Many doctors recommend an anti-inflammatory diet which has been shown to reverse obesity and Type 2 diabetes.Controlling your blood pressure by changing your diet is one of the best ways to reverse insulin resistance. Improvements in your diet can prevent pre-diabetes, diabetes, hyperglycemia, and obesity.;
, Limit the chemicals and extra sugars and fats that are usually added to processed food. Instead, try to eat natural or simply prepared foods. Cook from scratch as often as possible and choose organic foods to avoid chemicals.If you're pressed for time, remember you can prepare the basics (like rice, beans or meats) ahead of time and freeze them. Or, you can cook meals in a crock pot or slow cooker.


Since little is known about what chemicals may do to an individual, you should avoid them if you're trying to reverse insulin resistance.

, At least 90 to 95% of the carbohydrates you eat should be complex. These molecules are more complicated than simple carbohydrates, so they take longer for your body to break down. This can help regulate your blood sugar. Try to eat most of your complex carbohydrates at lunch and cut down on the portion sizes for other meals. Complex carbohydrates are found in whole, unprocessed foods like:Whole grains
Peas
Lentils
Beans
Vegetables

, Read food labels to determine how much sugar is in a food and try to avoid processed foods which often contain added sugars that aren't listed. Over-eating sugars like glucose, sucrose, fructose, and high fructose corn syrup can increase your risk for Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and obesity.Sugar by itself does not cause diabetes, but drinking more sugar-filled beverages for example is linked to higher blood sugar levels and to an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes., Research shows that increasing your insoluble fiber intake along with whole grains can reduce your risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.Good sources of fiber include brans, beans, berries, whole grains, vegetables, and seeds. Some fiber like flaxseeds also contains a good amount of omega-3 fatty acids.


To help you get into the habit, try adding one tablespoon of ground flaxseeds at every meal. Keep pre-ground flaxseeds in your freezer or use a coffee grinder to grind your own flaxseeds to keep them from getting rancid.

, Eat fish and skinless poultry which are good sources of protein. When picking fish, look for wild-caught fish like salmon, cod, haddock, and tuna. These are good sources of omega-3 fatty acids that your body needs. They're also anti-inflammatory.Try to limit red meats and skin from poultry. These can be high in animal fat and may be higher in added hormones and antibiotics., Don't think that you have to avoid fruits because they're sweet. You should actually a variety of fruits and vegetables to get nutrients your body needs. Since the sugars in fruit are combined with the fiber, your body will slowly absorb the sugar. Try to eat fruits and vegetables with the peel so you get more fiber and select fresh versions instead of dried produce (which has higher sugar concentrations).You should also increase the amount of water you drink. The Institute of Medicine recommends that you drink 1 to 2 liters or about 6 to 8 eight-ounce glasses of water a day., You can easily add flavor to a meal and regulate your blood sugar levels by using herbs. These herbs are hypoglycemic, so they increase insulin production and prevent the intestines from absorbing sugars.Since these herbs have no side effects when you take them in commonly used amounts as food, use them whenever you want. Herbs can also help you get over sugar cravings. To control blood sugar levels, cook with:


Cinnamon
Fenugreek
Ginger
Garlic and onions
Basil

, Gymnema sylvestre is an herb that's been used for hundreds of years to treat diabetes and hypoglycemia. It helps the pancreas produce insulin. To supplement, take 1 gram of gymnema sylvestre a day. You can also take bitter melon which lowers blood sugar and improves glucose tolerance. To supplement using liquid drops, take 5 to 30 drops twice a day.


You can also try coptis chinensis. Studies have shown that it can reduce insulin resistance by increasing your body's responsiveness to insulin., Consult with your doctor before taking any herbs or supplements. Some herbs and supplements can interact with prescription and over-the-counter medication so it's important to always ask before taking them. You can also ask your pharmacist about possible interactions since most pharmacists are extremely knowledgeable about potential problems.


Read package instructions and always follow the manufacturer's dosing instructions. Be sure to follow your doctor's advice about how long to take a supplement.

, Current research suggests that several vitamins and minerals are important to control blood sugar. Take a B-complex vitamin to get biotin, niacin, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12. Biotin helps regulate glucose, niacin can lower cholesterol, and B6 and B12 prevent nerve damage from high blood sugar.You can also take vitamin C to reduce insulin resistance and 600 IU of vitamin D to boost your sensitivity to insulin.Get 1000 mcg of vitamin B12 and 50 to 100 mcg of vitamin B6 every day. Since these are probably in a supplement with many other vitamins, follow the manufacturer's dosing recommendation.

, Several minerals can maintain your blood glucose levels. Choose a supplement that contains magnesium, zinc, 50 to 5000 mcg of chromium, 200 to 800 mcg of vanadium, potassium, manganese, and selenium.


Since many of these minerals will be combined with other minerals, always follow the manufacturer's dosing instructions and your doctor's advice. Avoid taking extra doses of any mineral. Since these are trace minerals, they can be toxic in high amounts.

, Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is an antioxidant that keeps blood glucose levels stable. It also stimulates blood flow and can nerve damage caused by high blood sugar. Take 300 to 1000 mg of ALA every day.


L-carnitine is another antioxidant that can repair nerve damage caused by high blood sugar. It may also reduce nerve pain. To supplement, take 1 to 3 grams of L-carnitine a day., CoEnzyme Q10 is an antioxidant is found in all cells of your body. People with diabetes tend to have lower amounts of CoEnzyme Q10, so supplementing may improve blood sugar regulation.It's also involved in energy production.


To treat Type 1 diabetes, take 100 mg every day for 12 weeks. To treat Type 2 diabetes, take 100 mg twice every day for up to 12 weeks., Your body needs fat to function efficiently. Healthy fats, like omega-3 fatty acids, evening primrose oil, and flaxseed can all reduce inflammation caused by high blood sugar levels. Omega-3 fatty acids can improve insulin sensitivity.Take a fish oil supplement or eat fatty fish several times a week.


While evening primrose oil can lower blood sugar levels, it can interact with other herbs or supplements, so speak with a doctor before adding this oil.Research showed that eating 40 grams of flaxseed taken every day over the course of several months may reduce insulin resistance."

Understand tendencies of diaper lovers.,
Realize that many diaper lovers (DLs) currently or formerly had issues with incontinence.,
Look at personal history.,
Accept that not every adult diaper lover prefers to act like a baby.,
Understand that some diaper wearers enjoy diapers for sexual reasons.,
Recognize fetishism.,
Accept that many diaper lovers are in relationships.,
Know that diaper lovers are not pedophiles.,
Ask a diaper lover to explain the situation to you.,
Accept the diaper wearing.,
Accept the individual.",How to Understand Diaper Lovers," One study examined adults who wore diapers and discovered that most individuals who like to wear diapers or engage in adult infant behavior began to express these desires in early adolescence, around age 11 or 12 and have been engaging behaviors for many years.Most diaper lovers are male, employed, and in their mid-30’s.More men than women engage in diaper behaviors, such as wearing a diaper, wetting, and messing in the diaper.;
, Some individuals begin to wear adult diapers when they start to have problems with uncontrolled accidents. As a result, they had to wear diapers, and over time, grew to like some aspects of them.

, Some studies have shown that adults who participate in infant behaviors and diapering may have a history that includes childhood sexual abuse and/or transgender expression.Some individuals express a different gender than the one assigned at birth, preferring to be called “she” when biologically a male. Some individuals involved in diapering express gender fluidity.It’s important not judge people on their past or for the way they express themselves now, even if they make choices you would not make.

, While some DLs like to live in infant lifestyle, not all do. Some use diapers to relax, to feel comfortable, or for sexual foreplay. Wearing a diaper does not automatically mean you want to act and be treated as an infant.

, People enjoy many types of sexual objects and practices, ranging from leather and rubber, to more unique practices, like wearing clothes of the opposite sex. Given that diapers are soft, sometimes warm, and positioned right next to the sex organs, it would be surprising if they did not trigger sexual feelings in some people.

, Some people enjoy wearing diapers as part of a fetish called autonepiophilia, or Adult Baby Syndrome. These people derive sexual pleasure out of acting as a baby and being treating as an infant. Using a diaper is not a medical or physical necessity, but a desire that is consistent with the lifestyle.Adult babies may enjoy playing with baby toys, talking like a baby, being cared for, and engaging in baby activities. As with all fetishes, behaviors vary quite a bit from person to person.

, Many adults with interests in infant behavior and/or diapering tend to be in relationships, and partners are aware of the behaviors. Wearing a diaper can be a part of arousal, foreplay, or sexual activity., Pedophilia involves fantasy or sexual activity with a prepubescent child.Individuals that practice wearing diapers for pleasure are typically adults who like to role play as infants. They tend to be physically mature adults.


Like other role playing scenarios, those that role play as aliens are not aliens. It does not mean that the individual would actually like to be or be with an alien.

, Instead of treating diaper wearing as taboo, approach the diaper wearing with an open mindset. If you have questions about wearing diapers, ask. If someone discloses that he enjoys wearing diapers, he may feel comfortable talking about his experience and explaining it to you. However, bear in mind he may be reluctant to do this unless he trusts you a great deal.


As with all personal questions, be respectful when inquiring about this behavior.
Let him know that he is important and supported.

, If the diaper wearer is someone who is in your life, learn to accept the diaper wearing behavior, even if you do not understand it. Realize that you likely have different quirks about yourself and recognize how nice it feels for those to be accepted by others.


If someone discloses that he is a diaper wearer, recognize he may feel nervous or ashamed to disclose that information to you. Recognize how difficult it is to have a personal secret, and how important it is to feel accepted for your secrets.Learn the accept the diaper wearing from a non-judgmental standpoint, recognizing that it’s okay if someone wants to express himself in a non-traditional way, even if you don’t understand it.

, Even if you do not understand the practices of being a diaper lover, learn to accept the person as a person. While you may find wearing a diaper strange, learn to accept that each person has unique differences. Wearing a diaper may feel like a huge difference between you two, but focus on similarities that you share.Learn to see past the diaper wearing and appreciate the person for who he is.
Show the individual that you see past the diaper wearing and appreciate and accept him on a personal level. He experiences pain, joy, sadness, and anger just like everybody else. You can have a normal relationship with a diaper lover.

Cut the product's bag open with a scissor from the bottom side of the packaging.,
Take the underpad out from the product's surrounding bag, and place it (in a folded-up state, onto the surface you'll be using it on).,
Unfold the pad.,
Place the pad down on the surface, with the white side up.",How to Use a Disposable Waterproof Underpad," Doing so will present you a better place to hold onto the pad as you take it out of the packaging. Start to cut into the edges of the bottom of the bag until the scissor feels tight without breaking through the entire package. Pull the bottom two sides apart and continue opening each of the sides of the bag(without opening the entire sides or top of the bag) until the product packaging is open.;
, Much like taking out a disposable diaper from the package, reach down into the package and grab one with your open fist. Keep your palm open, but curve your fingers, so that you only pick up one pad.


Likely, when you lay the pad down on the surface without unfolding it, the plastic-looking side will likely be face up. If you see the colored or plastic-looking surface (absorption surface) you're likely looking at this a bit awkward; you will want to be looking at the pad with it showing the white (non-plastic-like surface).
Try to grab the pads one at a time. Opening the package from the bottom may give away the secrets to only grabbing one (and if you are adept at taking out diapers from a package, this feeling is rather natural), but if you may feel the need to double the absorption rate or one pad might not be enough, you may need to use a second one on top of the first.

, Grab the edge of the product and ""throw"" it outward, away from you. This'll potentially be enough to create an air burst to be able to separate the quarters of the product from each of themselves.

, The white side can absorb the moisture, while the plastic-looking side can help deter any moisture from going through and onto the surface (which is potentially what you're trying to avoid by using these pads! Right?)


If both sides are white colored, look for a side that has a smooth, non-glossy (non-plastic-like) surface. The non-plastic side is the side the person must lay on. The liquid will be absorbed through this side, and yet won't travel through the plastic out the back.

Try to determine just how much wetness you tend to go through on any single given day.,
Propose to yourself that you might not even need a disposable incontinence product at all, if you aren't leaking that much.,
Look around on some incontinent companies websites, to see just what is available, especially while reading the product descriptions under most companies ""Incontinence products"" sections.,
Determine your weight on a scale, by weighing yourself or the one who's been proposed to be wearing the incontinent garment.,
Look around at the stores.,
Look for incontinence pads and/or belted incontinent products, if you find the wearer doesn't wet all that much and/or all that often.,
Determine just how much other coverage you'll need, in the style of diaper the wearer will be using.,
Look for what types of diapers to use at night, or if you find that the wearer wets their diapers heavily.,
Look on the market for disposable waterproof pads which can give the wearer some extra protection that will ensure them that no urine will soak through and end up on the bed or changing surface when they don't want it to.

",How to Tell the Differences Between All the Styles of Disposable Incontinence Products," Not all people will need a disposable incontinence product to begin with, if they only tend to leak a little bit. A few drops of wetness is normal to expect in any given adult.;
, All that you might even need might be a feminine pad that can double as a wetness ""catcher"" when you don't need all that much. And females aren't the only people who can afford to use them, males can to, as long as they tailor it to their own ""urine catching area"" near the front ""zone"" of their underpants.

, Most often times, you'll find those that are pads, those that are pull-up styled, along with those you put on much like that of a baby-like disposable diaper (those with tabs and such).

, This can further help determine just what's available to the wearer.

, Most stores might carry a large selection of types, along with a wide variety of brands, but since stores vary in what they carry, call the store first.

, They can be useful in these two situations.

, While most diapers are pull-up styled (with or without extra-protection/better-fit tapes), most can get away with wearing these during the day. And most of these brands can be fit to either gender (unless the outside of the package describes otherwise). Depends has come out with gender-based incontinence products that look and work much like those specifically for that gender, so be careful when noticing/purchasing these products.

, Most companies provide baby-like (tape-diapered styled) disposable incontinence diapers that get put on. These diapers are mostly marketed as ""for Maximum Protection"" and most can be worn at night without much need to be changed during the night.

Change the definition of diaper.,
Have talk show hosts discuss bedwetting.,
Ask celebrities to talk about their experiences dealing bedwetting when they were growing up.,
Ask physicians, especially specialists such as urologists, to counsel patients about the different types of diapers available to deal with bedwetting.,
One thing that would help reduce the stigma in this area would be if the people who wrote parenting books did not have such negative reactions to older children using diapers to deal with their bedwetting.,
One other thing to consider is the following-as a society we seem to have no problem with the following people using diapers: the elderly,special needs individuals, as well people suffering from diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, and other neurodegenerative disorders, but we look down on older children, teenagers, and adults who want to wear(or have no choice but to wear) diapers to manage their bedwetting.,
Finally, manufacturers of adult diapers could advertise their products in an attempt to make their products more well known.Parents might request to stores that they carry these types of products, and then perhaps grocery stores, places such as Walmart and Target, as well as pharmacies might be be more inclined to stock these products.This in turn might cause a ripple effect-if more stores start stocking diapers that fit older children, teenagers, and adults with bedwetting problems, more people would be likely to buy them, thereby reducing the stigma of wearing these garments.

","How to Reduce the Stigma of Older Children, Teenagers, and Adults Wearing Diapers for Bedwetting"," Most definitions of diaper define it as being a garment worn by babies. If I were responsible for writing the definition of diaper found in dictionaries I'd write something like this: ""An absorbent, waterproof, protective undergarment made of either reusable or disposable material which is drawn up between the legs and fastened at the waist by tape tabs, safety pins, or other methods. It is designed for managing episodes of incontinence experienced by individuals of all ages, including babies, young children before they are potty trained, and adults, in addition to providing protection for individuals that wet the bed."";
, This could be either a one part episode or it could be divided into several shows. Some of the topics that could be discussed on the show include the following: the causes of bedwetting, how prevalent it is including the different age groups effected, a segment specifically discussing adult bedwetting, different treatments available for bedwetting and the pros and cons of each, as well as the different types of garments available to manage bedwetting. This segment would talk about the more common garments available to manage bedwetting such as pull-ups and ""Goodnites"" as well as other choices available to deal with the problem such as disposable tape tab diapers, pin-on cloth diapers, and plastic pants. In this segment representatives from different companies that sell diapers that fit older children, teenagers, and adults could come on and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different types of diapers.

, There are some famous people who have come out and discussed their experiences with bedwetting but it might help reduce the stigma surrounding bedwetting if more celebrities discussed it. One celebrity that has been open about her experiences growing up as a bedwetter is Sarah Silverman. She's written a book called ""The Bedwetter: Stories of Courage, Redemption, and Pee"". She mentioned that she had to wear diapers for a while to manage the problem. In one section of the book she talked about how when she was 12 she and her mom hid some diapers in her sleeping bag before she went on a camping trip. She had this to say regarding this particular experience: ""Surrounded by my tent mates, I subtly reached to the bottom of my sleeping bag with my toes and took care of business without incident, probably because in their wildest dreams(among the giggling and gossip and talk about boys), they would never guess that one of us was wearing Pampers.""

, There are also nurses who specialize in incontinence. These nurses are called WOCN (which stands for wound, ostomy, and continence). They could also be a good source for recommending different types of garments available to handle bedwetting. By having medical professionals talk openly about adult diapers it might help alleviate the stigma of wearing these types of garments.

, The majority of parenting books seem to take a negative view of children over the age of 4 or 5 using diapers to manage their bedwetting. Most authors feel that older bedwetters should be taken out of diapers and put into underwear style garments such as pull-ups or ""Goodnites"". ""Goodnites"" were introduced into the marketplace in the summer of 1994. The thinking behind this product is that it would be less stigmatizing and embarrassing for an older child or teenager to wear, primarily due to its design which allowed the user to pull it on like regular underwear,as opposed to using tape tabs to fasten the garment like diapers.Eventually other companies starting making ""pull-ups"", including manufacturers of adult incontinence products. While these garments do work for some bedwetters, there are others who leak through these styles of garments and soak their bed. Also, even though these garments do pull on like regular underwear,for all intents and purposes they're diapers. That being said, the pull-on style products tend to be less absorbent and as a result less effective than the tape on style products for managing heavier forms of incontinence such as bedwetting. If the child or teenager leaks through the pull-on style products the parents should have their youngster wear diapers with tape tabs instead.

, In my opinion we have a double standard regarding this issue.

Set aside a time where you can both talk privately about the issue.,
Tell your loved one that you want to talk to them about an issue that has been concerning you for a long time but that you're not sure how to talk to them about it.,
Be honest about how you feel.,
After laying this groundwork you can tell them something along these lines: “As you know a lot of adults experience bladder control problems.,
Be ready to explain to your loved one why there is no effective treatment for your bed wetting.",How to Tell a Significant Other You Wear Diapers for Bedwetting,";
, At this point it's important to put their mind at ease and let them know that you need to talk about a health issue that you've dealt with since childhood and not something alarming like you have a wife in another state or that you're wanted by the FBI !

, Let them know that this is very embarrassing to talk about and you're having difficulty getting it out in the open.


At this point, if your boyfriend or girlfriend is an understanding person they should be able to put your mind at ease and let you know that you can talk to them about anything.

, I'm one of those adults, but fortunately this just occurs at night. I've had this problem since childhood and I have to wear protection to bed to prevent the mattress from getting ruined. I realize that this might be hard to take in and I hope it doesn't effect your feelings toward me.”

, Some people may think you should of grown out of this, that you are just lazy about getting up to use the bathroom, that you simply drink too much liquid before bed or that there is a simple physical solution to the problem of your urinating in your bed at night, such as a mobility issue. Whatever the reason that the only solution to your night time urinary incontinence is, be ready to explain why this is the only thing that works for you."

Fold the diaper length-ways with the back sheet facing outwards; you don't want a hard crease, just a soft fold.Make sure you do not touch the inside of the diaper. You do not want to contaminate it.This folding step is just designed to avoid contaminating the diaper as you put it on. If you're using cloth diapers, there is also folding involved in actually preparing the diaper for wearing. For more information about folding cloth diapers, check out How to Fold a Cloth Diaper.;
, Once you've folded the diaper, place the diaper front to back, with the smaller middle portion running between your legs. Carefully hold the brief in place as you make any necessary adjustments. Once again, make sure your hands do not come into contact with the diaper., Once the diaper is in place, make any adjustment necessary. Many people find it most comfortable to pull the bottom edges downward, creating something like pant legs. It may also be comfortable to adjust the top of the diaper so it's forming a straight, horizontal line along your hips., Once you have the diaper in a comfortable position, use the adhesive tape provided to secure it in place. Most brands of adult diapers come with four pieces of tape: two on the bottom sides and two on the top. It may be helpful to angle the tape slightly upwards as this improves how the diaper fits around the legs., Once the diaper is on, make any necessary adjustments for your own comfort. The edges of the brief should ease into the groin to avoid chafing or rashes. You may have to fold the edges over slightly so the sides are not as sharp., Gently fold the brief length-ways to make a soft fold; you don't need a hard crease.Keep the back sheet turned outwards. Do not touch the inside of the diaper as you want to avoid contamination. It might be a good idea to wear gloves during this process., Have the wearer lie on his or her side. Gently place the brief between his or her legs, the larger backside facing the buttocks. Fan out the rear end so it fully covers the buttocks., Have the wearer roll onto his or her back. Have him or her move slowly as to not ruffle the diaper. Fan out the front of the diaper, as you did with the back. Make sure the diaper is not scrunched at all between the legs., Once the diaper is a comfortable position, secure the adhesive tape. Most diapers will have four pieces of tape: two on the bottom on two on the top. Make sure the diaper fits snuggly but make sure the wearer is still comfortable. You do not want to tape the diaper up too tight as this can cause discomfort., Make sure the wearer is comfortable. You may have to fold the edges inward slightly so they ease into the groin area. Ask the wearer if he or she is comfortable and if you should make any adjustments., If you want to wear diapers subtly, take some time and care selecting products. Many brands of adult diapers are fairly easy to wear without others noticing.


Choose a product you can easily fit in a bag and briefcase. Less bulky diapers tend to be easier to conceal as they can be folded. However, be careful when folding a diaper as you do not want to cause any damage to the product.Make sure you select a product that's strong enough for you, however. If you're nervous about choosing a product, talk to your doctor and ask for a recommendation. He or she should be able to recommend a good brand for you based on your medical history., Many people worry about disposing diapers when out at work, school, or running errands. Most people worry about others noticing they're wearing adult diapers. Having a game plan in mind for discreet disposal can help.


Be aware of what's available in terms of dumpsters, trash cans, restrooms, and changing areas in any given area. This can help you act fast in the event of an emergency.Stock up on scented disposal bags. These allow you to discard diapers in places like public garbage cans without the smell becoming noticeable.Remember, it is impossible to plan for every scenario. However, having a set game plan for some of your regular outings can help you dispose diapers without too much notice., Proper clothing can help you conceal the fact you're wearing an adult diaper. Make the right wardrobe choices when going out.


Opt for somewhat high-waisted, loose fitting pants.A shirt that tucks in or does not pull up can also help conceal a diaper., Dealing with wearing diapers can be embarrassing for many. Look for support groups in your area. You can also find forums online where people share stories and offer tips for coping with adult incontinence.

",How to Use Disposable Diapers," The results must be based on the item's weight (if the situation is on a child) or over the surface area the diaper is supposed to cover.;
, Do this to see just which company has the right fit for your situation, along with providing enough adequate protection so that you can live with the diaper's results.

, Remove any old diapers the child or infant might be wearing, and place the new diaper on them. Unfold the new diaper's two halves, expand the leg cuffs/leak guards, lift the child's rear-end, place the diaper under their behind, and diaper away!

, These items can include light bulbs, hard-drives, and some other small necessary items.


Although each product is different, small fruits that have a separate skin-layer can even be preserved for a short period of time, when wrapped in a disposable diaper.

, Do this if you don't carry any deodorant, or all other deodorant forms have run dry. The amount of perspiration most people will perspire is less than the absorbency of a disposable diaper that has been to protect your baby's groin-muscles. Better yet, it will make your underarm smell baby-fresh for a little while.

, Turn the diaper over so the absorbent side is face-down overtop of the mess, and pull the hordes of difficult solids into the diaper by scooping the mess up. With the built-in absorbency power, you can even get wet messes to be cleaned up inside the diaper too. Close the diaper up with the tabs, and throw out the diaper into a trash receptacle when the mess has been cleaned up.

, Not only is it sanitary for your baby to be clean; it can also become a clean-up approach for your pampered pooch, if plastic bags aren't available when you go walking with your beloved dog.

, Do this to fill in small cracks of flame-retardant gels that may be included in your house's interior walls, if the walls are seeing cracks large enough to show the polymer filling. Disposable diapers use the same gel that is used in these gel-layers for generally about half the cost of redoing the entire strip (if all you need is a little tiny area).

, Fill each diaper completely with clean water from the tap, and store the diaper in a zipper-closed bag. Place this soaked diaper into the freezer for several hours before use.

, The spilled oil can temporarily seep out into the diaper, and you can make your hands less messy and prevent the bolt from dropping into the dark-colored oil collection container.

, Everyone who has ever owned a car and has taken a long road trip knows that these diapers can be valuable not just for your baby but for yourself too. Use them when ""nature calls"" and a bathroom is not in sight for miles on end.

,, Do this if you find it loses heat, or has some holes or scratches where there shouldn't be. Disposable diapers are great for sealing in that warmth, if given the large amount of area to cover with enough diapers around the item.

, Regardless of the situation, they must be cleaned up and removal is necessary.

Try to do something to get your mind off the situation. Watch television. Read. Go for a walk. Then, read the letter to revisit your emotions briefly.Remember, this letter is to allow you to process feelings. Talking to your teenager about wearing diapers can be an intimidating experience. You want to make sure your initial reaction is released in some manner before confronting your teen. After rereading your letter, destroy it and move on.;
, When confronting your teen about his or her diaper use, try to approach them from a place of love. Speaking from your heart means going into the conversation with the right motives and intentions.


Remember, you are talking to your teen because you are concerned. Try to leave judgment and other assumptions behind. Begin the conversation from a place of love. Say something like, ""I'm bringing this up because I love you and I'm concerned with these choices.""Try to put love first throughout the conversation. When having a difficult conversation about any topic it can be tempting to try to ""win."" That is, you may feel tempted to try and convince your teen that your way of thinking and acting is proper. However, having a difficult conversation is not about winning. It's about finding a solution that's mutually beneficial to all involved. If you find yourself feeling judgmental or frustrated during the conversation, try to think to yourself, ""I am having this conversation because I love and care about my child."", Teenagers are notoriously difficult when it comes to opening up. Wearing a diaper is an embarrassing issue and your teen may be wary to discuss the situation with you. Try to create a safe, open space for dialogue that allows your teen to be honest with you.People tend to feel safe when working towards a mutual purpose. If your teen feels like he or she is being lectured or scolded, he or she will be less likely to open up. Try to make it clear that you're seeking to understand your teen's perspective and help him or her with any issues, medical or otherwise.
Mutual respect also helps foster a safe space. Try to be as non-judgmental as possible during the situation. Make it clear to your teen that despite your concerns you still respect him or her as a person. Avoid judgmental phrasing and practice active listening. Nod and maintain eye contact to show you are paying attention. Reiterate what your teen had said when he or she finishes talking to clarify that he or she is being heard and understood., Empathy is key to addressing a difficult subject. Although it may be hard, try to imagine what you're teenager is experiencing and why.


Before you even begin the conversation, try to understand your teen's perspective. Do not speculate as to why he or she is wearing diapers. Rather, try to imagine how you would feel being confronted about a potentially embarrassing problem. What emotions would you experience? How would you react? Try to imagine how hard this is for your teen. Keep this perspective in mind when confronting your teenager.Listen to what your teen says and try to understand. Regardless of your teen's reasoning, make a conscious effort to put yourself in your teen's shoes. Make an effort to understand where he or she is coming from. Empathy is key to effectively coping with a difficult issue., Paraphilic infantilism is a rare sexual disorder in which an individual derives sexual pleasure from being treated like an infant. If your son or daughter claims to be interested in diapers in a sexual fashion, make an effort to learn about this disorder.


People with paraphilic infantilism enjoy role playing as an infant. In addition to diaper wearing, this may include wet nursing, being fed with a bottle, talking like a baby, being spanked, and playing with baby toys. While the disorder is mentioned in the DSM, studies on the subject are still limited. The precise cause and risk factors for paraphilic infantilism are not yet known.While usually sexual in nature, many people who wear diapers and engage in role playing as an infant do not associate the behavior with sexual pleasure. They may simply feel compelled to behave like an infant.For the majority of people, paraphilic infantilism has relatively little effect on day-to-day life. Many people with paraphilic infantilism hold down stable jobs, have healthy sexual relationships, and are relatively stable and well adjusted. While the practice may seem odd, it's usually harmless.In rare cases cases paraphilic infantilism is associated with other disorders like depression and anxiety. Thoughts of suicide and suicide attempts sometimes occur with patients exhibiting paraphilic infantilism., Another reason your teen may be wearing diapers is bed wetting. Your teen may be embarrassed to discuss issues of incontinence with you. However, if your teen is having issues with bladder control overnight it's important you evaluate the cause. Bed wetting can be caused by medical ailments but can also be the result of anxiety, depression, and other psychiatric issues.Introduce the topic of bed wetting carefully to your teen. Say something like, ""I know this might be embarrassing to discuss, but I want to make sure you're okay physically. Can you talk to me about the bathroom issues you've been having?""
Bed wetting should be evaluated by a doctor to rule out underlying medical conditions as a cause.

, As paraphilic infantilism and bed wetting are both occasionally a sign of an underlying mental illness, you should watch for signs of depression and anxiety in your teen. Depression and anxiety may manifest in your teen in the following ways:


Feelings of sadness, worthlessness, or helplessness
Change in eating or sleeping habits
Loss of interest in day-to-day activities
Irritability
Lack of energyIf you think your teen may need a therapist, you can find a therapist by going through your insurance. You should be able to find a list of therapists in your area that take your insurance plan. You can also ask for a referral from your teen's regular physician. If money is an issue, many therapists work on a sliding scale. There are also usually free or discount clinics in major metropolitan areas for people on a budget.

, Bed wetting often has a medical cause. In teens, hormones can cause bed wetting. Small bladders and certain genetic disorders may also be to blame for teenage incontinence. If your teen has been having trouble bed wetting, take him or her to the doctor for a physical and any other tests the doctor may think are necessary."

Know the causes of diabetes, then make choices to reduce likelihood of ever developing it.,
Put off the causes that you ""cannot"" prevent, instead of aggravating them -- making proper, healthy choices.,
Prevent the causes you ""can"" control:



Obesity - Most sedentary life diseases are caused by obesity, including diabetes and high blood pressure over the years.,
Conquer obesity, attaining a BMI (Body Mass Index) in normal range (your weight related to your height), maintaining that and:


Men - waist size below 40 inches (approx.,
Eat the healthy diabetes foods: follow the healthy food triangle or pyramid:


Less - sugar, fats and alcohol,
Moderate – milk, meat and other proteins,
More – whole foods: vegetables, fruit, beans, whole grains and complex starchy foods.

,
Become physically active combining diabetes exercises, first making slight changes, and then progressing in vigor with your daily activities:


Climb: take stairs, not resting in the elevator or escalator (lift);
Walk: leaving your vehicle parked, walking short distances;
Play and work: develop vigor with your child, do gardening, clean your vehicle or house, play sports;
Exercise: walk, walk the dog, swim, participate in aerobics, lifting weights or doing resistance training (including machines).

,
Take great care when ill to avoid complications: Type 1 Diabetes may be caused by complications of viruses and auto immune disorders when our defenses attack our own body.,
Ask your doctor about stopping non-essential nutrients 2 or 3 hours before your sleep-time, drinking only water.,
Consider sleeping on an almost empty stomach without any sleep aids (naturally), unless and until you awaken without enough sleep!",How to Protect Yourself Against Diabetes,";
, Push back diabetes by sustaining a low carbohydrate diet, and even cure Type 2 by weight loss, diet and exercise; hopefully it is not too late:



Heredity - Genes pass from one generation to another. If a mother has diabetics then there is 2 to 3% greater chance for her child -- but if the father is diabetic, the risk is more than the previous case. If both parents have diabetes, the child has much higher risk for diabetes.

Age - Increasing age is a contributing factor; although this disease may occur at any age, but 80% of cases occur after 49 year years of age. Age decreases all systems from functioning as well as when younger.

,

Stress - Stresses of physical injury, disease and of emotional disturbance are frequently blamed as contributing causes of the disease:


High blood pressure - Gradual damage by your resting systolic pressure being above 130 mmHg for borderline diabetics or more. Non diabetic health allows 140 mmHg as normal.

Complications of viral infections - Virus can infect, ""settle in,"" and damage the pancreas while, also, confusing the auto immune system into disorder, considering the body as the enemy.

, (""The food will be there tomorrow!"") And, if you're taking insulin and believe, ""I have to eat more!"" (near bedtime), then:Ask your doctor how to adjust your dose of the medications to not need and not eat that ""heavier, late-night snack"". A Mayo Clinic article asks and answers, ""Are late-night snacks a no-no for people who have diabetes?"" -- ""Yes!""Hungry after dinner -- these ""free"" foods have few, if any, carbohydrates and calories, so ""one"" of them won't cause weight gain or increased blood sugar. Choose a ""free"" food, such as:A can of diet soda,
A serving of sugar-free gelatin,
Five baby carrots,
Two saltine crackers,
One vanilla wafer,
Four almonds (or similar nuts),
One piece of gum or small hard candy...



Give your body the free snack, so that your nerves, liver and the digestive system has time to finish work, and to rest and for general recovery, from the sugar that would be produced by ""overeating"", causing overwork of your digestion while asleep; so sugar is less elevated in the blood, and to stop fats or sugars being processed all night in the liver (allows in-digestion to clear, as well), etc.

, If you must get up and go on limited sleep, do not automatically eat a full breakfast meal when you have not had enough fasting time (including sleep), but again eat a free food snack to carry you until about 10 to 12 hours or so since last evenings dinner (supper) -- letting your body continue to use the sugar already in your blood, instead -- ""Caution: snack as needed for preventing diabetic hypoglycemia"" following your doctors instructions. A healthy, fasting time is important, if it works for your level of diabetes.


For difficulty going back to sleep, try: deep breathing (counting the seconds for each slow breath to occupy your mind) -- or use sleep aids. So, if you need help to sleep after a short interrupted sleep, then consider the following in some combination: (1) Taking calcium, magnesium and vitamin D3 in one tablet, plus B-vitamins, omega3 or omega3-6-9 which can all work for improved relaxation! (2) Eating a ""small serving of low caloric salad or protein food"", such as plain turkey or chicken, or almonds, walnuts, pecans, sunflower, pumpkin seeds, pistachios, red peanuts with skins-on (those seeds and all nuts have essential oils, too!). Protein originally causes less elevation of blood sugar, but the protein can gradually change to sugar as required. (3) Taking (a) valerian, a relaxant herb that reduces aches and pains, and (b) melatonin, a hormone, that regulates sleep or other herbs that you may use for sleep. If you wake up too soon, drink water and only consider taking another dose of sleep aids, if four hours have passed since you last took them. (4) Using a PM pain reliever, or the antihistamine that causes drowsiness that does not raise high blood pressure (HBP), as little as $4 for 100 (as Equate brand 'Chlortabs'): it is chlorpheniramine maleate -- also, as 'Chlortrimeton' and 'Corcidin-HBP'. (Do not use any sugary liquid antihistamine, cold med or PM pain reliever ""syrup"".)

This can arise from conditions such as damage to the rectum, nerve damage to the sphincter, chronic constipation, diarrhea, surgery, or rectal prolapse.She suffers from stress incontinence. This usually arises because of weakened pelvic floor muscles. Stress incontinence occurs most often in women, though can happen in both sexes as a result of childbirth or prostrate surgery.He has a sexual fetish called infantilism or diaper fetishism.This occurs most often in males and usually presents as a desire to dress and be treated like an infant, which also involves a transfer of power and control with another adult.;
, In a non-confrontational and gentle manner, ask your spouse why she is wearing diapers. Wearing diapers can be a very sensitive and embarrassing subject for many adults, and simply asking her may help you better understand and eventually support her diaper use.If your spouse has been ill or experiencing other medical issues, broach the subject by saying something such as “I remember your doctor mentioned that incontinence may be a side effect of your injury. Are you having trouble?”If your spouse’s diaper use doesn’t come from an obvious condition, tread lightly in asking. For example, you could say “I found these diapers in the bathroom. Are you having some kind of issue with which I can offer you support?” This allows your spouse to answer honestly if he likes and also demonstrates your support no matter what the reason for wearing diapers.

, No matter how your spouse answers your question, accept her response. Whether for medical reasons or as a sexual fetish, your spouse’s need to wear diapers is deeply personal and she may—or may not—want to discuss the matter with you.Avoid knee-jerk or “humorous” responses, which may embarrass or hurt your spouse. For example, he may worry that you don't love him anymore.If you do not know how to respond, back away from the situation until you can process it while being gentle with your spouse. For example, say “I’m so sorry and I want to be supportive, but I’m not sure how to react and a need a moment to process this.”

, Schedule an appointment with your family doctor for your spouse and you. Seeing and talking to her may help both of you deal with the emotional aspects of wearing adult diapers while helping to manage any fetish or underlying conditions that may be causing incontinence.Because wearing adult diapers can be distressing, your spouse may not want you “meddling” in his affairs. You can explain that your desire to see the doctor together is as a means to best support him. Ultimately, though, you need to respect your spouse’s wishes.Speak with the doctor alone if your spouse doesn’t want to meet together. The doctor may give you tips on how best to support your spouse without breaking his confidence or doctor-patient privilege., Even if your spouse was reluctant to discuss her need to wear diapers at first, always welcome conversation if she wants to talk about it or anything else. Open communication sows trust and may help bolster your relationship as well as increase your understanding of your spouse.Remember that your willingness to support your partner can make her incontinence or his fetish easier to handle for both of you.Keep the conversation as light as possible. Don’t be accusatory or try an push your spouse into something that she doesn’t want.Compose a list of each other’s feelings and concerns to help you get through incontinence or a fetish together.

, In many cases, someone who is wearing a diaper may isolate herself out of embarrassment.Engaging your spouse and getting her to go out with you can boost her confidence and help her more effectively cope with wearing diapers.Make dinner reservations at a favorite restaurant or go to the movies together. You can also make plans with friends or family at a place your spouse enjoys.
Keeping your plans and routine as normal as possible may help your spouse forget about the diapers and realize that they don’t have any great impact on her ability to lead an active and fun life., Many people suffering from incontinence can have accidents that cause leakage or damage clothing or furniture. Being prepare with supplies or cleaning products may help put your spouse’s mind at ease and minimize her embarrassment.Carry extra diapers or a change of clothing with you when you go out.Place towels or disposable pads on your bed or furniture to help minimize damage to your home.Place a commode near the bedroom to help your spouse at night if necessary., Some forms of incontinence may respond to dietary changes. Avoiding certain foods and adding more fiber and water to your diet may help relieve the symptoms of incontinence and make diaper use less of an issue for your spouse.You may notice that certain foods exacerbate incontinence. Avoid these as much as possible. For example, spicy and fatty or greasy foods may make fecal incontinence worse.Try to get a balanced diet of whole foods from the five food groups to maintain your overall health.Getting 30 grams of fiber and 8 glasses of water a day may help keep you regular and eliminate waste that exacerbates incontinence., Incontinence and even fetishes can be very distressing for a person. By consistently assuring your spouse that you support and love her, you can boost her self-esteem and raise the quality of her life.Let your spouse know you care often. She might wonder if you still loves her, and telling her that you love and care for her no matter what is vital to her health and the health of your relationship.In the case your spouse wears diapers as a sexual fetish, be as supportive as you can. You may find the fetish as erotic as he does or may be repulsed by it. In either case, offer support. For example, you can say “I don’t understand your need to wear diapers, but I love you and want to support you as much as I can.”

, If you, your spouse, or your relationship are suffering because of the need or desire to wear adult diapers, attend counseling sessions. A therapist or counselor can help you cope individually or as a couple, or both.


Be as open as possible with your therapist. For example, if your spouse has a diaper fetish, you can easily say “I don’t understand his need to wear diapers but I want to know how I can support him without being involved in his fetish.”

Follow your doctor’s instructions regarding when and how often to test.If you do not already have an established testing schedule, call your doctor or make an appointment and ask, “When throughout the day should I be checking my blood sugar?” Most people with type 1 test at least four to eight times per day — more for increased activity levels, during illness, or during changes in medication.;
, Note, however, that this is a general guideline and you should refer to the parameters set by your doctor.

If you are above this range, contact your doctor to ask about testing for kidney damage or disease.
Log your levels after each reading to keep track and check for patterns or long-term complications, such as nerve damage (neuropathy), skin infections, eye damage, heart disease, and more., Protein has been shown to help regulate blood glucose levels, while carbohydrates have been shown to raise it.Try making yourself balanced meals with 20 to 30% of calories coming from lean protein and no more than about 40% carbohydrates.Integrate fiber, such as whole grains, into your carb intake at every meal.
Take the time to weigh out food to help ensure you are getting the correct portion. Check on food labels to see the recommended serving size and accompanying nutritional information.
Consult with your doctor, diabetes educator, or a registered dietitian about customizing a healthy meal plan if a standard plan isn’t helping you keep your glucose levels under control.

, If you have been prescribed insulin or other medication by your doctor, take it exactly as recommended. These medications often have a significant impact on your body’s ability to regulate blood sugar and avoid long-term health damage.If you have not been prescribed any prescription medication by your doctor, understand that there may be a reason. Ask your doctor, “Is there any medication I should be taking to help me control my diabetes?”
Follow your doctor’s guidelines for both the amount of insulin you should use and your injection schedule.

, Exercise helps control your blood pressure level as well as your overall bodily health, both of which greatly impact your kidney function. Aim for 30 to 45 minutes of moderate cardiovascular exercise four to five times a week to help keep your kidneys healthy.Exercise can be anything from walking to swimming or anything else that raises your heartrate. The exercise should feel challenging, but not so much so that it inhibits proper movement or function later on.
Integrate exercise into your daily routine by making choices such as walking or biking to school or work and taking the stairs instead of the elevator.

, High LDL cholesterol can cause plaque buildup in your kidneys and blood vessels and impede their function. Get your cholesterol under control to avoid compounding any kidney damage caused by diabetes.Make heart-healthy food choices such as opting for monounsaturated fats like olive oil, eliminating trans fats, and increasing your soluble fiber intake.
Create and follow action plans to quit habits such as smoking and excessive drinking. Seek help from professionals or support groups if necessary.

, If a balanced diet and regular exercise are not helping you control a high blood pressure problem, seek attention from a medical professional. Your doctor may be able to recommend an ACE inhibitor, which may not only help regulate high blood pressure, but may also slow the progression of diabetic kidney disease.Do not take any blood pressure regulating medication or supplements without first consulting your doctor. Let them know, “I want to find something that can help me regulate my blood pressure and prevent future kidney problems. What do you recommend?”

, If you are worried about kidney damage, request regular kidney function tests from your doctor. In addition, have them monitor indicators of kidney damage such as blood pressure.Aim to have a urine or blood test every year to check kidney function.
Talk to your doctor about an HbA1c test, which will indicate whether or not your blood sugar has stayed within a healthy rage over the last two to three months. A high result increases your risk of complications, such as kidney damage. The results of this test can help your doctor make any necessary changes to your treatment plan.Let your doctors know if you are taking ACE inhibitors, which can impact the urine test used to check for kidney function.

, After testing, regularly review your diet, exercise, and medication routines with your doctor. Be honest with them about what you have and have not been doing so that they can get a better understanding of what is working and what may need to be modified.If you can, meet with a team of specialists to help you review your routine. Talk to dietitians and trainers that specialize in helping individuals with diabetes, along with your doctor.
Cross-communicate with your team. Let your doctor know what your dietitian recommends and vice versa.

, You may benefit from using an insulin pump or a continuous glucose monitor if you are looking to take better control of your Type I diabetes. Ask your doctor about proper blood glucose monitoring and insulin injecting equipments.These machines may or may not benefit your particular situation. Ask your doctor about the advantages and disadvantages of each before either are added to your treatment plan.

Pick a plastic disposal bag to use.",How to Pack a Diapering Kit," A larger Ziploc-styled bag will work, but make sure the necessities can all fit inside the bag when closed. You'll get to realizing what you need later.
, Write on the bag using a Sharpie or other marker or stick a labeled sticker on. Place all of your diapering kit contents in it and close. Keep the diapering kit with you and dispose of the kit when used. If you use a sticker to label the bag, stick it on the front to keep labeling consistent and easy to check who this kit is for at a glance.,, Don't worry about packing cloth diapers. With a diapering kit, focus on periods when you could be out on a very quick run with your child and need to gather a new diaper quickly and don't have much time to deal with the process.

Pick a brand. In the United States, your primary brands are centered over Pampers, Huggies and Luvs, but with many store brands out there that are selling, there's a wide variety of diapers you can use to choose from. For those in other countries, this list may differ considerably. Remember to pick a diaper in your child's size.
Decide on the type of diaper you will put in the diapering kit. Most often, parents will pack regular disposable diapers in their kit. However, at certain times, you may want to invest in a few nighttime or bedwetting diapers or even swim diapers - but this must be up to you and what your child might end up doing when you grab the diapering kit.

, Although any brand generally works, don't bring along a large package of wipes - you might need a few, but not a whole lot. You can pick the brand you usually use. Remember that with their being so many choices of baby wipes of major companies (Pampers and Huggies) as well as some supermarket chain store brands available, you'll have a few choices to make when packing your diapering kit.

Keep the wipes in a separate Ziploc bag that you can keep in this main Ziploc bag. Place the baby wipes in a tiny plastic bag or wrap so that they don't dry out, or cause the wetness to penetrate into the diaper and cause the diaper to get very mildly wet before it's even used.



 



, See if you can find the smallest tube possible so as not to waste too much if it won't get used during a potential run with your child. Although you'll need to think in terms of quantity of need, you also need to think ""time allotted between emergency uses"" with these diaper rash cream tubes., Sometimes, diaper pads are sold with diaper-bags and sometimes parents don't routinely use this pad in lieu of their own choice of pad. The more disposable the pad is, the better choice of pad it should be for the kit. Changing pads must be disposable, if the pad is included in the kit when being disposed of. These disposable changing pads can be bought from the local grocery or baby store nearest you.

You can dispose of it with everything else after the diaper change and you won't have to worry about more cleaning supplies to clean the changing pad off after the diaper change.

, Although nursing supply stores always carry these, it doesn't have to be bought from there, and in fact some grocery stores (and most supermarket chains) stock these for several bucks. These gloves are used when there is no sink or cleansing location near and wearing gloves can keep your mind off touching the baby's dirty diaper contents.

Wear gloves during the diaper change or wipe your hands off with a hand wipe before and after the diaper change.

, Although most supermarket chains use plastic bags, you can reuse one and stash one in the kit for use during and after a diaper-change during the emergency run. Other choices may include sandwich size disposable bag with a spray of air freshener in it, but your choice may depend on the speed and ability to grab trash bags for use prior to the run.

Buy a bag from your local store and spray or lay some air freshener in it. After changing the diaper, place the dirty diaper, baby wipes, hand wipe or gloves, and changing pad in the disposable bag and close the bag.

Talk to your doctor about medication.",How to Reverse Insulin Resistance," Try to make most of your carbohydrate intake consist of complex carbohydrates. This means that they're more complicated molecularly and take longer for your body to break down. This may help your body break down glucose and may help you feel fuller longer, controlling weight and appetite control. Examples of complex carbohydrates include whole unprocessed foods like:Whole grains
Peas
Lentils
Beans
Vegetables;
, Try to keep your food as close to its original or natural form. To do this, limit processed or prepared foods and cook from scratch as much as possible. Processed food often contains large amounts of sugar. Read labels to determine how much sugar is in a product, but realize that manufacturers are not required to list added sugars.


An easy way to avoid processed foods is to avoid ""white"" foods (no white bread, white pasta, or white rice).
For example, one 6-ounce serving of flavored low-fat yogurt has 38 grams of sugar (which is the equivalent of 7 teaspoons of sugar).

, While sugars alone don't cause diabetes, eating more high-fructose corn syrup is linked to an increased risk of insulin resistance, T2D, cardiovascular disease, and obesity.Avoid simple carbohydrates that contain glucose, sucrose, and fructose. These include: Soft drinks
Sweeteners: maple syrup, honey, table sugars, jams
Candies, cakes, pastries

, Studies have shown that eating insoluble fiber along with whole grains can reduce your risk of T2D.Try to eat insoluble fiber with each meal. For example, you can sprinkle one tablespoon of ground flaxseeds over each meal. Good sources of fiber include:Brans: corn bran, oat bran, wheat bran
Beans: navy beans, lentils, kidney beans
Berries: elderberries, raspberries, blackberries
Whole grains: bulgur, brown rice, barley, oats
Vegetables: peas, leafy greens, squash
Seeds and nuts
Fruits: pears, prunes, dried figs

, Lean meats and fish are good low-calorie sources of protein. Make sure any meat you choose is not only lean, but skinless (since the skin is high in animal fat, added hormones, and antibiotics). Look for wild-caught fish such as salmon, cod, haddock and tuna. These fish are good sources of omega-3 fatty acids that are essential for your health and are anti-inflammatory. Try to eat at least 2 servings of fish each week.Limit red meats like pork, beef or lamb. These have been linked to T2D, cardiovascular disease, and colorectal cancer., You don't need to avoid fruit for fear that it contains sugar. The sugars in fruit are combined with the fiber which slows the absorption of sugars. Try to get 5 servings of fruits and vegetables every day. Don't forget to add herbs that can control your blood sugar levels. These can also help you fight sugar cravings and are safe with no side effects (when taken in commonly used amounts as food). Use these herbs:


Cinnamon
Fenugreek
Okra (not quite an herb, but more of a side-dish)
Ginger
Garlic and onions
Basil
Bitter melon (more commonly used as a tea three to four times a day)

, Moderately increasing your physical activity can help reverse insulin resistance. You don’t have to get ready for a marathon. Just choose a physical activity that you enjoy or are interested in picking up. This way, you're more likely to become active.You may start walking more, climbing more stairs, doing more outdoor activities, hiking, gardening, aerobics, Tai chi, yoga, using an elliptical, using a rowing machine, using a stationary bicycle, or stretching.
Consider whether you want to work out alone, with someone else, or play a group sport., Start with 10 minutes of activity a day. When you're comfortable with that level of activity, add a few minutes every week. For example, you may tell yourself to walk more. You might try parking your car farther from the office or getting off of the elevator two or three floors early so you can take the stairs the rest of the way. Increase these amounts by parking even farther away or taking more flights of stairs.


Avoid setting an extreme goal for yourself early on. You'll be more likely to remain active if you set small, achievable goals., Once you've been working out for a while, start to challenge yourself. Work yourself up to 30 minutes of activity a day for at least 5 days of the week. To keep things interesting, you may want to mix up the activities you do. For example, you might swim for 20 minutes and jog for 10 minutes one day.


Consider joining a gym and getting a personal trainer. This way, you'll understand how physical conditions can impact your physical activity. A trainer can help you design a personalized fitness plan.

, If you notice the skin around your neck, armpits, elbows, knees, and knuckles get darker, you may have a skin condition known as acanthosis nigricans. This is an early sign that you're at risk for T2D and insulin resistance.You may also have increased hunger, thirst, fatigue, weight gain, or increased urination.

, There are many things that increase your risk of insulin resistance. These include:Being overweight or obese
Being physically inactive or sedentary
High blood pressure
Low HDL cholesterol (“good cholesterol”) levels (less than 35 mg/dL)
High triglyceride levels (over 250 mg/dL)
Being older than 45 years old
Having a family history of diabetes
Having a history of gestational diabetes, giving birth to a baby with a birth weight of more than 9 pounds or a history of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
For women, having a waist measurement of more than 35 inches
For men, having a waist measurement of more than 40 inches

, Often, insulin resistance has no symptoms. Instead, your doctor may notice your blood sugar is higher than normal.The doctor then will run one of these tests:


A1c: This test measures how your body has handled sugars for the last 3 months. An A1c result of over 6.5% is a diagnosis for T2D while insulin resistance is diagnosed at levels between 5.7 and 6.4%.Fasting blood glucose test: You'll need to fast for several hours. Then, your blood is drawn to measure blood sugar levels. Fasting blood sugar levels between 100–125 mg/dL suggest insulin resistance.Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT): Your blood is drawn to measure blood sugar levels. You'll then drink a very sweet beverage and have your blood drawn two hours later. Your blood sugar is measured again. This test determines how well your body handles sugars., Once you've been diagnosed with insulin resistance, you should get regular checkups. Talk with your doctor about any dietary changes you've made, weight loss plans, and your activity levels. Your doctor will want to do regular blood tests to check your blood sugar levels.


Track your labs and use them as motivation to keep making diet and lifestyle changes.

, Once you have been diagnosed as prediabetic, you may want to take a medication that helps control your blood sugar, such as metformin.Ask your doctor about using this in combination with lifestyle and dietary changes to delay or reverse the onset of type 2 diabetes."
"
Exercise regularly to help prevent insulin resistance.",How to Prevent Insulin Resistance2," Aim for moderate activity for at least 2 1/2 hours a week. Find activities that will raise your heart rate, such as walking or jogging, and incorporate resistance training, such as weightlifting, into your routine. You may start out slowly, even exercising in 10-minute increments.

"
"
Measure your body mass index (BMI).",How to Prevent Insulin Resistance3," BMIs calculate your weight relative to your height. Charts can be found online and used to determine if you are overweight or obese, which could lead to insulin resistance or pre-diabetes. BMI charts are simple to read. Find your height in 1 column and your weight in another. The chart will give you a BMI number. If the chart indicates you are overweight or obese, consult your physician for a diet an exercise program. Losing as little as 10 lbs. (4.54 kilograms) can help prevent insulin resistance.

"
"
Check your blood pressure regularly.,
Have your physician check your cholesterol levels with a blood test.",How to Prevent Insulin Resistance4," Blood pressure levels above 130/85 may put you at risk for insulin resistance. If you have high blood pressure, consult your doctor for exercise and diet solutions to lower the numbers. Your doctor may also prescribe medication to regulate your blood pressure, thus lowering your risk of insulin resistance.

, Good cholesterol (or HDL) should be above 40-50 mg/dL. Overall levels should be lower than 200 mg/dL. Diet, exercise and cholesterol medications can all help lower your numbers to a range that can help prevent insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes.

Follow your doctor's instructions.,
Test your blood sugar regularly.,
Eat three meals and three snacks throughout the day.,
Make your meals are well balanced.,
Limit caffeine.,
Keep snacks with you at all times.,
Consume alcohol with food.,
Exercise at the right time.,
Treat an episode of low blood sugar.",How to Prevent Low Blood Sugar Symptoms1," Be sure to consistently follow your doctor’s instructions about medications, including insulin and other oral diabetes medications, on how to take them and when. Further, if your doctor has put you on a strict diet or you've consulted with a nutritionist or registered dietician, make a concerted effort to follow those dietary plans, which were designed precisely to avoid complications with your illness and to keep your blood sugar levels stabilized throughout the day.Sometimes the best preventive medicine is to follow the rules and guidelines set by your primary healthcare practitioner.;
, Individuals with diabetes are recommended to monitor their blood sugar at least once daily, ideally upon waking in the morning and before eating anything. Be sure to log the number on a data sheet or journal, noting the date, time and result of the test. Some diabetics, especially those with “brittle” diabetes, a condition marked by swings in blood sugar levels, should check their blood sugar more frequently and up to four times a day (before breakfast, lunch and dinner and before going to sleep). To monitor your blood sugar level using a glucometer (a blood sugar meter), purchase the meter, lancets to prick the finger, compatible test strips and alcohol pads to cleanse finger before pricking it. To test your blood sugar:Wash your hands with soap and water.
Take the alcohol pad and cleanse the pad of the index or middle finger.
Hold the lancet against your finger at 90 degrees and release the lever to prick your finger.
Squeeze a drop of blood onto test strip.
Insert the test strip into the glucometer slot and await the reading.
Log the measurement in your data log. A level of 70 mg/dL or lower is indicative of low blood sugar and this is usually when you will begin to experience the symptoms of hypoglycemia.

, You should eat three full meals and have three small snacks throughout the day so that you are eating regularly and consistently. Make sure to time the meals and snacks so that the gaps between them are evenly spaced out; if you miss a snack or eat later than usual, this can cause your blood sugar to get lower.Plan your meals so that they are never more than four or five hours apart.
Never skip meals if you have diabetes. This is especially important if you are taking medications for diabetes.
Make sure you account for any extra calorie expenditure. For example, if you're running a marathon on a Saturday, you will need to make sure to eat more that day than you would on a normal day.

, The meals should contain a protein source, such as chicken, fish or beef, that is approximately the size of a deck of cards (3-4 ounces). If you're vegetarian, make sure to get a different source of protein, such as eggs, tofu, soybeans, or Greek yogurt. Along with your protein source, make sure each meal contains a source of complex carbohydrates and plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables.Complex carbohydrates should comprise 40 to 60% of your daily diet and good sources include brown rice, beans, and whole grain breads as well as vegetables such as kale, cabbage and broccoli. Limit refined carbohydrates like white bread, pastries, syrups and candy.Good choices for fruit include oranges, peaches, grapes, blueberries, strawberries, and watermelon, among others; these will not only round out your meal but also provide valuable phytonutrients. Fresh fruit is a great source of natural sugar, which can spike your blood sugar and prevent hypoglycemia.
A good rule of thumb is that your plate should be two-thirds full of vegetables and fruits.

, Avoid beverages and foods that contain significant levels of caffeine, including coffee, tea and some types of sodas. Caffeine can cause the same symptoms as hypoglycemia, which may make you feel even worse., If you are at risk for hypoglycemia, keep quick-fix foods at work, in the car, or anywhere else that you spend time. Good healthy and convenient on-the-go options include as string cheese, nuts, yogurt, fruit or a smoothie., Consuming alcoholic beverages, particularly on an empty stomach, can cause hypoglycemia in some people. In some cases, this reaction may be delayed for a day or two so the correlation may be difficult to identify. If you consume alcohol, always drink alcoholic beverages with a meal or a snack., Exercise is very beneficial for diabetics, especially because it helps to lower blood glucose levels. By the same token, physical activity can also bring down those levels too far - even up to 24 hours after the exercise. If you engage in exercise, make sure that you are exercising a half hour to one hour after you've just had a meal. Always check your blood sugar before and after exercise.Carry a snack with you if doing strenuous exercise, like running or cycling. A snack can help prevent the onset of hypoglycemia.
If you're burning lots of calories, you may need to adjust your medication or eat additional snacks. The adjustment is dependent on the results of your blood sugar test results and how long and how intense the exercise you are doing is. You should consult your physician if you're diabetic and want to maintain your exercise regimen while also managing your condition.

, At the first sign of hypoglycemia symptoms, promptly ingest a quick snack. Go for whatever you have on hand or is available the quickest. Symptoms should dissipate within 10 to 15 minutes after consumption; re-test your blood sugar after 15 minutes to make sure it's back up to 70 mg/dL or higher. If it's still too low, eat another snack. There is no need to go to the hospital or visit your doctor if you an experience a one-off episode. If you can, stay seated, as you may become faint. Good quick-fix food options include:1/2 cup (4 oz) of fruit juice (orange, apple, grape, etc.)
1/2 cup (4 oz) of regular soda (not diet)
1 cup (8 oz) of milk
5 or 6 pieces of hard candy (Jolly ranchers, Lifesavers, etc.)
1 tbsp of honey or sugar
3 or 4 glucose tablets or 1 serving (15 g) of glucose gel. Keep in mind that the appropriate doses of these items may be less for small children; read the instructions before giving glucose medication to children in order to determine appropriate dosage.

Understand how hypoglycemia works.,
Know the symptoms of low blood sugar.,
Be preventive and take precautions.,
Consult your physician.",How to Prevent Low Blood Sugar Symptoms2," Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, occurs when your blood sugar drops below the normal level. An individual will typically begin to feel the symptoms of hypoglycemia when their blood glucose drops below 70 mg/dL. Low blood sugar occurs almost exclusively in diabetics in response to insulin therapy along with insufficient caloric intake, excessive dosages of insulin, or the exertion of energy without sufficient caloric intake (such as if you were to run a 10k but didn't account for that by having snacks).Other rare causes include a tumor in the pancreas that produces excess insulin (insulinoma) and reactive hypoglycemia, which occurs when blood sugar drops after eating a meal or specific food.Hypoglycemia can be a side effect of some medications used to treat diabetes, including insulin and pills (such as glipizide and glyburide) that are taken to increase insulin production. Certain combinations of medications (like glipizide and metformin or glyburide and metformin) can also cause hypoglycemia.This is why it is vital that you disclose all medications, vitamins, and supplements (including herbal remedies) you're taking to your doctor.

, There are a number of physical and mental symptoms that you can identify as signs that your blood sugar is low, including:Shakiness
Dizziness
Weakness
Mental confusion (e.g., uncertain of the date, year, etc.)
Altered level of consciousness, poor concentration, or drowsiness
Diaphoresis or a “cold sweat”
Coma (Note: Severe disorientation and coma do not occur until your blood glucose level reaches around 45mg/dL)

, Test your blood sugar at least once daily (when you wake up and before eating anything). Follow the above recommendations to exercise regularly and eat meals and snacks throughout the day. Take care to bring snacks with you while you're out as a precaution.In addition, If you have diabetes, or are prone to bouts of hypoglycemia, describe your symptoms to your friends, family, and a trusted co-worker so that they can help you if you experience a rapid or severe drop in blood sugar. In the case of young children, school staff should be instructed on how to recognize and treat a child's hypoglycemia symptoms.Consider carrying a form of diabetes identification, like a medical identification necklace or bracelet or a card in your wallet, so that people can know that you have diabetes in an emergency situation.
Be careful when driving because hypoglycemia symptoms can make driving extremely dangerous. When driving long distances, check your blood sugar levels frequently (especially before getting behind the wheel) and snack as needed to maintain a blood glucose level of at least 70 mg/dL., Notify your healthcare provider if you are having persistent episodes of hypoglycemia (more than a few times a week) so that they can adjust your medication dosages accordingly.It is important to bring your blood glucose log, so your doctor can figure out when your insulin is peaking and glucose level is falling, so that he can time the use of the correct type of insulin (regular, intermediate or long-acting). Dosing at the correct times of the day, as determined by your log, can help ensure that you do not have any subsequent episodes of hypoglycemia.

Watch for symptoms of high blood pressure.",How to Prepare for the Gestational Diabetes Screening Test," There is no way to determine if a woman is going to get gestational diabetes before she is pregnant. But there are certain risk factors that may indicate a higher probability in some women. If you’re planning to get pregnant, or you are pregnant, review these risk factors and speak to your doctor about possible testing when the time is right.Age. Women who are 25 years of age or older are at a higher risk or developing gestational diabetes.

Medical history. You are also at a higher risk if you have a personal history of diabetes, PCOS, insulin resistance, or history of diabetes in your immediate family. In these cases, you should be screened for gestational diabetes at the beginning of your pregnancy.

Previous pregnancies. Get screened for gestational diabetes at the beginning of your pregnancy if you have had gestational diabetes before or if you delivered a macrosomic (larger than average) baby, then you are at a higher risk of developing gestational diabetes.

Weight. Obese women with a body mass index (pre-pregnancy) of 30 or higher are at a higher risk of developing gestational diabetes and should be screened for gestational diabetes at the beginning of any pregnancy.

Ethnicity. Black, Hispanic, Indigenous peoples, and Asians have a higher risk factor for gestational diabetes.;
, Throughout your pregnancy, record any medical symptoms you may experience, especially those your doctor has asked you to track. This information may be useful to your doctor in diagnosing gestational diabetes at a later date. Some symptoms (and other items) to keep track of include:Excessive thirst and urination.
Birth weights of previous children.
Details on when you’ve lost or gained significant weight in the past.

, Before any doctor’s appointment it’s always useful to write down any and all medications (prescription and over-the-counter) you current take. Having a written list will help ensure you don’t forget anything, and will allow you to easily remember the exact dosage of each medication that you take.


Remember to include medications you take on a regular basis (i.e. daily) and medications you take as needed (e.g. when you have specific symptoms)., Depending on the type of screening test that is going to be performed, there may be specific restrictions you have to follow in the 24 hours leading up to the appointment. Make sure you are fully aware of what these restrictions are — and that you following them as instructed — to ensure your test is not delayed.For example, some blood glucose tests must be performed after the patient has fasted for 12 hours. However, most blood glucose tests that are performed during pregnancy are non-fasting.

, It is highly likely that you have been reading pregnancy books or websites and have a lot of questions floating around in your head. To be sure you remember them all, write them down before your doctor’s appointment. Some example questions related to gestational diabetes are as follows:What websites do you recommend I view in order to get reputable and relevant information pertaining to my condition?
If I have to change my diet, is there someone that can help me (e.g. dietician, nurse, etc)?
How will we know when and if I need to take medication? What type of medication might I need to take?
Will I need to check my blood sugar level regularly?
Will I continue to have diabetes after the baby is born? Will I need to do additional screening tests?What potential complications might exist during my pregnancy, and what can we do to lower those risks as much as possible?

, If your doctor sends you for the second gestational diabetes test, called the glucose tolerance test, you will be required to remain at the clinic or office for at least 3 hours. During this time you will not be permitted to eat or drink anything (except maybe water) and you will likely not be allowed to leave the premises.You may want to bring something to keep you occupied during this time, as it will likely be rather boring.

, The initial screening test requires that you drink a glucose solution about 1 hour before your blood test. The doctor may provide you with the solution to take home, so you’ll need to remember to drink it on time before you go to your appointment.You do not need to change your eating habits in any other way, other than to drink this solution., When you come into the lab you will have your blood drawn and the glucose levels will be measured. This initial test looks at your risk level for gestational diabetes.However, if your blood glucose is abnormal enough, such as 200mg/dl or higher, then this may be sufficient for a diagnosis of gestational diabetes.


Blood sugar levels of 135 to 140 mg/dL or 7.2 to 7.8 mmol/L are considered normal levels for this type of test. If the test results show your blood sugar as being higher, you are at a high risk of developing gestational diabetes.
This is a routine test that is performed on most pregnant women, especially those that have at least one of the higher risk factors. It is normally performed between weeks 24 and 28 of pregnancy, but will be performed earlier if your doctor thinks you have a higher risk of gestational diabetes.If this blood test shows you are at high risk, your doctor will most likely request you go for a second test — the glucose tolerance test., The second type of test that the doctor may request can determine if you do in fact have gestational diabetes. This test will require that you fast the night before the test (usually 12 hours). When you arrive at the clinic your blood will be drawn and your blood sugar levels will be checked. After the initial check, you’ll be asked to consume a glucose solution. After you’ve consumed the solution your blood sugar levels will be tested every hour for 3 hours. If 2 or more (out of four) of the blood sugar tests show higher than normal readings, you will most likely be diagnosed with gestational diabetes.This test will require that you remain at the clinic or doctor’s office for at least 3 hours. During this time you will not be allowed to eat or drink anything while you wait (except maybe small amounts of water).Abnormal values for each test are:

Test 1 - Fasting: greater than 95 mg/dL
Test 2 - First hour: greater than 180 mg/dL
Test 3 - Second hour: greater than 155 mg/dL
Test 4 - Third hour: greater than 140 mg/dL



, If only one of the four blood sugar tests from the glucose tolerance test were abnormal, your doctor may request a slight change in your diet and then ask you to be re-tested. The re-test will determine if the one abnormal result was easily fixed, or if there is still a problem., If you are diagnosed with gestational diabetes you will most likely have more frequent checkups throughout your pregnancy, specifically in the last trimester. Your doctor will test your blood sugar levels at each of these checkups, but most of the time you will need to perform tests to monitor your blood sugar at home., If you’ve been diagnosed with gestational diabetes, your doctor will test your blood sugar levels the day after you give birth. Your doctor will then test your blood sugar levels sometime between the 6th and 12th week after delivery.In most cases, a woman’s blood sugar level returns to normal after she has given birth. However, even if it is normal your doctor will most likely ask you to get re-tested every three years to be sure it doesn’t develop into something more serious.

, As long as you are otherwise healthy, and your doctor doesn’t have any objections, you should exercise regularly while you’re pregnant. Women should try to perform at least 150 minutes of moderate-level activities every week.One of the best types of exercises to perform while pregnant is walking. Try to schedule yourself for a brisk walk for 30 minutes every day if possible.
If you performed activities such as running or other intensive physical activities before you were pregnant, you can continue to do these activities while you’re pregnant. Throughout your pregnancy you should consult with your doctor as to when and how to reduce such activity if required.
150 minutes is equal to 2 hours and 30 minutes. At 30 minutes per day, you would only need to perform activities for 5 out of the 7 days of the week. You can even perform activities for as little as 10 minutes at a time if that works for you.

, If you’ve been diagnosed with gestational diabetes, one of the best things you can do is change your diet to be as healthy as possible. If possible, enlist the help of a dietician to help you plan your meals and select the types of foods you should eat regularly (and which ones to avoid).The following foods should be part of a balanced diet while you’re pregnant:Whole grains. Breads, cereals, pastas and brown rice.

Fruits. Any type of fresh, frozen or canned fruits are great. If you choose canned fruits, look for ones without any added sugar.

Vegetables. Any type of fresh, frozen or canned vegetables in a variety of colors are best. If you choose canned vegetables, look for ones without any added salt. It is also a good idea to avoid raw sprouts.

Lean protein. Meats, poultry, fish, eggs, beans and peas, peanut butter, soy products and nuts. You should avoid eating tilefish, shark, swordfish and king mackerel. You should limit the amount of tuna you eat to 6 ounces per week. It is recommended that you reheat deli meats or hot dogs before you eat them.

Low-fat or fat-free dairy. Milk, cheese and yogurt. Unpasteurized milk, and any dairy products made from unpasteurized milk, should not be consumed.

Healthy fats. Vegetable oils such as canola, corn, peanut and olive.

Less sugar and processed foods. Eliminate or reduce the amount of processed items you consume, and anything that is high in fat or sugar. Try to reduce or eliminate your consumption of regular sodas, sweets and fried foods.

, Many doctors will recommend prenatal vitamins specifically designed for pregnant women. However, the following supplements will also provide you with the valuable health benefits for both you and your baby. If these are not included in your other vitamins and supplements, ask your doctor how you might add them (either as supplements or as part of your diet).Folic Acid. Reduces birth defect complications associated with the spinal cord. While pregnant you should consume at least 400 mg of folic acid every day. Foods that contain folic acid include: cereals, pastas, breaks, legumes, green leafy vegetables and citrus fruits.

Iron. Most pregnant women will suffer from some level of iron deficiency, taking iron supplements will ensure the iron in your body stays at proper levels. While pregnant you should consume at least 27 mg of iron a day. Foods that contain high amounts of iron include: red meat, chicken, fish, fortified cereals, spinach, some leafy greens and beans.

Calcium. Required for the development of your baby’s bones, teeth, nerves and muscles. While pregnant you should consume at least 1,300 mg per day. This amount is equivalent to 3 servings of calcium-rosh foods such as: milk, yogurt, cheese, fortified cereals, or fortified juices.

, In addition to the positive benefits associated with gestational diabetes, eliminating smoking and alcohol while you’re pregnant will have a lot of other positive impacts on you and your baby. Alcohol, in general, can have high sugar contents, which may make it harder to control your blood sugar levels if consumed., If you are unable to maintain healthy blood sugar levels with diet and exercise alone, your doctor may request that you take an oral medication or insulin. Medications and insulin can help you to control your blood sugar levels so that they are equivalent to the levels of a pregnant woman who does not have gestational diabetes.


There are many different oral blood sugar control medications available, but some doctors have concerns about the safety of these drugs for pregnant women.Talk to your doctor about oral blood sugar control medication options and ask about the potential side effects of these drugs.
If your doctor prescribes insulin, the amount of insulin you take, and how often you have to take it, will depend on your specific situation., One potential issue with having gestational diabetes is the fact that your baby will most likely be larger than average. This can cause discomfort during the last trimester of your pregnancy, but it can also cause complications during delivery. Your doctor may prefer to schedule you for a c-section in order to ensure your baby is delivered without any additional stress or nerve damage.While c-sections are a fairly common occurrence, it is an invasive surgery that will require more recovery time for the mother. Knowing in advance you will be having a c-section will help you plan accordingly.
When the estimated fetal weight is suspected to be greater than 4500 grams (9.9 pounds), you may need a cesarean to prevent complications such as dystocia, which is when the baby's shoulder gets stuck behind the pelvic bone., Women who have gestational diabetes are more likely to also experience high blood pressure — or preeclampsia — during pregnancy. Possible symptoms of preeclampsia are fingers and toes that swell, but never go back to normal. If you notice these symptoms while pregnant, notify your doctor immediately."

Manage portion sizes.,
Understand the glycemic index and glycemic load.,
Pay attention to carbohydrates.,
Avoid white bread and eat whole grains instead.,
Eat green leafy vegetables.,
Add lean meats into your diet.,
Drink sparkling water instead of sodas.,
Eat oatmeal.,
Incorporate fiber into your diet.,
Eat well-balanced meals.",How to Reduce Blood Sugar1," Blood sugar levels elevate when you eat larger portions than you should. That means if you eat larger portions, your glucose levels will increase. Carefully manage your portion sizes for each meal and snack so that you can manage your blood sugar levels.


Measure the ingredients and serving sizes of your meals. Use measuring cups, measuring spoons, and a food scale. Follow the guidelines given by your doctor. If the doctor hasn't given you any guidelines, look at the nutritional label for the foods. Measure out a half or full serving of the food based on the serving size.Make sure to read labels for serving sizes. One package or one item may not be a single serving. For example, some bread is based on one ounce servings while many slices of bread are larger than one ounce.
Weigh fruits and vegetables. Depending on the size and type of fruit or vegetable, this can vary. It is especially important to weight fruit.;
, Glycemic index (GI) is based on the quality of carbohydrates you are consuming. Glycemic load (GL) is one number that combines both the quality of the carbs (GI) and the quantity of carbohydrates. The quantity is based on the grams of carbohydrates a food item has.When thinking about which carbs to eat to regulate blood sugar, think about the glycemic index and glycemic load.


You want to have a GI medium. This can be achieved by eating a balanced number of GI foods with every meal. You can also combine high GI foods with foods containing lots of protein and other low GI carbs, like fruit and legumes.Low-glycemic foods are rated at 55 or less. Medium foods are rated between 56-69. High-glycemic foods are rated between 70-100. When trying to control blood sugar, refrain from eating high-glycemic foods.
Low-glycemic foods include: bran cereal, black and kidney beans, skim milk, apples, oranges, peanuts, and wheat tortillas.
Medium foods include: barley, brown rice, oatmeal, whole grain bread, and whole grain pasta.
High-glycemic foods include: baked potatoes, French fries, sugary drinks, candy bars, couscous, white pasta, white basmati rice, and processed cereal., Digestible carbohydrates break down into sugar after you eat them. Simple carbohydrates result in a fast rise in blood sugar. Complex carbohydrates, which contain fiber, vitamins, and minerals, digest slower, and cause blood sugar to rise more slowly than simple carbohydrates.


Not all complex carbohydrates are equal. White bread and white potatoes are complex carbs, but they are mostly starch instead of fiber, so they are bad for blood sugar levels.
Avoid processed foods if possible. Processed whole grains have a higher glycemic index than those that have no or minimal processing.
Carbohydrates are just as important as sugar in regards to controlling blood sugar. Eating too many carb heavy foods increases blood sugar levels just like eating too much sugar does.

, White bread is quickly converted to sugar when you eat it.Instead of eating white bread, look for foods with whole grains. Whole grains are full of fiber, which help keep you full.


Whole grains are found in bread, cereal, tortillas, and crackers. Look for whole wheat flour, whole-grain cornmeal whole oats, whole rye, or buckwheat flour.
Try eating whole wheat English muffins, bran cereal, whole wheat pasta, whole grain bread, or brown rice., Adding non-starchy vegetables to your diet can help you sustain and lower your blood sugar. These vegetables are high in fiber and low in carbs.


Green vegetables include broccoli, spinach, kale, and green beans.
Don't cut starchy vegetables, like peas, corn, squash, and lima beans, from your diet. Eat them in moderation, and make sure to control your portion sizes., Meats high in proteins are good for helping control blood sugar. They don't have a drastic affect on your blood sugar like carbohydrates do. Choose lean cuts of meat, without the skin and excessive fat. Make sure to grill or bake the meat instead of frying. Also remember to eat these foods in proper portions.


Good meats to incorporate into your diet include skinless chicken breast and fish. Try salmon, tuna, and tilapia., Sodas contain a lot of sugar and carbohydrates, unless you are drinking diet sodas. Sodas and diet sodas are not good for you, and drinking juice - which is full of sugar - isn't a good alternative. If you don't want to drink just plain water, try sparkling or seltzer waters. They are flavored and have carbonation if you miss the bubbly taste of sodas.Seltzer waters are all natural and contain no additives. They are sugar and carbohydrate free, so you can drink as many as you want without affecting your blood sugar.
Sparkling waters are another good alternative. These do have additives, and some come in varieties that contain sugar and carbohydrates. Make sure to read the label to find the appropriate drink for yourself.

, Oatmeal is a good carbohydrate because it is high in soluble fiber. When you eat it, it digests slowly so it won't spike your blood sugar. Barley, a similar food to oats, is also high in soluble fiber. Evidence shows that it may also help control blood sugar.


Oatmeal offers a steady source of energy. It also helps keep you full longer, which helps with weight loss.

, Fiber helps cleanse your system and improve digestion. It also helps keep you satisfied along with slowing the rate of digestion, which helps control blood sugar levels. When looking for high fiber foods, try to find ones with low starch content.


Foods with high fiber have a lower glycemic index.
Fruits, vegetables, and beans are great sources of fiber. Try spinach, green beans, and broccoli. Try to eat fruits with lower sugar and starch content, like strawberries.Grapefruits are also great.
Unprocessed whole grains have a lot of fiber. Look at the label for ingredients labeled as ""whole"" or unrefined. Stay away from refined ingredients., Your meals should have a mixture of different food types. Focus on a plate that has complex carbs, fruits and vegetables, proteins, and fats. Make sure not to eat too many fats, and when you do eat fats, eat healthy fats. Protein can be found in lean meats.Good sources of starches are peas, corn, squash, and lima beans. Lima beans are really good because they are high in fiber.Just remember to watch portion sizes with these foods.
Eat skinless chicken breast, lean meat, and fish in your diet. Salmon is a great option because it has omega-3 fatty acids, which promote heart health. Meat is important when trying to control blood sugar because it contains chromium, which helps insulin function and aids your body in breaking down carbohydrates.Mackerel and herring are also great protein sources.Eat peanuts or peanut butter. This adds needed fat and protein into your diet that can help control blood sugar. You can also try almonds and almond butter, walnuts, and pecans. Since nuts are high in calories, make sure to pay attention to portion size."

Understand how exercise affects blood sugar.,
Monitor your blood sugar while exercising.,
Consult your doctor before starting an exercise plan.,
Incorporate different exercises into your routine.",How to Reduce Blood Sugar2," Regular exercise lowers blood sugar levels. When you exercise, your muscles need to find energy. To do this, they use glucose reserves. After they use that, they pull glucose from your bloodstream. Then, when you finish your workout, your liver replenishes the glucose in your body. Together, this process uses glucose in your body and helps level out your blood sugar.


Stopping physical activity or decreasing the amount of physical activity can have a negative effect on your blood sugar levels. When you stop exercising, your blood glucose levels rise. Consistent physical activity is important to managing your blood sugar levels.Exercise also lowers your blood pressure and cholesterol. It burns fat and helps promote weight loss, which helps control blood sugar and diabetes. It also improves your circulation and increases insulin sensitivity.

, To make sure your blood sugar doesn't drop too low, monitor you levels before you exercise. Check your glucose levels half an hour before you exercise and then just before you exercise. Your blood sugar should be between 100-250 mg/dL.


If your blood sugar is lower than 100 mg/dL, eat a healthy snack so that your levels don't fall too low during your activity.
Talk to your doctor to determine your specific blood sugar levels before you begin exercising.

, Before beginning an exercise plan, talk to your doctor to find out the best kind of exercise plan for you. Your doctor can help you figure out your overall health, how strenuous your activity should be, and the kinds of exercises you should be doing.


Your doctor can also help you figure out what time of day you should exercise. You and your doctor can come up with a plan that takes into account exercise, your meals, and medication., To get the proper exercise, you need to include aerobic cardiovascular exercise, strength training, and flexibility exercises. A regular routine that has these three components helps increase your overall health.


To help reduce blood sugar levels, try doing 20 minutes of vigorous exercise 4 times a week or 30 minutes of moderate exercise 3 times a week.
Try aerobic exercise 30 minutes a day 5 times a week. Choose activities that you enjoy. Great cardio workouts are walking, dancing, swimming, cycling, and skating. You can also play group sports, like soccer, tennis, or racquetball. Join a gym and use their treadmills and stationary bikes, or try one of their cardio classes.
For strength training, work on building muscle. Go to a weight training group class at the gym. Use strength training workouts online or DVDs. Use machines at the gym or buy some home weights.
Stretch before and after exercise. Do a yoga video for some stress relief and great flexibility work.
Get a pedometer and try to take 10,000 steps every day. If you're not close to that number now, work your way towards 10,000 steps.
Increase your workouts gradually. If you can only exercise for a few days or for a shorter length of time when you first start, make it your goal to improve that each week.
Keep a record of your blood sugar levels before and after your exercises. This can help you track the positive affects exercise has on your blood sugar levels."

Drink more water.,
Sprinkle cinnamon on your food.,
Look for patterns.,
Lower your stress.,
Use medication.",How to Reduce Blood Sugar3," Drinking water helps you lower blood sugar levels through urine. As you drink more water, the body flushes extra sugar out of your blood through urine. Then, you'll have to replenish the fluids in your body.You should drink a minimum of 8 glasses of water each day., Recent research has shown that cinnamon may have a positive effect on blood sugar by lowering fasting blood glucose. Adding cinnamon to your dishes can be a helpful way of managing your blood sugar. However, it is not to be used in place of medication.


If you are ingesting more than a teaspoon a day, buy Ceylon cinnamon. It is more expensive, but it's milder and doesn't contain the ingredient cassia, which contains coumarin. Some people are sensitive to coumarin, and when they eat a lot of coumarin, can end up with liver toxicity.
Try using cinnamon in spice rubs for meat. Or put it in oatmeal, cereal, or a salad.
You can also take cinnamon as a supplement., Isolated incidents may not be cause for worry. But if your blood sugar is irregular for three days or more, there might be cause for concern. Ask yourself what could be causing the irregularities. Is it only in the morning? That might mean you are producing too much sugar during the night and need to see a doctor. Look at your food, lifestyle, and habits for the past week or two. Try to determine the cause of the irregularity.


Have you stopped managing portion sizes? This might mean you are overeating.
Have you stopped paying close attention to the ingredients in your food? Maybe you are eating too many carbs with a high-glycemic index. If this is the case, restructure the way you eat and see if that helps regulate your blood sugar.
Have you decreased your physical activity? That could cause your blood sugar to rise.
Are you taking your medicine regularly?
Are you sick? Even drinking a cup of orange juice for the added vitamin C might change your blood sugar levels., When you are stressed, your body puts glucose in your blood as a source of energy. Trying to manage your stress can help you refrain from spiking your blood sugar.


Don't put yourself into high stress situations if you can help it. There's no reason to cause unneeded stress on your body.
If you are feeling stressed, take a step back. Realize that it is a stressful situation and try not to let the stress overwhelm you. Take a few deep breaths, meditate, squeeze a stress ball, or whatever other kind of stress relief method you have., Medication and insulin can help reduce your blood sugar. If you feel you need medication to help you regulate your blood sugar or insulin injections to help, see your physician."

Prepare to give blood.,
Understand the results.,
Know the limitations of A1C test.",How to Prepare for a Glucose Screening Test1," The A1C test measures your blood sugar control over the past two to three months and aids in the detection of Type 2 diabetes and prediabetes.This blood test is not affected by recent food intake so you don’t have to fast before the test.;
, If your doctor has recommended an A1C test, she will give you a form detailing what test should be conducted. Bring the form to the laboratory you will be testing at.


You may also want to make an appointment for the test. Some laboratories or testing centers will take appointments, which should reduce the time you need to wait in line.
Be sure to use a laboratory that is the primary provider for your health insurance.

, The A1C test is a simple blood test that can be done by two different ways, either using a venipuncture or a finger prick test.During venipuncture, a needle will be inserted into a vein in your arm and blood is drawn into a test tube.
During a finger prick test, the tip of your finger will be punctured with a needle (lancet). The laboratory technician may also gently squeeze your finger to form a blood drop that she will then collect.
Once the blood is drawn, a sample is sent to the laboratory for testing

, The A1C test measures what percentage of your hemoglobin is coated with sugar, also called glycated hemoglobin. When your A1C level is higher than normal, it indicates a poor blood sugar control, which translates to a higher risk of diabetes.A normal A1C level ranges from 4.5 to 5.7% glycated hemoglobin. A 5% A1C level translates to 97 mg/dL (5.4 mmol/L) blood sugar level.Results ranging from 5.7 to 6.4% are considered to be in the prediabetic stage and indicates a higher risk for developing diabetes.
Results showing an A1C level of 6.5 percent or higher are considered diabetic.
If your results are positive for diabetes, your doctor may confirm the results with an oral or plasma glucose test (see below) and/or will initiate a treatment plan for you to begin.

, You should be aware that the effectiveness of an A1C test may be limited, including:Falsely low A1C may result due to a recent heavy or chronic bleeding, blood transfusion or if you have an uncommon form of hemoglobin or hemolytic anemia.
Falsely high A1C may result if your bloodstream doesn’t contain enough iron or you have an uncommon form of hemoglobin.
The normal range for A1C results may also vary among laboratories.

Understand the results of fasting plasma glucose test.,
Know the limitations of fasting plasma glucose test.",How to Prepare for a Glucose Screening Test2," The fasting plasma blood test is used to measure blood sugar levels to diagnose diabetes or pre-diabetes. A fasting plasma glucose test is normally performed in the morning, after the patient has gone approximately 12 hours without eating or drinking. Fasting is required because:A person without diabetes produces insulin in response to increased glucose levels. After an overnight fast, the blood sugar levels would be low.
A person with diabetes won’t produce insulin, leaving their glucose levels still high after an overnight fast., If you have fasted overnight, go to the testing center in the morning.


Remember to bring the form your doctor gave you that details what test should be conducted.
If the laboratory takes appointments, you may want to make one to reduce the time you need to wait in line.
Also, check your insurance and use a laboratory that is the primary provider for your health insurance.

, In order to measure the fasting plasma glucose level, you need to give a blood sample. During the blood sample:A needle will be inserted into a vein in your arm.
Blood is drawn into a test tube.
Once the test is done, you can go home and the blood sample is sent to a laboratory for testing.

, Your test is considered normal (non-diabetic) if your glucose level is below 100 mg/dl.A test result of 100–125 mg/dl is considered to be in the prediabetic stage and you are at a higher risk of developing diabetes.
A test result of 126 mg/dl or higher is considered diabetic.
If your results are positive for diabetes, your doctor will initiate a treatment plan for you to begin.

, You should be aware that the effectiveness of this test may be limited, including:Falsely low plasma glucose levels may result if blood is drawn in the afternoon instead of in the morning or if too much time passes between when the blood is drawn and when the lab processes the blood sample.
Results can also be affected by medical conditions, smoking, and exercise.

Know the limitations of an oral glucose test.",How to Prepare for a Glucose Screening Test3," As the oral glucose test lasts an hour after you have consumed a glucose solution, it is recommended you make an appointment to reduce the time you wait in line before the clock starts ticking (see next steps).


Call a few days ahead when you want to take your test and make the appointment. Then, fast the night before your appointment.
Be sure to use a laboratory that is the primary provider for your health insurance.

, This type of glucose test is used to understand how your body processes glucose.This test requires you to fast, usually 10–16 hours before the test is given.
Eat normally several days before the oral glucose test, then fast the night before.
The only thing that you can consume during the fast is water.Please note that if you take medications, ask your doctor if the medicine will affect the test results., Oral glucose test will take a few hours to complete. Thus, you may want to bring along a book or play a game or watch a movie on your smartphone, laptop, or tablet.


Also remember to bring the form you received from your doctor to your appointment so the laboratory personnel knows which test to perform.

, The first blood sample is collected when you arrive to give a baseline reading (before sugar is added into the bloodstream).The laboratory technician will perform a venipuncture to draw your blood.

, After your first blood sample is taken, you will be asked to drink 8-ounce glucose solution. The solution resembles a soda drink with a higher sugar content (about 75 grams).After you drink the solution, you need to sit and wait. Relax by reading a book or watching a movie on your smartphone.

, Your blood will be drawn three to four times after the glucose solution is absorbed into the bloodstream. This will give your doctor a better picture of how your body processes the glucose in the drink.


The first venipuncture is done 30 minutes after you consume the solution.
The remaining two or three tests are done one and two hours, and sometimes even three hours after you consumed the solution.
Each test is analyzed to show the rise and fall of blood sugar levels over time.Please note that you should remain calm and not be active during the test.
You may also feel nauseated, sweaty, light-headed, experience short of breath, or faint during the test. If you experience any of these symptoms, talk to the laboratory personnel and ask if you can lay down., A normal test result will have your glucose levels decline during the test.A normal fasting value is between 60 to 100 mg/dL.
A normal glucose level after one hour is less than 200 mg/dL
A normal glucose level after two hours is less than 140 mg/dL
If your results are higher than the above values, you are positive for diabetes and your doctor will initiate a treatment plan for you to begin.

, Your test results may be false for some reasons, including:Higher glucose levels are possible due to certain medications, stress or a trauma, such as stroke, heart attack, or surgery.
Lower glucose levels may be due to exercise or certain medications.

Understand the results of the three-hour glucose screening test.",How to Prepare for a Glucose Screening Test4," A glucose-screening test is a routine procedure done between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. This test helps check your glucose levels to determine if you have gestational diabetes.During pregnancy, your hormones increase the amount of insulin needed to control glucose levels. If your body can’t handle this increased need for insulin, you can develop gestational diabetes in the late stages of pregnancy.Your doctor might instruct you to eat at least 150 grams of carbohydrates per day for three days prior to the test., The test takes an hour after you have consumed the glucose solution (see next steps) and thus, in order to reduce time waiting, it is better to make an appointment.


Choose a laboratory that is the primary provider for your health insurance and call a few days before you want to take the test.
Bring the form you received from your doctor to your appointment. As with the other glucose tests, bring the form detailing what test should be conducted to the laboratory where you will be testing at.

, When you arrive on the test day, you will be given a sugar solution containing 50 grams of glucose. The solution tastes similar to a soda drink and you can often even pick your flavor from cola, orange, or lime.


You must drink the solution in 5 minutes., You will be asked to wait for one hour after you have consumed the glucose solution to allow it to absorb into your bloodstream.The test will help your doctor understand how efficiently your body can process sugar.

, After one hour, the laboratory technician will draw a blood sample using venipuncture:


A needle will be inserted into a vein in your arm and blood is drawn into a test tube.

, If the 1-hour blood test indicates your blood sugar is too high, you will be asked to return for a three-hour glucose test to determine if you have gestational diabetes.You will need to take the three-hour glucose test if your glucose level is above 140 mg/dl (see next step).
If your one-hour glucose test result was below 140 mg/dl, you don’t need to return for further testing.

, The three-hour test takes (as the name indicates) a whopping three hours after you have consumed the glucose solution. Thus, it is better to make an appointment so you can get started immediately when you arrive to the testing center.


Call a few days before you want to take the test. Then, fast the night before the test.

, This is imperative before you take the three-hour glucose test because your sugar levels need to be dormant in order to compare your results after you’ve taken the glucose solution.Fasting while you are pregnant may seem harsh but it is needed. Make an early morning appointment for your test to get it over as soon as possible.

, Because the three-hour gestational glucose test takes so long, you may want to bring along a book or play a game or watch a movie on your smartphone or tablet to make the time go by faster.

, Your first blood test will be drawn before you drink the glucose solution to measure your baseline fasting blood glucose level. This test result will be used as a controlled variable against the other blood tests.The technician will draw your blood using a venipuncture.

, After you’ve had your fasting blood glucose level tested, you will be instructed to drink a glucose solution similar to the one you drank during the 1-hour test. However, this solution will be greater in volume and contains twice the sugar (100 grams) than the previous solution.You might feel nauseated during the three-hour test because the solution is sweet, has higher volume and is taken into an empty stomach. If you feel nauseated, ask to lay down., After you’ve consumed the glucose solution, your blood will be drawn three to four times every 30-60 minutes.Each time your blood glucose level will be checked.

, Your blood levels are considered abnormal if more than one of the test results are higher than normal, indicating that you have gestational diabetes. Results considered abnormal for the three-hour glucose-screening test are:Fasting results are > 95 mg/dl.
One-hour results are > 180 mg/dl.
Two-hour results are >155 mg/dl.
Three-hour results are >140 mg/dl.
If only one of the test results is higher than normal, your doctor may instruct you to change your diet."

Realize, those late-night snacks should be a no-no for people who have diabetes, per Mayo Clinic article.Hungry after dinner -- these ""free"" foods have few, if any, carbohydrates and calories, so ""one"" of them won't cause weight gain or increased blood sugar. Choose a ""free"" food, such as:A can of diet soda,
A serving of sugar-free gelatin,
Five baby carrots,
Two saltine crackers,
One vanilla wafer,
Four almonds (or similar nuts),
One piece of gum or small hard candy...



Give your nerves, liver and the digestive system time to finish work, and to rest and for general recovery, from the sugar produced by digestion when asleep;
Stop blood sugar being unnecessarily elevated during sleep.
Stop fats or sugars being processed all night in the liver (and allow in-digestion to clear, as well).

, -- get 6, preferably 7 or more hours of sleep for recovery time for the nerves and all other systems to settle and rest. This will lower your diabetes problems, i.e.: blood sugar levels .


If you need help sleeping, (1) try the one antihistamine to cause drowsiness that does not cause higher blood pressure (HBP), as cheap as $4 for 100 (as Equate brand 'Chlortabs'): it is chlorpheniramine maleate -- also sold as 'Chlortrimeton' and as 'Corcidin-HBP'. (Do not use any sugary antihistamine syrups.) (2) Taking Valerian as a highly relaxant herb -- helps with sleep and is especially known to reduce body aches and pains. If you wake up too early, drink water and take another dose of both, if four hours or more have passed since the first dose. (3) Take calcium with magnesium and vitamin D3 and B-vitamins, omega3, omega3-6-9 which all work together, causing much improved relaxation and many other healthful benefits! (4) A ""small serving of protein food"" helps sleep -- such as plain turkey or chicken, and do eat almonds (have more fiber!), walnuts, pecans, sunflower and pumpkin seeds, pistachios, red peanuts with skins-on (also, those kinds of seeds and all nuts have essential oils!).

Vegetables are low in sugar and provide many vitamins and nutrients that are important for you and your growing baby.Try to eat at least four portions of these vegetables per day - one with breakfast, one with lunch and two with dinner.
However, it is important that you avoid eating starchy vegetables such as corn, winter squash, peas and potatoes as these foods cause your blood sugar to rise more dramatically, increasing the risk of gestational diabetes.;
, Try to eat three servings of fruit per day, as fruits are high in vitamins, nutrients and fiber. Avoid drinking processed fruit juices, as these can be very high in sugar. Try to get your fruit intake from whole fruits instead (with the skin on, if possible) or blended smoothies.


Choose fruits that are lower in natural sugars like oranges and bananas. Fruits that have high amounts of sugar include watermelon, apples and mangoes. These can still be eaten, but less frequently.
If you do drink fruit juice, consider diluting it with water to reduce the concentration of sugar.

, High fat dairy products should be avoided during pregnancy as they are usually broken down into sugar in the body, increasing the chances of gestational diabetes. Opt for low fat diary products instead, or switch to soy milk.


However, dairy products should not be eliminated entirely, as they are important for the growth of the baby's bones and teeth. Try eating 1 cup of low fat yogurt per day.
If you significantly reduce your dairy intake, it may be necessary to take vitamin D and calcium supplements to make up the difference. However, you should consult with your doctor before taking any supplements while pregnant.

, Whole grains contain more fiber and have a reduced effect on the body's blood sugar levels. This helps to balance the amount of sugar in the body.


Whole grains also help you to stay full for a longer period, therefore causing you to eat less. Foods that contain whole grains include brown bread, whole grain crackers, brown rice and whole grain cereals. Try to avoid processed grains, which are found in white breads, cracker and pastries.
It is recommended for one to take 4-6 servings daily. Foods rich in whole grains help to provide the body with energy that is needed for the development of the baby.

, Each serving should weigh approximately 3 ounces and the fish can be baked, poached, roasted or grilled.


It is advisable to choose fatty fish, like sardines, herring, mackerel and salmon. This is because these fish contain healthy fats which are important for the normal functioning of the body's cells. These fish also provide the body with proteins that help to build immunity, which is extremely beneficial for the immunity of the baby.
Fish also has a minimal effect on the sugar levels and this helps in the prevention of gestational diabetes.

, It is advisable to eat more foods that are rich in healthy, unsaturated fats instead of foods that are high in saturated fats.


This fat does not raise the cholesterol levels, but they should still be taken in some moderation because they are still high in calories.
Foods that contain healthy unsaturated fats include olive oil, avocados, fish, seeds and nuts.

, It is advisable to take at least 1 or 2 servings of nuts and legumes. Legumes provide the body with proteins, minerals and fiber, while nuts provide the body with unsaturated fats that are essential for the development of the baby's heart and body cells.


Examples of good nuts and legumes to eat include sesame seeds, pecans, almonds, baked beans, lentils, pinto, soy, navy beans, split peas,peanut butter and peanuts.
These foods do not raise the level of sugar in the body as they have a very little effect on sugar. This foods help in prevention of gestational diabetes.

, The Mediterranean diet usually encourages people to reduce their alcohol intake. However, pregnant women are advised against drinking alcohol at all, because the toxins contained in it can affect the health of the baby.


In addition, some beers contain a lot of sugar and this increases the amount of sugar in the body predisposing one to gestational diabetes.
It is advisable to take a glass of grape juice once a day instead of wine. Grape juice provides the body with essential nutrients that are needed for building of blood components for the mother and the baby.

, Aim to reduce your intake of red meat to 3 times per month. This is because red meat leads to increased amounts of sodium and uric acid, which increases the chances of getting gouty arthritis and other systemic conditions.


Red meats usually cause metabolic changes in the body and this interferes with the balance of glucose. Therefore, the intake of red meats should be avoided to help in the prevention of gestational diabetes.
Example of red meats include beef, lamb, pork and veal. Try switching to healthier white meats such as chicken and turkey instead.

, Try to limit your intake of sweets and sugary foods during pregnancy, as these foods increase the sugar levels in the body, making you more likely to develop gestational diabetes. Try eating a piece of fruit after dinner instead - the natural sugars should help to satisfy your sweet tooth.

Follow your diabetes care program.,
Understand your 504 plan.,
Take your diabetes supplies to school.,
Carry tasty lunches with you.,
Avoid hiding your diabetes.,
Stay active.,
Remember that diabetes isn’t a big deal.",How to Overcome Diabetes Related Obstacles in School1," Having diabetes is hard, especially when you are going to school. It can also be difficult when your friends don’t have diabetes; however, that doesn’t mean your life and experiences have to be significantly different than your friends. By keeping up with your diabetes care, you ensure that you don’t have any negative effects and have to miss field trips, after school activities, or hanging out with your friends.Make sure you take care of yourself at school. That includes following your diabetes treatment plan, even if that means you have to eat different foods or at different times than your friends.
If you can't remember when you are supposed to eat a snack or take your medicine, carry a schedule with you. Put it in your notebook, your book bag, or somewhere you can easily get to.
If you have trouble remembering when to eat or take your medication, or you are too young to remember, ask your teacher or your school nurse to help keep you on track. For young children who are unable to carry out their own diabetes management, the 504 plan will outline what the school officials should do throughout the day to manage the child's diabetes.;
, A 504 plan outlines the modifications for you in your classroom. Your 504 allows you certain adjustments based on your diabetes needs, like having to be late for class due to an insulin shot.Your 504 outlines exactly your daily diabetes management plan. It tells the school what they are responsible for doing, like administering your insulin or checking your blood sugar levels. It also details what you are responsible for, like checking your blood sugar or eating snacks.Your 504 may allow you to get up to use the bathroom when you need to. It might also give you permission to go to the nurse’s office during scheduled times throughout the day.
Your 504 might also cover food-related concerns, like allowing you to have a snack in the middle of class or getting adjusted time for lunch.
Your 504 plan will outline accommodations for field trips. The supervising teacher should get your diabetes management plan from the school nurse. As part of your diabetes management plan, your parents, doctors, school nurse, and other school officials should have a plan in place for what you will need to do to manage your diabetes while on a field trip. This includes being able to have a snack, check your blood sugar, take an insulin shot, or take medication.If you have questions about your 504 plan, discuss it with your teachers and your parents.

, For most kids with diabetes, you’ll need the same diabetes supplies at school that you use at school. This includes medications, any supplies, and even food. Don’t forget your supplies because that could cause you to get sick.If you have a medical ID bracelet, make sure to wear that.

, Having diabetes may mean you have to monitor what you eat, but that doesn’t mean you can’t eat good, tasty food. Taking your own lunch from home is safer and better for you than eating at school because you don’t know everything in school food. If you or your parents pack your lunch, you will know you are getting healthy, safe meals.Following your diabetes meal plan is easy when you go to school. You can take the same lunch food and snacks that you eat at home to school with you.
Discuss with your parents what kinds of foods you think will be tasty for you to eat for lunch. Also think about which foods are easy to carry and eat within the amount of time you have.

, It can be hard to have diabetes and go to school. Other kids may not understand you, and they may make fun of you or talk about you; however, this shouldn’t make you feel ashamed. You have nothing to feel ashamed about. Never try to hide your diabetes to try to fit in.You may feel like you can give into peer pressure and eat the same foods your peers are to fit in. You may want to skip going to the nurse’s office so you don’t stand out in class. Don’t do this. Your health comes first, and you risk getting sick if you do this.

, Having diabetes doesn’t mean you can’t play sports, engage in PE, or run around at recess. Getting at least an hour of physical activity is recommended for kids with diabetes.When engaging in physical activity, make sure to have your blood sugar monitoring supplies and blood sugar snacks near your. Also monitor your blood sugar symptoms carefully.Staying physically active can help you control blood sugar.
If you play a sport or participate in PE, make sure your coach knows about your diabetes. They should have a hypoglycemia action plan in case your blood sugar drops during PE or a sports practice or game.
If you are at risk for hypoglycemia, you can still perform the same physical activity, but make sure to monitor yourself carefully while doing it. You should check your blood sugar before and after the activity, and you may need to eat extra snacks before, after, or during the physical activity. You may also need to adjust your insulin if you take it.For smaller children at recess, school officials should keep blood sugar monitoring materials close by, along with glucose snacks. They should be aware of the hypoglycemic action plan in case the child starts showing symptoms.

, You have diabetes, unlike most of the other kids at school. That makes you slightly different, but having diabetes isn’t a big deal. You can still do anything everyone else does; you just have to watch what you eat and your blood a little more closely. Don’t think of yourself as any different, and remember nothing is wrong with you.If someone teases you for having to skip class, eat different, or take medication, explain to them that you have diabetes and what that means. If they continue to bully you, tell an adult.
If you feel upset about having diabetes or feel like you are different than everyone else, talk to someone. Talk to your parents or a school counselor. They might be able to help.

Talk to the teacher and principal.,
Voice your concerns.,
Learn the disabilities laws.,
Explain your child’s condition.,
Create a diabetes management plan with the school.,
Pack your child a diabetes kit.",How to Overcome Diabetes Related Obstacles in School2," Some teachers may never have taught a student with diabetes. This means your child’s teacher may be uncomfortable with a student with diabetes or unaware of how to deal with the condition. Before the start of the school year, request a meeting with your child’s teacher, principal, school nurse, counselors, or whoever else you believe may need to be aware of your child’s condition.If the teacher feels uncomfortable with your child’s condition, see if it is possible to switch her to a class with a teacher who feels more comfortable.
If needed, schedule meetings with the superintendent of the school district to express your concerns.

, Sending your child to school should make you feel like you’re sending him to a safe place. If the diabetes protocol in your school doesn’t seem right or you don't feel like your child is safe or his needs are being met, make sure to voice your concerns to the school or the school board.In some school districts, you will have the most knowledge about diabetes, especially if no child before yours has has it. You have to be your child’s advocate.
If the teachers or other staff members are unfamiliar with the procedures for your child, instruct or train them on how to properly monitor your child, use an insulin pump, or do anything else related to your child’s diabetes.
The American Diabetes Association offers training programs for non-medical school staff members., When you learn your child has diabetes, you should become familiar with the disabilities laws. This helps you be familiar with what schools and schools districts have to lawfully do to provide care for your child.Don’t expect the school or workers at the school to know the laws. Learn them for yourself so you can make sure your child gets the proper care.
Not all states have the same diabetes protection laws. Some state laws are confusing, complicated, and unclear. Learn what your state’s laws are so you will be prepared.No matter what the state’s laws are, your child has rights under federal disabilities laws.
If you are unsure about laws and your child’s rights, the American Diabetes Association provides contact information so you can talk to experts and legal advocates to help you learn how to best help your child.

, When you let your child’s school know that she has diabetes, make sure you are clear about her condition. This includes all treatment she should receive at school, emergency protocol, and even a detailed description of the condition.Give your child’s school information about diabetes with ways to recognize warning signs of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia and how to treat conditions.Emphasize how important it is for your child's blood sugar to remain stable. Studies have shown that chronic high blood sugar can impair brain development in children.Make sure your child’s school has your child’s diabetes management plan, emergency contact information, and information on your child’s diabetes team.
Consider, too, calling the parents of your child's friends and explain your child's condition. In particular, talk to the parents of your child's best friends or wherever your child spends a significant amount of time. They can then explain your child's condition to their kids, so that they have a better understanding and are less likely to make fun, and may be able to help in an emergency.
This might be especially important if your child has Type 1 diabetes. Many schools deal with Type 2 diabetes but have relatively little experience with Type 1.

, At the start of the school year, or when you discover your child has diabetes, get together with the teachers and school nurse to come up with a diabetes management plan. You may need to coordinate and work along with your child’s doctor, too.This plan outlines what your child will need done during the day to manage his diabetes. This includes trips to the school nurse for meds, shots, or testing, snack breaks, extended or adjusted lunch times, and bathroom breaks.
Make sure the school has emergency contacts for everyone, including your child’s doctor.
Make sure the school has a glucagon emergency kit and the people are aware of how to use it in case of emergencies. Your child's teachers and coaches should know how to use the glucagon emergency kit, along with the school nurse.

, When your child goes to school, she needs all her diabetes supplies. You should help her get together a kit. Make it a part of your evening routine for you and your child to check the kit to see if there’s anything it needs.This may include insulin and syringes or a blood testing meter with strips, lancets, and batteries. If your child uses an insulin pump, include that.
You may also want to include antiseptic wipes and other first aid items.
Snacks that raise blood sugar are also needed. This may be a few pieces of hard candy, four ounces of juice, eight ounces of low-fat milk, or a few tablespoons of raisins.
Include a bottle of water."

Discuss diabetes with your friends.,
Be vocal.,
Get comfortable with your school nurse.,
Learn how to deal with bullies.,
Know who to contact for help.,
Talk to your parents.,
Talk to your doctor.",How to Overcome Diabetes Related Obstacles in School3," You shouldn’t be ashamed of your diabetes. It’s part of who you are. Talk to your friends about diabetes and help them understand that though you have this condition, you are just like them in other ways.Sometimes your friends might not understand or even be afraid of your diabetes. That’s okay. Be patient with them and help them understand what your condition means for you. Also help them understand that you can do things just like they can.
Focus on what you and your friends have in common. Don’t focus on your diabetes. While you shouldn’t hide it, you also shouldn’t dwell on it.

, Sometimes, you may feel uncomfortable in a situation where you need to do something because of your diabetes. Maybe you need to get an insulin shot, take your medication, or eat a snack. These needs may come in the middle of awkward situations, like taking a test or a field trip. Make sure to speak up if you need something. Not saying something because you want to avoid an awkward situation may make you sick and put your health at risk.If possible, talk to your teacher before a test or field trip to let them know you may have to stop and eat a snack or leave to check your blood.

, Your school nurse is one of the most important people in your diabetes management at school. She will be the person you go see if you need an insulin shot, to check your blood sugar levels, or to take your medication. Don’t be shy to talk to her or get to know her. She’s there to help you and be there for you.You will probably have to leave your needles, testing devices, and meds with the school nurse. She will keep them for you and help you remember to take your meds or check your blood if you forget.

, Some kids might pick on you for having diabetes. This might be because they are scared of the condition or they don’t understand. If you get bullied for having diabetes, knowing how to cope with them can help.Tell the bully to stop bullying you and then walk away. Act brave and ignore anyone who bullies you.
Get your friends to help you. It’s easier to stand up to bullies if you have friends around.
Tell your teacher if someone is bullying you because of your diabetes.

, While you’re at school, you should know who you can go to for help if something happens with your diabetes. Make sure your parents let you know who is aware of your situation, who administers insulin, or who knows how to treat any complications.Your teacher is the first person you should talk to in class. He will then probably send you to the school nurse, who will be able to help you with any diabetes-related problems. If he can't help, he will have your emergency contacts, like your parents and your doctor.
You may consider going to the meetings your parents set up with school officials to go over your diabetes management plan. This helps you understand what your school knows and who you can go to for support and help.

, Your parents are your advocates. They’re on your side and make sure the people at school do what they need to for your diabetes.Tell your parents if there are any issues with your diabetes management at school.
Make sure to tell your parents if you have any problems with anything at school.

, Your doctor can help you prepare for going to school and dealing with your diabetes. Your doctor may be able to help you figure out how to deal with certain situations related to your diabetes at school.Ask your doctor what things you should be concerned about at school. You may also ask him what things you should bring to your teacher’s attention and what things can wait until you get home to your parents.

For example, the American Diabetes Association, The Endocrine Society and the Diabetes Research Institute Foundation provide links to the clinical trials they are partnered with., There are many different clinical trials going on at any given time. You can locate a specific study in your area.


For example, the Glycemia Reduction Approaches in Diabetes: a Comparative Effectiveness Study (GRADE) is a long-term study for type 2 diabetes funded through the National Institute of Health. They have 45 clinical sites where they are enrolling participants.The Restoring Insulin Secretion (RISE) Study focuses on children and adults with or at risk for type 2 diabetes. This study has four clinical sites in major cities across the US.Diabetes TrialNet is an organization that studies and runs trials focused on type 1 diabetes., Many universities with medical programs specializing in diabetes may run clinical trials. For example, the Diabetes Center at the University of California San Francisco, the Harold Schnitzer Diabetes Health Center Research Department at Oregon Health and Science University, the University of Maryland Center for Diabetes and Endocrinology, and the University of Chicago Medicine are only a few of the many universities that conduct diabetes clinical trials.

Recognize the early symptoms of hyperglycemia.,
Be alert for advanced symptoms of hyperglycemia.,
Don't confuse hyperglycemia with other conditions.",How to Manage Hyperglycemia," As part of your annual checkup, your doctor will order a standard blood test that checks your blood sugar level. Ideal targets are between 80–120 mg/dL (4–7 mmol/L) for people younger than age 60 with no other medical conditions, or between 100–140 mg/dL (6–8 mmol/L) for people older than 60 and those younger people who have a history of heart, lung or kidney disease.If your blood glucose levels are higher than these targets you've got hyperglycemia.


Your doctor may also conduct a special A1C blood test, which measures your average blood glucose levels for the past two to three months.
An alternative option is routinely testing your blood glucose at home with an inexpensive store-bought meter that works by pricking your finger and reading a drop of your blood.
In general, your target blood sugar range changes (gets higher) as you get older or if you're pregnant.;
, Once it's established that you have chronically high blood glucose levels and not just temporary hyperglycemia from binging on sweets, your doctor will likely recommend synthetic insulin-based medications.Insulin is a hormone produced by your pancreas to shuttle glucose from the blood into tissues so they can use it for energy production.


Medications for hyperglycemia come in injectable medicines (syringes, pens, pumps) and oral pills. Talk to your doctor about the pros and cons of each and which may be more appropriate for your condition. Injectable medication have to be stored a proper way some need refrigerated while others do not. Make sure that you are storing you injectables properly.
Diabetic medication typically needs to be taken every day, especially if you have type 1 diabetes. Make sure that you take your medicine on time and when you are supposed to. If you are off then this might contribute to your hyperglycemia.
Be careful not to take too much medication because you can easily trigger hypoglycemia, or low blood glucose. Hypoglycemia is the feared complication of aggressive diabetic treatment. Talk to you doctor about hypoglycemia and how to prevent or counteract any side effects from your medication.

, If you or a friend or family member start to show the signs of severe hyperglycemia (particularly if you or they cannot keep any food or fluids down), then get to the emergency department of the hospital as soon as you can to get insulin and/or other diabetic medication to stabilize the blood sugar.Once a diabetic coma commences, the risks of permanent organ and brain damage increase significantly.


While at the hospital you'll receive fluids (likely intravenously) until you're rehydrated. The fluids also help to dilute the excess glucose in your bloodstream.
Along with fluids, you'll also get your electrolytes replenished, which are charged minerals (calcium, potassium, sodium and others) needed for normal muscle, heart and nerve function.

, Regardless if you have diabetes or not, your diet has a big impact on your blood sugar levels. All fruits and other carbohydrate-containing foods (bread, pasta, rice) get broken down to glucose and absorbed into your blood, but refined sugars such as high fructose corn syrup are absorbed so quickly that your blood sugar spikes — leading to hyperglycemia.As such, focus on fresh foods and avoid prepared foods, which are often high in refined sugar.
Eat lean meats and fish, fresh veggies, whole grains and moderate amounts of fruits, but avoid sugary baked goods, sweet desserts, ice cream, milk chocolate, candy and soda pop.

, Your portion size during meals can also have a dramatic impact on your blood sugar levels.Thus, instead of eating two or three big meals per day and risk triggering hyperglycemia, eat four or six smaller meals per day. Stick to meal portions that can fit into the space created by cupping both hands together (as if you're washing your face with water).


Smaller portions don't cause as big of a insulin spike because they don't raise the blood sugar levels as high.
Eating smaller portions will give you energy spread throughout the day without any of the ""sugar rushes"" and resulting energy ""crashes.""
Make sure you still stay within the amount of calories you should eat each day. You can use an online calorie calculator to help determine how many calories you need to eat to maintain your weight or lose weight.

, Eating food high in fiber (veggies, whole grains, beans, legumes) tends to fill you up so you don't over-eat and risk developing hyperglycemia.Fibrous veggies (celery, carrots, zucchini) also tend to be very low in sugar, so they won't spike your blood sugar levels — assuming you lay off the veggie dips and processed cheese!


Some fibrous fruits can be relatively low in sugar and make good choices also, such as strawberries and apples, but make sure they're not too ripe because the sugar content will be higher.
Instead of white rice and white bread, eat more brown rice and whole wheat bread with flaxseed or nuts.
High fiber diets also keep blood cholesterol levels low and stimulate better digestion and colon health.
According to the Institute of Medicine, women need 25 grams of fiber per day whereas men need 38 grams of fiber per day., Another way of avoiding, minimizing or managing hyperglycemia is via regular (daily) physical exercise;however, don't push yourself too hard with strenuous exercise because it can overly stress your body and trigger temporary hyperglycemia. Instead, stick with brisk walks, hiking, cycling, stair climbing and swimming for good glucose-controlling exercise.


Exercise can lower blood sugar levels because it improves cell's sensitivity to insulin and helps them burn glucose for energy.
Try to get 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise every week. That is about 30 minutes five days a week.
Don't exercise, even moderately, if your hyperglycemia is so high (typically above 240 mg/dL) that ketones are present in your urine because it can make your blood sugar level even higher., During periods of high stress, both physical and emotional, your body releases lots of ""stress hormones,"" which cause a spike in blood sugar levels.This is because stress triggers the ""fight or flight"" response and your body needs the extra sugar in the blood for quick bursts of energy; however, chronic stress leads to hyperglycemia and the risk of health problems, such as diabetes, heart disease and kidney failure.


Reducing chronic stressors such as financial strain, job pressures, relationship difficulties and health issues can help you manage or avoid hyperglycemia.
Learn stress-relieving practices such as meditation, tai chi, yoga, positive visualization and deep breathing exercises to help you cope.
Also physical stress injury, illness, infection, or surgery can lead to elevation in blood sugar. Treatment of this type of stress usually involves treatment of the underlying cause and a change to your diabetes treatment plan., Hyperglycemia doesn't typically trigger noticeable symptoms until glucose values are greater than 200 mg/dL (11 mmol/L).Furthermore, the symptoms often develop slowly over several days or a few weeks. The early symptoms of hyperglycemia to look out for include: frequent urination, increased thirst, unusual hunger, dry mouth, blurred vision, headache, numbness in your extremities, reduced sexual desire and fatigue.


If you notice any of these early symptoms, you should either measure your own blood sugar with a home monitor or make an appointment with your doctor as soon as you can to determine if your have hyperglycemia.
Recognizing the early symptoms of hyperglycemia allows you to treat the condition promptly and avoid any further health issues.

, If early stages of hyperglycemia goes unnoticed and untreated, it can cause toxic ketones to build up in your blood and urine (ketoacidosis) and lead to: fruity breath, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, general weakness, abdominal pain, confusion and eventually loss of consciousness and coma.Untreated hyperglycemia can ultimately be deadly.


Ketoacidosis develops when your body doesn't produce enough insulin to use glucose, so it breaks down fatty acids to use for energy which produces toxic ketones.Over the long term, chronic hyperglycemia (even if it's not severe) can lead to nerve and circulation problems complications that affect your eyes, kidneys, heart and feet.

, The symptoms of hyperglycemia are similar to other serious conditions, such as a heart attack (myocardial infarction) and pulmonary embolism;however, hyperglycemia doesn't typically involve chest pain or any referral pain down the left arm, which is so common with heart attacks. Furthermore, severe heart issues and pulmonary embolisms come on very fast, whereas hyperglycemia generally takes many hours or even days to develop and escalate.


Other conditions that can mimic hyperglycemia include: severe dehydration, central nervous system infection, a head concussion, extreme alcohol intoxication and severe blood loss from a wound.
Your doctor will rule out other conditions and use blood tests to confirm hyperglycemia before beginning treatment.

Discuss the reasons for your blood test with your doctor.,
Don’t eat the night before your appointment.,
Expect to have blood taken.,
Get educated about your results.,
Make a plan of action with your doctor.",How to Measure Fasting Blood Sugar1," There are many reasons your doctor might suggest you take a test to measure fasting blood sugar. A family history of diabetes, any symptoms of diabetes, or just regular screening for diabetes are all valid reasons for the test. He or she will discuss your risk factors with you, and schedule another appointment at which to perform the test.


If you’re unsure why you need the test, just ask! Say something like, “Can you please explain your rationale for ordering this test?” Your provider can then elaborate: “Because your mother got diabetes at age 40, we want to check to make sure you don’t have it, too,” or, “You mentioned you’ve been using the restroom a lot more frequently in the last two months. This can be a sign of diabetes, so we just want to check.”
Anyone over the age of 45 should be screened every three years. You should be screened more often if you are overweight (BMI >25), have high cholesterol or blood pressure, are a member of a high-risk ethnic group, or have certain medical conditions.Symptoms of diabetes include the need to urinate more often, vision changes, lightheadedness or fainting, confusion, and having a seizure for the first time.;
, “Fasting” blood test means one that is done after 8 hours or more of not eating. It’s used to measure the baseline blood sugar in your body, so that food you eat doesn’t interfere with the reading. It’s okay to drink water the night before and the morning of your test, but avoid food and other fluids like juices and soda (these have lots of sugar in them).


Most fasting tests are scheduled for first thing in the morning so you don’t have to go hungry all day long. Request an early appointment if one isn’t already suggested for you.

, Having your blood sugar tested at the doctor’s office involves having a blood sample taken, generally from inside the crook of your elbow. A nurse or other healthcare provider will use a disinfecting swab to clean the area, and will apply a tourniquet (a tight band) to the top of your arm to keep blood in the area they want to sample. They will withdraw blood with a syringe. Some people feel moderate discomfort when the needle is inserted, and others feel only a small prick like a bee sting. You may experience mild throbbing or a small bruise afterwards. The nurse will remove the tourniquet when done, and apply a bandaid. The whole process takes about a minute.This blood sample will probably also be tested for other things, like your hemoglobin A1C – this indicates your average blood sugar over a two to three month period, and is another methods of testing for and monitoring diabetes.

, Normal results for a fasting glucose test is in the range of 70 to 99 mg/dL. A level between 100 and 125 mg/dL indicates a higher risk for type 2 Diabetes because your body isn’t making or responding to insulin appropriately. A reading of 126 mg/dL or higher on two separate tests indicates diabetes.Discuss the results with your doctor.Someone from your doctor’s office should call you or have you schedule an appointment to explain your results to you. If not, be sure to ask, “What are the results of my fasting blood sugar? What does that mean?” Your doctor or nurse can then explain what your reading was, for instance, “Your test showed a reading of 95 milligrams per deciliter, which is a healthy level,” or, “Your reading was a little high at 115, so we’d like you to come in next week to be retested. You might be pre-diabetic, and if so we want to catch it early and talk about lifestyle changes you can make.”
A measurement of 100 mg per dL means that there are 100 milligrams of glucose for every deciliter of blood in your system.
A high reading on a fasting blood sugar test is typically the first sign of diabetes or pre-diabetes. Being aware of your glucose levels and working to keep them appropriate can prevent serious health complications in the future.
70 to 99 mg/dL = 3.9 to 5.5 mmol/L, Talk to your doctor about dietary and lifestyle changes you can make to improve your blood glucose, like exercising daily and eating a low-sugar diet. Schedule a follow-up fasting blood sugar test in 1-3 months, depending on what your doctor prefers, so you can put your plan into action and see the results. Always try lifestyle modifications to improve your blood sugar before taking medications, unless your blood sugar is dangerously high as indicated by your doctor.


Set realistic goals with your provider – you’re not going to change all of your habits overnight. It’s common for your doctor to ask questions like, “Do you do anything for exercise? How often do you drink soda?” and then make recommendations: “Try to take a fast-paced walk for 30 minutes 4 times per week, and drink water with your meals instead of soda. What do you think of those changes?”

Know the type of diabetes you have.,
Know your body weight.,
Determine the age range.,
Pay attention to exclusion criteria.",How to Participate in Diabetes Clinical Trials2," Each clinical trial has different requirements, called inclusion and exclusion criteria. Some want participants who have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, while other studies might be looking for people who are at a risk for type 2 diabetes or who have type 1. Know what your status is so you can apply for the appropriate clinical trial.Some trials may want participants who have had diabetes for awhile, and others want those who have just been diagnosed. For example, a study might say they want someone who has had diabetes for at least a year, while another might want someone who found out within the last six months. , Some diabetes clinical trials have weight requirements. For example, a study might require the participant to be overweight or obese. Other trials might want participants under a certain body mass index (BMI) number. Knowing your weight can help you find clinical trials you are eligible for., Most clinical trials have a minimum age limit. These ages may be anywhere from 13 to 18 to 64.Some have a cap on how old a participant can be, like 49 or even 80.Read the eligibility to determine if you are affected by the age restrictions.

, Some studies have a list of people who are not eligible for the study.

A clinical trial researches new approaches to preventing or treating diseases. These clinical trials might focus on a new treatment option, like medicines, new ways to use existing treatments, or new ways to make a diagnosis of the disease. Each clinical trial aims at trying to determine if these experimental treatments or tests are safe and improve the quality of life for patients.People may participate in clinical trials for many reasons. Some reasons include wanting to help with the advancement of medicine; trying out new treatments while receiving care by the staff running the trial (physical examinations, diagnostic tests); playing a more active role in your healthcare; possibly being compensated for time, travel, and participation., Clinical trials vary in length. Some diabetes trials last for many years at a time. When you are trying to decide if a clinical trial is right for you, figure out if a long trial is the kind of commitment you are willing to sign up for., Before signing up for a clinical trial, research the trial and the people running the trial. Ask questions of the people involved and make sure they answer all your questions to your understanding. Make sure you understand all your responsibilities and what will be expected of you during the trial. Visit any websites connected with the trial.Make sure you know what the purpose of the study is and why the treatment might be helpful.
Find out who is funding the study, who approved the study, and how the participants’ health is being monitored.
The clinical trial should follow all the ethics and confidentiality rules and laws. Make sure that you ask about the IRB approval and carefully read the informed consent (if you decide to participate).

, Not all clinical trials are free. You may have to pay for tests or the medicine. Ask what exactly you will have to pay for and how much that will cost you. Don’t forget to look into travel costs for the trial.Some insurance companies cover clinical trials. Contact your insurance company to learn what they will cover and what they won’t.

, Clinical trials have different methods which they use to get the medicine or treatment to the participants. When you read the information about a clinical trial, you may see the following words:Placebo. A placebo is a product that you think is the product being tested, but it is actually an inactive product.
Randomization. This process randomly assigns two or more treatments or medicines to volunteers. This helps researchers avoid bias.
Single- or double-blind studies. The participants in these studies are unaware of which treatment is being used. This avoids bias on the participants part.

, A patient volunteer is a participant in a clinical trial who has known health problems, such as diabetes. The clinical trial may or may benefit you.A healthy participant is someone who has no health problems who volunteers for a study. Some diabetes clinical trials will allow healthy volunteers, while others only want participants who have a form of diabetes.

, Clinical trials present risks for the participants. There is a chance for minor discomfort, but there is also a chance for more serious complications that require medical attention. Risks will be explained in detailed on your informed consent sheet, which you sign before participating. Those who are running the trial will also explain any major risks.Some clinical trials are time consuming. They may require you to make more medical visits, have more tests, take more treatments, or have complex instructions.
In rare cases, people have died or been seriously injured during clinical trials.

, Clinical trials provide many benefits. As a participant, you get to try new treatments before they are available to the general public. You have access to medical attention through the duration of the trial from the research team full of health care professionals.In addition, there is the indirect benefit that clinical trials produce — helping the scientific community to produce or study something for other people and for the future.


Clinical trials give you a chance to be active in your own health care while contributing to medical research.

Purchase a blood sugar testing kit.,
Familiarize yourself with your glucometer.,
Refrain from eating at least 8 hours before measuring your fasting blood sugar.,
Assemble the device.,
Wash your hands.,
Test your blood sample.,
Read the results.,
Record your results.",How to Measure Fasting Blood Sugar2," If you have diabetes, testing your blood sugar at home is the simplest way to monitor your glucose level. Many people do test their sugar before or after meals, but doing a fasting blood sugar test once a month is a good way to monitor the status of your diabetes and overall health.


Visit your local pharmacy to obtain a testing kit, called a glucometer. Most kits contain lancets (testing needles), a lancing device, testing strips, and a meter to read the results.
Many doctors can provide a prescription for these testing kits, which may save you money.

, Thoroughly read the instruction manual supplied with your blood sugar testing kit so that you are familiar with how it works, know how much blood is required for testing, and feel comfortable with the device. Look at the pictures, read the instructions, and if you have any questions or concerns then contact your doctor before trying to use the machine. They are rather straight-forward devices, but proper use is always the best use.

,


Go to bed at around 10 or 11 p.m. the night before you test your blood sugar. When you wake up around 7 or 8 a.m. the next day, you will have fasted for at least 8 hours without having to stop yourself from eating throughout the day.

, Insert a test strip into the glucometer, ensuring your insert the proper end inward. Insert a lancet into the holder you use to prick your finger.


Glucometers may differ in when you insert the test strip. Usually it is inserted in order to turn the machine on, but sometimes you have to put the blood on the strip and then insert it into the machine. Make sure you know which way your glucometer works before you prick your finger.

, Use hot water and soap to thoroughly wash your hands. Alternately, clean the finger you’re going to prick with an alcohol swab., Prick the side of your fingertip with the lancing device. This usually causes no, or very minimal, discomfort. You may need to squeeze or massage the finger you pricked on either side to squeeze out a drop of blood. Let the blood form a small bead on your finger. Hold the bead of blood to touch the tip of the strip at the right place, which should be indicated on the strip.Some people find it more comfortable to prick the side of the finger close to the fingernail, rather than the pad of the finger – there are fewer nerve endings on the side, making it a less sensitive area., The results will show up on the digital screen of your glucometer. How long it takes to show up may vary between machines. The numbers from an at-home test mean the same thing as the numbers from a test done at your doctor’s office: Below 100 mg/dL is normal, 100 to 125 mg/dL suggests impaired fasting glucose, and 126 mg/dL or higher may indicate diabetes.


Usually, more than one blood test is done to confirm the diagnosis of diabetes. If your at-home results are high and you have not yet spoken to your doctor about the risk of diabetes, contact them and set up an appointment to discuss it.

, Keep a log of your fasting glucose levels so you can compare them over time. Whether it’s something you do at home once a month, once every 3 months, or once every 6 months, look for trends to see if your blood sugar is staying the same, lowering, or increasing.


Take your log with you when you visit your doctor so they become aware of any trends you record.
Some glucometers record your results. Bring your glucometer with you to every doctor’s visit.

Cook from scratch.,
Eat complex carbohydrates.,
Avoid processed foods.,
Increase the fiber in your diet.,
Change the meats you eat.,
Increase vegetables and limit fruits.,
Watch your daily calorie intake.,
Exercise.",How to Manage Gestational Diabetes Without Medication1," To treat gestational diabetes, natural treatments are similar to medical treatments, but the dietary approaches in the natural treatment of gestational diabetes emphasize whole foods. Keep your food as close to its original or natural form as possible. This means that you should try to limit any processed or prepared foods and cook from scratch as much as possible.


If you are pressed for time, try using a crock pot or preparing the basics, such as rice, beans, meats, and vegetables, ahead of time and freezing those basics.Another ingredient that you can use in cooking from scratch that can help you is cinnamon. Cinnamon has also been used to help control blood sugar levels and is considered safe for pregnant women in the amounts used normally in foods.This corresponds to approximately 1000 mg every day.While ""natural"" food companies like to tout the benefits of organic foods, research does not show a benefit in managing gestational diabetes. It is most important to eat plenty of fresh, whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.;
, Your diet should include at least around 40 to 50% of your daily intake of calories from complex, high fiber carbohydrates.Eat most of your complex carbohydrates at lunch and cut down on the portion sizes for other meals. This helps to regulate your blood sugar and insulin production throughout the day.Complex carbohydrates are found in whole, unprocessed foods such as whole grains, sweet potatoes, and oatmeal. Another good rule of thumb is no “white” foods, meaning no white bread, white pasta, or white rice, which are simple carbohydrates.


While both simple and complex carbohydrates are broken down into glucose in the body, the idea is that it takes the body longer to break down the complex carbohydrates than it takes to use the simple carbohydrates. This means that the body has a better chance to process the glucose., Simple carbohydrates are often found in processed foods, which include added sugars like glucose, table sugar, and fructose such as high fructose corn syrup. Recent studies have shown that the ingestion of high fructose corn syrup, especially from soft drinks and other beverages with high fructose corn syrup added, has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and obesity.Reading labels can be useful to determine the amount of sugars in processed food, but manufacturers are not required to list added sugars. Avoid candies, cookies, cakes, and other confections. The reason that processed foods should be avoided is that they include both simple carbohydrates along with added sugars.
Sugar by itself does not cause either diabetes or gestational diabetes, but ingesting more sugar-filled foods and beverages is linked to an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes., Increased fiber can also help with your diabetes. This means you can eat beans and whole grains, all which have increased fiber. Add extra fiber with a tablespoon of ground flaxseeds at every meal. Either get a coffee grinder to grind your own flaxseeds or keep pre-frozen ground seeds in your freezer to keep the healthy oils that you also get in flaxseeds from getting rancid., You should limit red meats from your diet. Instead of steak or ground beef, increase fish and skinless poultry. Look for wild-caught fish such as salmon, cod, haddock, and tuna. These fish are good sources of omega-3 fatty acids that are essential for your and your baby’s health. Remove the skin from poultry such as chicken and turkey, as it is high in fat.


Make sure you eat lean meats that are not too high in fat. Only 10 to 20% of your daily calorie intake should be from protein sources. This includes other sources of protein as well, such as nuts., To keep with your healthy diet, you need to eat more vegetables. Make sure you have at least one to two servings of vegetables with every meal. You can eat them as a snack too.Even though fruit is good for you, when you have gestational diabetes, you should limit your fruit intake to no more than two a day. This will help you control the amounts of sugars you eat that come from fruit.Avoid fruits such as pineapple, melons, bananas, raisins, and grapes. They have a high glycemic index, which means they have more sugar that affects your blood sugar per serving than other fruits. Your fruit intake should be eaten at lunch instead of breakfast or dinner, which helps keep your blood sugar down in the morning and night.
Avoid fruit juices, which are full of sugar as well, even if they are 100% juice., Normal weight gain during pregnancy is from 18.5 to 24.9 pounds. Generally, the ADA recommends a calorie intake of between 2,000 and 2,500 calories a day for you and your baby. Each trimester, your caloric intake will increase as your baby grows. However, each pregnancy is different, so you should talk to your doctor and a registered dietitian to ensure that you are getting the right amount of calories per day based on your particular circumstance, weight, and blood sugar needs.During your doctor visits, your physician will most likely recommend a nutritionist to help control gestational diabetes. If your physician doesn’t make that recommendation, insists on one. Pregnancy presents a number of nutritional demands on your body and this is complicated by gestational diabetes. Both you and your baby can benefit from professional, nutritional advice.Make sure you follow the list of healthy foods to increase your calories with healthy options.

, Exercise is important for a healthy pregnancy. Work to achieve at least thirty continuous minutes of exercise once or twice per day. Walking is the easiest way to do this, but you can also go swimming or join a yoga class. Mix it in with other activities to keep it interesting and to work other muscle groups. You can also use an elliptical, conditioning machine or stationary bicycle. Moderate physical activity can improve your glucose control.Avoid exercises that have you lying on your back or any activities where a fall or injury is possible. Your chosen activity or activities should be done every day if possible. Make sure you take it easy at first and work up to a moderate level of activity that works the muscles and slightly increases your heart rate.Make sure you listen to your doctor if he advises bed rest or little activity."

Find a support system.",How to Encourage Older Children and Teenagers to Wear Diapers for Bedwetting," As the parent, you know that you are in charge. But as your child gets older, they will be much more interested in knowing why certain choices are made on their behalf. Take some time to talk to your child about why you are making the choice to put them in diapers.Use terms that your child can understand. If you need to explain your decision in terms of a medical condition, find ways to make it relatable to your child. For example, you could say, ""You know how you have trouble going to the bathroom before bed? These diapers are one of the things we're going to try to address this issue.""
Point out to the youngster that it's important to get a full night's rest at their age, and that wearing protection to bed will allow them to do that because they won't have to get up in the middle of the night to change sheets.;
, Consider saying something like, ""I know that you don't want to wear diapers, but I'm concerned that the bedwetting is really interfering with your sleep. That's why I've decided to try the diaper solution for a while. Let's see how it goes.""


Let them know that people of all ages (including many adults) wet the bed and that some of these people have to wear diapers their entire life.
While it'd be best for you all if you can deal with the bedwetting behavior itself, rather than just addressing the symptoms, there are some cases in which ongoing use of diapers is appropriate. Reassure them that, even if that's the case, it'll be okay. Diapers are the most effective garments to manage heavy incontinence such as bed wetting and will provide comfort and hygiene.

, If your child is old enough to be resistant to wearing diapers, than they likely have some good reasons. Maybe they are feeling ashamed or embarrassed. Or maybe the diapers are physically uncomfortable. Whatever the issue, make sure that you treat it as a valid concern.One great way to demonstrate that you are hearing their concerns is to use paraphrasing. For instance, you might say, ""I hear you saying that you are concerned your older brother will make fun of you for wearing diapers.""
Follow up with questions. Try saying, ""What could we do to make you feel better about the situation?""

, When you are discussing wearing diapers with your child, they are likely to be experiencing several different emotions. It's very common to feel frustration, anger, and embarrassment in this situation. Listen carefully to your child, and make sure they know that you are empathetic.If they feel embarrassment, try reassuring them that this is a very common problem. Reassure them that their emotions are valid and understandable. Say something such as, ""I understand how you feel. I've felt embarrassed at times in my life, too.""
It's important to let the youngster know that you're not putting them in diapers to punish or humiliate them.
Stress to the child or teenager that they only have to wear the diapers at night, and that the only people who know that they're wearing diapers are their family.

, There are several ways that you can demonstrate support through your words. Try making the conversation problem-oriented instead of person-oriented. This will help you address the issue without putting your child on the defensive.An example of a person-oriented statement is ""You have been wetting the bed too much."" This can make your child feel like he is somehow at fault. Instead, try a problem-oriented statement such as, ""Bedwetting can be very uncomfortable and disruptive for people who deal with it."" This supports your child be making it clear the problem is not on their shoulders alone.
Offer supportive statements such as ""It's great that you're willing to discuss this issue with me. I really appreciate that you're such a mature, honest kid.""

, Bedwetting is a problem if your child has previously been able to stay dry and has now regressed. Many experts agree that it is also considered a problem if your child is over the age of five and if the issue occurs more than twice a week. Your first step to finding a solution is to find the cause. Make an appointment with your child's doctor to discuss the problem.There are many common physical issues that can cause bedwetting. One of the most common is called delayed bladder maturation, in which your child's bladder as not developed as quickly as the rest of their body.
Your child might also suffer from having a low amount of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). This hormone prevents the body from producing urine. Studies show that children who have low levels of this hormone often wet the bed.
Other causes include small bladder capacity, birth defects, deep sleeping, and genetics.Ask your doctor to run some tests to determine the cause of the problem. Make sure that they clearly understand your concerns.

, If the lab results do not indicate a physical cause for the bedwetting, you may want to consider an emotional cause. Doctors say that if your child has previously gone six months or more without wetting the bed, the problem might be stress or anxiety. Start exploring underlying causes if you think your child is suffering from stress or anxiety.Consider whether your child has been through any major life changes recently. For example, as there been a move? A death in the family? A divorce? Any of these things could very likely cause stress or anxiety.
Try having some in-depth conversations with your child. You can ask some questions to let you try to determine if there are any issues that you are unaware of. Try saying something like, ""How's school going? I haven't heard you talk much about how you're liking your teachers lately."" Then you can use the information to try to figure out if your child is having some sort of emotional problem.

, Once you have figured out what is causing the bedwetting, you can begin to explore different treatment options. If the diagnosis is that there is a physical cause, there are different treatments that your doctor can suggest. Ask them to thoroughly explain options to you.Medication might be an option for your child. There are several drugs available to treat the underlying causes of bedwetting. Two of the most common are desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) and imipramine.Ask your doctor if these are right for your child.
If the causes are psychological, you might consider taking your child to a counselor. A mental health specialist can help your child deal with anxiety and depression.

, If your doctor agrees that diapers are the best solution, considering using a short-term rewards system to encourage the child to follow through. At the outset, let the child or teenager know that this is a temporary solution, just for use as they become accustomed to the diapers.


Consider saying something like this: “We know you feel a little embarrassed about this and we get how you feel, but we thought of an idea to make this fun. We're going to implement a reward system. By fulfilling your part of the deal, you'll not only earn a reward, but at the same time you'll be helping yourself.""
Have the child or teenager pick three things they really like. For instance, they might like video games, books, and toys, in that order. If they wear the diapers to bed 20 – 24 nights in a row, they would get a toy; if they wear them for 25 – 29 nights in a row they would get a book; and if they wore them to bed the whole month they would get a video game. The purpose of setting up the reward system along these lines is to gradually ease them into or get them comfortable with wearing the diapers.
Verbal encouragement is also an important part of the system. Offer praise, encouragement, and reassurance in the face of any setbacks. If the child is old enough, focus on the real end goal, rather than the temporary rewards: their long-term health, comfort, and hygiene. Say something like, ""We're really proud of you for being understanding enough to wear them. We know it's no fun but just keep in mind that people of all ages wear diapers for bedwetting, and it's much more comfortable wearing them rather than waking up in yucky wet PJs and bedding, right?""

, If they're able to, it's important they take care of their own hygiene, safely and independently at an age-appropriate level. A child should be taught how to do this at a young age so they don't feel embarrassed or ashamed about wearing the diapers. Unless the youngster has some cognitive and/or physical disability that prevents or makes it difficult for them to diaper themselves, they should be responsible for putting on and changing their own diapers.

, Your child's bedwetting is likely a very frustrating situation for both you and your child. You might find that you need some help in finding good ways to deal with the situation. If you're having trouble encouraging your child to wear a diaper, maybe there is someone who can help you have that difficult conversation.Is there a family member that your child has a great relationship with? If they are close to an aunt or uncle or cousin, try recruiting that person to help you have the conversation.
Talk to your friends and family members who have children. If they have experience with this type of situation, they can probably offer you some very helpful personal advice.

, They can be a good source to talk to people about various topics related to incontinence, from how to adjust to wearing bedwetting diapers to how to choose between different brands. Suggest to the youngster that they talk to people in a support group and ask them how they cope with wearing protection. If they're younger it would be a good idea to supervise them while online.

, Your doctor can be a great resource for you in this type of situation. Not only can they help you figure out the physical causes, but they can offer advice on how to talk about the problem with your child. Remember, your doctor has likely seen this situation before and can offer some great insight.Prepare for your visit to the doctor. Make a list of questions that you would like to have answered and check them off during your conversation. This will help you to remember all of the things you want to ask.

, Remember to be kind to yourself. You're going through a difficult situation, too. Try to surround yourself with people who have a positive effect on your life and can offer you support.Try talking to a close friend who you trust. Explain that you are going through a difficult issue with your child and that you need someone to talk to. Having a listening ear can really help ease the stress of the situation.

Ask the bedwetter how they feel about this.Talk to the bedwetter and tell them that you are considering getting the bedwetter's siblings to help out with washing their diapers and plastic pants.,
Realize that boys and girls develop at different times.,
Talk to the bedwetter's older sibling(s) and get a feel for how they would deal with this issue.,
Parents need to be aware of the possibility that an older child might be a bit reluctant to involve their older siblings in such a private matter.,
After talking to the siblings and the son or daughter with the bedwetting problem you can talk to everyone together as a group, that way everyone knows the ground rules - what's to be expected of the siblings doing the laundry, that there's to be no teasing of the bedwetter(s), where the bedwetter(s) is to place the wet diapers and plastic pants when they're ready to be laundered, etc.,
If the parents are going to wash the diapers and plastic pants all at once they'll need to purchase a diaper pail.",How to Involve Older Siblings With Laundering a Bedwetting Sibling's Diapers and Plastic Pants," Let them know that you are doing this because it will make doing the laundry easier.Many bedwetters are self-conscious about their bedwetting and the fact that they have to wear diapers and plastic pants to bed. Having an older sibling help out with laundering the diapers and plastic pants might be embarrassing,that's why it's important to put their mind at ease about the whole situation.;
, Studies show that girls tend to mature faster than boys and might be more mature about handling this type of situation. Also, the girl's maternal instinct tends to come into play, so they might be more sympathetic than a boy when it comes to helping out the parents with this chore. If the bedwetter is a boy, they might feel more comfortable with a girl dealing with this issue. On the other hand it could go the other way.My hunch is that a girl would be able to handle this in a more mature manner and be more empathetic about their brother or sister wearing diapers and plastic pants to manage their bedwetting. That being the case,this is just a rule of thumb and the parents have to gauge this based on their knowledge of the particular situation at hand.

, If you feel they would be able to do this chore in a responsible, adult manner, then by all means, get them to help out in some way. I would say something along these lines: “I wanted to talk to you guys (if there's more than one daughter helping out) about something. I know you've noticed me laundering plastic pants (or ""rubber pants"" as they're sometimes called - you may know them by that term) and cloth diapers, you've seen plastic pants hanging on the clothesline, as well as me folding diapers and plastic pants up and putting them in a laundry basket. Your brother has problems with bedwetting and he has to wear protection to bed. He uses pin-on cloth diapers covered with plastic pants to keep the bed dry. The reason I'm telling you this is because I would like you to help me with washing the diapers and plastic pants on the weekend. It would really help me out a lot if you'd pitch in with this. One of you can be responsible for laundering the diapers and plastic pants and one of you can hang the plastic pants on the clothesline to dry then fold the diapers and plastic pants up and put them in the laundry basket. Or we can have one person be responsible for both laundering the diapers and plastic pants as well as folding them up and putting them in the laundry basket. In this case all of you can take turns with this chore – one of you will be responsible for doing this one weekend, the next weekend someone else will take care of the wet garments, etc. I'll leave it up to you to decide amongst yourselves how you want to handle this. I'll show you how to launder them. This is a very delicate matter guys - he feels embarrassed about wearing diapers and plastic pants at his age so I want you all to be sensitive about his feelings. I want you to treat it like it's no big deal.” This is just an example of how you can approach the siblings. Obviously the dialog might need to be modified depending on how many people are involved in the chore, whether or not the bedwetter is a boy or girl, and if there's more than one bedwetter.

, The older the bedwetter is the more embarrassed they might feel about this. A 12 year old that wets the bed and needs to wear pin-on cloth diapers covered by plastic pants might be more reluctant to have their older siblings take care of the diapers and plastic pants as opposed to a five year old.This is not say that parents should not involve older siblings with helping out in laundering an older bedwetter's diapers and plastic pants, just that they need to be sensitive to the older child's feelings.If the bedwetter is embarrassed about their older sibling or siblings being involved in this situation the parent or parents can say something along these lines: ""You shouldn't be ashamed about your older sibling(s) taking care of your wet clothing. They just want to help mom(or dad) out. I've talked to them about the whole situation and I think that they'll be able to handle this in a mature and thoughtful manner. Also,I've let them know that I will not tolerate any teasing about you wearing the diapers and plastic pants.""

, This might make the bedwetter(s) feel more at ease as well because he or she knows what to expect., On the day the diapers and plastic pants are to be laundered, have the bedwetter bring the diaper pail to the sibling or siblings who are going to be responsible for taking care of them. Another option is to tell the bedwetter and the siblings that there will be a designated place set up in the laundry room for the bedwetter to put the diaper pail.

Note if diapers interfere with relationships.,
Monitor your behaviors.,
Examine how the diapers make you feel.,
Be honest if you isolate yourself by wearing diapers.,
Reach out for help.,

Be proud.",How to Know if You've Become Addicted to Wearing Diapers (As an Adult)," You may find yourself continuously thinking about diapers and wearing diapers. If you think about diapers and diaper wearing constantly in a way that interferes with daily living, it may signal a problem. Persistent thoughts about obtaining a certain thing can be a marker of addiction.You may struggle to get things done because you are thinking about diapers. Has your work productivity declined, or are you finding it harder to get things done around the house?
You may find your thoughts getting off track due to thinking about diapers or diaper wearing.;
, If you struggle to engage in normal, functional behavior (such as getting up, going to work, buying groceries, and cleaning) because of your diaper wearing, this also may be a problem.


Interfering behaviors can be emotionally painful, and it’s important to regain control of behaviors before they spiral out of control., If you’ve had difficulty relating to people due to your diaper usage, this may be a problem. You may struggle with family or your partner because of diaper use, yet still use diapers despite the problems they cause in your social life. When habits or lifestyles interfere with social functioning, yet you still continue to engage despite the problems they cause, it can indicate an addiction.Reflect whether you’ve experienced relationship decline since using diapers regularly. Think about whether your relationships with friends, family, co-workers, and partner have suffered.
Declining relationships may be limited or no contact, more tension, or difficulty relating.

, If you’ve noticed that your behaviors have changed since starting to wear diapers, reflect on their impact on your life. If you’ve noticed that you cannot go without diapers, spend a lot of time in diaper-related activities that detract from daily functioning, and have limited interests due to your diaper fascination, this can be behavioral markers of addiction.You may try to cut back on diaper usage, but find yourself unable to limit your diaper usage.
You may continue to use diapers even when negative outcomes are likely, such as not having enough money to sustain the diapers each week. You may even try to stop wearing diapers altogether and find it too difficult., If they make you happy and are a satisfying part of your (or you and your partner's) environment there is nothing to fear. Should they make you feel sad, socially isolated or depressed, consider changing your use. If you’ve developed a dysfunctional emotional response to diaper wearing, this may mark a degree of addiction. Examples of dysfunctional responses may include feeling extremely anxious when you run out of diapers or when in situations you cannot wear one, running to diapers as the only thing to soothe you, or feeling emotionally dependent on wearing diapers.Think about the way diapers make you feel, both before you wear one and while you wear one. Ask yourself if you have any negative feelings about wearing diapers.

, Wearing diapers at home may create a sense of safety in the home, and a feeling of fear if you leave the home. If you tend to shy away from leaving the house because you are wearing diapers, consider only wearing them in the privacy of your own home.


Isolation begets more isolation, to the point where social interaction can become awkward and uncomfortable. Before getting to that point, make sure you have plans to be with other people regularly.Create a schedule for when you wear diapers and when you do not. Don’t let diaper wearing interfere with you living your life and making time for friends and family.

, If you struggle with your relationship to diapers or want to change your diaper habits, talking to a therapist can be helpful. A therapist can help you understand a work through the emotions associated with wearing a diaper.


You can begin moving away from diaper wearing altogether or work on creating a more healthy relationship with diaper wearing if you struggle to balance a healthy life with wearing diapers.
Seeing a therapist can help with any conflicted feelings you have about having a fetish or telling a partner., Obsessive thoughts about anything can interfere with daily living and social circles. Don’t let the thoughts take over; instead, learn to challenge them.When you find your thoughts distracted by wearing diapers, get back on track. As soon as you acknowledge your wandering thoughts, get back to whatever business is in front of you.
Practice focused attention meditation. Keep your attention on one object, such as your breath, a photo, or a flower. You’ll find your mind wandering, and when it does, bring it back. With practice, this meditation can help you navigate your thoughts and increase your overall focus.If you find your thoughts always on diaper wearing and you can’t seem to refocus, take a break. Get up and drink some water, have something to eat, or take a walk., Perhaps you are choosing to cut down on wearing diapers for personal, environmental, or cost-related reasons. You can choose to wear diapers only at home, only to bed, or only in sexual roles. If you are concerned about how wearing diapers may affect you personally or professionally, keeping the diapers at home will lead to less worries about diapers affecting your social and work life.


If you are cutting down on your use, be realistic, both financially and emotionally. Create a plan for when you will wear diapers and how often you will wear and replace them.

, To keep a balanced life consider the economics of wearing diapers. You can determine when to use a diaper (all day, only at home, only at night) and how to use it (for sexual foreplay, for leisure, to wet). Wetting the diaper will result in the use of 3-5 diapers depending on thickness, wetness at change and consumption of liquids.

, If you want to cut down on diaper usage, use the toilet for all elimination. This will cut down on costs and consumption of materials. Using the toilet will also make you appear ‘normal’ at work or at social functions if you are concerned that people will discover your diaper wearing.


Limit the use of diapers to wetting or just staying dry will limit the negative feedback or embarrassing moments. Consider that other people will be bothered by a smelly diaper.
If you and your partner enjoy a dirty diaper as a fetish, practice this at home and not in public. Be considerate of other people when wearing diapers in public. While the experience may be pleasant for you, it may be unpleasant for those around you.

, Even if you choose to cut back on your diaper wearing, it’s important not to feel ashamed to wear diapers. If it is your (and possibly your partner's) choice to wear diapers, be proud of it. While you should not intrude on other people's personal space with your diaper choice, there is no need to be ashamed. Enjoy it as part of your life.

Take a multivitamin.,
Take insulin.,
Do not take herbs or supplements without consulting with your doctor.",How to Manage Gestational Diabetes Without Medication2," You may need to take a multivitamin with minerals, especially iron, because the demands of pregnancy may require more vitamins and minerals than diet alone can provide. Low Vitamin D levels may be associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes.Have yourself checked for Vitamin D levels and take supplementation if you are deficient. 1000 to 2000 IU a day of Vitamin D have been safely used in pregnant women., Insulin is a natural hormone replacement treatment and is a widely used natural treatment. It may be necessary to take the insulin by injection in order to force the glucose into the cells. Your physician will guide you as to how much insulin to take and how to take it.


Never take insulin without consulting with your doctor., There are some herbs and supplements that are safe during pregnancy to help control blood sugars. Always ask your doctor before taking any herbs, even if the packaging says they are safe. This is because many herbs have not been tested for safety during pregnancy. Bitter melon, also known as Momordica charantia, is often recommended for diabetes control, but has been associated with miscarriages and induced abortions in animals, so it should be avoided.Gurmar, also known as Gymnema sylvestre, and Prickly-pear cactus, also known as Opuntia spp, have not been tested in pregnancy, though Gymnema is safe when used for up to 20 months and Opuntia has been used for centuries as food.
Gymnema is generally taken in doses of 200 mg twice a day and Opuntia can be taken as a single dose, 400 mg once a day. If you use either Gymnema or Opuntia, talk to your healthcare professional first for recommendations."

Understand insulin resistance.,
Be aware of the effects.,
Recognize the symptoms.,
Diagnose gestational diabetes.,
Know if you're at risk.",How to Manage Gestational Diabetes Without Medication3," While it is not clear what causes gestational diabetes, some pregnant women develop insulin resistance, which means that the cells in their body do not respond to insulin normally. Every cell in our body uses glucose (sugar) for producing the energy needed for the cells to do their jobs. The glucose is derived from the foods you eat, primarily from carbohydrates. Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, is the main chemical messenger that tells the cells that it is time to take up glucose.Insulin is also involved in messaging the liver to take up glucose and transform it into the storage form of glucose known as glycogen.


Insulin is also involved in a wide range of other functions like protein and fat metabolism.
If the cells become insulin resistant, they ignore or can’t respond to the signal from insulin. This can increase the levels of glucose in the blood. When this happens, the pancreas responds by producing even more insulin. The problem is that since the insulin has no effect on the insulin-resistant cells, the blood glucose levels can keep rising. The body’s response is to convert the high levels of glucose in the blood into fat, and that can set up a scenario of chronic inflammation and other disorders like full blown Type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome and heart disease. , During pregnancy, if insulin resistance is not properly controlled, you can develop gestational diabetes. It can have a number of effects on your and your baby's body. The main effect on the baby of uncontrolled gestational diabetes is increased fat in the blood stream, which leads to increased birth weight. These babies are also at higher risk for difficult deliveries due to the size, breathing problems, obesity, lower than normal blood sugars and, as adults, Type 2 diabetes.


The mom is at higher risk for cesarean section, Type 2 diabetes after pregnancy, and high blood pressure before and after delivery., Often, there are no symptoms of gestational diabetes, which most often begins about halfway through the pregnancy. This can make it hard to look for. However, when symptoms do occur, they can include many of the same symptoms of Type 2 diabetes. These symptoms include:


Impaired vision due to blurriness or other issues
General tiredness
Increased infections along the skin and in the bladder and vagina
Nausea and vomiting through the duration of the pregnancy
Increased appetite that can be accompanied by weight loss
Frequent urination
Increased thirst., To test for gestational diabetes, your physician will order blood tests to test for blood sugar levels. He or she will also order a glucose tolerance test to determine how well your body is dealing with sugars. Your baby can be monitored as well to determine if his size is normal for his gestational age, which is usually done by ultrasound, and to test the baby’s heart rate by using a fetal monitor., You can be at risk for gestational diabetes if you have had gestational diabetes during previous pregnancies or have already had a baby that weighed more than 9 pounds at birth. You are also at risk if you are overweight or if you have a parent, brother, or sister with type 2 diabetes.You are also more at risk if, before you are pregnant, you were diagnosed with prediabetes, a metabolic syndrome, or insulin resistance. Metabolic syndromes are a group of issues that include high or increased blood pressure, belly and waist excess weight, higher than normal blood sugar levels, and high or risky cholesterol levels.If you are African American, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic/Latina, or Pacific Islander American, you are also at an increased risk.
Other syndromes can also put you at risk. If you have a type of hormonal disorder called polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), you are more likely to have gestational diabetes. PCOS is a condition where a woman’s ovaries contain numerous cysts, which leads to fertility and menstrual problems."

Redirect from any further conversations about diapering.",How to Determine if You Should Diaper a Young School‐Age Child Again (If They Asked You To)," Seriously, how long would it really take you to change the child's diaper again on a child that was once diapered continuously? It will be no longer now than it was once before.


If your child just wants to be briefly placed back in diapers, you may be able to deal with the change to diapers for a day and then move on back again to the normal regimen in a matter of days. The upside of this move may be that it allows the child to feel supported in their choices and to move quickly through this phase, without a power struggle.;
, Even if they have the same feeling as you, you should feel the sense that your partner can stand by your side and help you in supporting your decision.


It's also a good idea to consult your child's physician and make sure there are no medical implications involved in the child wearing diapers again.

, Realize that your child asking to be diapered again may very well just be a ""phase"", and diapering may need to be done for only a short period of time (lasting between a few days to a week or two). Most children will later recognize that they enjoyed the great feeling it was not to feel all wet and icky all the time or remember what it was like when mom and pop didn't have to embarrass them into getting their diaper changed, and want to rid themselves once again.Be careful if the child lets this ""phase"" go beyond a week or so; it's an awful addicting thing that some children don't even realize they are doing.


Allowing a child who is originally potty-trained to wear a diaper again for long periods of time may irreversibly change the child's attitude to the use of the toilet. Don't let this phase linger onwards for too long.

, Don't talk to your child in the same baby-like talk you would give to an infant, but explain to them (with age-appropriate language) that they are loved no matter if they are diapered or not. Give them a hug and kiss, and even a gentle caress in your loving arms might be all very well what it might take to convince them not to transition backwards to a period where they are again diapered.


With all the giggling and smiling and twisting and turning going on, it'll all be worth it in the end, Them asking for diapers sometimes is just a plea for parental attention, and your hug may be all that it takes to prove to them that they've received your undivided attention and not want them to return to diapers.

, Listen to hear exactly what they have to say, and see if they have any convincing reasons to be in diapers. Be supportive of their opinions, but avoid making promises you would not willing to keep; this is their chance to talk and explain their decision to you. Make sure to explain your reasoning for why you can or can't diaper them, trying to rebut every point they just made.

, Especially in older children (who may or may not be telling you the complete truth), bedwetting may be occurring. If the child bedwets (due to stress or peer-related issues or some other psychological factor), they sometimes wet the bed because of stress, peer-related issues (like bullying), or other psychosocial factors. Consider whether your child may be worried about the possibility of bedwetting.


Keep an open ear, if they make any notion that they are bedwetting. Bedwetting is 100% treatable, and bedwetting diapers could help assist while waiting for a doctors appointment for the child. Change them into diapers only during the nighttime hours (starting at about sundown) and don't change them back until the next morning when the child awakens.
For temporary measures, if this is a nighttime problem, let them go around in diapers for that night only!


,, You'll need the same supplies you needed when they were babies: diapers (of the appropriate size), diaper rash cream, wipes, etc.


Plan on allowing them to wear heavier-weight diapers at night and even throughout the main course of the day. Let them keep a complete pack of diapers in their backpack and refill them as they come close to being emptied.
Some children allow their diaper stacks to run out quicker than others, so if you find them going beyond having to add back more every single day, you will know they are abusing the privilege.

, Show them how to loosen, remove, and later re-assemble their new diaper's diaper-tapes. Only when you feel they are ready to maintain this task on their own, should you feel they will be able to keep up in their diapering duties.


Make sure that they realize that they should only do this in a restroom, and to make sure no one else can see them bringing some of their diapers into the stall with them.

, Even cleanup and placing their diapers into the trash can and disposing of any soiled baby wet wipes, must be observed by the child, and can show them that it's a lot of hard work to be diapered again at their slightly older age.


Be open about the consequences of diapering again. Let them run into a mild diaper rash and explain to them how the rash relates to them wearing the diaper again (and prepare the ""fix"" for the rash). Be supportive in your explanation, and have them apply the diaper rash cream to the affected area.

, The school nurse might have a convincing plan in place to allow diapering to take place inside their restroom or in a darkened area when no other children are present; however, let the nurse tell you of their specific plan in relation to when this event happens.


If the nurse asks you if you have any appointments coming up with the child's doctor, tell them that you think the child is just going through ""a phase"" that could soon go away given the child has ample amount of time to grow out of the phase.

, Inform them that your child is going through ""a phase"" that may seem odd to them. Make sure they realize that the child may have to leave class occasionally to go to the nurse or private changing room in the restrooms to change their diaper.

, Realize that this phase will most-often be short and will eventually break away, so support them and love them through this part of their life. Only you can help your child conquer this ""phase"" without its latter ill-effects.

, If they still find themselves enjoying every diaper-change that you help them with, you'll need to act to remove the addicting diapers from the child and make them unenjoyable.


Explain to the child that the diaper budget will not allow you to buy diapers for them anymore after a period of a few days (no more than 2-3 weeks), and if the child doesn't stop, they will be stopped immediately when they notice there are no more diapers in stock and have to run around everywhere without something on their body (even to the local area markets) (but be prepared to bring along a pair or two of undies for the child- as most then decide to give up the diapers).
Prepare to potty-train the child for a day or two and potty-train at night for a night, as most children lose sight of how to use the toilet after being successfully potty trained.
Most children will break out of the phase alone, but monitor the situation closely as soon as you find that you've had to tell the child that their diaper budget has been expended.
Helping to keep the child in school during school hours can sometimes deter the children from wearing diapers. As they see that their schoolmates aren't using them anymore, your child may also lose interest in their diapers.
If they don't stop with little help, consider talking to them on a weekly basis, to see if they still feel the same way as they once did when they chose to ask you to diaper them again. Give the idea a total of two weeks before seeing your pediatrician for advice on where to go from here. Continue to hug them and give them the positive encouragement they always require to break them of this habit.

, Pick a time when you can have a proper talk.

, Ask them why they feel the need to be diapered once again. Keep up with the discussion, and thoroughly listen to their answers. Help them compile a list of things you and them can do alone to improve the feeling of being diapered again rather than result back to the use of diapers. Not providing a good enough/any solution to each and every bullet they help list can result back to the use of diapers on your child. Help them thoroughly think through each issue and why the new solution might be better than to go back into diapering them.


If your child is afraid of wetting the bed, talk through other solutions, like using plastic bed sheets (to help minimize the mess) or absorbent underwear (to help deal with minor accidents)to minimize mess, Reassure the child that bedwetting is okay and will pass soon; try your best to help them avoid embarrassment over it and help decide on actions (other than diapering) that will help.
If your child is fascinated with a younger sibling or friend's diapering, talk them through why babies need diapers and why they, as the older child, shouldn't need to be anymore. Explain to them that their sibling or friend used to have diapers too, but now enjoys a whole range of skills and perks that come with aging. Draw a connection between the fun things that the child can now do - like playing with friends, going to school, and going on field trips - and being a big kid who wears underwear.

, If your child is focused on the idea of being a baby again, brainstorm other ways to get this need met. You can play ""house"" with the child, (taking turns to be a parent or baby) or do regular activities to provide quality bonding time with the child (as the child will get one-on-one attention with each parent). Suggest the various options to your child, and make them sound way-more fun than being diapered again.

, Don't emphasize the embarrassment in an attempt to shame the use of diapers, but don't also hide the fact that diapering might lead to awkward encounters at school. Make sure your child has thought through what they would do if any peers figure out they are wearing diapers again. Be kind and supportive in your decision, but help your child consider the potential social ramifications of wearing diapers as a school-aged child. This discussion and thought process to this may put them off the idea, by this time anyway.

, If your talk has given light to options that might give the child the same feeling they're seeking without diapering, now is the time to focus on those.


Make a game-plan to deal with bedwetting or accidents, and let your child be part of the planning.
Emphasize the benefits of being a big kid who doesn't make it routine to wear diapers again; encourage them to feel accomplished and grown up in all things they do. Reward and reinforce ""big kid"" behavior across the board, not just when it comes to toilet use. Provide lots of encouragement when the child participates in age-appropriate activities.

, Give them lots of hugs and kisses throughout each day. Express empathy for their reasoning, as you hear them out. Make sure they feel heard and supported. (Especially shortly before the next step, should you complete this step, as most children won't connect the two together and the love will help bridge the gap and prevent them from hysterically crying ""My parents don't love me anymore!"")

, Although most parents choose explanations that focus on aging/development and health concerns, there are a variety of reasons why it may be ill-advised to diaper the child once again. Be age-appropriate in your decision but straight with the child about it; if you're not going to do it, don't make promises that you won't keep. Be supportive but clear.

, Look for all opportunities to bond and be positive with your child.

, Don't be punitive or tell them to stop asking the same question endlessly, but do steer your child towards a more appropriate - and even more highly preferred - topic or activity when it comes up. Then make whatever you do next - fun and exciting - as this will reinforce their switch away from the discussion of diapering and onto the next ""fun"" thing you plan on doing with them.

Don't make the child feel too embarrassed when you need to talk to them about having them wear a diaper again.,

Explain to them that no matter what happens with you when you first put them into their first diaper, that doing so won't make you stop loving them or make you love them even more or less.,
Make their diapers the only thing from their Big Kid stage that they'd want to remember about their early childhood, however, don't loose sight of their ""big kid abilities"" and use baby words in babyish tones your Big Kid could accept (in hopes that they'll want to accept the diapers any more as something more soothing) to make them accept the diapers more now than ever before.,
Have the child express whether or not they want to wear diapers at any time they'd like to talk - even if that means at that immediate time or anytime in the near future.,
Explain - with a new diaper in hand - the new diaper-changing routine to them, so they understand what they may expect when they are wearing their diaper.,

Explain that if they keep moving around, their diaper changes will last much longer, and that this may hinder their times to becoming the ""Big Kid"" they'd want to expect to become.

,
Make the diapers readily available in a nearby room where most of the child's dressing will be done.,
Prepare an area that you could use that is big enough for both you and your child when your child needs their diaper changed and where there could be little to no fuss yet secure enough for others not to notice their need to wear these diapers.",How to Encourage Big Kids to Wear Diapers," If you walk up and down the aisles of most supermarkets, you'll also find alternatives in most of the hygiene aisles that your child could want to use. Most often times, these diapers are considered to be adult-sized replicas of the types of diapers they once used when they were children. Some adult diaper companies often offer pull-up styled diapers that you can buy that can sometimes be enough to persuade your ""big kid"" into wearing diapers once again.


Most big kids will be resistant to diapers with a graphic. Even if it's just needing to find one that doesn't have the standardized graphic on the front of the diaper, adult diapers will tend to cross over and not provide this graphic, but may provide an easy and visual colored-line on the diaper to indicate when it has been wet by the wearer. Whether the diaper is a pull-up style or to those with tabs in the disposable adult line of diapers to slip into pads that go right in their underwear, there is some type of diaper for every person. It's likely that you'll find something that the Big Kid will want to use for their diaper-wearing need.;
, Although baby-sized cloth diapers are available at almost every retailer offline, adult cloth diapers (sometimes providing the bigger fit the Big Kid might need) are always available at some online-only retailers. While adult cloth diapers aren't generally found at most supermarkets, some baby sized ones might fit your ""big kid"" still, and may be just the replacement that you ""big kid"" might want or need to use.


If your child doesn't like the sound that disposable diapers make when you change him/her or is crinkling when they move around in public or the gel in the disposable diapers is reacting to cause more severe rashes on them, cloth diapering may be the better fit for both of you to attempt. Cloth diapers don't crinkle when the child moves around - so little to no sounds are made and it's an all-around great solution to use.
Make cloth diaper changes seem easy on both of you. Look for pinless cloth diapers where the Big Kid doesn't need to operate a diaper pin to change, if convenience during changes is necessary and you can allow the kid to help with their diaper-changes. Most of these adult cloth diapers can be found online that can get attached with a Velcro strip and tab system - or as slip-in diaper pants. However, the big burden comes in the price you'll pay for the product as well as the shipping price from the outside company and most often the additional bank fees for paying to a merchant outside of your home country.
If the Big Kid needs to be diapered you can just buy square cloth diapers but these need folding. There are many different ways to fold a diaper but only a few are suitable for Big Kids.
If you decide to let your child wear cloth diapers remember to buy plastic pants too. Plastic pants are required for cloth diapers and comes in different styles and colors. Make sure to buy plastic pants with sufficient room for the diaper.

, Yes, although you'll probably think that bedwetting only runs in kids older than 4 years old, Goodnites are designed to be a disposable product that can be a cross-over styled diaper that provides convenience while making the diaper seem to be kid-friendly. When they first go on, they are designed to be pulled up fairly rapidly (with a pull-on styled design) (which can be a big plus to those parents) while changes don't take all that long and can easily be ripped off for easier removal, and yet provide absorbency at rates that sure trump the baby-styles tabbed disposable diapers in the area your kids will need it most (having been focused on nighttime diapers when parents might not have checked in on their kids all that often). It's easy to overlook the fact that even kids of up to 11 or 12 can still fit into these sizes of diapers as they are made to help those who weigh between 38 and 125 pounds independent of the gender of the child, and exact type of Goodnites diaper you choose.

, Have them come to you at any time and talk. If you need to, and if your child wants to talk to you in private, these matters should be taken care of promptly and in a manner both of you can discuss comfortably so as not to inform others of their thoughts and situations.

, Most Big Kids will be naturally resistant and open to change to revert back to diapers (as opposed to big kid pants or underwear), but once you explain that wearing diapers have a positive effect on their lives, this can most often make them feel ready again to wear their diapers. Make their Big Kid diapers become a part of their natural flow of the routine during both the day and night, all while still not making onlookers think something weird is going on with this Big Kid. Make this routine seem like a ""normal"" part of the child's daily routine and part of normal aging to the child and any of his or her caregivers.

, Although most often you can mention that their diaper is their own private bathroom they can use at any time is always available when other bathrooms aren't always available for use, they must be able to realize that this will come at a cost of having you check in and diaper them on a set routine again, all at which point you can talk to them and ""cross"" into once the Big Kid runs into that predicament in life. Have several reasons (besides this one) available to explain to them why using diapers are easier on them. Express to them that just because they have been put into diapers now, doesn't mean they'll be treated like an infant.

, Whether it's to help cure a temporary sign of potty-training weakness or a short case of the flu that you don't want to worry about as much, or something else, open up your mouth and explain this reason to the kid in words they will understand. Talk to them about your viewpoints about having them wear diapers.

, This talk may take a little while, and even if the parent has to use a little more parental force to make them understand and accept the consequences of wearing one, the fact that you must impart a feeling of yourself caring for your child, may mean a world of difference to the child in the end. Make sure they can accept that diapers can provide for better usability when times get tough or the bathroom is out of commission or for some other reason that makes using the alternative (of needing the bathroom) a bad idea to them.


Have the Big Kid accept that wearing diapers will mean making less trips to the bathroom (especially those that are in public areas where they could be scared or during the middle of the night when there are little to no lights to light their way to the bathroom), but wearing diapers will also mean the cold and clammy feeling that they once felt when wearing them as an infant - all of which can be taken care of promptly when they come to you and ask for a diaper-change or when you come to check in on them. Let them still roam the house as they naturally would, but offer them the ability to use their diapers in place of using the bathroom. Don't shudder out the use of the toilets all together, but try not to encourage the use of the toilet.

, Make sure they can privately come to you at any time and have you help them with the diaper-dressing needs including having you help them with their diaper change or having you help them solve the pain of an irritating diaper rash on their skin in their diaper area. It's pertinent however, that they can accept your full-fledged faith and encouragement to help them keep from feeling babyish and to evaluate how others can help them when they need the most help to solve out the problem, all while building up confidence in themselves for being able to ask and accept help when they request it. The Big Kid might cry to get your attention but you must encourage them never to cry to get your attention and that they can walk (if they are mobile) up to you to get your help to get the job done quickly and painlessly as possible.

, Tell them that hugs and kisses might be given with praise for jobs well done in other areas and for achieving other important goals in their diaper-wearing time, but their treatment will be carried out the same between now and how it was dealt with before. Make the treatment the same as how you've always tackled diaper-changes when they mere babies, infants and toddler-children.


If they are too weighty to be caressed after being lifted and hoisted into your arms, you may need to kneel down to their eye level and give them your ultimate affection, hugging them from the changing surface while changing their diaper instead of injuring your back and they should accept that they can't be hugged the same way as when they were infants.

, However, nor should you use too adult-like words to make them not like to wear diapers any less. Make them realize that, through your visual cues during this diapering phase, these diapers will mean that it's still okay for them to wear their diapers despite some of them being potty-trained before.

, Give them their own chances to express their views on the use of diapers now. Although some Big Kids will be resistant to change and will want to wear Big Kid underwear at all times, there will be others who will want to be adventurous once again and try out diapers for a second time in their life.


Make the child open up and express their viewpoints on why diapers might or might not be the proper way to deal with the situation at their age level. Make sure you can receive, justify and accept their reasoning.

, If you need to, try to show them with the proper tools and perform the initial change into their diaper for the first time. Show them just how long a diaper-change can take if they don't hinder the process by squirming around and show them what good cooperation can get them during these changes. Tell them exactly how they can cooperate during the diaper-change for example by lifting their legs as much as they can to give you access to the diaper area during the cleaning up or to lay still. Expect to incorporate answers to their questions into the conversation along with some ins and outs of their diaper-usage. Explain what you intend to do next, and how you plan on checking in on them when they are wearing their diaper.

,


If you don't want them forgetting how to use the bathroom (if they have been previously potty-trained), expect to allow them to make trips occasionally to the bathroom, but you might want to have your children deal with using their diapers more at night (but that must be up to you to decide).

,, Keep them out of sight of their siblings and relatives children who come to visit and that only the child who will need the diaper can oversee their use. Most often located in the child's room, put them where the child can reach. If the children are still able to fit on a diaper-changing table, you can put them on a lower shelf for them to grab when they need to bring one to you for their diaper-routine.


Make sure that there is a trash can for the dirty diapers which have been soiled in some way, along with a pile of clean clothes and a pile of unused diapers that can be taken from at any hour of the day, yet stashed into a discrete area where only certain family members know about them.
A diaper-changing table can be a good solution also for a ""big kid"" as it will give you the best working position to change your child's diaper. However it can be difficult to find a changing table large enough for children above 4 years in baby stores - but it is easy to make one yourself. Just use a stable office table and buy a foam pad covered in soft strong vinyl or waterproof table cloth.

, Spots on a carpeted floor in their bedroom or a spot out of sight of other visitors can provide spots that could be used to provide privacy, security and self-respect to the diaper-wearer to discretely have their diapers changed.


Don't let the feeling of not locking the bathroom door due to their use of the diapers ever stop you from closing the bathroom door. If they need to use the toilet, they may enter after knocking, and if someone says that someone is in the room - let ask them either hold it or use the diaper instead.

Don't be uncomfortable with the babysitters.,
Be sure all of the appropriate laundry is clean, so it isn't laying around.,
Keep in mind that bed-wetting is a common problem and that most babysitters realize this and most should be mature enough to make the child feel at ease about this.,
Know how to deal with nannies.",How to Discreetly Wear Diapers for Bedwetting (for Your Babysitter)," If your parents decide to use diapers to manage an older child's bed-wetting and they occasionally use a babysitter the child might feel anxious about this. You're older, so the babysitter should never find out. However if the child is older, there is no reason for them to worry about this because older children can handle diapering themselves.;
,


If the parents use pin-on cloth diapers covered with plastic pants for their bed-wetting child they can make sure the diapers and plastic pants are laundered beforehand. That way the babysitter won't see the plastic pants hanging on the clothesline which could embarrass the child. Also the babysitter won't have to bring the diapers and plastic pants to the child before they go to bed. There may be situations when the diapers are in the process of being laundered-for instance the diapers might not be finished drying or the plastic pants may still be drying on the clothesline.
In a situation such as that the babysitter might have to take the diapers and plastic pants to the child when they're finished drying.
If the parents feel that the babysitter would be able to deal with this in a mature manner, then the parents can let them know that the child has to wear diapers and plastic pants to bed and ask them if they would mind bringing these items to him or her before going to bed. Or the parents can let the child get the diapers when they're dry if the child feels uncomfortable about the babysitter getting involved in this. This is just one scenario that the parents might have to contend with.

, That being said the parents should take steps to assure that the child is able to maintain discretion in this matter should that be necessary.

, Many parents hire au pairs to watch their kids and they should be experienced in this manner. The parents could talk to the agency about this beforehand and let them know that they have a child or children that wet the bed and that the nanny will be responsible for taking care of cloth diapers and plastic pants (if the parents decide to have the bed-wetter wear cloth diapers). It may not be necessary to go into this much detail with the agency; you'll have to play it by ear.

Search for a camp that works with disabled campers, especially those who are bed-wetters.,
Confirm the camp arrangements.,
Be clever in how you tell the child that bedwets how to approach the situation from here, while they are at camp.,
Make sure the children know how to change their own diapers as they encounter them; both when they are wet and when they are soiled and wet and when they are not.,
Consider asking the child to wear a disposable diaper to their camping gear as opposed to cloth.Having to feel as if you've wet your sleeping bag in the middle of the night, is completely unpleasant and may make the other children in the tent/bunk feel uncomfortable.,
Have your child place the used diapers directly into a plastic bag which can be taken on different camp outings.

,
Let the bedwetting camper seek support.,
Pack the child's backpack well.,
Mention to the child that a few diapers should be reserved only to be used in an emergency and that you'll pack them in a bag and stick them elsewhere in the bag.

",How to Discreetly Wear Diapers for Bedwetting as a Camper," Camp Kirk and Camp Brandon are two camps that have staff equipped to deal with these problems. If you do a Google search you may be able to come up with others.;
, The parents should check with the staff and ask them what type of arrangements are made for youth that wet the bed and may have to wear diapers to bed.

, The children may feel intimidated if you tell them out in the open when others are around. If you take them aside into an enclosed room and tell them, they might not be as intimidated as if you didn't tell them at all.

, Make sure they can decipher a wet diaper from a dirty diaper, and also from sweaty-wet diaper to completely unused.

,


Changing a cloth diaper isn't feasible for a child of any age to complete successfully,, especially alone at night. Besides the smell of urine from the bedwetter's diaper, the fact that most disposables can hold a bit more fluid, can help make your child believe they can hold onto their wet diaper further until morning (and they can continue peeing in it) and thereby helping alleviate the uncomfortable feeling of having to be seen walking past to head to change it in separate secluded area.

,, Incontinence forums are a good place to get suggestions about the many issues surrounding incontinence at camp and how to be discreet about dealing with the problem.

, Not only should they contain at least one or more packs of diapers, they should also contain ways to not show off that they are holding onto other packages of diapers. Pack them into the bag in layers. Cover them in plastic bags (with the plastic bag bottom showing outwards towards the other kids (should the other kids decide they'd like to look into the bag when the bedwetting child isn't looking)).

Know the symptoms of hypoglycemia.",How to Manage Juvenile Diabetes," For most diabetics, physicians recommend insulin combinations containing types of insulin with different durations of action. In practice, this usually means that a combination of long-acting and rapid-acting insulin is considered safe and most appropriate. Rapid-acting insulin is given before meals to counter the rise of blood glucose after eating and longer-acting insulin is given later on to maintain normal glucose levels and prevent hyperglycemia.There are four classifications of insulin, all depending on the duration of action: rapid, short, intermediate and long-acting. Glulisine, lispro, and aspart insulin are rapid-acting, regular insulin; a preparation of zinc solution is short-acting; neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) is intermediate-acting; glargine and detemir are long-acting insulins.
Insulin is available in various combinations and dosages commercially. Your doctor will prescribe the right insulin therapy based on your particular condition.
There are several different brands for each type of insulin, such as Humalog, Novolin, and Lantus.;
, Currently, there are four options:



Split or twice-daily regimen: This includes 2/3 of daily your insulin requirement administered before breakfast and 1/3 before supper. NPH with rapid or short-acting insulin is generally used according to individualized dose calculations.

Split or mixed variant: This involves NPH and rapid or short-acting insulin before breakfast, followed by rapid or short-acting insulin before supper, and plain NPH before bedtime. This regimen prevents early morning and nighttime hypoglycemic episodes.

Multiple daily injections or (MDI): This includes one or two daily doses of long-acting insulin such as detemir or glargine in addition to rapid-acting insulin before meals, adjusted according to the carbohydrate intake during every meal and then blood glucose levels after eating.

Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII): This involves a continuous infusion of rapid-acting insulin through a battery-operated insulin pump over 24 hours at varied rates and insulin boluses before each meal. Additional doses may be required if blood glucose levels are higher than desired. These pumps are very convenient; they can be paused up to an hour or re-programmed as required. Patients themselves can easily adjust the insulin dose according to the carbohydrate content of the meal and their caloric intake.

, While taking insulin you are always at risk of developing the following complications:



Hypoglycemia - Trouble starts when the blood glucose falls below 54mg/dl. At this level, you may feel palpitations, an increase in heart rate, nausea, vomiting, excessive sweating and trembling. If these symptoms are ignored and blood glucose falls below 50mg/dl, you'll likely experience excessive tiredness, headache, difficulty in speech, irritability and confusion. Further decline can lead to unconsciousness and seizure. Insulin-dependent individuals should carry some glucose or juice with them since even 15 gm of glucose can neutralize the hypoglycemia and make you feel better.

Insulin allergy - This may range from pale red rash at the injection site to a hypersensitive life-threatening reaction called anaphylaxis (though this is quite rare). Allergic reactions are more common with human insulin, the name given to the synthetic insulin grown in a laboratory to mimic the insulin in humans; usually these reactions can be easily managed with antihistaminic drugs or corticosteroids.

Insulin resistance - Since the advent of highly purified varieties of insulin, this condition is rare. In the past, antibodies could form against the insulin, making it resistant and, as a result, heavier doses in higher increments were required.

, Juvenile diabetics need insulin injections or can take insulin via a pump; oral medicines are not an option. Self-monitoring of blood glucose levels along with multiple injections of insulin (to balance hyperglycemia) is mandatory for the effective day-to-day management of diabetes.For the injections, you'll use a fine needle and syringe or, alternatively, an insulin pen to inject the drug beneath the skin. Needles come in a variety of sizes so you can choose what size is most suitable and comfortable for you.
For an insulin pump, you wear a device about the size of a cellphone on the outside of your body. A tube connects the insulin to a catheter inserted beneath the skin of your stomach. The pumps are programmed to dispense the appropriate dosage of insulin. You can also get wireless pumps.
Your insulin requirement is calculated based on individual criteria such as weight, age, carbohydrate count during each meal, exercise, and hypoglycemic attacks due to low sugar levels.
Your total daily dose of insulin may vary from 0.5 to 1 unit/kg/day, depending on your particular age, gender, body mass index and mode of therapy (intermittent or continuous). Each case should be individualized.Consult your doctor and/or a diabetes specialist to determine the appropriate dose and mode of administration for you.

, Optimal diabetic control requires frequent self-monitoring. All patients with Type 1 diabetes should learn how to self-monitor and record their blood glucose levels at home with glucose monitors, so that they can adjust their insulin doses accordingly. This is a regimen that needs to be discussed with your doctor.You should check and record your blood glucose level at least four times daily or more; the American Diabetes Association recommends testing it before eating, sleeping, exercising, and driving.
To test your glucose levels, you can use a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), which attach to the body and use a fine needle under the skin to assess your blood glucose level every couple of minutes. This is one of the newest advances in blood glucose monitoring.
You can, however, also use a more traditional blood glucose meter, in which you insert a test strip into a small device. You then prick a clean fingertip with a special needle so that you get a small drop of blood. Press the test strip against the blood and wait for the blood glucose reading to appear on the screen.

, With Type 1 diabetes, you'll be constantly monitoring your blood glucose levels, making sure your body is operating properly. To do this properly, you'll need to be able to identify appropriate from excessive or low blood sugar levels. Here's what you need to know:In your day-to-day life and monitoring, the goal is to keep blood sugar levels before eating in the range of 70-130 mg/dl. After eating, you want to see blood sugar levels should below 180mg/dl.
In the HbA1c test, your blood levels of glycosylated hemoglobin should be less than 7%.
However, it's important to note that the guidelines of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) suggest that the blood sugar level targets should be individualized according to the patient’s specific circumstances (age, occupation, medical conditions, family support, etc.). For instance, if the patient has associated heart disease, repeated episodes of hypoglycemia, some mental illness or a substance abuse problem, he can be given higher targets, such as a glycosylated hemoglobin level up to 8% and pre-meal glucose levels of 100-150 mg/dl.

, Getting diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes is going to seem unfair. But if you place high value on prevention — even after diagnosis — you can navigate your life with diabetes relatively easily. Although nothing can prevent the development of Type 1 diabetes, regular care and treatment of the condition can prevent the development of complications and can reduce its progression.As the old saying goes, ""An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."" With insulin therapy, a monitored diet, and the right lifestyle habits, you can learn to live with your diabetes and prevent the development of major complications, such as heart and blood vessel disease, nerve damage, kidney damage, and eye damage (including blindness)., For better control of sugar levels, the amount and frequency of each meal should be constant and it should be in balance with your insulin doses. What you eat and when you eat play a vital role in avoiding increased blood sugars as well as hypoglycemia, which is caused by a deficiency of glucose in the bloodstream.Always have small meals at intervals of two to three hours to avoid hypoglycemia. Distribute your daily calorie requirement, such that you consume 20% of it for breakfast, 35% for lunch, 15% at tea-time (late afternoon), and 30% for dinner.

, An ideal diabetic diet is low in calories, sugars, saturated fats, cholesterol and carbohydrates.Here are some important tips:


Have six to eight ounces of protein daily. A three ounce serving is about the size of a deck of cards, so try to have two of these or thereabouts in your diet each day. Eggs, lean meat, skin-less chicken, fish, soya beans, tofu, seeds, legumes, milk and milk products are some recommended protein-rich food items.Have more of fiber-rich foods, such as whole oats, prunes, green leafy vegetables, spinach, watercress, celery, kidney beans and berries.Avoid processed foods with added sugars and preservatives like jams, syrups, ice cream, cookies, pastries, bread, etc.
Replace refined carbohydrates, such as processed flour, white bread and polished rice, with healthy complex carbohydrates like whole wheat breads, whole grains and brown rice. You can have fruits such as papayas, apples, bananas, and pears.

, Exercise in moderation is good for improving insulin effectiveness, since it helps your body's metabolism and utilization of fats and carbohydrates. Try walking for half an hour in the morning and evening and seeking out active leisurely activities, like dancing, yoga, swimming, or hiking. You should strive to get 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise as well as engage in resistance exercise (like weight training) three times a week.However, it's important to avoid strenuous exercises. Overexertion can precipitate hypoglycemia and be very dangerous. Be sure to only increase your exercise routines gradually to monitor what your body can handle. You should also consult your primary care physician before beginning any exercise regimen.
Drink lots of fluids to keep yourself well hydrated, and monitor pre-workout and post-workout sugars. Since exercise reduces blood glucose levels, you may have to reduce your pre-workout insulin by 20-30%. Insulin is more readily mobilized from a site of injection compared to normal insulin production from the organs, so it's doubly important to keep an eye on it. Again, it's best to ask your doctor for tips on how manage your blood glucose levels while working out and sweating.
Insulin-dependent patients who need to do some strenuous activity should take insulin injection at a site away from the muscle involved in the activity.

, Personal hygiene is very important in those with Type 1 diabetes, especially the hygiene related to the skin, teeth and feet. Infections in these areas can lead to an increase in insulin requirement, so your dose may need to be adjusted. But as long as you stay hygienic and maintain general good health, infections should be kept at bay.Have a bath or shower after any activity that makes you sweat. Make efforts to keep your armpits, back, genital area and feet clean and dry.
Inspect your feet regularly and treat any cuts and blisters immediately. Make sure your feet are receiving adequate blood flow and give them a regular massage.
Apply moisturizers in cases of dry skin and itching to avoid skin infections due to scratching.
Attend to any boils, acne or skin infections promptly. You can clean cuts and wounds with disinfectants and oxum solution at home, but in the case of swelling, pus or fever, visit your doctor for evaluation and a course of antibiotics.
Type 1 diabetes normally results in repeated vaginal yeast infections in girls and general skin infections. Avoid vaginal infections by wearing clean, cotton underwear and keeping the vaginal area clean and dry. Change out of sweaty clothes and bathing suits immediately to avoid bacteria growth in the vaginal area.

, Quit smoking, alcohol, tobacco chewing, substance abuse and any other type of addiction. Any consumption, inhalation or exposure to these things can cause unpredictable changes in blood glucose levels. It's best not to risk it.Further, alcohol, smoking, and other drugs can have adverse affects on your physical and mental health beyond aggravating your diabetes. Consider quitting these drugs and substances as beneficial for your overall health and well-being.
You don't need to quit alcohol, so to speak, but you should cut back as it can cause either high or low blood sugar, depending on how much you have consumed and what you have eaten. If you drink, only do so in moderation (one to two drinks per day) and alongside a meal.

, Managing your stress effectively is key to coping with diabetes in a healthy manner. This is because the hormones your body releases in response to stress can prevent the effective functioning of the insulin you are taken. This often creates a cycle of frustration and stress that can have serious repercussions for your diabetes.Schedule in some downtime in your life, where you can do something you enjoy, whether that be reading, spending time with family, or gardening.
Try relaxation techniques, including breathing exercises, yoga, meditation and progressive relaxation therapy. A good breathing exercise to try involves sitting or lying down with all of your limbs uncrossed. Take in a deep breath and then push out as much air as you can until you are completely empty. Breathe in and out again and deliberately relax your muscles while exhaling. Do this for at least 10 minutes once a day.
Another way to relax involves moving your body. You can loosen yourself up mentally through physical movements such as circling, stretching, and shaking.

, Diabetes is a disease that can lead to other debilitating conditions if not properly monitored and treated. In addition to your healthy lifestyle, stay up to date in scheduling and attending medical appointments that assess how your body is coping with diabetes and act as necessary precautions against the development of complications.Apart from your daily blood sugar tests, you will require HbA1c testing two to four times annually to check for diabetic control. The HbA1c, or glycated hemoglobin, test provides information about your blood sugar levels over the past two to three months by measuring the percentage of blood sugar attached to the hemoglobin in the blood. Hemoglobin is a protein that carries oxygen in the red blood cells. The higher your blood sugar levels, the more sugar will be attached to the hemoglobin. This test is the standard test for diabetes assessment, management, and research.Annual eye examinations and monitoring of your serum creatinine (a chemical waste product produced by your muscle metabolism) levels are needed to screen for diabetic retinopathy, a disease of the retina that can result in impairment or loss of vision, and nephropathy, also known as kidney disease.Annual lipid profiles and blood pressure checks will be necessary four times a year to check for heart diseases.
Tetanus vaccines are also recommended due to the increased risk of infections with daily insulin shots and impaired wound healing ability.
Keep your immunizations up to date. Get the flu shot every year and potentially also the pneumonia vaccine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recommends hepatitis B vaccination if you haven't been previously vaccinated and have Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. It's important to be vaccinated because high blood sugar can cause your immune system to be weaker.

, Know how to handle hypoglycemia if it strikes, particularly if you are out and about. It's important to realize that hypoglycemia can be life-threatening and that you take steps to prepare yourself in the event that a blood sugar spike occurs.Carry some sugar cubes, candy or juices in your briefcase, backpack or purse, and take them on slightest hint of impending hypoglycemia.
Carry a card in your purse or pocket that explains hypoglycemia and its treatment. Be sure to include the phone numbers of your treating physician and family members. If you are confused and dizzy, this helps someone else understand what to do and who to inform.
You can also wear a tag or bracelet that identifies you as a diabetic. This can help others identify and help you if needed.

, In the body of someone with Type 1, the β (Beta) cells of the pancreas cannot synthesize the insulin sufficiently, and Type 1 diabetes is the result.The body produces auto-antibodies, which destroy the insulin producing Beta-cells and sometimes also the Islets of Langerhans, the regions of the pancreas that contain its endocrine cells. If your body isn't producing insulin, this means that the glucose stays in your blood and your blood sugar level can become too high.Type 1 diabetes can technically develop at any age but typically occurs in people under 30 years old and is the most common type of childhood diabetes. Type 1 diabetics requires life-long insulin therapy for survival. Currently, there is no other alternative. However, there is much ongoing research for long-term treatments or even cures, such as an artificial pancreas, and pancreas or islet cell transplants.

, Initially, juvenile diabetes causes such minor complaints that they may be credited to other things. However, the symptoms are typically rapid in onset and should be diagnosed and treated immediately because Type 1 worsens as time goes on and can result in serious health problems, such as renal failure, coma and even death.Visit your doctor if you notice the following symptoms:Increase thirst and frequent urination especially at night
Generalized weakness without any reason
Weight loss
Changes in eyesight
Recurrent fungal infections
Increased hunger

, Doctors always emphasize the necessity of maintaining tight glycemic control, and that's for good reason. Even a slight spike in blood glucose levels can trigger the button of a good lecture from your physician. This is because the damage can go unnoticed until it is fairly advanced. Because of this, tight glycemic control is mandatory.You may find yourself thinking, “If I am feeling well and my sugar levels are just a bit above normal, then so what?"" These are the normal feelings of a diabetic, but they need to be adjusted. Diabetes is a silent killer; high blood glucose levels can harm the blood vessels from inside leading to damage to various organs (primarily the retinas (retinopathy), kidneys (nephropathy) and heart muscles (cardiomyopathy).
Give yourself your best chance at a healthy and happy life by acknowledging your illness as a serious medical condition, but one that can be managed with effective medical treatment and lifestyle modifications.

, Diabetic ketoacidosis is a very serious complication of diabetes caused when your body produces increased levels of blood acids called ketones as it breaks downs fat to use as fuel since there is insufficient insulin production. All patients with Type 1 diabetics should learn the method of testing for urine ketones (high acid levels, not solids) at home with commercially available reagent strips. These strips are the most direct method of testing for the condition, since they will tell you if you there are high ketone levels in your urine. However, you can also look for other symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis, such as:Hyperglycemia, or high blood sugar
Excessive thirst
Frequent urination
Nausea and vomiting
Abdominal pain
Weakness, tiredness, or vomiting
Shortness of breath
Blurred vision
Difficulty concentrating

If you experience any of the above, you should call emergency services so that you can be admitted to hospital and receive treatment. You will need to begin correction doses of insulin while waiting for help.



, When on insulin therapy, hypoglycemia can readily develop whenever there is less food intake, vomiting, a missed meal, strenuous exercise, or when the insulin dose is increased. If not treated on time, the individual with hypoglycemia may become unconscious, so it's important to know the signs, which include:Light-headedness
Shakiness
Dizziness
Confusion
Sweating
Severe headache
Blurred vision
Fast or irregular heartbeat
Note that B-blocker drugs used in some heart disorders like angina pectoris can mask all other symptoms of hypoglycemia, except sweating.

If you experience any of the above, eat or drink something with sugar in, such as fruit juice or a sugar cube. Even 15-20 grams of something with sugar can help. Test your blood sugar 15 minutes later and if it's still low, try another 15-20 grams and call emergency services.

Remember sealable plastic bags.,
Don’t forget the cleaning supplies.,
Choose the right clothes.,
Take advantage of campus health services.,
Request to have a room with a private bathroom.,
Inquire about a single dorm.",How to Discreetly Wear Diapers as a College Student," These days, it is easy to find a pair of reusable adult diapers that resemble your regular underwear. The underwear are so discrete that your roommates will be unable to detect them and won't learn of your issue with incontinence.Do your research before making the purchase. While manufacturers may rate their pull-on underwear as fully absorbent, there are many reviewers who would disagree.Things to consider are the fit, absorbency and style.
You may want to purchase a few different pairs prior to leaving so that you can determine what works and what doesn’t ahead of time.;
, If you don’t like the idea of relying solely on underwear to keep you protected, consider purchasing incontinence pads or boosters. Boosters aren't typically used on their own; however, they can be used with a disposable brief or pull-up for maximum absorbency.There are boosters available that make it possible for you to get through the day without changing them. If you have a long day of classes or are tailgating at a football game, it may be worth looking into this option!
If your incontinence issues are only minor, pads may be your best bet, as they can be worn with different types of underwear including regular (snug fitting) or specialty made underwear., It’s a good idea to have extra sets of sheets on hand for any bedwetting incidents. You’ll want to be able to change your sheets as many times as necessary without having to run down to the laundry room each time. Additionally, there are other great products available, which are waterproof and can protect your mattress.


Today you won't have a difficult time finding waterproof products, which keep both you and your mattress dry. The goal is to reduce damage and excessive laundry.A waterproof mattress pad should be on your must buy list. With the ability to hold up to 6 cups of fluid, pads provide absorbency as well as moisture protection.You may want to consider vinyl mattress covers, as they lock out moisture and serve as an inexpensive way to add years of life to your mattress., For underwear and pads alike, sealable plastic bags will come in handy if you’d rather wait to dispose of them in a more private setting. Plastic bags can easily be stored in your bookbag. When you’re in a public restroom, simply place your wet belongings in the bag and back into your bookbag. No one will be the wiser!


An environmentally friendly option is a reusable, sealable waterproof bag. You can place the wet products into the bag, dispose of them later and then throw the bag in with your laundry.

, Things such as plastic gloves and stain and odor removers will come in handy in a dorm setting. There’s no need to clean in front of your roommate either. Wait until they leave for class to do your cleaning, if you feel more comfortable doing so.


You can always explain to your roommate that you’re a neat freak and like things to be clean.
Open the windows after using cleaning products. You wouldn’t want the room to smell overwhelming upon your roommates return.

, If you're still concerned about your peers noticing the pad, diapers or underwear you're wearing, choose clothing that doesn't cling. In other words, wearing skinny jeans may not be the best choice for you. However, men can wear looser fitting jeans and go with an untucked shirt, while women can opt for long skirts or tunic shirts.


If you're heading to the beach with your friends, women can accessorize with a full or partial cover up, while men can sport board shorts.

, Upon arriving to campus, familiarize yourself with the health services on campus. Healthcare on campus is similar to going to the family doctor, but most campuses provide a wider range of health services to students who are transitioning from being a patient to an independent health consumer.Inquire about potentially free or discounted products for incontinence.
Chances are the nurses on campus have encountered students with similar issues, so don’t feel embarrassed about any questions or issues you may have.

, If you’d like to avoid having to use a public restroom every day, you may want to request a room with a private bathroom. There is no guarantee that the school will be able to honor your request; however, it’s worth asking about.


You’ll need to involve your doctor from home in the process.
School guidelines for submitting such a request vary, so check with them once you’ve been admitted to see what their policy is.
Don’t wait until you arrive on campus to make the request.

, It may be that you feel most comfortable having a space of your own. Again, policies will vary by school, but some require that requests be made yearly for such accommodations. You will also need documentation from your family doctor when submitting the request.


Single rooms tend to fill up fast, so make the request early!
Consider what living in a single room will mean for your social life.
You may also be asked more questions about your medical condition, if you are living alone.

Determine the level of absorbency you need.,
Find the right diapers.,
Try your diapers on with your school clothes.",How to Cope With Wearing Diapers to School1," The type of diaper you wear will depend on the amount of leakage you have, daytime wetting versus nighttime wetting, and what size you are. Diapers with more absorbency and nighttime wetting diapers are bulkier.;
, Because incontinence is an issue for people of all ages , a variety of diapers are on the market to meet your needs. There are diapers especially for older children and preteens , teenagers, and adults . You should try different brands of diapers until you find the right one. Having the right diapers can make you feel more confident.


Youth pull ups are a great option for older children. Popular brands of youth pull ups are Goodnites and Select. Some of these pullups look exactly like regular underwear.
Shopping for diapers can be expensive. The CareGiver Partnership allows you to try out samples before you spend a lot of money on diapers.
If you are a preteen, you may be too small for adult diapers and too big for youth diapers. Race Car Diapers are made for preteens and come in many different sizes. These diapers were designed for boys. Molicare is another brand that has sizes for preteens.
Popular brands for teenagers are Tena , Prevail, and Tranquility. You can also insert booster pads into your diapers to increase how much your diaper can hold. The booster pads will also allow your diapers to absorb more.
The most important factor when finding the right diaper is how you feel in them. If they fit well and you are comfortable, you will be more confident wearing them to school.

, You should wear your diapers when you go shopping for new clothes. This will help you find clothes that do not expose your diapers. Wearing clothes that are one size larger than your actual size will help hide your diapers.

If the relatives aren't aware of the bedwetting problem and the parents feel that the relationship is strong enough where they can divulge this then it might not be an issue.;
, The child might not feel comfortable about the relatives knowing that the child wears diapers to bed. If the child feels insecure about the relatives knowing, the parents could have the child pack some plastic garbage bags in their suitcase to put the wet diapers in, along with some disinfectant spray to spray in the bag(to kill any odors that will emanate from the bag). Have the bedwetting parent's ask the guests about the relatives sleeping arrangements for the child, so they can be sure the bedwetter will be able to manage the issue in a manner that won't cause any embarrassment.

, If they do have kids but they don't have a bedwetting problem, the non-bedwetting child could bring a sleeping bag and sleep in the parent's room or there might be a guest bedroom they could use. However this works out depends primarily on the attitudes of the host family; some people are very understanding about this problem, whereas others aren't as sympathetic.

Urinary continence is when you do not have control over your bladder. You may leak urine or not make it to the bathroom in time when you feel the urge. Fecal incontinence is when you do not have control of your bowel movements. Stress incontinence is when certain movements or activities (coughing, sneezing, running, jumping) put stress on your bladder and causes you leak urine.

, Try keeping a diary to learn what your triggers are.

You should make your diary as detailed as possible.The information in your diary will also be helpful to your doctor. , A doctor will be able to help to identify the cause of your incontinence and create a treatment plan that is just for you. It is important that you talk openly with your doctor. You should not feel embarrassed because your doctor is used to helping people who have the same problem you have. Your doctor may send you to a physical therapist, prescribe medications, or even talk to you about the possibility of surgery. .


Your doctor will take a medical history, do a physical exam, talk to your parents, discuss a treatment plan, and run some tests. The National Association for Continence maintains a list of specialists across the United States. , Voiding is a part of bladder training that teaches you to go to the bathroom at specific times. You should discuss a voiding strategy with your doctor before you begin one. Scheduling bathroom visits helps to strengthen your bladder muscles and decrease the need to use diapers.


If you are a child, your parents can help you with your bladder training. Start by measuring how often you use the bathroom.

Others try to identify the root cause of the issue such as diabetes, urinary tract infections, bladder cancer, obstructive sleep apnea, urinary tract stones, or an enlarged prostate.

Decide whether or not you want to use cloth or disposable diapers.,
If you decide on using cloth diapers pick which style you want to wear to bed.,
Purchase other diapering supplies.,
Be aware of the terminology used for adult incontinence products.,
Get appropriate measurements.,
Ask for samples.,
Buy a waterproof sheet to put over the bed.,
Check for signs of diaper rash.,
Check online for information regarding incontinence garments.",How to Choose What Type of Diaper to Wear if You're an Adult Bedwetter," You can also use both styles. One reason to do this is because you save some money by not using as many disposable diapers. In this case you can alternate your use of the different types of diapers. For example on some nights you can wear cloth diapers to bed and on other nights you can wear disposables to bed. Another reason to use both kinds of diapers is because some people find cloth diapers covered with plastic pants uncomfortable to wear during warmer times of the year such as spring and summer. In that case the individual switches to disposable diapers.Finally alternating your use of disposable and cloth diapers can cut down on the wear and tear that can occur from laundering cloth diapers. Some people say that they've had cloth diapers last for years, but some wear still does occur to a certain extent and using both types of diapers has the potential to make the diapers last longer.;
, One style of cloth diaper that is very effective for managing bedwetting are pin-on style cloth diapers. Although somewhat old fashioned there are some people who use these types of diapers on their babies. In addition there are incontinent adults who still use pin-on style diapers. Some of the advantages of pin-on diapers include the following: Pin-on diapers are customizable to a large degree-they offer a great deal of flexibility with being able to adjust the diapers to fit different body types as well as flexibility with how you layer the diapers and how many diapers you can add(this in turn allows for more effective protection), they tend to be the most durable style of diaper(pin-on diapers have been called the “workhorse” of the diaper world by some people), and this style of diaper can double as a tool for use in household tasks such as dusting, car washing, and other chores. These are just some of the advantages of using pin-on diapers. On the other hand some individuals might find the pins to be a hassle.That being said, it might be worth experimenting with this style of diaper due to how effective they are with nighttime protection. There are different fabrics used for cloth diapers-flannel, birds-eye cotton, as well as gauze. Gauze diapers are presumably very comfortable to wear particularly during warmer weather in addition to being highly effective for managing bedwetting, although there are people who prefer the other fabric styles also.


There are other types of cloth diapers besides pin-on style diapers. These styles of diapers have different ways of fastening the diapers. These include cloth diapers with Velcro fasteners, cloth diapers with snaps on the sides, as well as pull on diapers which are also known as diaper pants. While these styles are worn by some people there are some disadvantages with these diapers: pull-on cloth diapers tend to be less absorbent than pin-on diapers for heavier forms of incontinence such as bedwetting, in some instances the cloth diapers with Velcro fasteners have problems with the Velcro wearing out after a certain number of washings, and the snaps on snap on diapers can break. These are some of the other reasons why the adult who wets the bed may want to consider using pin-on cloth diapers if they want to try cloth diapers. The only reason it might not be advisable to use this style of cloth diaper is if the person has some cognitive and/or physical disability that might make it difficult for him or her to handle the pins. For instance the tremors associated with neurological diseases such as Parkinson's can effect a person's dexterity and therefore would make it difficult for this individual to diaper themselves using this type of diaper. There is a slight learning curve associated with using pin-on diapers but there is plenty of information online that talks about how to pin on diapers.With these caveats in mind, a person needs to decide for him or herself what type of diaper(or combination of diapers) works best for them. Kelly's Closet(www.kellyscloset.com) has an illustrated step-by-step guide on how to fold and pin on cloth diapers. Although the instructions are for baby diapers they are also applicable to adult size pin-on diapers. The ""newspaper"" and ""angel wing"" folds seem like the easiest folds to do. To find this section, go to the top of the website and click on cloth diapers, a pull down menu will appear. Then click on the section on prefold and flat diapers. Then it will say cloth diapering 101. That is where the information on folding cloth diapers is.

, If you do decide to wear pin-on cloth diapers there are a number of supplies you'll need to buy. Waterproof pants must be worn over cloth diapers because unlike disposable diapers there is no waterproof outer layer to keep clothes and bedding dry. Plastic pants(which many people call “rubber pants”, even though this is a misnomer) are the most popular type of waterproof pants and in general are the most durable type of waterproof pants. Plastic pants are also known as ""vinyl pants"", vinyl being a type of plastic. There are several brands of plastic pants and cloth diapers which are recommended by adults suffering from incontinence particularly those with bedwetting problems. These brands and where to purchase them are discussed on the blog “Tips on Managing Bed-Wetting.” This blog also lists several places that sell adult size disposable diapers.


Other supplies that you have to purchase are safety pins for fastening the diapers. Diaper pins can be found at places such as Walmart in the baby section, places that sell adult size cloth diapers, as well as similar places. Fabric stores such as Jo Anne Fabrics should also have safety pins which may be suitable for using with cloth diapers.Other supplies you may need are a diaper pail(if you decide on washing the cloth diapers and plastic pants all at once) , diaper rash products such as Desitin, A&D ointment, Balmex, and petroleum jelly(Vaseline being an example), and baby powder. Incontinence wipes are another product that you might consider purchasing. Baby wipes can be used for this purpose and are found in the baby section of places such as Walmart, Target, as well as grocery stores. Finally incontinence wipes(as well as products for the treatment and prevention of diaper rash) are sold by companies that sell adult incontinence products.

, If purchasing disposable diapers be aware of the terminology used to market these products. Since there is a great deal of stigma associated with adult diapers, manufacturers have come up with creative names for these products. The most popular name and one that has been used since these products were introduced in the late 70's is “disposable briefs” although some places also use the term “adult diapers.” Disposable briefs have the same fit and design as baby diapers such as Pampers, Luvs, and Huggies-they have tapes on the sides for fastening the garments, elastic leg gathers to prevent leaks, a waterproof plastic or cloth like outer layer, and some of them also have elastic waistbands which are also designed to prevent leaks. Although there are pull on style disposable diapers for managing bedwetting(known as disposable underwear or “pull-ups”) they tend to provide less effective protection for heavier forms of incontinence such as bedwetting. The adult size disposable diapers with tape tabs tend to offer the most absorbency for nighttime use. In addition the tapes allow for flexibility with how you adjust the diapers.

, Most websites list the waist measurements for both cloth and disposable diapers but some also list hip measurements and weight ranges that the diapers will fit. A diaper that is too loose will not provide effective protection and one that it too tight will be uncomfortable so it's important that you familiarize yourself with these and if you have any questions be sure to ask a customer service rep before you buy the diapers.

, Many websites that sell disposable diapers for adults have samples either for free or a nominal price. This is a good way to determine what brand of diaper works best for you.

, Even though you are wearing diapers to bed, it's still a good idea to put a rubber or plastic sheet over the bed for added protection just in case the diapers leak.

, Some people are susceptible to diaper rash and it's important that you maintain appropriate hygiene when wearing diapers in order to avoid getting a rash. Those individuals wearing cloth diapers covered with a pair of plastic pants are particularly vulnerable to getting rashes, although rashes can occur when wearing disposable diapers too. That being said this should not discourage you from trying pin-on cloth diapers covered by plastic pants(after all many people wear these types of diapers without having any issues), just to be cognizant of the fact that rashes can occur. Online sites such as WebMD as well as similar places have information about the signs of diaper rash as well as methods to treat it.

, There are a number of good online sources that contain information about incontinence including information about the many types of products available to handle the different forms of incontinence. A few good sources of information are The Simon Foundation for Continence, the NAFC(which stands for the National Association for Continence), as well as The New Diaper Primer. Among other things The New Diaper Primer has information about how to launder cloth diapers and information about the different types of cloth diaper fabrics. The url for this article is www.incontinentsupport.org. It's also a good idea to be familiar with the different forms of incontinence so you can buy an appropriate product. There are different levels of incontinence, as a result there are many products available. Bedwetting is a heavier form of incontinence and disposable briefs and cloth diapers tend to be the best products for this type of incontinence.

Replace any dirty or wet clothes the child was wearing that had to be changed.,
Deal with settling the child down and get them back into their normal sleeping pattern.",How to Change a Disposable Bedwetting Diaper," Sometimes it's just a matter of a tiny bit of urine or sweat that may have ran into the diaper since the last diaper change. Although nothing can be more frightening to a child wearing the diaper if the parents feel down into the pant itself, if you peak over and see the sag of the diaper from the outside of the pant or if you smell the stinky smell of urine, it's definitely time to change that diaper.
, Although most diaper-changing areas for those who have bedwetting diapers will just be so easy they can be changed near the bed with little to no inconvenience, you will need to determine a suitable place to change it. Have nearby any diaper-rash creams and a diaper-changing pad, along with the new diaper so you won't need to take your eyes off the child (if the child hasn't gotten off their bed and come to you yet or isn't mobile yet and tend to roll around when being changed)., Place a waterproof changing pad or towel on the wet surface area temporarily until the child's diaper has been changed, so as not to rewet the new diaper from below them. You can still change a bedwetter's diaper on the bed, even with this pad on it., Get the diaper out of the package. Hold onto the diaper's front panel with both of your hands with a five-fingered pinching grasp as you grasp the center portion of the panel with both of your hands (one next to the other) and pull gently on the front section (from the back section) of the new diaper to help release the static from the inside of the diaper that has built up from production of that particular diaper at the factory.

The diaper will need to be open and near you, with it's Leakguard liners inside the diaper fully flared so that there is no static in the diaper. Be careful not to rip the diaper at all, as bedwetting diapers don't have resealable tabs that help re-place upon the change when needed.

Stick your hand down into the diaper far enough so that the side elastic-like straps unfurl open.
Stop pushing down into the diaper when your hand touches the bottom section of the new diaper (which your child's genitals will be placed in).
Take your fingers and run them over the Leakguard areas and then pull your hand back out.



,

Be firm but not too rough when pulling the static away from the sides of the diaper. If you pull these sides apart too rough, you are more likely to end up breaking the diaper's side closing areas that hold the diaper closed when the child wears them at night, thereby making the diaper not catch all the urine from the accident during the night and will be sprayed onto all the other surrounding areas the child rolls around on.
Watch out for diapers that ""itch"" your children who wear these diapers. If you don't pull the diaper open far enough, it will choke the child's genitals (especially those of boys) when you try to remove the diaper upon replacement time the next time it gets changed. The child may then scream that ""their diaper itches them"" and you don't want that to happen.

, Tell them that they'll need to have their diaper changed and that they must lay down to get them changed. Ask the child to lay back down on the bed on top of the changing pad. If the child is incapable of doing so themselves, you may need to help move them to the right place. If they are sleepy, you may need to do this yourself whether they are mobile or not. Pick them up from underneath their arms and lay them gently down on the bed yourself so the affected diaper area is directly on the pad and not overlapping any part of the remainder of the unprotected bedding., This may including removing their sleepwear, onesies (those that have button-snaps in their genital area), pants or some may even have night shorts. Remove any sleepwear the child might have been worn when the bedwetting accident occurred. Try and get full access to the diaper without exposing the child to too much late during the night.,

Give the diaper a forcible pull outward when you pull rather forcefully near the center panel of the top of the diaper which should be near the child's waist , but let go of the diaper when the diaper is laying flat in front of the child on the surface of the changing area. You will hear the diaper sides rip, and that's a very good thing to hear at this time. (At this point, this sound is normal. Later on, this ripping sound will become a sound you don't want to hear, as it will signal a need for a brand new diaper.)
Remove the old diaper from the changing surface. Use the Ankle Hold Technique to lift the child's legs. Even if the child can help you take off their own pant, you may need to pacify them and have only you take care of this portion of the removal so as not to wake them any further. Keep things quiet and calm. If they can and if they are able to move, they can help raise their own rear-end off the changing surface or raise their legs together so you can pull the old diaper out from under them.
Hold the child's legs until their old diaper has been taken out from underneath them and can be safely placed to the side without loosing sight of the child. Slide with your other hand, the ""dirty"" diaper away from under your child. Lower the child's feet back down onto the changing surface again, when the old diaper has been fully placed to the side.


, Liberally apply diaper rash ointment/cream onto and around the entire affected area. However, if at any point during the changing process, you see poop in the diaper or on the child's rear-end, use diaper-rash ointment after wiping the poop away with a baby wipe., Look at the diaper itself to ensure that the child's diapers will be going onto the child the correct way. Make sure the front of the diaper is facing you. To determine the proper side of the diaper, look for icons that are pre-sewn into the diaper's top back portion of the rear panel denoting a size. Other companies features may differ on what these say but will describe the back of the pant. Some may have icons placed on their pant, while others don't. Look for the size of the diaper being a little deeper in the Leakguard area from the ""top"" down of the diaper comparing the front and back of the diaper., Put your hands on both of the insides of the diaper so that you can help the child slip the diaper on them without too much fuss and you can control the action instead of just the reverse. Insert both of the child's legs - one at a time - through the leg holes. Use the same leg-insertion method as that of the process of inserting a child's legs inside a potty training pant or a pair of underwear. At this point, you don't want to force the diaper to rip as ripping could cost you the need to change the diaper once more. Once both legs have been inserted, you can continue onto the next step.

Prepare the child's legs, so you can put the new diaper onto the child. Lift the child's legs using the Ankle-Hold Technique again. 'The child's legs will need to be positioned in a completely straight line from their ankles to their knees and must be still at the same straight line past the knees up until their waistline. Keep the child's legs in this ""slightly inclined position until after the diaper has been fully pulled up.

, Stop once the diaper stops moving or the child says they feel the diaper on their rear end, but before they tell you that the diaper is too tight on them in their genital area. It must be snug but comfortable.You may need to use your both of your hands to help hold the top edge in front of the diaper and top edge of the back of the diaper as you pull it up onto the child. The diaper should be positioned at about the same height as that of a disposable diaper (at or very near to the child's waistline).


If you can reach onto the tag and pull it up from that area, kudos to you. It's beneficial to pull the sides of the diaper up at first by the tag area, but if you can't reach it or if their is an obstruction in the diaper area, raise the diaper by holding each side of the pant until the pant stops, readjust the other side then continue switching sides until the diaper stops moving completely or the child says the diaper has met or is even a little tight in their groin. (You'll have to fix their diaper a little if it pinches them in their groin, though.)
Raise the diaper up the child's legs at a consistent speed comparing the rate of speed of the front and the rate of speed on the back. Use one of your hands on each side of the diaper to pull the diaper upwards onto your child. Stop just before it reaches the child's genital area. Try to raise both sides consecutively at the same time and to the exact same height.

If at any point you hear a ripping sound in this new diaper, you've gone too far. Even if you've just started when you hear this ripping sound, remove this diaper, and start with another fresh new bedwetting diaper, until this specification can be met.

, Change any shirts, pants, socks, additional nightwear, or (if the child wears one) their pair of underwear., Dependent on the time of day or night and if the child can help carry out the parents directions without help or not, send the child to bed and settle them in, in the normal appropriate adjusted bedtime manner."

Consult your physician.,
Make sure all of your physicians are aware of each other.,
Learn about your needs.",How to Manage Diabetes Risks in Older Adults1," Your main point of contact for information to manage diabetes should be your physician. Your physician will be able to tell exactly what you need to do to manage your health risks.


Your physician will be able to diagnose your condition and make you aware of major health risks.
Your physician will be able to prescribe medication to treat your health problems and health risks.
Your physician will help you manage your life style and overall health.
Let your physician know if you have any special concerns about your condition. For example, say ""I'm really concerned that my diabetes risks will prevent me from doing things I like to do. Is this true?"";
, One of the challenges for older adults in managing diabetes is that they often have several diseases and disorders and may be on multiple medications at one time. As a result, you should go out of you way to make sure your doctors know about each other and are in communication with each other.


Provide all of your doctors with the contact information of all of your other doctors.
Make sure your doctors know exactly what medicines you take – including ones prescribed by other doctors. For instance, if your cardiologist has prescribed Mavik, and your urologist has prescribed Flomax, you should let the doctor treating your diabetes know immediately.
Realize that certain medicines may conflict with each other or cause negative interactions., Managing risk factors should not end with your physician. To properly manage your diabetes, you need to continue to learn about your needs at home. By going out of your way to educate yourself about your condition, you’ll be better equipped to manage all of the risks associated with it.


Become a member of support and information services. For instance, join the American Diabetes Association (ADA).
Use the internet to search for resources about diabetes in older adults.
Attend support groups, conferences, and conventions for older adults with diabetes."

Watch blood sugar levels.,
Monitor your heart rate.,
Check your cholesterol.",How to Manage Diabetes Risks in Older Adults2," Blood sugar levels are perhaps one of the most important indicators of a person's health in terms of diabetes. Whether you have diabetes or are pre-diabetic, you need to be very vigilant about your blood sugar levels.


Aim for 80 to 130 mg/dl blood sugar level before a meal.
Your blood sugar level should be less than 180 mg/dl within 1 or 2 hours after a meal.
Remember that blood sugar levels vary based on age and other conditions., Your heart rate is another vital indicator of your overall health. It also gives important information about the toll that heart disease and diabetes is taking on your body. As a result, make sure to monitor your heart rate frequently.


The high target heart rate of an adult between 65 and 75 years old is 105.
The low target heart rate of an adult between 65 and 75 years old is 90.
The max heart rate for an adult between 65 and 75 years old is 150.
Heart rate varies based on fitness level, age, gender, and other medical conditions.
Consult your doctor if you have any questions about your heart rate and diabetes., While cholesterol is not a direct indicator of your diabetes risk, it does give you good information about your overall health and your cardio health. Because many people who have diabetes also suffer from cardiovascular disease, you should monitor your cholesterol frequently.


You are at greater risk of heart disease if your HDL levels are less than 40.
Target LDL levels are 100 or lower.
HDL and LDL levels may vary based on age, genetics, and other factors.
Low HDL and high LDL levels paired with diabetes may increase health problems."

Watch for diabetic eye disease.,
Be aware of hypoglycemia.,
Monitor injuries.,
Manage cardiovascular disease, if you have it.",How to Manage Diabetes Risks in Older Adults3," Many older adults with diabetes are at a great risk of diabetic eye disease. Diabetic eye disease refers to a variety of eye diseases that older adults are at risk of. While researchers do not understand the connection between some eye diseases and diabetes, they are sure that people with diabetes are at a higher risk of eye disease. Diabetic eye diseases include:


Glaucoma, which is a disease in which the intraocular pressure of the eye increases.
Diabetic retinopathy, which is a disease in which small blood vessels in the eyes are damaged.
Cataracts, which is the gradual clouding of the eyes., Older adults with diabetes are predisposed to hypoglycemia, a condition that occurs when blood sugar levels drop below a certain point. Hypoglycemia can result in serious medical problems such as loss of consciousness or coma. As a result, older adults need to be very aware of this potential risk.


Always monitor blood sugar levels.
Carry glucose tablets or sugary drinks or snacks with you to consume if you feel the symptoms of hypoglycemia.
Watch for the symptoms of sweating, fatigue, dizziness, paleness, or blurred vision., One problem for many older diabetes patients is that injuries often do not heal properly. If injuries do not heal properly, the patient may be at risk of more severe medical problems. As a result, all older adults with diabetes should closely monitor any injuries.


Watch cuts. Cuts may heal slower or be more prone to infection for older adults with diabetes.
Pay attention to bruises.
Be cognizant of broken bones.

, A serious danger to older adults with diabetes is cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease may increase the severity of your diabetes and create new problems. To avoid this:


Manage your blood pressure.
Watch your lipid levels.
Monitor your blood sugar."

Eat healthy.,
Exercise frequently, but safely.,
Maintain your social life.",How to Manage Diabetes Risks in Older Adults4," A great way to manage the risks of diabetes is to eat healthy. However, older adults with diabetes face an array of challenges when trying to eat healthy. Not only do you need to manage calories, sugar levels, and nutrition, but you have to be very weight-conscious in order to avoid cardiovascular disease.


Avoid excess sweets.
Eat a well-balanced diet.
Make sure to get enough vitamins., Frequent exercise is key to managing diabetes risk. However, older adults are at special risk since their age makes exercise more difficult and opens them up to larger dangers than younger adults.


Make sure to adopt a frequent exercise schedule. Try to exercise at least 30 minutes a day.
Consider low-impact exercises such as using an elliptical or cycling.
Be mindful of the dangers of a fall. One of the biggest dangers to older adults who exercise frequently is the danger of a fall. Older adults should be especially mindful of this danger since they may not heal as quickly due to age and due to diabetes.
Watch for the danger of overexertion. Older adults, especially, may be susceptible to overexerting themselves, pulling muscles, or aggravating heart conditions or similar cardiovascular diseases.
Consult with your doctor before you commit to any exercise routine., Don't let your diabetes get in the way of you enjoying your life. Maintaining a vibrant social life is an important part of staying healthy -- both mentally and physically. Consider:


Frequenting the senior center in your community. You might find other people, talks, or education offered at your senior center.
Enroll in continuing education courses.
Join diabetes support groups.
Become more active in your neighborhood or community.

Familiarize yourself with the various fabrics cloth diapers can be made of.,
Go to the website of the company they're interested in buying from and look at the different size ranges they have.,
Make sure you get a good fit.,
Buy plastic pants to wear over the cloth diapers.,
Buy additional supplies mentioned in Choose Bedwetting Diapers for an Older Child or Teenager.",How to Choose Pin‐On Cloth Diapers for Older Children and Teenagers With Bedwetting Problems," Cloth diapers can be made from different types of cotton fabric: flannel, birdseye, and gauze. Each of these fabrics has different characteristics which has a bearing on both the absorbency of the diapers as well as how comfortable the diapers are.;
, There are several companies that sell pin-on cloth diapers for older children, teenagers, and adults.

, If they're too tight the diapers will be uncomfortable, if they're too loose the diapers will leak.


One company that sells pin-on cloth diapers for older children and teenagers has the weight range that these diapers will fit listed on their website and another company has just the waist sizes listed. If you're not sure you've got an appropriate fit or you have any additional questions call the company and ask to speak to a customer service representative. Like the saying goes, ""Measure twice, cut once.""

, Unlike disposable diapers, cloth diapers do not have a waterproof outer layer. As a result, you need to cover the diapers with a pair of waterproof pants. Plastic pants (also known as vinyl pants,vinyl being a type of plastic) are generally considered to be the best type of pants to cover cloth diapers with - they're usually the most durable, they tend to be the least expensive type of waterproof pants, and they have excellent wicking capabilities (meaning how well liquid is dispersed).


Some people also call plastic pants ""rubber pants"" even though they actually mean plastic pants.The terminology ""rubber pants"" is incorrect. Before the advent of plastic pants in the fifties ""rubber pants"" were the only style of waterproof pants available to cover baby diapers. The term ""rubber pants"" became widely used in the vernacular as a generic term for waterproof pants. Some people also use the term ""rubber sheets"" even though they mean vinyl or plastic sheets
There are two styles of plastic pants: pull-on and snap-on style. The snap on style are usually more expensive. The snap-on style plastic pants are generally used for individuals who are non-ambulatory (cannot walk). For most people the pull-on style plastic pants will work just fine.
Unfortunately pin-on cloth diapers and plastic pants designed to fit older children, teenagers, and adults are not found in retail stores and must be ordered online. You can find some references to help in bedwetting blogs onlineThe blog mentioned in the ""Sources and Citations"" section of this article lists websites of companies that sell plastic pants and safety pin style diapers for older children, teenagers, and adults that wet the bed.

, These include a diaper pail if the parents decide to wash the diapers in one load, diaper pins (which are safety pins designed specifically to fasten cloth diapers - these can be purchased at places such as Walmart, Target, as well as places on line that sell adult and baby cloth diapers), diaper rash ointment, baby powder, and baby wipes. Amazon is one place that sells various incontinence supplies including diaper pins.

Increase your intake of nuts and fish.,
Spice your food with cinnamon.,
Reduce your intake of high-fat, high-cholesterol foods and snacks.,
Stay hydrated with water instead of with sodas and sugary drinks.",How to Lower A1C Levels1," Fruits and vegetables contain a number of antioxidants that promote better health in general, and are also high in fiber, which studies have shown can contribute to better blood sugar management., According to Harvard University Health Services, one-half cup (118 ml) of beans will provide you with one-third of your daily fiber requirement. Beans will also slow down the digestion process, and help stabilize blood sugar levels following meals., Fat-free milk and yogurt are rich in calcium and vitamin D, which have been shown to contribute to better blood sugar management and weight loss, the latter of which can help improve most cases of type 2 diabetes.

, Most nuts and fatty fish including tuna, mackerel, and salmon contain omega-3 fatty acids that will help lower insulin resistance, regulate blood sugar levels, and contribute to better heart health. Nuts can also benefit type 2 diabetics who are trying to lower their cholesterol levels.

, Although cinnamon is generally associated with sweets and desserts, research has shown that consuming one-half tsp. (2 ml) cinnamon per day can improve insulin resistance.


Add cinnamon to tea, or sprinkle over fruits, vegetables, and lean meats to increase your daily cinnamon intake without eating more desserts and high-fat snacks.

, Sweets and junk foods such as candy bars, cakes, potato chips, and fried foods will cause your blood sugar levels to spike, which can impact your overall A1C levels.


Snack on foods that contain natural sugars such as fruits, berries, and low-fat cheeses to satisfy any sweet-tooth and dessert cravings. These types of foods all contain natural sugars that will enter your bloodstream at a much slower pace than foods that contain processed sugars and ingredients., Studies have shown that those who drink water throughout the day are able to stave off dehydration, which may lead to high blood sugar levels and higher A1C levels. Sodas, energy drinks, fruit drinks, and other types of sugary drinks will result in higher blood sugar levels and weight gain.

"
"
Perform at least 30 minutes of physical activity per day.,
Add a mixture of aerobic and anaerobic activity to your workout routine.,
Find ways to add more activity to your daily lifestyle.",How to Lower A1C Levels2," Physical activity will naturally lower blood sugar levels, improve heart health and energy levels, and also contribute to weight loss. Diabetics who exercise regularly will often have better control of their blood sugar levels and exhibit healthier A1C levels.

, Anaerobic exercises such as weight training may temporarily increase your blood sugar levels, whereas aerobic exercise such as walking or swimming will help automatically lower your blood sugar levels. Over time, both types of exercise will help contribute to lower A1C levels.

, The more active you are, the better your A1C levels will become over time. For example, take stairs instead of the escalator when possible, and walk to the corner store instead of driving.

"
"
Perform relaxation techniques at times you experience stress and anxiety.,
Make gradual lifestyle changes to rid your life of the things that cause you stress.",How to Lower A1C Levels3," Evidence shows that stress and anxiety can actually have an adverse effect on your heart health, which can also worsen diabetes.


Practice activities such as deep breathing, yoga, or meditation to help your body relax and reduce levels of stress and anxiety.

, Studies have shown that long-term stress can negatively impact your health, and can contribute to a higher risk for obesity, high blood pressure, heart disease, and more. For example, if you are feeling stressed due to being overworked, develop plans to cut back on hours.

Make and keep doctor’s appointments with your healthcare provider as recommended.,
Take all prescribed medications to manage and control your diabetes.",How to Lower A1C Levels4," Your healthcare provider will help track your A1C and blood sugar levels, and will provide you with treatments needed to help manage and improve your diabetes.

, Failure to take your prescribed medications can result in high blood sugar levels and higher A1C levels, and in some cases, may even lead to hospitalization or severe illness.

Eat regular and consistent meals.,
Focus mainly on protein and produce.,
Include regular sources of heart healthy fats.,
Go for 100% whole grains only.,
Skip sweets and processed grains.,
Incorporate cardiovascular exercises.,
Add a few days of strength training.,
Increase your lifestyle activity.,
Keep an exercise journal or log.,
Exercise with a friend or support group.,
Talk to your doctor.,
Lose weight.,
Quit smoking.,
Track blood work.,
Limit alcohol consumption.",How to Manage Diabetes Risk with Diet and Exercise," You may not think your eating pattern during the day can affect your risk for diabetes. However, eating irregular or inconsistent meals affects how your body controls blood sugar levels.


Health professionals recommend to eat regular and consistent meals or snacks during the day. This helps manage your diabetes risk by helping you maintain a healthy weight and by keeping your blood sugar levels stable.Aim to eat at least three meals daily, or five to six smaller meals. You should not go more than four hours without eating something, so eating more, smaller meals may be the best strategy.
Aim to eat breakfast within an hour or so of waking up. This helps get your body started and helps immediately stabilize blood sugars.;
, If you are not currently a diabetic, but only want to manage your risk factors, focus on a diet high in lean protein and produce (fruits and vegetables). This combination can help manage your risk in a variety of ways.


To start, both lean protein, fruits and vegetables are all relatively lower in calories. This can help you lose weight or maintain a healthier weight. Since your weight has a big impact on your diabetes risk, it's important to strive towards a healthier weight.
Also, these foods are very satiating. Lean protein sources and the fiber found in fruits and vegetables not only helps keep you satisfied, but also helps stabilize blood sugars. When combined, protein and fiber can help prevent blood sugar spikes and keep it stable for longer periods of time.Aim to include a 3-4 oz serving of lean protein at every meal and snack. Go for items like: poultry, eggs, lean beef, pork, seafood, low-fat dairy and tofu.Pair your lean protein with fruits or vegetables at every meal. Aim for a 1/2 cup serving of fruit, 1 cup of vegetables or 2 cups of salad greens,or try to make half of your plate consist of fruits and vegetables.

, The risk factors for diabetes are very similar (and some are identical) to heart disease. In addition, if you're at a high risk for heart disease you're also at a higher risk for diabetes (and vice versa). Eating healthy fats can help support your cardiovascular system and manage your risk of diabetes.Healthy and nutritious sources of fat come from unsaturated fats. These are known to fight inflammation in the body, support a healthy heart, maintain the flexibility of arteries and support brain health.
The best sources of these heart healthy fats include: cold water and fatty fish (like salmon, tuna, mackerel or sardines), avocados, nuts and seeds, olive oil, canola oil, olives, and safflower oil.
Regardless if you're eating more nutritious sources of fats or the unhealthy fats, they all are more calorie dense. You always need to measure your portion sizes and only eat the recommended amounts daily. Otherwise your overall calories may be too high and could cause weight gain.
Measure out 1 tablespoon of oils, 1 oz of nuts, 3-4 oz of fish or 1/2 cup of avocado., You may think that to better manage your risk for diabetes that you should give up carbs or grains. However, eating these foods (especially from nutritious sources) does not cause diabetes nor increase your risk. Moderate how much you eat and choose the best sources.


If you're going to choose a grain product (like some bread or pasta) go for 100% whole grains. These foods are higher in fiber, protein and some minerals. They are a more nutrient dense and more nutritious choice compared to refined carbohydrates (like white bread or white rice).To make sure you consume these foods in a healthy way, measure out the appropriate portion size. Larger servings or quantities of these foods (even the whole grain ones) can be too many calories or carbohydrates overall. Measure out 1 oz of grains or 1/2 cup of cooked grains.Also, make sure you monitor how many servings you eat on a daily basis. If your diet is filled with grains, it may be unbalanced and your blood sugars may be running higher due to the higher quantity of carbohydrates. Stick to two to three servings maximum daily to help manage diabetes risk.

, Some sources of carbohydrate (like fruits or whole grains) provide a variety of nutrients and health benefits. However, there are some carbohydrates that are considered unhealthy and when eaten regularly can increase your risk for diabetes (and other chronic diseases).


There are three different types of nutrients that are carbohydrates. Fiber, starch and sugar count as carbohydrate. While fiber is a nutritious carbohydrate, some sugars and starches can be considered an unhealthier source.
Refined and processed carbohydrates have been shown to be directly linked with an increased risk of developing diabetes. Studies have shown that refined flours and sugars have increased in the diet, fiber has decreased in the diet and the prevalence of diabetes has increased.Refined carbohydrates are highly processed and many of the beneficial nutrients have been stripped away from these foods.
Refined and processed carbs come from two main groups — those made with white flour and those made with sugar. Try to limit or avoid foods like: white bread, cakes, pies, cookies, crackers, pretzels, candy, pastries, muffins, bagels, white bread, white pasta, white rice, ice cream and sweetened beverages (like sweet tea or soda).
You do not necessarily have to avoid these foods completely, however your intake should be strictly limited and portions should always be small.

, Cardiovascular or aerobic exercise can really help manage and decrease your risk of diabetes. Regular cardio exercise not only helps your body use glucose but also use insulin more effectively.Aerobic activity has immediate effects on your blood sugar. It helps stimulate your muscles to use the blood sugar in your blood stream. In addition you'll see immediate benefits on your blood pressure and cholesterol levels.
Most health professionals recommend including a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity each day. This ends up being about 30 minutes of activity five days a week.
However, even more recent studies suggest you may need up to 60 minutes of aerobic activity daily. This is especially true if you've lost weight to help reduce your risk of diabetes and are working on maintaining weight loss.
Moderate intensity activities should work your body hard enough to break a sweat. You also shouldn't be able to talk freely without taking a few breaths during sentences.
You can try walking, jogging, biking, swimming, hiking, dancing or taking spin classes for aerobic exercise.
A reasonable initial regimen is 10 minutes of stretching and warm-up, followed by 20 minutes of gentle aerobic exercise such as walking, cycling, or rowing. Cool down for another five or 10 minutes.You can also try high-intensity training. A good example of this is sprinting at 80% of your maximum heart rate for 60 seconds, followed by 60 seconds of walking. Do this for 20 minutes (plus five minutes to warm up and five minutes to cool down, totaling 30 minutes of exercise)., Health professionals don't only recommend cardiovascular activity. It's also important to include a few days of strength or resistance training. This also helps your body use glucose and insulin more effectively.Strength training specifically helps your muscles become more sensitive to insulin. This helps your muscles use glucose more effectively over time.
Strength training also helps build and maintain lean muscle mass. The more lean muscle mass you have, the more calories your body burns at rest. This can help you maintain a healthy weight.
Health professionals recommend including about one to two days of strength training each week. You don't need the same amount of strength training as you do cardiovascular exercises.
Lift weights, take a pilates or yoga class or do isometric exercise to work your muscles. Aim for a 20 minute session and exercise all your major muscle groups.

, Both cardiovascular and strength training exercises can significantly decrease your risk of diabetes. However, studies also show that increased lifestyle activity can also help manage your overall risk of diabetes.Lifestyle or baseline activities are those that you already do on a regular basis. They could be household chores, walking to and from your car, taking the elevator instead of the stairs or gardening.These activities do not burn many calories alone, but can add up to a significant amount by the end of a day. These are also great activities to start improving on if you're not currently active or have an injury.
Think about your current day and when you could be more active, move more or take more steps. Can you park farther away from your office? Can you take the stairs to your apartment? Could you stand during commercial breaks? These are all good areas for more lifestyle activity.

, An exercise log or journal is a great idea to help you track not only your exercise, but how it's affecting your diabetes risk. You can see your progress, how well you're meeting goals and help keep you on track long-term.Use a paper and pencil journal, journaling app or just take notes on a calendar you have to track your activity. Jot down notes on what type of activity you've completed and for how long.
Studies show that regular journaling can help keep you on track and help you meet whatever goals you've set for yourself long-term.
If you've been exercising regularly, compare your exercise notes with your weight or blood work levels to see how your new exercise routine is working overall.

, Staying consistent with regular exercise can be difficult. This is especially true after several weeks or months of exercising. However, if you workout with a friend or other support group, you might find it easier to stick to your exercise routine.


Studies show that with support you're more likely to meet and even exceed your exercise goals.This is especially true if your support group is also active.
Talk to your friends, family or co-workers about your goal to manage your diabetes risk with exercise. You might be surprised to find that others are also interested in increasing their physical activity.
If you can't find a friend or family member to link up with, consider researching local exercise groups. You might find local running or walking groups you can join or even join a local dance club.

, There are a variety of risk factors for diabetes. It's important to review your medical history and family history with your doctor to see what other risk factors you should manage.


Make an appointment with your primary care physician. They can review your previous medical history, family history, weight history and other lifestyle factors that may increase your risk for diabetes.
Talk to your doctor about your diet, lifestyle and weight. Ask if any of these should be changed or modified - like losing weight or exercising more.
If you have a family history of diabetes, your doctor may want to monitor you more closely. They may suggest you do blood work regularly to keep track of your risk diabetes.

, If you're overweight or obese, your risk of diabetes increases significantly. Although it may be difficult to maintain a healthy weight or lose weight, it's an essential component of managing your risk for diabetes.If you feel that you're overweight, this is something that should definitely be discussed with your physician. They may recommend you lose a certain amount or offer advice or diets to help you lose weight.
To figure out if you need to lose weight, figure out your BMI and ideal body weight. Both of these calculations can give you insight into whether or not you're at a healthy weight.
Use an online calculator to figure out your BMI. You'll need to input your weight and height for this calculation. If your BMI is 25.0–29.9 you're considered overweight and if your BMI is 30.0 or higher you're considered obese. Aim for a BMI of 20.0–24.9 for a normal and healthy weight.
For ideal body weight follow these calculations: Male: 106 + (6 x inches above 5 feet) and Female: 100 + (5 x inches above 5 feet). Subtract your current weight from your ideal body weight to find out about how many pounds of excess weight you're carrying.

, Smoking is another risk factor that is completely modifiable and in your control to change. If you're currently smoking, try to quit. Those who smoke are at a significantly higher risk for developing diabetes.Studies have now directly linked smoking to the development of diabetes. Those who smoke are 30–40% more likely to develop diabetes compared to those who don't.
It's best to quit as soon as possible and go cold turkey if you can. This is the quickest way to discontinue the stream of harmful chemicals into your body.
However, quitting cold turkey is probably one of the hardest things to do. If you're struggling, talk your doctor about taking medications to make quitting easier or joining a smoking cessation program.

, If you're at high risk for diabetes or are worried about your risk of diabetes, it may be a good idea to begin getting blood work done on a regular basis. You and your doctor can track lab values that can predict your risk for developing diabetes.If you do not currently have diabetes, you may only need to get blood work every year. However, if your physician feels you're at a higher risk for developing diabetes, they may suggest getting blood work done every six months.
One of the typical lab values that's tracked is your fasting glucose. This the amount of blood sugar circulating in your blood stream without the influence of food. If it's elevated, it might signify your body is having difficultly using insulin.
Another value that is tracked is your hemoglobin A1c. This is a percentage based value and measures the viscosity or stickiness of your blood. When this value is elevated it means your fasting sugar has been elevated for about three months or so. In addition, the higher the value, the stickier and slower moving your blood becomes.
Your doctor may also suggest monitoring your triglycerides and cholesterol levels as well. Although they are not used to diagnose diabetes, the more elevated these values are, the higher your risk of diabetes becomes.
When you get blood work done, make sure to keep copies with you overtime. This will you and your doctor track and changes or see any trends that may emerge over time.

, Although an occasional alcoholic beverage hasn't been proven to raise your risk of diabetes, it's important to moderate your intake. Regular or excessive alcohol consumption will increase your risk.Drinking alcohol affects how your liver manages your blood glucose levels. When you're drinking it is much harder to stabilize your blood sugar and insulin levels.
When you're planning on having a drink, make sure to have some food in your stomach first. This blunts alcohol's effects and helps your body manage blood sugar a little more effectively.
If you are going to drink, health professionals recommend that women consume no more than one glass daily and men limit their intake to two glasses daily.

However, if you have high blood sugar, it is usually a good idea to lower the amount of meat, dairy, white bread, white rice, potatoes, and sugary foods you consume., These foods, and other foods high in fiber and moderate in fat, are recommended for people with high blood sugar. Whole grains may not be appropriate for every person with high blood sugar, so consult your doctor before making them a major part of your diet.Fresh apples, dried apricots, or peaches canned in juice or water are good choices. Avoid canned or frozen fruits that have added sugar.At least 3 cups (700mL) of raw vegetables or 1.5 cups (350mL) cooked vegetables every day are recommended. Try artichokes, cucumbers, or salad greens. Fresh vegetables are better than frozen or canned ones, which sometimes have added sodium.Oatmeal and barley are especially good whole grain options for most people with high blood sugar.Note that eating too many carbohydrates can increase your blood sugarand cause obesity.

, If you are not certain whether a food is harmful, ask a doctor or look up the food on a glycemic index, which gives a rough idea of its effect on blood sugar (but not its overall healthiness).""High glycemic"" foods with a Glycemic Index rating of 70 or above should be avoided if you have high blood sugar. Replace these with ""low glycemic"" foods (GI rating 55 or below), such as the foods recommended above.Foods with a rating between 55 and 70 have a ""medium"" rating, and can be eaten in low to moderate amounts depending on your needs.

, If you use these substances daily or imbibe them in large quantities, you could be seriously affecting your body's ability to produce insulin, which breaks down sugar in your bloodstream.If you are trying to quit smoking, realize that products containing nicotine may cause similar effects. Nicotine patches or gum may be used as a temporary replacement, but should not be treated as a long term solution if you are concerned about high blood sugar., Newspaper headlines often make claims about managing blood sugar or other health issues with common foods, but these are not always backed up by high-quality medical studies. Studies of coffee have produced contradictory results, so its overall effect on blood sugar is unclear.One study of cinnamon found possible benefits, but only a small group of similar people were tested. All of them were people over 40, with type 2 diabetes, who were not using insulin therapy or taking medications for health conditions other than diabetes.Even if a claim seems reasonable to you, realize that one food item is never a replacement for exercise, other dietary changes, or medical treatments.

, While the following steps describe actions that are generally helpful for people with high blood sugar and associated health problems, they will not be as effective as specific recommendations tailored to your health problems and characteristics.


Visit your doctor or doctor-recommended nutritionist regularly to check on progress and keep an eye out for possible health problems that result from high blood sugar.

, While exercise reduces blood sugar in the long run, it can actually increase your blood sugar in the short term by encouraging your body to produce glucose (sugar) to fuel your muscles.If you have diabetes or other health issues that require testing your own blood sugar, it's important to check your blood sugar levels before you begin exercising and about every 30 minutes during exercise.A doctor or drugstore may be able to provide you with a blood glucose meter or testing strip for testing your blood sugar.

, If you are diabetic, it's important to adapt your exercise routine to the results of a blood sugar test, as mentioned above. Decide whether exercising is safe at this time using these instructions, or the instructions your doctor provides for your specific case:If you blood sugar is lower than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L), raise your blood sugar before exercising. A small snack containing carbohydrates should accomplish this, such as fruit or crackers. If you do not eat any carbohydrates and exercise anyway, you risk experiencing shakiness and anxiety, falling unconscious, or even entering a coma.If the test result is between 100 and 250 mg/dL (5.6–13.9 mmol/L), no action is required unless your doctor instructed you otherwise. Continue to exercise.

, If you are diabetic, and especially if you have type 1 diabetes, you should not exercise when blood sugar is high without first testing for ketones.These are substances that cause serious health problems if they build up, and exercising might increase their levels. Test your urine for ketones using as ketosis test strip from a drugstore, following the instructions carefully. Do not exercise if ketones are present, and test regularly if ketone levels are moderate or high.Seek medical attention immediately if you have very high ketone levels or if the ketone levels don't drop after 30–60 minutes.


If your blood sugar is higher than 300 mg/dL (16.7 mmol/L), do not exercise. Wait for 30–60 minutes without eating, and test again to see if your blood sugar has dropped to a level that is safe for exercising. Let a doctor or nurse know if you experience this high level of blood sugar frequently or for several hours at a time.

, Exercise helps convert glucose into energy, makes your body's cells more sensitive to insulin, and reduces excess fat, which is associated with high blood sugar.The more active you are, the less likely you are to have problems with high blood sugar.


Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise a day, for at least 5 days a week. In total, you should exercise 150 minutes or more each week.Try to find an exercise that you enjoy; this way you will be more likely to stick with it in the long run. Fast walking, swimming laps, or bicycling are common choices.

, If you have diabetes or are at risk for diabetes, keep an eye out for signs that the exercise may be causing health problems. If you feel faint, have chest pain, suddenly feel short of breath, or notice blisters or pain in your feet, stop and call your doctor., Check with your doctor to determine how often you should do this. Depending on your treatment plan, your doctor will advice you to check your levels either every day or multiple times per week.If you do not have access to medical treatment, you may still be able to find a blood sugar glucose meter or testing strip at a drugstore.

, Even if you follow a strict diet and reduce your consumption of sugar, your blood sugar levels may change unpredictably, especially if you have diabetes.Blood sugar levels tend to rise in the hour or two following a meal.Blood sugar levels decrease in the long run through physical exercise, which transfers glucose from your blood to your cells.Female menstrual cycles cause fluctuations in both hormones and blood sugar levels.Almost all medications have an influence on blood sugar levels.Be sure to check with your doctor before beginning any new medication.

, Chronic stress can release hormones that prevent insulin from working properly.Eliminate stressful aspects of your life if possible, for instance by avoiding arguments or reducing your workload. Combat stress through relaxing exercises such as meditation or yoga.

, Some people can manage blood sugar through diet and exercise alone, while others need to be prescribed diabetes medications or insulin therapy.Many doctors advise their diabetes patients to use medication, diet, and exercise to control blood sugar.Insulin injections may also be used to help manage blood glucose levels throughout the day.These can be self-administered at home.

Educate yourself about juvenile diabetes.,
Follow your doctor's treatment plan to the letter.,
Carry your supplies with you at all times including a blood glucose meter, glucose tablets and insulin.,
Follow a healthy diet and eat at regular intervals.,
Familiarize yourself with the symptoms of hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar; hyperglycemia, or high blood sugar; and ketoacidosis.,
Make people aware of your condition so that they understand your need to eat regularly and administer insulin as well as the symptoms of hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis.",How to Live With Juvenile Diabetes,"


The more you know about how your disease works, the better you will be able to understand how to live with juvenile diabetes.
Several organizations, such as the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International, the National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse and the Centers for Disease Control offer a wealth of information on diabetes treatments, research and potential complications.
Join a support group for people with juvenile diabetes. It will help you discover that, while diabetes is challenging, it will not stop you from living a full life.;
,


Take your blood sugar readings and administer your insulin as directed. Do not skip doses or attempt to administer a dose without reading your blood sugar unless your doctor directs you to do so.
Your blood sugar levels should be between 70 and 110 mb /dL before meals and between 100 and 140 mg/dL at bedtime.
Consult your physician if your blood sugar levels are consistently lower than 70 before meals, or 100 before bed; or consistently higher than 110 before meals, or 140 before bed. This could indicate that you are having trouble controlling your blood sugar and need to adjust your treatment plan.

,


Your blood sugar levels will fluctuate throughout the day depending on your activity levels and eating habits.
Some forms of insulin must be kept refrigerated. Other forms, such as the insulin pen, should not be refrigerated once in use. Consult your physician about prescribing non-refrigerated insulin that you can carry around with you.
Individuals who have to take multiple injections could also benefit from an insulin pump, an electronic device that automatically dispenses insulin at preset intervals throughout the day. Consult your physician to determine if an insulin pump is right for you.

,


There is no set ""diabetic diet"" but there are certain guidelines that can help you remain healthy: eat more whole and fresh foods than processed; reduce your intake of fast food and sugary sodas and snacks; substitute whole grains, such as whole wheat and brown rice, for refined, ""white"" grains.
Eat at least 3 meals per day and 2 snacks to keep your blood sugar levels stable. If necessary, carry food with you to ensure that you do not miss a meal.

,


Low blood sugar happens suddenly and the symptoms include: sweating, nervousness and irritability, nausea, hunger, blurred vision, headache and a rapid heartbeat. You could also experience confusion, slurred speech, an unsteady gait and in severe cases, loss of consciousness.
Treat low blood sugar by consuming a glucose tablet, a cup of fruit juice or sugary soda, or a piece of candy. Wait 30 minutes and take a blood sugar reading. If your levels are still low, administer more glucose and take another reading. If your symptoms do not resolve after three attempts, call the Emergency Services.
High blood sugar takes several days to develop and should not occur if you are monitoring your blood sugar properly. The symptoms are similar to the symptoms of untreated diabetes: increased hunger and thirst and frequent urination, blurred vision, weakness or fatigue, weight loss and a rapid heart rate.
Treat high blood sugar by administering insulin and waiting 30 minutes and testing your blood sugar. If your sugar is still high, call the Emergency Services.
Ketoacidosis occurs when your body is unable to use sugar for energy and must rapidly break down fats. The process of breaking down fats releases chemicals called ketones, which can build up in the body and make your blood acidic. Symptoms of ketoacidosis include: rapid breathing, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and breath that smells like rotting fruit.

Call the Emergency Services and administer insulin if you are experiencing ketoacidosis.

,


Notify the school nurse or, if you are in college, the campus healthcare and disability office as well as your teachers.
Notify your friends, and if you spend a lot of time at their houses or with their families, their parents as well.
If you are an adult with this condition, notify the human resources department at your place of employment and your supervisor.
Wear a medical bracelet that advises emergency personnel of your condition in the event you are in an accident and unable to speak for yourself.

Get enough protein.,
Monitor carbohydrate intake.,
Keep meals heart-healthy.,
Follow your meal plan.,
Use whole grains.,
Try fruit as sweetener.,
Focus on unsaturated fats.,
Make a smoothie.,
Scramble some eggs for a quick omelet.,
Cook a savory breakfast.,
Take nuts and fruits to-go.",How to Make Diabetes‐Friendly Breakfasts," Protein can be very helpful in managing blood sugar levels, and it’s important to integrate some into every meal. People with diabetes should aim to have 20 to 30% of their daily calories come from heart-healthy proteins, including breakfast options such as:Egg whites
Lean meats such as chicken
Plain Greek yogurt
Nuts
Beans;
, For people with diabetes, keeping carbohydrates under control is critical, and a whole breakfast shouldn’t typically go over around 30 to 45 grams of carbs. Instead of basing a meal on refined grains such as cereals, opt for choices like:Whole grains
Fresh fruits
Low-fat dairy such as skim milk
Keep in mind that, while these are healthier than refined carbs, you must still count them.

, Type 2 diabetes increases one’s risk of heart disease, so along with monitoring macronutrients, it is important to make heart healthy choices. This can impact both the type of food you eat and how that food is prepared.Meats, for example, contain protein, but lean meats like chicken and turkey are better for the heart than red meats like steak or fatty meats like bacon, as they have less saturated fat.
Prepare foods in a heart-healthy way by avoiding additions like butter or excessive oil. Opt to crisp turkey bacon in the oven rather than frying it, and try poaching an egg rather than scrambling it with cream or butter.

, Though there are general guidelines for meal planning for people with diabetes, it is essential you work with your doctor or a registered dietitian to design a meal plan specific to your needs. Nutrition is the cornerstone of diabetes management, and following an individualized meal plan will help you manage your blood sugar and keep it in a healthy range.Your meal plan should give you guidelines for consuming carbs, such as how many you can have at each meal and how many should come from fruits and vegetables.
If your meal plan gives you different guidelines than those outlined in this article, follow your meal plan and the advice of your doctor.

, Swap out processed grains for their whole grain counterparts. Many breakfast foods, including breads, cereals, and pastries, have wholegrain versions, generally available at most markets and health food stores.Read the label carefully when looking for whole grains. Make sure it says “100% whole grain,” or “100% whole wheat.” Otherwise, the food might contain mostly processed grains and only some whole grain.
Opt to use whole wheat flour in baked goods and breakfast breads such as pancakes and muffins.

, Where you would normally use sugar or a sugary product, swap in fruit. A fruit puree makes a great substitute for jelly or jam, and some banana or apple slices easily replace brown sugar on oatmeal and porridge.Look at the amount of refined sugars in some of your sweet breakfast options. Where you see an excess of sugar, think about ways in which you can incorporate fruit instead of a refined product.

, Instead of butter, ghee, lard, or other saturated fats, trying cooking with small amounts unsaturated fat oils. In strict moderation, oils like olive, grapeseed, and sunflower seed oil can replace butter or other saturated fats.Always oils to the necessary minimum amount. Try not to over-grease pans or add extra oils into a recipe unless they are strictly called for.

, Use fresh fruits and low-fat yogurts to make a refreshing smoothie for a morning meal. Avoid using fruit juices and opt for high-protein yogurts such as Greek yogurt to get the most out of your meal.Blend together a cup of fresh or frozen fruit like strawberries and a banana, a quarter of a cup of plain Greek yogurt, and a few ice cubes to make a diabetes-friendly morning breakfast.
Avoid adding sweeteners unless you find it absolutely necessary. Fruit is often very sweet on its own.

, Instead of putting a lot of time into making a full omelet, scramble one egg with an additional egg white, and add some chicken or turkey bacon, spinach, green beans, or other lean meats and vegetables.Sprinkle a bit of low-fat cheese and add some rosemary or green onions on top to finish the dish.
You can use fresh vegetables, or microwave frozen vegetables and add them on top of your eggs.

, Try a breakfast burrito or a breakfast scramble to help you add savory foods such as lean meats into your breakfast. Use a low carb tortilla or wrap and add scrambled egg whites, chicken, spinach, onion and peppers to make an easy and healthy breakfast wrap that you can take on-the-go.You can also choose to top your scrambled egg whites with a baked white fish filet, some onions, spinach, and low-fat feta for a Mediterranean-style breakfast.

, If you need a fast breakfast that you don't have to prepare, a handful of almonds or pistachios and a piece of fresh fruit such as an apple or peach can make a quick and easy breakfast.You can even keep canisters of nuts at school, work, or anyplace you visit regularly to help make sure you get a healthy breakfast every day.

Shop around for the best price.,
Research lower-priced options.,
Contact pharmaceutical companies for assistance.,
Apply for help from an assistance program.",How to Lower Your Prescription Insulin Costs1," The cost of insulin products is not the same at all pharmacies. Every pharmacy sets its own price and large chains can often use their buying power to demand lower prices from the pharmaceutical companies. Ideally, these savings are then passed on to you.Compare prices at the pharmacies of big box stores, local pharmacies, and online sellers. If may be more cost effective to buy insulin online, even with shipping costs.;
, There are a wide variety of insulin products on the market and they all have different pricing. For example, longer lasting insulins, which only have the advantage of being injected once a day instead of multiple times and may not work any better, are typically more expensive than shorter-lasting insulins.Make a list of products that you think might cost you less. You can then take this list to your doctor and discuss your options.

, Most pharmaceutical companies that make insulin have financial assistance programs for low-income individuals that need their products. In order to get insulin at a discounted price from a pharmaceutical company, you will need to apply to their programs and meet their eligibility requirements.Each company has a different financial assistance program. These programs have slightly different requirements, so you may qualify for one and not for another.

, There are non-profit assistance programs that can help you find financial support if you cannot afford your insulin. These programs work by searching all pharmaceutical company assistance programs and government sponsored and other discount programs in order to find one that will be right for you.These programs are helpful because they remove the work of you contacting each pharmaceutical company individually.
In order to use one of these programs you will need to fill out an application. They will ask for your basic information, your income, and your monthly insulin costs.
If you meet the eligibility requirements, these programs can reduce your insulin costs dramatically.

Compare insulin prices through your insurer.,
Discuss changing products with your doctor.,
Increase your insurance coverage.,
See if you qualify for government assistance.",How to Lower Your Prescription Insulin Costs2," Different types of insulin could be covered differently through your insurer. Either call your insurer or have your medical office look into the coverage and out of pocket expense to you for different products.


Knowing that another product might be cheaper for you will not mean that you automatically can switch to that product. However, it does mean that you can discuss this option with your doctor.

, While your doctor may have you on a specific product for a therapeutic reason, discuss whether a cheaper product would serve your needs just as well. For instance, if you are on basic insulin therapy using an analog insulin, discuss the possibility of switching to human insulin, which is less expensive in general.You may need to educate your doctor a little bit about what you pay for insulin. Many doctors do not know how much medications actually cost patients. If you tell them how much you pay for insulin, and how that impacts you financially, they may be more open to finding alternatives.

, If you cannot get assistance on your insulin costs from pharmaceutical companies, you may want to consider getting medical insurance or changing insurance policies so that your out of pocket cost is reduced. In order to do this, you will need to figure out if it will be more cost effective to pay more for insurance or if the added cost for better insurance will be more than the coverage on insulin it offers.


If you have health insurance through your employer, you may not have the option of increasing your coverage or changing programs. Discuss your options with your human resources personnel at work or with a representative from your health insurance.
Even if you cannot get health insurance through your employer and you don't qualify for a public program, it may be in your financial interest to get an individual health plan., For instance, if you are 65 years old or older in the United States, you may qualify for Medicare or Medicaid, which could cover some of your prescription drug costs. Additionally, under the Affordable Care Act, you could qualify for government assistance no matter what age you are, if you are below the poverty line.Medicaid is a state health insurance program that is partially funded by the federal government for those with low incomes.


The prescription coverage under Medicare is called ""Medicare Part D."" This coverage requires that you pay a premium. However, if you are below the poverty line, there may be assistance programs that cover the premium costs.

Do not stop taking your insulin.,
Do not cut back on your insulin.,
Don't buy insulin from untrustworthy sources.",How to Lower Your Prescription Insulin Costs3," Even though insulin can be very expensive, not taking your insulin is not a good way to cut back on your expenses. Not only can it put your life in danger, it could make you very sick and increase your medical costs in the long run. Completely stopping your insulin may result in a life-threatening emergency, especially for type 1 diabetics, since their bodies do not produce any insulin on their own. A type 2 diabetic may be able to decrease or stop insulin through diet and exercise, but should only do so under the direction of a doctor., It may be tempting to just skip an injection of insulin if you are having difficulty paying for it. However, skipping treatment for your diabetes can increase the speed at which the negative symptoms of diabetes occur. This means that you could begin to have problems with your heart, feet, kidneys, or eyes sooner than if you took your insulin as prescribed.Having to deal with the negative side effects of diabetes will cost you more, both in terms of money and quality of life, in the long run than taking your insulin regularly.
If you skip doses of your insulin it can cause dangerous complications , such as damage to your eyes, heart, blood vessels, nervous system, mouth, feet, and kidneys., It may be tempting to buy insulin from suppliers that offer extremely low prices online. However, if you do not know the source, you should avoid buying these products. These offers could be scams or they could send you medications that are not good quality products.


There are a lot of online suppliers that sell secondhand diabetes supplies, such as testing strips. These products will be cheaper for you to buy but the integrity and quality of the product may be less than perfect.There are a few insulin products available over-the-counter from reputable pharmacies. Keep in mind, changing insulin types or taking insulin without being under the care of a doctor can be unsafe and may cost you more in medical costs over time."

Eat complex carbohydrates.,
Choose fish and skinless poultry for protein.,
Include lots of vegetables.,
Drink more water.,
Read labels.",How to Lower Blood Sugar Without Insulin1," Make sure that at least half of your carbohydrates from complex carbohydrates. Complex carbohydrates are made up of individual sugar molecules that are strung together in long, complicated and often branched chains. These types of carbohydrates have more nutritional value than their simple counterparts and are less likely to cause your blood sugar to spike.Complex carbohydrates are found in whole, unprocessed foods, such as whole grain bread, brown rice, buckwheat, millet, quinoa, oats, starchy vegetables such as sweet potatoes, corn, pumpkin and squash, beans, peas, lentils, nuts and seeds.
Avoid simple carbohydrates. Simple carbohydrates include added sugars like glucose, sucrose (table sugar), and fructose (high fructose corn syrup or HFCS). Consuming HFCS has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and obesity.A general recommendation is to have 45–60 grams of complex carbohydrates at every meal.Eat most of your complex carbohydrates at breakfast and lunch. Only have a small portion of complex carbohydrates for dinner.;
, Getting enough quality protein is an important part of controlling your blood sugar.Make sure that any poultry you eat is skinless to reduce the amount of unhealthy animal fats you consume and eat a couple of servings of wild-caught fish each week.


Wild-caught fish such as salmon, cod, haddock and tuna are good sources of omega-3 fatty acids.

, It is essential to eat plenty of non-root or starchy vegetables such as broccoli, leafy greens, cauliflower, and beans. These types of vegetables are low in calories, high in fiber, and nutrient dense.Keep in mind that you can still eat fruit, but you will have to count the carbohydrates as part of your 45–60 grams per meal. On average, a serving of fresh, frozen, or canned fruit has 15 grams of sugar., Water flushes out toxins and helps maintain electrolyte balance. Women should consume about 2.7 liters (91 ounces, or 11 cups) of fluids each day, and men should consume about 3.7 liters (125 ounces daily, or 15 cups) of total fluids.Be aware that this includes water from other foods and beverages, not just pure water.Ask your doctor if you have any special fluid restrictions or needs that you should consider.


Avoid sugary beverages. Sugary beverages will cause your blood sugar to spike, so it is best to avoid these to keep your blood sugar under control.Choose water, unsweetened sparkling water, or unsweetened iced tea instead of sugary soda.

, Reading labels can help you figure out how much sugar is in food and inform your decision of whether or not you should buy that product. Be aware that manufacturers are not required to list added sugars. That is why it is best to choose whole, unprocessed foods as often as possible.Avoid foods labeled with terms like “enriched” or “refined.”

Be sure to take careful note of what your doctor recommends and follow guidelines accordingly.


Glucose is your body's main energy source, so you need to maintain a certain and consistent range for your entire body to function well.;
, People with type 1 diabetes must take insulin (those with type 2 diabetes may use other treatments). It is important to adjust your levels of insulin in accordance with doctor’s orders so that you can lower your blood glucose. Insulin levels may be altered according to a change in exercise or meal plan.It's important not only to take insulin, but to be diligent and adjust the dose according to glucose level outlined by your doctor


Insulin comes in various forms such as vials, pre-filled pens and pumps.
Injection sites should be chosen carefully, depending on your level of physical activity.
Insulin amounts vary for each individual.
Medication’s effectiveness is dependent upon dosage and time of day it is taken.

, It is vital that you consistently check your blood sugar levels so you stay within a healthy range as recommended by your doctor. By watching your levels you can avoid hypoglycemia, which is low blood sugar and hyperglycemia, which is high blood sugar. , It is a must to keep snacks with you at all times to help control your blood sugar levels.Carbohydrate-rich foods will raise your blood glucose levels.
Good options for snacks with carbs and protein are almonds, string cheese, hummus, apples, carrots, cantaloupe, cottage cheese, bananas, and peanut butter.
Consider keeping a log of your glucose level, time, and insulin dosing. You can do this on paper or even on your phone — there are apps that will help you easily log and track your levels.Your doctor can use this information to look for patterns in your glucose levels, and it can help you identify which foods cause a spike in your glucose levels.

, Many people with diabetes may not be aware of these two causes of high glucose levels, in particular in the morning before the person eats breakfast.The dawn phenomenon occurs because the liver releases large amounts of sugar in response to certain hormones. In response, the body will normally release insulin; since people with type 1 diabetes can't create insulin, this may cause their glucose levels to be high when they first wake up.The Somogyi effect often occurs in patients who take insulin but don't eat a regular bedtime snack. The person's glucose levels drop during the night, and the body will respond by releasing sugar. Thus, when the person wakes up, he will have higher-than-normal glucose levels.To tell if you are experiencing the dawn phenomenon or Somogyi effect, check glucose levels before bed, then again around 2 a.m., then when you wake up. Do this for a few days, noting your levels at all of these times. If the person's glucose levels are low at 2 a.m., it is likely the Somogyi effect. If they are normal or high, then the person may be experiencing the dawn phenomenon., Exercise involves any physical activity that gets your body moving and it helps diabetics in a number of ways. Walking, light jogging, heavy cleaning, yard work, etc. are all considered forms of exercise.
Exercise helps with: glucose levels, blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, energy, fitness and well-being.

, Type 1 diabetes is often considered a balancing act and the amount of physical activity you get needs to be at equilibrium with the food you eat and medications you are prescribed. You will meet with your doctor regularly to adjust your dosage of insulin and medication as your diet and level of exercise changes. Your doctor will keep a book that records your medication, insulin, activity level, and any changes to them.
Be sure to make your doctor aware of any major changes to your exercise level or meal plan.

, With type 1 diabetes, you must balance your activities with what you are eating and the medicine you are taking. In order to discover how different types of exercise affect your levels of glucose, monitor your levels. Be sure to record your levels before, during and after exercise. Certain activities affect your blood glucose level more than others.
Your body’s blood glucose levels will be affected in various ways depending on: a change in your dosage of insulin, length of workout, intensity of workout, and level of glucose, pre-workout.

, Make sure you are prepared for a drop or rise in blood glucose levels. By packing yourself some snacks to take with you when you exercise, you will be well-equipped to raise your blood glucose level if necessary or to choose appropriate activities if your blood glucose levels rise. Snack on foods or drinks high in carbohydrates if you test low for blood glucose.
Avoid intense exercises if you test high for blood glucose levels and/or if your urine tests positive for ketones.

, It is a good idea to get in touch with a registered professional such as a dietician or nutritionist when coming up with a safe and healthy meal plan to treat your type 1 diabetes.Speak with a specialist such as a certified diabetes educator.
A specialist can act as part of your support system.
Your specialist can answer any food-related questions or concerns.
Your specialist can teach you the importance of portion sizes and how to count carbohydrates.
Meet with your specialist on a regular basis to develop, maintain, and change meal plans.

, Carbohydrates affect your blood sugar differently than proteins and fats because not all nutrients affect blood sugar the same way. Carbohydrates affect blood sugar levels significantly more than fats and proteins.


Proteins role in your body is to steady the level of blood sugar.
When eating just by itself, fat doesn’t affect your blood glucose levels, it essentially keeps them steady.
Carbohydrates raise blood sugar, which can be good when your levels drop but the proper consumption of fats and proteins can actually help lessen the impact of carbohydrates on your blood sugar levels.

, Skipping meals is no way to control your blood sugar. In fact, it can cause your level of blood sugar to rise. Make sure you are eating at least three meals a day along with some snack thrown in. , Dietary guidelines for people suffering from type 1 diabetes are not all that different from those without diabetes. Simply make certain you eat well-balanced and nutritional meals. Consume foods that contain lots of nutrients.
For each meal, eat a serving of vegetables without starch such as broccoli, carrots, peppers, mushrooms, spinach and cucumbers.
Try and eat at least one serving of starchy foods per meal like, corn, potatoes, whole grain rice and bread, peas, and cooked beans.
Low-sodium foods are best.
Avoid drinks containing a lot of sugar.
Have a glass of low-fat or fat-free milk with each meal.

, It is just as important to maintain a diet that consists of food you enjoy as it is to maintain one that controls your blood sugar levels. This way, you are more likely to adhere to the diet because you are enjoying the foods you eat. Create a plan that include both snacks and full meals that can be easily incorporated every day. itMeal plans must be customized because not every meal plan will work for everyone.
Make adjustments when necessary.
Don’t overeat.
Be sure to eat three meals per day if that is what you’re used to or several small meals per day if you eating habits are more like that.
Create eating patterns by making sure you eat around the same time each day and eating meals with similar amounts of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.

There is no RDA for biotin, but a daily intakes for adults should be between 30–100 micrograms.Niacin (Vitamin B3). The RDA is different for men and women. Men need about 14 mg of Niacin per day while women need 16 mg of niacin per day.Vitamin B6. The RDA for vitamin B6 varies by age and sex. For men ages 19-50 1.3 mg per day, for men ages 51 and up 1.7 mg per day, for women ages 19–50 1.3 mg per day, and for women ages 51 and up 1.5 mg per day.Vitamin B12. The RDA for adults for vitamin B12 is 2.4 micrograms per day. Pregnant women require 2.6 micrograms per day and lactating women require 2.8 micrograms per day.Vitamin C. The RDA for vitamin C is 90 mg per day for men and 75 mg per day for women.Vitamin D. The RDA for vitamin D is 15 micrograms per day for people between the ages of 1–70 and 20 micrograms per day for those over 70., Trace minerals are important, but they are only needed in small amounts. Trace minerals are necessary for health, but they can cause toxicity in high amounts. Talk to your physician regarding these minerals and always follow dosing instructions from the manufacturers. Make sure that you are getting enough of the following minerals in the amounts needed to meet your recommended daily allowance(RDA):Magnesium. The RDAs for magnesium vary based on age and sex. Men ages 19-30 require 400 mg per day, men ages 31 and up require 420 mg per day, women ages 19-30 require 310 mg per day, and women ages 31 and up require 320 mg per day.Zinc. For Zinc, the RDA for men is 11 mg and for women 8 mg.Chromium. The RDA for chromium varies by sex and age. The RDA is 35 micrograms per day for men between the ages of 19 and 50, 30 micrograms per day for men over the age of 50, 25 micrograms per day for women between the ages of 19 and 50, and 20 micrograms per day for women over the age of 50.Vanadium. There is no RDA for vanadium, but 1.8 mg per day is the general recommendation.

Potassium. The RDA for potassium is 3,500 mg.Manganese. The RDA for manganese for men is 2.3 mg per day and for women 1.8 mg per day.Selenium. The RDA for selenium is 55 micrograms per day., Some herbs and other supplements may also help with blood sugar levels, but make sure that you check with your doctor first before incorporating any herbs or other supplements. If you plan to use any herbs or supplements, follow the manufacturer’s instructions as well as your physician’s advice. Some of the other herbs and supplements that you may want to consider are:Bitter melon
Coptis chinensis
Gymnema sylvestre
Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA)
CarnitineCoEnzyme Q10 (CoQ10)Omega-3 fatty acids
Evening primrose oil

Make an appointment with your doctor.,
Ask your doctor about medications that you can use to control blood sugar.,
Follow your doctor’s instructions for taking medications.,
Learn about side effects.",How to Lower Blood Sugar Without Insulin3," Diabetes is a serious condition that requires medical treatment. If you already have diabetes, make sure that you seek treatment. If you are concerned about your blood sugar levels because diabetes runs in your family, talk to your doctor. It is also important to let your physician know if you have changed your diet or added any supplements to help improve blood sugar control.


Make sure to get regular checkups, including blood tests as advised by your physician.

, There are many different medications available that may help you to control your blood sugar levels.Talk to your doctor to determine if there is a medication that will work well for you.



Sulfonylureas. Sulfonylureas stimulate insulin secretion. Examples include Glibenclamide (Micronase®), Glimepiride (Amaryl®) and Glipizide (Glucotrol®).

Alpha-Glucosidase Inhibitors. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors delay glucose absorption after a meal. An example is Acarbose (Precose®)

Glinides. Glinides stimulate the secretion of insulin and include Repaglinide (NovoNorm®, Prandin®, GlucoNorm®).

Biguanides. Biguanides make the cells less insulin resistant. These include metformin formulations such as Glucophage®, Glucophage XR®, Riomet®, Fortamet®, Glumetza®, Obimet®, Dianben®, Diabex® and Diaformin®.

Dipeptidyl Peptidase-IV Inhibitors. Dipeptidyl Peptidase-IV Inhibitors prevent the breakdown of certain proteins that improve glucose tolerance. Sitagliptin (Januvia®) and Linagliptin (Tradjenta®) are dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitors.

, If your doctor prescribes a medication for you, it is important to take them exactly as instructed. Do not change your dosage or stop taking the medication without talking to your doctor first.

, The medications prescribed to help treat diabetes may have some side effects. Ask your doctor about the potential side effects of any drug before you decide to try it.


Keep in mind that you will still have to monitor your blood sugar levels while taking these medications as well as follow diet and exercise recommendations.

Grab a new diaper from the package and prepare it for use, by separating the cling at the diaper's containment zone.,
Try to prevent overuse or overspray during diaper changing times.,
Remove the diaper using the same method as described in the similar-styled (toddler-like)bedwetting diaper removal method, all while substituting the adult for the child.

,
Identify the status of whether or not the wearer's diaper needs changing.

,
Hold onto the wearer's diaper front panel with both of your hands.,
Pull the diaper forcibly outward.,
Let go of the diaper, when the diaper is laying flat in front of the wearer on the surface of the changing area.

,
Lift the wearer's legs with the ankle-hold technique, or if the wearer is capable of doing this by themselves, ask them to lift only their rear-end up and off of the diaper-changing surface.,Wipe their genital area with a bathroom wipe or toilet paper, or even a soft paper towel or bathroom washcloth.,
Continue holding onto the wearer's legs as you slide (with your other hand), the diaper out) from underneath the wearer.

,
Lower the wearer's feet down onto the changing surface again, when the old diaper has been fully placed to the wearer's one side.

,
Set this old diaper to the side, as the caregiver will be cleaning up the mess a bit later.,
Ask the wearer to stand up on their feet.,
Insert one of the wearer's legs into one of the foot holes of the diaper.

,
Repeat the previous step by substituting the opposite leg for the one you previously used, into the other hole of the diaper.

,
Pull up the pant just like any other pair of underwear.",How to Change a Disposable Pull‐Up Style Adult Diaper1," Place it nearby when this step is complete.;
, Use a waterproof changing pad when changing a disposable adult diaper. These precautionary extra measures may be purchased at most supermarket chain stores, where adult disposable diapers are sold.

For those wearers who are super cost-conscious, as long as you don't mind doing a few more items in your washing machine, spread out some bath towels on the changing surface you'll be using in lieu of these underpadding layers. Kitchen and hand towels tend to cover a smaller surface area, so avoid these at all costs.

,,, Keep your hands next to one another near the center of the diaper with a 5-fingered pinching grasp.

, You should hear a ripping sound. At this point, this sound is normal.This sound will later become a sound you don't want to hear, but for now, the ripping sound is A-Okay!).

,, You can't bring the feet up as far as when the wearer was when they were children, but if you can get them up more than a few inches, it's okay.


If you can't bring them up far enough, you may need to roll them over.

,,,, No need to complete that step now.

, If you other problems require you to not stand up, you may help guide the pull-up styled adult diaper, over the adults body, much like the method you used when you changed the last pull up diaper on other toddler/kids, as you'll be found hanging your feet over the edge of the changing surface's outer side and sliding the diaper up into position.

,,,


Make sure the taller side is facing the wearer's rear-end as you pull up the diaper. If you realize that this is not the case after pulling the pant all the way up, you won't need a new diaper; just pull the pant all the way downwards, step out of the diaper, turn the diaper around, and step back into this pant and re-apply.

"
"
Ask the wearer to stand up or lean against a wall.,
Unruffle the static cling of the new disposable pull-up diaper.,
Remove the old diaper from the wearer's body.,
Step forward for a second, while not holding onto the old diaper.,Wipe the wearer to ensure they are clean and make sure they are dry before applying the new diaper.,
Grab a new diaper and place it up against the same wall from which you used to remove the old diaper.,
Place a clean diaper in front of the wearer on the floor and open it so it's easy to step into.,
Have the wearer step into both of the foot-sized holes in one of the sides of the garment.,
Pull the diaper up just a bit using both hands in a synchronous form.,
Make some final adjustments to the diaper's containment zone, if you see the diaper is not quite situated correctly or the diaper's side ruffles near the zone aren't correctly situated on the wearer's body.",How to Change a Disposable Pull‐Up Style Adult Diaper2," The solid wall must be able to hold the diaper as you are applying it on the wearer.

, Take it out of the package and un-ruffle the static cling from the railing sides of the diaper's containment zone.

, It really doesn't matter if the old diaper rips by it's tapes or not at this point. Pull the diaper tapes off from the front of the old diaper, in any way possible. Rip it off the person's body, if needed.

, It will fall off of the wearer. If the wearer would like, you may hold the diaper on the outside down near the crotch of their diaper, and let it drop. After it has dropped to about knee-length height, you may pull the diaper gently out from under them.

,, Make sure it is propped up against the wall, so that the back of the pant is shown to be on top of the front, and so that only the outer plastic isn't seen.


Don't allow the wearer to step backwards quite yet. The adjustment of the diaper to the wall is a critical step in getting just the right fit of the diaper to the wearer.
Make sure the pant is hanging freely.
Allow a caregiver to assist, if one is available.

, The placement doesn't have to be perfect, but it can help better acquaint the wearer to the placement of their new diaper.


Locate the back of the pant with the tag-like icon/strip mentioning the back of the pant. Notice that many adult disposable diapers will have a tag-like icon or strip that will indicate which portion of the pant is the back of the pant.







, But don't pull the pant up the person's legs just yet.


If you need to, you can pull the diaper up a little to help steady it, but pulling it up shouldn't be needed often and too much so go easy on this.

, The caretaker might have to pull the diaper up about an additional two to three inches from the default position, to ensure they can properly see the effective area of the diaper's strip that might be facing them.


Hold both sides of the diaper firmly onto the wearer's body as you pull them up the person's body, the remainder of the way.

, If you don't do this, it can cause the diaper's chemicals to not ""activate"" if and when the wearer urinates into them (and thereby will allow the water to flow out of the diaper and onto the surrounding surfaces and that can cause a big mess).


To prevent leakage in the diaper, always remember to unruffle the sides of the diaper using one of your hands' thumbs and pinkies, as you push the side ruffles outward a bit (no matter what type of diaper you wear (whether it be pull-up style or not)).

Take a sulfonylurea medication.,
Try a meglitinide medicine.",How to Increase Insulin Levels1," Sometimes, diabetes cannot be controlled with lifestyle alone and you need to take medications. Medications such as glyburide (DiaBeta, Glynase), glipizide (Glucotrol), and glimepiride (Amaryl) increase how much insulin your body makes.Your doctor will prescribe one of these medications and you will work together to monitor your blood sugar.You might experience weight gain with sulfonylureas, and sometimes they cause low blood sugar.;
, The meglitinides also increase how much insulin your body makes. They work faster than sulfonylureas but don’t last as long, and they’re less likely to cause low blood sugar. If a Meglitinide is right for you, your doctor will prescribe a medication such as repaglinide (Prandin) or nateglinide (Starlix).You might gain weight with these medicines, too.

"
"
Decide on the right type of insulin with your doctor.,
Take insulin injections.,
Use an insulin pen.,
Get an insulin pump.",How to Increase Insulin Levels2," When lifestyle and medications don’t control your blood sugar, you may need to take insulin directly. There are long-acting and short-acting types of insulin, and you and your doctor will have to work together to decide on the right dose, timing, and type of insulin for you. You will need to test your blood sugar regularly at home if you’re taking insulin.Keep a blood sugar log so you can manage your treatment. Ask your doctor if you should check your sugar before or after meals. Write down the time, if it’s before or after you ate, what your blood sugar is, when you last had insulin, and what the dose was.
Keep track of changes in your blood sugar before and after you exercise., Insulin is often given as an injection using a syringe. Giving yourself insulin shots properly is important, so have your doctor demonstrate how to do it correctly. Ask any questions you have, for instance, “At what angle do I inject myself?” or, “Where are the best places to inject insulin?” Your doctor can probably refer you to a diabetes specialist to help you manage your insulin. Follow these general guidelines for insulin injections:Keep your insulin in the refrigerator.
Use a new syringe for every injection.
Rotate your injection site.
Do not use expired insulin.

, Managing diabetes may be easier, and more comfortable, if you use an insulin pen. These hand-held devices use smaller needles than syringes and can be conveniently carried around. Have your doctor or diabetes nurse show you how to use your pen properly, and follow similar guidelines for rotating injection sites and properly storing your pen., Insulin pumps are small electronic devices that are attached to your body and deliver insulin through a small tube implanted into your side. It provides insulin continuously, which helps to avoid big spikes and drops in blood sugar. Discuss the risks and benefits of using a pump with your doctor – the convenience and comfort are often factors for users.You still have to monitor your blood sugar at home.

"
"
Eat a healthy diet.,
Exercise five days a week.,
Take medication that improves insulin sensitivity.,
Increase your brown fat.",How to Increase Insulin Levels3," Manage insulin resistance naturally by eating a diet low in sugar and fatty meats, and high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Eat foods high in fiber like peas, beans, lentils, bran, oatmeal, and whole wheat.A dietitian can help you develop the best diet to manage your insulin resistance.

Stay away from sweets, including sugary sodas.Skip processed snack foods like chips and other “junk-food” aisle products.
Choose lean poultry and fish over red meat.

, Get aerobic exercise for at least thirty minutes, five days a week. Do anything that makes you sweat and raises your heart rate, like walking, biking, or swimming.Get creative – try dance, a sport, or an exercise class.

Talk to your doctor before starting a new exercise regime, especially if you’re diabetic. Ask your doctor how exercise affects your blood sugar, and what you need to do to manage it.

, Metformin is usually the first medicine prescribed for diabetes.It improves how your body uses the insulin you have. If you need further medical help to lower blood sugar, your doctor may try a medication like Avandiaor Actos– though these can have serious side effects.

Often a combination of medications with different effects on the body will be used to simultaneously increase the insulin you make, improve how you use insulin, and lower blood sugar other ways.

, Brown fat exists in small amounts in your body. In contrast to the white fat you think of when you think of weight gain, brown fat burns calories at a supercharged rate.It may be able to improve your body's sensitivity to insulin.Studies are still being done on brown fat, but the best ways to increase it seem to be:

Cool your body down for 2-3 hours a day by sitting in a cold room, taking cool baths or showers, or taking a long walk outside in a cool climate. Cold weather stimulates brown fat production.
Exercise regularly in a cool environment (mid-60’s F).
Get plenty of iron in your diet, and eat plant fats over animal fats (cook with olive oil instead of butter, for instance).

Keep track of your child’s thirst.,
Notice if your child urinates more frequently than normal.,
Pay attention to any unexplained weight loss.,
Note if your child suddenly has an increase in hunger.,
Notice if your child suddenly seems fatigued all the time.,
Take note if your child complains of blurry vision.",How to Know if Your Child Has Juvenile Diabetes1," All the symptoms of type 1 diabetes are a result of hyperglycemia, or high glucose in the body, and the body working to balance it out. Increased thirst (polydipsia) is one of the most common symptoms. Extreme thirst occurs as a result of the body trying to flush out all of the glucose in the blood stream since it can't be of use (because there is no insulin to escort it into the cells). Your child may feel thirsty all the time, or may drink unusually large amounts of water that are far beyond their normal daily fluid intake. According to standard guidelines, children should drink between five to eight glasses of fluids per day. Young children (ages 5 – 8) should drink less (about five glasses), and older children should drink more (eight glasses).However, these are ideal guidelines, and only you can know how much water and other liquids your child actually intakes on a daily base. Thus, the assessment of increased thirst is relative to what your child usually consumes. If they usually drink just about three glasses of water and a glass of milk with dinner, but now constantly ask for water and other drinks and are drinking a lot more than their usual three to four glasses a day, this may be cause for concern.
Your child may feel a thirst that cannot be quenched even if they intake a lot of water. They may even still appear dehydrated.;
, Increased frequency of urination, also known as polyuria, is the body's attempt to filter out the glucose with urination. Of course, it is also a result of increased thirst. As your child drinks more water, the body will produce more urine, resulting in considerably higher incidences of urination.Be especially vigilant about the nighttime and check to see if your child is urinating more than usual in the middle of the night.There is not an average number of times that children urinate a day; this depends on their food and water intake and so what is normal for one child will not necessarily be normal for another. However, you can compare your child's current frequency of urination relative to his past frequency. If in general, your child went to the bathroom about seven times a day, but is now going 12 times a day, this is cause for concern. This is also why the nighttime is a good time for observation or awareness. If your child never got up in the middle of the night to pee, but is now up two, three or four times a night, you should take them to the doctor for testing.
Also look for signs that your child is dehydrated from urinating so much. The child may have sunken eyes, a dry mouth, and a loss of elasticity in the skin (try lifting the skin on the back of the hand upwards in a tent shape. If it doesn't bounce back immediately, this is a sign of dehydration).You should also pay close attention if your child starts wetting the bed again. This is particularly important if your child has already been potty trained and has not wet the bed for a long time.

, Juvenile diabetes commonly causes weight loss due to metabolic derangements linked to increased blood sugar levels. Very often the weight loss is rapid, although at times it may progress gradually.Your child could be losing weight and may even appear emaciated or skinny and weak due to juvenile diabetes. Note that a loss of muscle bulk also often accompanies the weight loss due to type 1 diabetes.As a general rule, unintentional weight loss almost always warrants consultation with a medical professional.

, The resultant muscle and fat breakdown, along with calorie loss, stemming from type 1 diabetes further leads to loss of energy and subsequent increased hunger. Thus, there is a paradox here — your child could be losing weight even as they demonstrate a noticeable increase in appetite.Polyphagia, or extreme hunger, results when the body attempts to get the glucose that its cells need from the blood. Your child's body wants more food to try to get that glucose for energy, but it cannot. Without insulin, it doesn't matter how your child eats; the glucose from the food will float around their bloodstream and never make it into the cells.
Note that there is no medical or scientific benchmark to assess your child's hunger. Some children naturally eat more than others. Keep in mind that children tend to be hungrier when they experience a growth spurt. Your best bet is to measure your child's behavior with their previous behavior to assess whether they seem considerably more hungry than usual. For example, if your child would usually pick at their three meals a day but for a few weeks has been eating everything on their plate and even asking for more, this may be a warning sign. If this is accompanied by increased thirst and trips to the bathroom, it is less likely to just be a sign of a growth spurt.

, The loss of calories and glucose required for energy production, as well as fat and muscle breakdown, will generally result in tiredness and a disinterest in normally beloved games and activities.Sometimes children also tend to become irritable and have mood swings as a result of the exhaustion.
As with the other symptoms mentioned above, you will need to assess your child's sleeping patterns based on what is normal for them. If they usually sleep seven hours a night but is now sleeping 10 hours and still complains of being tired or shows signs of being sleepy, slow, or lethargic even after a full night's sleep, you should take note. This may be a sign that they are not just experiencing a growth spurt or a period of tiredness, but that diabetes may be at work.

, High blood sugar levels change the water content of the optical lens and cause the lens to swell, leading to hazy, cloudy, or blurred vision. If your child complains of blurry eyesight, and repeated visits to the ophthalmologist have been of no use, consult a doctor to rule out Type-1 diabetes.Blurry vision usually resolves with the stabilization of blood sugars.

Take your blood sugar.,
Ask how often you need to check your sugar.,
Record the glucose level.,
Know your target range.,
Keep track throughout the day.,
Record what you ate.,
Write down your emotions, too.,
Guesstimate the number of carbohydrates.,
Note the medications you took.,
Understand the purpose.,
Compare the two sides and look for trends.,
Discuss it with your doctor.,
Make it enjoyable.",How to Keep a Diabetes Journal," The first step in keeping a record of your readings is taking your blood sugar. Your blood sugar is a measurement of how much sugar is in your blood.Wash your hands first. It's important to start with a clean hands, as you can introduce infections with the lancing device.Another option is using an alcoholic wipe on the area where you're going to lance. Turn on your meter, and put a testing strip in it.
Place the lancing device on the appropriate area. Most of the time, you'll use the side of your finger. However, some devices let you use other areas, such as your thigh or arm.If you suspect high or low blood sugar, it's best to use your finger, as it has the most up-to-date blood sugar level; glucose gets to the fingertips faster than other sites.Prick yourself. Draw the spring end of the lancet out and let go, allowing the part up against your skin to prick you. Watch for the blood to start pooling up.If it doesn't, you can squeeze your finger a bit to push out the blood.
Use the end of the strip to catch the blood. The strip should soak the blood up, and a reading will pop up on your meter.;
, Before a meal is a good time to check because it shows what your low reading is. However, it can also be good to check an hour or two after a meal to see where it is. It's also a good idea to check it before bedtime to make sure it's not too low. Usually, right before your bedtime snack is good.You'll need to check it about 2 to 4 times a day, but your doctor can help you figure out the right plan for you.In fact, you may even need to check it more than 4 times a day.


If you find you're having low sugar episodes in the morning or in the night, try setting an alarm to make sure you check it in the middle of the night, too.You may need to up how often you check during certain times. For instance, if you're sick or particularly stressed, you may need to check more. If you're taking a new medication, pregnant, or changed your diet, you may need to check it more.Always check if you feel like you are having low or high blood sugar.If you're having high blood sugar, you may have blurred vision, nausea, drowsiness, or be extremely hungry or thirsty. With low blood sugar, you may be shaky, anxious, weak, tired, irritable, dizzy, and/or very hungry., Once you take it, you need to record it right then. Write down the reading, as well as the date and time you took it.You also need to write down anything unusual. For instance, if you missed a medication, you should write that down.
You can also write down when you last had a meal or if this reading is right before a meal.
You can note something that may have made it go up or down, such as drinking a cola., The target range is the range you should strive to be in most of the time. You may occasionally go above or below it, but you want to stay in it as much as possible.Generally, the range you want to be in is 80 to 130 mg/dl.Not everyone's range will be exactly the same., If you try to sit down and write your journal at the end of the day, you're likely to forget what you ate. It will also be harder to remember portion sizes.Every time you eat, stop and record it right then.If you wait, you might be tempted to skip because you're too tired at the end of the day.

, As you write, try to estimate the amount, too. If you have trouble guessing at first, start measuring your food so you can see what certain amounts look like. Don't forget to include things like condiments and butter.As a basic guide, a piece of meat that is the size of a deck of cards is about 3 ounces.A half a cup of vegetables is about half a tennis ball.An ounce of cheese looks like four dice.For a cup of pasta or rice, compare it to the size of your fist., Include what you're feeling, as well. Writing down your emotions can help cue you in to why you ate what you did. Your blood sugar can also affect your emotions, so making a note can help you see patterns.Also, write down how hungry you were, as that can help you start to think about why you're eating.Use a simple scale, such as 5 being the most hungry and 1 being not hungry., Based on your serving sizes, take a guess at how many carbohydrates you ate. This step will take some getting used to, as you'll need to learn the average serving sizes and how many carbohydrates are in certain foods.Until you get it down, don't be afraid to look up a food to find out the carbohydrates. While dietary needs differ, you usually can eat 45-60 grams of carbohydrates at each meal. As a reference, these servings are each 15 grams of carbohydrates: 1/3 cup of pasta or rice, 1/2 cup of oatmeal, 1 slice of bread, 1 small piece of fruit, or 2 small cookies.Also, read labels. You can find out what you need to know if you look on the labels as you cook.

, This step is especially important if you are on insulin. Because you take different amounts of short-acting insulin depending on what you ate, writing it down can be helpful if you have an episode later., Writing a food journal helps you be more accountable for what you eat. You may not always remember that snack you had, but if you write it down, you can take it into account.It can also help you see patterns. For instance, maybe you're reaching for something sugary on days you don't eat enough for breakfast.Even though writing keeps you accountable, it also helps you think about what you're eating before you eat it., If you've been keeping separate food and blood sugar journals (and even if you're not), it's important to compare them to each other. That way, you can see how what you're eating affects your blood sugar level.For instance, you may need to eat a few more carbohydrates at bedtime if you're having lows overnight.
Maybe you're eating too many carbohydrates at lunch and that shows with a high reading just before lunch.

, If you notice some worrying trends, such as continually high or low blood sugars, talk to your doctor.She can help you adjust your medications or recommend a nutritionist to help with your diet.

, You don't need to just write down your food and blood sugar readings. Feel free to make notes about your day or doodle a little. That way, it will keep you interested."

Watch for recurrent fungal infections.,
Keep track of any repeated skin infections.,
Watch out for vitiligo.,
Look out for vomiting or heavy breathing.",How to Know if Your Child Has Juvenile Diabetes2," Diabetics have higher levels of sugar and glucose in their blood and vaginal secretions. This is an ideal environment for abundant growth of yeast cells, which normally cause fungal infections. As a result, your child may suffer from recurrent fungal skin infections.Notice if your child seems to be itchy in the genital area. For girls, you may notice that they have repeated vaginal yeast infections, characterized by genital itching and discomfort, with mild white to yellowish foul smelling discharge.Another type of fungal infection that can be a result of the immune-compromising feature of juvenile diabetes is athlete's foot, which causes white discharge and peeling of the skin in the webs of the toes and soles of the feet.Boys, especially if they are uncircumcised, may also develop a fungal/yeast infection around the tip of the penis.

, The reflex that enables the body to fight against infections under normal circumstances is hampered by diabetes, as it causes immunological dysfunction. Increased glucose in the blood additionally causes unwelcome bacterial growth, often resulting in frequent bacterial skin infections such as boils or abscesses, carbuncles and ulcerations.Another aspect of recurrent skin infections is the slow healing of wounds. Even small cuts, scratches or wounds from minor trauma take an abnormally long time to heal. Be on the lookout for anything that doesn't fix itself up as usual., Vitiligo is an auto-immune disorder, leading to reduced levels of the skin pigment melanin. Melanin is the pigment that gives human hair, skin, and eyes color. With the occurrence of type 1 diabetes, the body develops auto-antibodies that destroy melanin. This results in white patches on the skin.Although it occurs much later in the course of type 1 diabetes and is not very common, it is better to rule out diabetes if your child develops such white patches.

, These symptoms can accompany diabetes as it progresses. If you notice your child vomiting or overly deep breathing, this is a dangerous sign and you should take your child to the hospital immediately for treatment.


These symptoms may be a sign of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which can result in a potentially fatal coma. These symptoms come on fast, sometimes within 24 hours. If left untreated, DKA can be fatal."
"
Know when to consult a physician.,
Visit your physician for examination.,
Receive the diagnosis and treatment plan.",How to Know if Your Child Has Juvenile Diabetes3," In many cases, type 1 diabetes is first diagnosed in the emergency room, when children are admitted in a diabetic coma or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Though it can be treated with fluids and insulin, it's best to avoid this altogether by consulting your physician immediately if you suspect your child may be diabetic. Don't wait for your child to pass out for a long time thanks to DKA in order to have your suspicion confirmed. Get your child tested!Symptoms that require immediate medical attention include: loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting, a high temperature, stomach pain, fruity smelling breath (likely you can smell it but your child won't be able to smell it themselves)., If you suspect that your child might have type 1 diabetes, get evaluated immediately. To diagnose diabetes your doctor will want to request a blood test to assess how much sugar is in your child's blood. There are two possible tests, hemoglobin test and a random or fasting blood sugar test.Glycated hemoglobin (A1C) test — This blood test provides information about your child's blood sugar levels over the past two to three months by measuring the percentage of blood sugar attached to the hemoglobin in the blood. Hemoglobin is a protein that carries oxygen in the red blood cells. The higher your child's blood sugar levels, the more sugar will be attached to the hemoglobin. A level of 6.5% or higher on two different tests is indicative of diabetes. This test is the standard test for diabetes assessment, management, and research.Blood sugar test — In this test, your doctor takes a random blood sample. Irrespective of whether your child just ate or not, a random blood sugar level of 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) may indicate diabetes, especially if it occurs with other symptoms. Your doctor may also consider taking a blood test after requiring your child fast overnight. In this test, a blood sugar level from 100 to 125 mg/dL indicates prediabetes, while a blood sugar level of 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher on two separate tests, your child has diabetes.Your doctor may also request a urine test to confirm Type 1 diabetes. The existence of ketones, which emerge from the breaking down of fat in the body, in the urine is indicative of Type 1, as opposed to Type 2.The presence of glucose in the urine also indicates diabetes.

, Once the tests are completed, your doctor will use your child's blood test results and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria to diagnose diabetes. Following the diagnosis, your child will need close medical follow up until their blood sugar has stabilized. Your doctor will need to determine the right type of insulin for your child as well as the appropriate dosage. You will likely need to consult an endocrinologist, a specialist in hormone disorders, in order to coordinate your child's diabetes care.Once the basic insulin treatment plan for managing your child's type 1 diabetes is set, you will need to schedule checkups for your child every few months to repeat some of the above tests to make sure your child's blood sugar levels are satisfactory.
Your child will also need to have regular foot and eye exams, since these are often places where the symptoms of poor management of diabetes are seen first.Though there is no cure for diabetes, technology and treatment have developed to such an extent that most children with type 1 diabetes live happy and healthy lives once they know how to manage their diabetes.

Join a support group.",How to Live With a Diabetic Spouse," One of the most positive ways in which you can support your spouse is by informing yourself about diabetes. This can help you to understand not only what she is going through, but may also help you give her what she needs to maintain her health.Speak to your spouse’s doctor spouses about dietary and exercise requirements, including any warning signs of bigger issues for which you should watch.
Consult educational tools online from organizations such as The American Diabetes Organization. You can find articles about the disease, diet and fitness, and joining support groups.Subscribe to magazines or other media published to support and educate persons with diabetes and their spouses.
Take a course about health and diabetics, which could teach you how to inject insulin or identify anaphylactic shock, if necessary.;
, Communication with your spouse should be one of the cornerstones of supporting your spouse. Not only can she tell you about how she is feeling and what she needs, but also if you are nagging her.Be honest with each other at all times. There is nothing about which you should feel shame or guilt around your spouse, especially if you are providing care for her.
For example, if your spouse isn’t eating properly, you can say “I don’t want to nag you, but eating that piece of cake may cause more serious issues with your blood sugar.”Give your spouse time to adjust to any changes in the disease or a diagnosis. Both of you may also need time to cope with anything that comes your way. You can do this by saying things like “This is scary for both of us. I’m really worried about losing you. What worries you most?”, Part of supporting your spouse is to encourage her to follow healthy habits and get treatment when necessary. This can help maintain her well-being and prevent any complications from the disease, such as cardiovascular or eye damage.Ask your spouse the best way you can support her. For example, ask her if you should remind her when she needs new supplies like needles or insulin or if she prefers to take care of it herself.Encourage as much self-care as possible for your spouse, which can give her confidence, you a bit of relief, and enhance your mutual lifestyle.For example, you could encourage your spouse to take her medications by taking yours at the same time of day.Be aware that there is a fine line between encouraging your spouse to stay healthy and nagging her.If there is something serious that you want to discuss with your spouse, it may be better received if the doctor broaches the subject.

, Being diabetic often means making changes to one’s lifestyle. Help your spouse make positive changes by adopting similar changes if you are able. Following elements such as the same diet and exercise plans can help reinforce your spouse’s treatment plan and well-being and may also minimize her feelings of isolation.Get some exercise together, which is good for your health and that of your spouse. For example, if you don’t exercise, incorporate a couple of 30 minute walks into your twice a week and work up to six days a week.Change your diets, swapping unhealthy choices for healthy, whole foods. For example, your spouse may no longer be able to baked goods. If you are both craving something sweet, have a dish of fresh berries with sugar-free whipped topping.Set small goals as you change your lifestyle. This can help ensure that you and your spouse stay on track to managing her diabetes.

, Work in conjunction with medical professions as much as possible. This can help you live with your spouse in a safe, healthy, and harmonious atmosphere.Attend doctor’s appointments and education classes with your spouse. Make sure she agrees to this before you assume it’s acceptable and appropriate to her.You may include a dietician or mental health counselor as a part of your spouse’s care team.Remember you are a part of the team to advocate for the best of spouse and express her wishes or anything else she may be unable to say., Because of excess glucose in a diabetic’s system, she needs to watch her diet, though the disease shouldn’t keep her—or you—from enjoying some of your favorite foods. Getting nutrient-rich, whole, low-sugar foods can help both of you to stay healthy and maintain your weight, which in turn may help relieve some symptoms of diabetes.Eat about around 1,800-2,200 nutrient-dense calories a day, depending on how active you are.If you are trying to lose weight, decrease your calorie intake by about 500-800 calories per day.
Choose healthy foods including: beans, dark green leafy vegetables, citrus fruit, sweet potatoes, berries, tomatoes, whole grains, nuts, and fat-free milk and yogurt.These foods can help ensure you and your spouse get all of the nutrients needed to maintain health and weight and manage diabetes.Aim to fill your half of your plate with non-starchy vegetables such as beets, carrots, cauliflower, squash, snap peas, and asparagus. If you are getting frozen or canned versions, make sure they do not contain any added sugar.Decrease or eliminate the amount of sugar you eat, especially if it is from refined sources such as cakes and cookies. Instead, eat fruits like blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries to satisfy your sweet tooth., Your and your diabetic spouse can plan weekly meals together. Not only can this be a fun activity for both of you, but can help manage your weight, sugar, and may that you’re getting plenty of nutrients.Start off your day on the right foot with a healthy breakfast together. You can choose a variety of foods to make a healthy and satisfying breakfast for both of you such as an omelet with cheese and veggies and a side of whole grain toast and fruit.Some studies have shown that allowing yourself occasional cheat days can help you maintain a healthy diet because you’re not denying yourself anything., Eating at restaurants can prove a major pitfall for many diabetics and their spouses because of processed foods with hidden sugar.Arrange your restaurant trips as a part of meal planning, selecting restaurants that offer both of you healthy food choices.


Ask for substitutions when you can. For example, ask for a salad or extra broccoli instead of French fries.Order desserts with whole fruit or even a fruit platter for dessert.Make restaurant reservations for a time that you won’t have to wait for a long time and run the risk of disrupting your spouse’s blood sugar., It’s also important to your health to stay hydrated. Because of added sugars in beverages, you may find it difficult to know what to drink. Making wise choices can help you and your spouse stay hydrated, manage weight, and control your spouse’s diabetes.The best choices for you and your diabetic spouse for beverages are: water, unsweetened tea, coffee, diet sofa, low-calorie and sugar-free drinks and drink mixes.Consider flavoring water with fruit or lemon.Avoid regular soda, fruit punch, fruit drinks, energy drinks, and sweet tea. These are high in calories and sugar.Women should drink about 9 cups of liquid daily. Men should drink about 13 cups daily. If you are active or pregnant, you may need up to 16 cups of water a day., Both smoking and alcohol consumption can increase your spouse’s risk for complications from diabetes and also harm your health. By either reducing or quitting alcohol and tobacco altogether, you and your spouse can maintain your overall well-being and manage her diabetes.Men should consume no more than 3-4 units of alcohol daily, while women should have no more than 2-3 units of a day.A bottle of wine, for example, has 9-10 units of alcohol.You may want to consider non-alcoholic beer or sparkling grape juice as alternatives to beer and wine.
If you are not able to quit smoking, speak to your doctor about getting treatment to help you quit.

, Regular physical activity can keep you and your spouse healthy and may help manage her diabetes. Incorporate some kind of activity that you can do together daily.Try and get at least 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week.There are many different activities that you can do together including walking, jogging, biking, swimming, or playing tennis.
Regular exercise can help maintain the weight of you and your diabetic spouse.
Your spouse may find that combining cardiovascular exercise with weight training may help control diabetes more effectively than cardio alone., Schedule your annual doctor’s appointments at the same time. Not only can this ensure that your spouse gets regular care for her diabetes, but may also detect other complications of the disease or conditions you could both have.You may want to meet with your dietician and any other members of your diabetes care team at as a couple to see the ways in which you can support your spouse through lifestyle., Living with and taking care of a diabetic spouse can cause you stress that leads to health or other problems for you.Taking measures to manage stress in your life can promote your well-being and may make your living situation more comfortable and manageable.Remove yourself from stressful situations as much as possible, whether they are at work or at home.

, No matter how much care your spouse requires, ask for help if you need it. This may allow you to enjoy some alone time, help share the burden of care, and even give your spouse a break. It’s never healthy for a couple to be on top of one another at all times.You could ask friends or other family members to help out so that you can properly take care of yourself or just get away for a little while to focus on you.
Consider hiring an at-home caregiver a couple of days a week. This will give you a chance to get out of the house. In some cases, your insurance may even cover in-home care from licensed practical nurses.Be honest with your spouse about why you’re getting help. For example, you can say “I love you and taking care of you, but part of that is having time to take care of myself, too.”

, Having time to yourself is an important part of reducing stress and taking care of your own well-being. Schedule regular “me time” to give yourself a break.Do activities that keep you engaged with other people. For example, schedule a weekly lunch or dinner with friends.
Permit yourself to pamper yourself to help you relax and de-stress. You could take a gentle yoga or meditation class or get a massage.
Go shopping or do an activity your spouse doesn’t like, such as kayaking or swimming. Even reading a book can give you a break.You should never feel guilty for taking off some time. Remind yourself this is vital for your well-being., It is common for a caregiver to put her spouse’s needs before her own, which often results in a lack of vital rest. Prioritize getting 7-9 hours of sleep every night, which can help you more effectively cope with caring for your spouse and also reduces stress.If necessary, take short naps during the day.

, Taking care of yourself is an important part of being a supportive partner to a spouse with diabetes. Joining a support group for caregivers of diabetics make help you cope with any stress your feelings or give you constructive ways to deal with issues you are facing.The American Diabetes Organization has different services and programs to help support the caregivers of diabetics. The group also can help you locate support groups in your local area.You can also find support by calling the American Diabetes Organization at 800-DIABETES (800-342-2382)."

, Take it out of the package and unruffle the static cling from the railing sides from the diaper's containment zone.

, Rip the dirty diaper off the person, as removal is necessary. Grab the adhesive tape tabs on either side of the front panel and pull. Pull the diaper tapes off from the front of the old diaper.


Most adult disposable diaper tabs-style company normally advise the wearer and caregiver to remove both tapes from the top, and later remove the two tapes from the bottom. However, as long as the old diaper comes off, it really doesn't matter what order you remove the tapes from the diaper with this method.

, It will drop off of the wearer. If you'd like, you may hold the diaper near the wearer's crotch. After the bottom portion has dropped to the wearer's knees, you may pull the diaper gently off of both of the wearer's legs. You will want to roll up the front of the diaper into the back tightly and use the four tapes to seal the bundle so urine and fecal smell cannot get out. Roll used wipes and gloves into the bundle as well.

,, Prop the new diaper up against the wall, so that the back of the pant is shown to be on top of the front, and so that only the outer plastic isn't well seen.Don't allow the wearer to step backwards quite yet. The adjustment of the diaper to the wall is a critical step in getting just the right fit of the diaper to the wearer.


Make sure the pant is hanging freely to avoid other potential problems later.
Allow a caregiver to assist the wearer, if one is available.

, Grab the diaper at the one side (holding the diaper firmly up to the wall with both of the helper's hands by the end).


If there is no second helper nearby, try to hold the diaper to the wall one-handed (with your thumb and index fingers steadying the one side of the diaper, extend the other fingers of your hand and hold the diaper steady) while the wearer is forced to do the caregivers work on top of doing their own work that the caregiver would have advised them to do otherwise.
Visualize the height of the placement of the diaper on the wall, being worn at about the height of the wearer's waist.

, If the wearer is yourself, you will need to step back now. Release the diaper from between your hands, once you feel the wearer is firmly standing up against the wall (and thereby you should feel the wearer's skin touch the diaper unless the wearer has been known to quickly move away without prior notice).

,, If the caregiver isn't around, the wearer must do this one-handed, as the wearer must touch and pull up and around the center panel of the front panel of the diaper.

, Pull the diaper tapes until they are both taut to the diaper's front panel. It must be a tight but comfortable fit, to still be wearable on the wearer's body.


If at any point the diaper starts to pull away and starts to release the side tapes from each other, you'll hear a slight static sound. Stop using this diaper, and replace this diaper with a brand new diaper. You may have inadvertently pulled too hard on the tapes when securing them around the front panel of the diaper. To avoid the possibility of even further breakage (and thereby leakage), don't use this ""broken"" diaper.
It doesn't matter if you start with the top tape first, or the bottom tape.
The diaper-tapes should be placed snugly on the person's belly. The general rule of thumb for assuring snugness for an adult disposable diaper is that: If you can get only one of your fingers of one of your hands in between a secured diaper (fastened with the attached tapes), the diaper is secure enough. If you can fit more, it's not snug enough. If you can't fit any, it's too tight. Care must be taken not to fasten the diaper too tightly around the legs.

, Secure the other sides' diaper tapes in place.

, If you don't do this, it will cause the diaper's chemicals to not ""activate"" if and when the wearer urinates into them, and thereby will allow the water to flow out of the diaper and onto the surrounding surfaces.


To prevent leakage in the diaper, always remember to unruffle the sides of the diaper using one of your hands' thumbs and pinkies, as you push the side ruffles outward a bit (no matter what type of diaper you wear (whether it be pull-up style or not)).

Prepare a fresh new diaper out of the package.,
Have the wearer sit down with your old diaper taped to them.,
Grab the diaper by the top of the front panel and push the diaper outwards.,

,
Set the old diaper to the side as the caretaker will need to clean up the diaper changing mess a bit later.

,
Place the new diaper onto the chair, with the back side of the prepared diaper sitting loosely against the back of the chair.,
Have the wearer sit back down onto the chair.,
Ask yourself (if you are the caregiver): ""Do I see the diaper tapes?"".,
Pull the tapes of the one side around to the front panel of the diaper and push the tapes onto the panel to secure them in place.,
Repeat these steps with the wearer's other leg.

, Any size or style chair will do, as long as the wearer fits on the chair.

, If you are the caretaker, pull the diaper outwards.

,,, Try to position the diaper so that it can later be located at or near your waist. Make sure the diaper can't slip on the wearer when their hands have been taken away from the diaper.

, The diaper should then be almost aligned equal to the location of the diaper tapes on both of the sides of the diaper.

, If you do, grab the tapes and open them up.

, Always push the tapes onto the diaper, so that the bottom tape hangs slightly upwards from it's default position, and that the top tape hangs slightly downwards from it's default position too.

Allow a caregiver to assist, if one is available.

, The placement doesn't have to be perfect, but it can help better acquaint the wearer to the placement of their new diaper.


Locate the back of the pant with the tag-like icon/strip mentioning the back of the pant. Notice that many adult disposable diapers will have a tag-like icon or strip that will indicate which portion of the pant is the back of the pant.







, But don't pull the pant up the person's legs just yet.


If you need to, you can pull the diaper up a little to help steady it, but pulling it up shouldn't be needed often and too much so go easy on this.

, The caretaker might have to pull the diaper up about an additional two to three inches from the default position, to ensure they can properly see the effective area of the diaper's strip that might be facing them.


Hold both sides of the diaper firmly onto the wearer's body as you pull them up the person's body, the remainder of the way.

, If you don't do this, it can cause the diaper's chemicals to not ""activate"" if and when the wearer urinates into them (and thereby will allow the water to flow out of the diaper and onto the surrounding surfaces and that can cause a big mess).

",How to Change a Disposable Adult Diaper While Lying Down," A bed in a bedroom or a sofa in a living room with all the curtains closed will work wonders. Sometimes a large changing table may also be available which gives the caretaker the best possible working conditions to perform diaper changes;
, When complete, place this diaper onto the side of the changing surface, just within the caretaker's quick reach, yet just out of arms reach of the wearer.

, These clothing pieces include any shirts, pants or underwear that might have been worn overtop of the diaper.

, Whether or not the wearer has wet the diaper or solid-wasted/soiled it, it still needs to be changed. Often times, what the caretaker may smell on the wearer, may mean something totally different has happened to the diaper wearer and may mean the wearer doesn't need a diaper change at all.

, Accidents may undoubtedly happen at least once while being diapered.

,, Do NOT use the ""ankle hold"" method to slide the diaper out from under the wearer!

,, Be extra-careful not to allow the wearer roll back over onto the changing surface accidentally, or it may even cause the wearer to roll completely over and onto potentially another surface causing other medical problems that are more severe than incontinence itself may bring. Most assistants suggest doing this portion, while kneeling or standing (on the ground) on the rolled side of the person. Continue to change the diaper from this position until further notice.

, Visualize the approximate location of the final location of the diaper, and the point that the diaper is closest to the wearer's waistline and that the tapes are positioned almost-on the wearers waist, all before rolling the wearer back over onto the diaper. Make sure the diaper is spread flat on the changing surface. Take these precautions for the comfort of the wearer's body.


Make sure the diaper tapes literally can touch up against the wearer's body.

, The process is almost over.

Fold the diaper (if needed) in advance of the diaper change.,
Determine where you’d like to change the wearer's diaper.,
Grab a hold of all needed items excluding (for a moment) the wearer in question.,
Lay a waterproof changing pad (such as either an adult waterproof pad or Goodnites Underpads) on the changing surface to prepare a mess-free changing environment.,
Bring the adult diaper-wearer over to the changing area and lay them down on the pad so that their rear end is in the pad's center core.,
Make sure to keep an area near the changing area open to receive any of the dirty clothes from the wearer's ensemble and will need to be changed out of.,
Remove any and all of the wearer's outer clothes (including the rubber pant).,
Look for and remove any diaper pins that exist on the diaper.,
Pull the diaper outwards from the center of the person's stomach and lay the diaper flat onto the changing surface.

,
Roll the person over onto their side, and pull out the dirty diaper from underneath the wearer, but do not slip a clean diaper underneath the wearer just yet.,
Use a diaper wipe or wet cleaning cloth to clean the person's rather-sensitive genital areas from urine or fecal matter that may have settled there.,
Place a smear of diaper rash cream on their behind as well as in the genitals near their diaper region.,
Spread the freshly-folded diaper onto the surface then roll the person back onto their back.,

Clean up the changing area.,
Place the dirty cloth diaper into a small plastic bag, seal, and place it into the diaper pail nearby.",How to Change a Cloth Adult Diaper," Although one common trait is the smell of either urine or poop in the wearer's diaper region, the fact that the diaper could sag could be another and could indicate the need for their diaper to need changing. Despite the person's age, no adult enjoys having someone check to see if they are ready for a diaper change. Doing so will most often actually degrade this person's emotional status everytime this is done and make the person changing them want to stop them doing it from that point forward.


Try not to leave the person in a wet or soiled diaper for too long. Diaper rashes (especially those resulting from cloth diapers) are the result of leaving the diaper-wearer to sit/lay in their wet and soggy or soiled diaper for an elongated period of time. Check into the status of the wearer's diaper every once in a while, to ensure their diaper is still dry.;
, Despite most babies' cloth diapers being large cloths that will still need to be folded, some adult cloth diapers are prefolded and won't need to be folded but will need to be snapped in place or have Velcro closings to be secured on the wearer, but this will depend on the specific brand of diaper you are using.

, Most cloth diaper folds used on babies still applies for adults wearing cloth diapers, so the information posed in Fold a Cloth Diaper should still apply. You can set this diaper off to the side until needed, once it is folded.


Although uncommon for adults to roll around when having their diaper changed, folding the diaper is especially useful for time restraints and any ways to make the change more pleasant is to make it shorter and having the diaper ready to go would be best done before the change is needed.
If the wearer tends to oversoak their diapers in a short period of time, try double-diapering them instead. Use two diapers stacked inside one another when preparing the diapers together.

, Although most adult cloth-diaper wearers aren't big enough anymore to use a diaper-changing table, most will elect to use the floor and that's perfectly okay. You can also use a bed with a waterproof plastic cover and old towel spread out on it. Although this change won't matter, most people who have to change a cloth adult diaper, prefer to have this done on a carpeted floor.

, Place them all in the diaper changing-area so you can grab it all one-handed and in a place where you can keep your eyes completely on the wearer. Although the diaper should be on hand, other items would include powders and/or diaper rash creams, along with a clean (and potentially newly-washed rubber pant), a cleaning cloth for any additional urine that wasn't soaked up by the diaper and some new clothes (if the urine soaked through their rubber pant onto the rest of their bottom half of their clothes).

, Though most disposable waterproof underpads will no longer be able to fit the entire adult body, they can withstand the stress coming from an accidental over-wetting in the case the adult cloth diaper wearer ""springs a leak"", and these can prevent the changing surface from becoming wet.

, The place you lay them doesn't have to perfectly center underneath their behind, but as long as their rear end is resting fully on the pad, they should be ready for their diaper-change.


Although adults who require cloth diapers can still wiggle around, not many adults will choose to wiggle around. However, take every available safety option to keep them from hurting themselves and so strap them in and keep them from moving as best as you can until you ask them to move.

, This area may include items such as any pants they were wearing along with their diaper as well as any used cleaning cloths and rubber pants that will have become wet or have been soiled in some way.

, Much like those of a baby's cloth diapering needs, only remove clothes that have gotten wet and set them aside. Only remove clothes that are wet and start by removing items from their changing area on up to rolling up their shirts. This should include their pants or shorts and socks and shoes/sneakers) as well as their rubber pant that needs to be used with any cloth diaper wearer. Adult onesies need to be unbuttoned from the genital area and folded up including the back fasteners folded up from behind the wearer, to prevent an unobstructed view.


Never use the leg lift method to raise the wearer's legs if this person is an adult. You must be able to roll the wearer over. However hard it is to grab the rubber pants with this method.
Strip the rubber pant that will still impede the cloth adult diaper on the wearer. Though a normal piece to help urine prevent a soaking feeling on their clothes, these pants are annoying, and can easily rip in the leg seems if removed roughly.

, If the diaper doesn't use pins, look for snaps (on the right and left side of the diapers instead) or Velcro-fasteners (along the side onto the top front areas) of the diaper. Undo or unfasten the snaps or Velcro tabs a bit but don't take the old diaper completely off.

,, Although it was once advised to use the ankle-hold technique with babies, with adults you will need to be advised to roll them over instead. Most adults are bigger and that by rolling them over leaves them in less-vulnerable position to feel ""too exposed"". (While standing behind them while holding them with your right arm, and rolling and placing the older diaper up with your left hand, letting their left arm get rolled over under their side for a moment.)


Place the old diaper to the side once you have obtained it. Watch out for solid fecal matter as well as urine and other bodily fluids. Although a great place to hold this is on top of the pile with all the other wet clothes, if you have time to slip it in a dirty-wash basin, go for it.
Keep in mind that some adult diaper-wearers can and will still urinate into the air when exposed to the cooler air in the room and should be covered with a cloth until you are ready to switch to using the clean diaper.

, Remember to wipe from front to back (especially in girls and women) to prevent the spread of fecal bacteria into other areas of the body. If you don't have any of these, you can also use a clean area of the old diaper to clean. Try not to spread the mess on a third cloth diaper to prevent a large load of laundry later on.

, Alternatively, you can later place some diaper-powder down onto the cloth diaper to prepare for the next soaking of the diaper to ensure the wetness doesn't hurt the wearer's skin the next time.


Only use A & D ointment and zinc oxide based ointments like Desitin in their genital region if there is diaper rash or as a preventative measure, due to the holding-power of cloth diapers to keep urine in the folds of the wearer's skin near their genital organs. Smear a glob of the ointment/cream in this area and coat their external organs in these ""medicines"". You may wish to use a cotton swab/Q-tip to apply the ointment, if necessary.

, Make sure that the center crease or double-thickness area of the diaper is towards the wearer's front. You'll might want to be close to spot-on where you place it during the diaper-change, to prevent extra overhang from being seen or noticed (or even felt) by the wearer.


For those who have prefolded diapers that have snaps or Velcro, you may need to keep your hand outstretched in the diapers core until the person has been laid back down onto the clean diaper so the diaper doesn't readjust and fold back up while situating the placement of the person onto/into their cleaner and drier cloth diaper.

, You'll need to be able to outstretch your arms, but you will need a firm grip on the diaper to bring it up, over and around.


Lay the dry diaper temporarily on the wearer's skin so that you can obtain the new pins or get ready to fix up the diaper again.

, For those who've chosen to use prefolded diapers, you shouldn't need to flare out the sides any, but you must be able to hold your arm overtop of their genital region of the wearer's dry diaper for a moment as you'll complete the next step. The amount of diaper you flare back out onto the diaper's sides will depend on the size of the diaper-wearer's weight and width of their waistline.


Stay consistent as you work with only one side of the diaper at a time. Flare out and work with only one side at a time. The side you begin with shouldn't matter. If you choose the left back, pick the left-front, alternatively when you move on tot he right side, work with both the right back and right front sides of the diaper.

, If you formerly used diaper pins and the former diaper pins aren't broken, use these diaper pins to secure the diaper. If you had something else that works well that was used to secure these diapers, use them instead. Pre-folded diapers with Velcro fasteners work well, pull each side up and over and push them down onto the face of the diaper.Be sure not to push it through all the layers of the inner diapers' folded layers. Be sure to insert the end of the pins away from the wearer's navel/belly button. If you don't want to stick yourself, don't push the pins through all layers of the diaper fabrics.


If you'd like to give yourself some extra security of having the diaper not fall off, you can secure these diapers using two pins per side (one up and one lower), but make sure to secure the lower one first before securing the top for both sides.
Push the pin from the original location into the one layer of the diaper fabric towards the pin head and around the diaper's pin head notch created in most diaper pins.
Snap the diaper pins closed from both sides. Diaper pins are created with an open section in the pin-head. Push the pin around and into the head of the pin’s opening, and push inwards so the pin-head is covering this end of the pin.
You can reuse a baby's diaper pins for these cloth diapers, if you'd like, or you can order adult ones. Adult ones are the same size of those used for babies, so just recycle these if you have them available for use.

, Both sides will need to be fixed to ensure a proper fit.

, If the rubber pant was wet, choose to use a dry pant. If it wasn't all that wet, you can either reuse the pant or use a dry one from a few extras you might have had to keep on hand.

, Pull down and refasten the snaps to any adult onesies the wearer is using, or change the clothing much like any other piece of clothing. The order here doesn't matter, but you can begin with the person's top and work down past the pants onto their socks and sneakers/shoes.

, Bring the soiled diaper diaper to the laundering station for further cleanup.

, Remove all wet clothes from the pile and place any of the other unused changing supplies back where they were originally found (or where they belong if found in areas other than where they belonged if accidentally misplaced). Take care of any wet underpads by placing them into a trash basin (for disposable pads) or into the laundry bucket for cleanup (for reusable ones). Place all wet clothes into a laundry basket that can be carried to your laundering area as where all your other laundry will go.

, Make sure to close the diaper pail's lid tightly. Wash the dirty cloth diapers to prepare them for future use and rinse them well afterwards.

Shop online.",How to Buy Adult Diapers and Briefs," A good fit is essential to making sure your adult diaper prevents leaks and accidents. Wrap a measuring tape around your hips, and take the measurement. Then measure the distance around your waist. The sizing for incontinence products is based on the largest figure of the measurements around the waist or around the hips.There aren’t standardized sizes for adult diapers. Each manufacturer uses his own sizing method, and it can even vary across product lines from the same manufacturer.
Check your measurements every time you place an order, particularly if you are trying a new product.;
, You’ll want to buy the diaper with the highest level of absorbency, without compromising the diaper’s fit. Take into consideration whether you’ll need diapers for both urinary and fecal incontinence or urinary incontinence only. You may decide to use different diapers for daytime and nighttime use.Absorbency levels vary widely from brand to brand.
Incontinence pads can be added to adult diapers to increase the absorbency rate if necessary. However, this is an expensive option and should be used as a fallback method.
If your absorbency needs are light, using a pad by itself might be sufficient
Comparison of absorbency in different adult diapers can be done through online websites such as XP Medical or Consumer Search.

, The needs of men and women’s diapers are different. Men’s diaper options include boxer shorts, while women’s adult diapers include pads and underwear designed with women’s urinary flow in mind.Unisex adult diapers may be fine for your needs, and are usually less expensive.
Try a sample before you invest in a full case or box.

, Reusable diapers cost less over time, and are often more absorbent than disposable diapers. They’ll need to be washed often, though, and this might not be practical for you. Washable diapers will also age quickly, so you’ll need to make sure you have replacement products handy.Athletes often prefer reusable diapers because they fit better and hold more urine than disposable diapers.
Disposable diapers are best for travel or other situations when you may not be able to easily wash your diapers.

, Adult diapers, or briefs, are best for people who are limited in mobility, or who have caregivers who can help them change. Because they come with refastenable side tabs, these diapers can be changed while you are sitting or lying down. You won’t have to completely remove your clothing.Adult diapers tend to be more absorbent. They’re best for overnight protection and those with heavy to severe incontinence.
Many adult diapers have a wetness indicator strip to show caregivers when a changing is needed.
Pullups, or “protective underwear”, is best for those who don’t have mobility problems. They look and feel more like regular underwear, and are often more comfortable than diapers.

, Bariatric briefs are designed for very large adults. They usually come with stretchy side panels to keep their wearer more comfortable, and to provide a better fit. While they’re usually labeled in sizes like XL, XXL, XXXL, etc., the exact sizes vary by company so you’ll want to carefully measure your waist and hip circumference before ordering.Many bariatric briefs also include anti-leak leg cuffs to prevent leakage.
Bariatric briefs are available waist sizes up to 106 inches.

, Nighttime incontinence affects at least 2% of adults who may not otherwise have the needs for adult diapers. Consider using a diaper that protects against leaks for overnight protection.You may need to use a diaper that has additional absorbency to keep you dry and clean during the overnight hours.
Make sure your overnight diapers have breathable outer layer for better skin health.

, While Medicare does not pay for adult diapers, their cost is tax-deductible. If you keep your receipts proving purchase of your adult diapers, you can deduct them on your federal income tax.Keep these receipts in an folder or file together with all your tax-deductible receipts.
Make sure each receipt has the specific cost, the date, and the place of purchase of your adult diapers.

, If you’re a veteran, you’ll be eligible for VA services which include access to adult diapers. The type of diapers covered by this insurance may be limited; however, if your health care provider is willing to write a prescription for specific brands, you may be able to use your insurance coverage to cover the purchase price.Medicaid covers the cost of adult diapers for people living in nursing homes.
If you receive services under a Medicaid “waiver” program, you may be eligible for adult diapers while you live at home or in a community setting.
Services covered by Medicaid vary from state to state, so you’ll need to check with the Social Security (SSA) offices in your home state for more information.

, Manufacturers’ coupons can help defray the cost of adult diapers. You may be able to receive help paying for diapers through local nonprofits or community health resources. Nonprofit diaper banks are established in many communities to help support people who need adult diapers.You can find online options for medical discount coupons.Discount prescription cards can help you with adult diapers if they are prescribed by a medical provider.

, If you’ve found a product that fits well, provides the absorbency you require, then it will save you money to purchase in bulk. Online sellers often offer lower prices than the traditional brick-and-mortar stores in your home community.Make sure you’re calculating the cost of shipping when you’re comparing prices. Look for online retailers who offer free or discounted shipping.
Online prices may be 50%-80% less expensive than the prices found in supermarkets.

Pull up the user's underwear to comfortably match the pad.",How to Apply Incontinence Pads1," Since this is such a personal process, it's important that this person has your complete trust and fully knows what to expect. If they have any questions or are uncomfortable, they should be encouraged to speak up.


If this is your first time helping them, introduce yourself. Ask them if they have their own way of applying the pad and if so, if they could show you how they're most comfortable doing it.
If this is their first time too, show them the product, explain how it will be applied, and, if applicable, give them the option of standing up or lying down. Standing up is the easiest option if they are mobile and able to support themselves.
A liner is used to manage light incontinence. If the user has bigger, more constant issues, a brief should be considered.;
, Skin moisture from incontinence pads does not necessarily contribute to skin damage, but it can. Wet skin’s temperature is lower than dry skin; wet skin has less blood flow, too. Dry, warm skin is ideal.If you detect any wounds, clean the area first with a cotton ball soaked in hydrogen peroxide or betadine. Start at the inner part of the wound and move outward. Let the area dry before putting any clothing back on.

, If a pad is currently being used, gently pull the underwear away from the user's body, peel off the pad, and discard it. It's a good idea to wash your hands afterward, too, to prevent the spread of bacteria.

, Remove the adhesive backing from the new pad and fold the liner in half down the center length-wise to form a hotdog bun shape. This is to facilitate ease of insertion.

, Have the user spread his/her legs slightly. Insert the liner between the legs and cover the groin area from front to back. The front to back method will decrease the chances of cross contamination of the urethra by the anus.

, Spread the back of the liner at the buttocks and position the front panel evenly along the crotch area to cover the area. This helps to ensure proper positioning and prevents leaks.

, Position the pants or shorts as they were on the individual. Make sure the pad and the underwear feel comfortable. Suss out and wrinkles and make adjustments as necessary.

, This is mainly in order to get his or her trust and cooperation. This is a very personal procedure, and they will likely feel insecure or judged. Assure them that this is no big deal and the procedure will take only seconds.


If this is the first time you're assisting them, be friendly! Talk about how they normally apply the pad, if this is their favorite product to use, and what you can do to keep their routine unchanged. If they say they are changing liners often, suggest a brief – liners are for light incontinence only; briefs are for heavier episodes.
If possible, give them the option of standing up or lying down. If they are bedridden or otherwise immobile, lying down will, quite clearly, be your only option. However, if they are capable of standing, it may be easier for the both of you.

, With the individual lying down, slowly flex both of their knees and remove their underwear. As you're doing this, assess the area for signs of pressure ulcers or dermatitis (inflammation of the skin) such as redness, swelling and wounds.


To assess the area, with your pointer and middle finger of your dominant hand, touch the area to be affected and feel if it is cold or warm. Cold skin indicates a lack of blood supply in the area while warm skin has good blood circulation.
If a wound is present, grab a cotton ball and soak it in hydrogen peroxide or a betadine solution. Start from the center of the wound and work your way outward. Allow the area to dry before you continue the procedure., If a pad was previously being used, gently pull the back of the underpants away from the patient’s body, slip the used pad out of the underwear and discard it. Wash your hands afterward to prevent the spread of bacteria.

, Standing behind the user, begin applying the pad by spreading the back of the liner at the buttocks to evenly cover the area. Make sure it's centered and flat to avoid potential leaks.

, To place the front of the pad, have the user spread his/her legs slightly to make it easier for you to position. Place the pad, rolling the front panel evenly over the crotch. This is to create a way of putting the liner at the groin in the proper place.

, Make sure the pad adheres to the proper area of the undergarments by pressing it into the underwear. Make adjustments as necessary so the pad is adhered well, won't move, and all the necessary places are covered.


Position the clothes as they were on the patient. Rearrange the pants or dress as necessary.

Encourage them to ask any questions and to tell you if they're uncomfortable, too.


Briefs are used for heavy incontinence; they also come in many forms. If the user complains if this variety being uncomfortable, let them know they may have other options, too.
Give them the option of standing up or lying down. Standing up will be easier for both of you if they support their weight. Lying down will be necessary if they're bedridden or otherwise unable to stand.

, If they have a brief on from before, help them take it off and discard it. If you get the chance, assess their skin. Is it clean and dry? If it's cold, odds are it was wet; if it's warm, there is adequate blood flow and the skin is dry.


If any wounds are present, halt the procedure. Grab a cotton ball and douse it in hydrogen peroxide or betadine. Place it over the area, starting in the middle and working your way outward. Let the area dry before you place the brief.

, Make sure that all sides are unfolded and the brief is in perfect condition. Then, fold the brief length-wise – this is done to easily insert the brief between the legs later.


Briefly inspect the brief. Is the the right size for the user? Are there any holes or tears?

, They'll also need to lightly spread their knees while you are inserting the incontinence pad beneath their pants or dress. Any assistance they can offer will make this process go much more smoothly and quickly.

, Have the user spread their legs as necessary. This front-to-back maneuver should be carried out to reduce the chances of transferring microbes from the anus to the urethra.

, Spread out the back part of the brief and position the absorbent pad in line with the crotch. Have them pull the brief on the other side. Proper alignment of and position of the brief helps in avoiding leaks that might occur.

, Fit the front panel in a cupped position over the groin to avoid leakage and any liquid spreading over the skin. Make sure it's comfortable for the user and seems to fit appropriately.

, You can now begin connecting the adhesive tapes in the belt. You can start either from the left or the right. Incontinence pads usually have 4 adhesive tapes, 2 from the left and 2 from the right.


Slowly pull the top adhesive tape in the belt of your desired side and connect it to the other side of the pad.
Pull the bottom adhesive tape of your desired side and connect it to the other side of the brief. Do this on the remaining side, too.
Make sure it's not too tight and not too loose to promote proper air circulation.

, For aesthetic purposes, make sure the brief is lying smooth and flat and smooth any wrinkles. After the belt is secured, instruct the patient to lift their buttocks while you pull their pants or dress up. Arrange their clothes and secure as necessary.

, To gain the user's trust and cooperation, it's a good idea to explain the procedure beforehand. The idea of needing someone else to help with this very personal issue can leave them feeling very vulnerable and, at times, uncomfortable; do your best to assuage their worry.


Briefs are used for those suffering from heavy incontinence. How many briefs do they go through a day? Do they find this specific variety comfortable? There are many types of briefs out there they could try if not.
If the user can stand, you may wish to have them do so. This will be easier for them to help you and make the process quicker. However, if they cannot, lying down will work.

, Create a fold at the center in a length-wise position. Folding the pad in a length-wise position creates a line in which will be used as a baseline to be aligned between the buttocks.


Briefly inspect the brief to make sure there are no slight tears or holes and that it's the appropriate size for the user.

, Take a look at their skin, assessing the area for signs of pressure ulcers or dermatitis (inflammation of the skin), redness, swelling and wounds.


With the first two fingers of your dominant hand, touch the area to be affected and feel if it is cold or warm. Cold skin indicates a lack of blood supply in the area because it was likely wet; warm skin has good blood circulation and is likely dry. Wet skin can lead to infection if not cleaned properly.
If a wound is present, clean it with a cotton ball soaked in a betadine or hydrogen peroxide solution. Clean from the middle of the wound and work your way out. When you're finished, let it dry before replacing any clothing.

, Spread the bottom of the brief on the buttocks; the line you made on the brief earlier should be laterally between the buttocks. This is to evenly distribute the pad between the cheeks of the butt.

, This will make it easier to apply the front panel of the brief. Unfold the front panel, giving it a cupped shape in the crotch. Cuffs should fit snugly against the groin.


For male users, position the penis downward. This avoids any potential leaking.

, Follow the contour of the groin in securing the pad. This will be the most natural, comfortable, leak-free position. Secure the tapes depending on the manufacturer’s instructions (there will likely be 2 on each side).


Be sure to make it not too tight and not too loose to promote proper air circulation. The brief should be snug but comfortable.

, Smooth any wrinkles for aesthetic purposes – often the biggest issue with briefs is that the user feels they're too obvious. Assure them that it's fine and help them replace and adjust their clothing as necessary.

That way, you'll be prepared for the conversation, and you won't be as nervous when it comes time to talk to your parents.It's a good idea to think about what you're feeling and how that can help you talk about what you want. For instance, if you're tired of wetting the bed, you may be feeling frustrated or embarrassed, and that can help you talk about why you want to wear diapers.;
, Once you've figured out what you want to say, it's time to figure out how you want to say it. One way to do that is to practice the conversation. Take some time to write out exactly what you want to say, and try saying it out loud to a mirror.Start with the topic at hand: ""Mom and Dad, I still wet the bed, and I'd like to talk to you about wearing diapers.""
Move on to your feelings. You want to talk about your feelings and how that affects what you're saying: ""It's both frustrating and embarrassing to wake up wet in the middle of the night. I think diapers will help with this problem.""

, You don't want to talk to your parents when they're rushing out the door or trying to cook dinner. Rather, you need to pick a time when they have a chance to actually sit down and listen to you. The best way to figure out a good time is to simply ask them.You could say, ""Hey, Mom, I'd like to have a serious discussion with you. When can we sit down and talk?""
Don't put it off. Because you may feel embarrassed, you may be tempted to put off the conversation. However, the sooner you talk to your parents about it, the quicker you can get to a solution, such as wearing diapers to keep you dry at night., You may want to get around saying it by bringing up other topics or going about it in a roundabout way. However, it's best to just let your parents know what's wrong, so you can get the help you need. If you aren't clear and direct about what you want, your parents may not understand.You could say, ""You may or may not know that I still wet the bed. It's become more of a problem for me. I'd like to start wearing diapers to help take care of the problem.""

, Explain your reasoning. If you've been hiding the fact that you're wetting the bed, you may need to give a little bit of explanation. Just let them know what's been going on so they can understand your request better.You could say, ""It's really embarrassing for me to talk about, but I'm still wetting the bed 2 to 3 times a week. I've been hiding it from you because I was so embarrassed.""

, It can be hard to stay calm when you're embarrassed or upset. You may be tempted to start ranting or stomp off to the other room if the conversation doesn't go your way. However, staying calm is a much better way to get to the goal you want.It's okay if you do get upset. The important thing is not to take it out on your parents. It's fine to cry or feel sad, but don't yell, scream, or argue with your parents. It won't help the situation.
If you feel yourself getting upset, try counting to 10 in your head or taking a few deep, calming breaths.

, Try not to run your words together or mumble to yourself. You don't need to be embarrassed, and speaking clearly will help you get your point across. Try not to be embarrassed at all. Lots of kids and teens have this problem, so you're not alone. Plus, your parents probably already have an idea about what's going on, and they'll be happy to help you find a solution like wearing diapers.To speak clearly, speak up, and try to say your words slowly and distinctly. Look at your parents so they have your facial expressions to help understand what you're saying.
Your parents might look worried, but that's not because they think what you're asking is wrong. Rather, they're probably just trying to figure out how to help you.

, Your parents need a chance to ask you questions and to talk about what's going on. Don't just override what they're trying to say. Listen to their questions and concerns, and answer anything they ask you as honestly as you can.For example, your parents may say, ""Why haven't you told us about this earlier?"" You could say, ""I was too embarrassed.""
Your parents may also say, ""Why do you think diapers are the best solution? What other solutions do you think might be good?""

, Diapers may be a good solution for you. However, your parents may have other options, as well. It's best to keep an open mind about what will work best for you. Work with your parents to talk about the best way to solve your problem.If your parents seem to be saying they don't think diapers are a good option, ask them what else they suggest. You could say, ""You seem to think diapers aren't right. What else can we use instead?""

, One factor in bedwetting is how much you drink before bed. If you're a deep sleeper and you drink a lot of water or other liquids before bed, your kidneys may produce more urine than is appropriate for the size of your bladder, meaning you wet the bed. Try to cut back on drinking liquid for a couple of hours before bed., Another thing you can do to help is to always make sure to go to the bathroom before you go to sleep. Emptying your bladder before you go to bed can reduce the likelihood of going to the bathroom while you're asleep., Set your alarm, or have your parents do it, to wake you up in the middle of the night. Aim for waking up twice, so that you can get up and go the bathroom, reducing your risk of wetting the bed. You can also ask your parents to wake you up before they go to sleep if they go to bed later than you do., While diapers are one option, another option is plastic pants (usually with cloth diapers) or pants that have a waterproof exterior. These pants can be a good option because they keep the bed dry, and they also signal to you when you need to get up. It can help train you to figure out when you should be getting up in the night.A third option is bed pads. These pads come in washable and disposable forms, and they protect the bed from any wetness. However, your clothes will still get wet if you're not wearing plastic pants or diapers.

, Your doctor can help you figure out if there's something causing your bedwetting. If you can solve the problem medically, then you don't need to wear diapers. Don't be embarrassed to talk to your doctor. That is what your doctor is there for, and many people have the same issue.Your doctor may feel differently about diapers than you do. Some people feel diapers make the issue worse because you're not actually changing anything about the bedwetting. However, if wearing diapers makes you more comfortable and your parents agree, then it is what you should do.Understand the problem may fade away on its own. While you still should see a doctor, it's important to know that many kids and teens grow out of this problem. Therefore, you may find that it fixes itself on its own, and you won't wet the bed anymore as you get older."

It is also good to keep a regular log of your readings in order to get an idea of how your sugar levels fluctuate in response to diet and exercise.Some meters have spring-action lancets that make reading less painful. Other allow you to test from your arms, thigh, or hand.
Unfortunately, urine testing is less accurate than blood and not a usable method.;
, Insulin therapy is a must for people with Type 1 Diabetes. People with Type 2 sometimes need it. Your medical team will help you determine if and what you will require for an insulin regime. In general, Type 1 diabetics start with two injections of insulin per day, while Type 2 diabetics may need one per day to go with other medication like pills. In both cases the body builds up a resistance so that more insulin is needed over time. Insulin is also delivered in different ways. The most common method is by injection. However, there are also insulin pens -- and self-testing, self-correcting electronic pumps, the easiest method.You should inject into the same area of the body in order to be consistent, but not the exact place.
Insulin delivery should also be properly timed to fit meal times, so that it is effective in processing glucose as needed.

, Good nutrition and lifestyle is a major aspect of diabetes management. Medical studies show that good diet, exercise, and weight loss can reduce fasting glucose levels in diabetics.Part of this is knowing what to eat. The idea, in short, is to eat things that level your blood sugar rather than spiking it. Together with your doctor or nutritionist you should be able to make an appropriate meal plan.


Nutrition is the best way to control blood sugar levels because blood sugar is directly impacted by what you eat and when. Eating a healthy diet that is focused on blood sugar control is essential in maintaining healthy blood sugar levels and thus preventing or controlling diabetes.

, Simple sugars like cane sugar, honey, or corn syrups found in soda and processed foods are easily absorbed into the bloodstream and will raise your blood sugar levels. You will have to be vigilant with them. This does not mean that you can't eat sweets on occasion. A small piece of pie or a cookie now and then is OK, but you will have to plan for it. Make sure you are not overdoing sweets and getting off track., Doctors recommend that diabetics get 60% to 70% of their total calories from carbohydrates and non-saturated fats – especially complex carbohydrates like whole grains, brown rice, and oats. High-protein diets are not recommended.Instead, opt for fiber-rich foods such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, broccoli, peas, almonds, apples, and pears. Fiber slows down the absorption of carbohydrates and will keep your blood sugar level. It will also make you feel full.


Many diabetics or people tying to maintain blood sugar levels think they need to completely avoid carbohydrates. This is not true. Complex carbohydrates are rich in fiber and thus, have a blood sugar stabilizing effect.
Educate yourself on how much you can eat during snack and meal times and how to space those meals out so that you can better control your levels of blood sugar.

, Try to swallow soft foods such as rice and pasta whole, without chewing. This is to help limit the amount of starch that your body processes at a given time. Starches (pasta, rice, potatoes, etc.) should not be chewed too much, for example, because chewing decreases particle sizes. So it increases speed of digestion, absorption and spike sugar levels, by opening up the surface area of the food for easy access to digestive enzymes., Toasting, or freezing and then thawing, or the combination of both alters starches so that they are digested more slowly., Another pillar of diabetes and high blood sugar management is physical exercise. Exercise improves insulin sensitivity. Try attending a gym, walking on a regular basis, or simply be more active. Incorporate fitness into your daily routine by choosing walking over driving, or opting for stairs over the elevator. Swimming and exercise classes are also good options. Talk to your doctor before starting an exercise program, however, because medicines may make your blood sugar dip too low; some exercises can also worsen diabetic conditions like diabetic eye disease.Exercise can cause your blood sugar level to drop for up to 12 hours. Check your levels before exercise and again afterward.Consider wearing a diabetic bracelet. Tell gym partners or coaches about your condition. Carry emergency phone numbers with you, as well.
Be attentive to any sores or blisters on your feet, particularly if you have diabetic neuropathy. Small sores can become infected., People with low blood sugar can benefit from frequent meals to ensure a steady glucose supply, otherwise they may become shaky, panicky, confused, or faint. Eating too sporadically can cause spikes in blood sugar, followed by lows. This sort of up-and-down creates a diabetic environment in the body. Plan to eat about about once every three hours, making sure that meals are small but satiating. You should also include snacks.Try carrying emergency snacks with you in case you experience a sudden sugar low. Nuts work great as a portable food, for example.

, The best way to manage hypoglycemia is through a diet similar to that used by diabetics. Someone who is suffering from an extreme sugar low needs a quick boost. In such circumstances a modest amount of juice, candy, soda, or even sugar or honey will alleviate symptoms.However, in general it is best as a hypoglycemic to avoid sugary foods, especially on an empty stomach. Simple sugars may boost your blood sugar, but they can lead to a quick crash and spark a vicious cycle of highs and lows. It is much better to maintain a steady balance.

, Make sure to include foods that are low in simple sugars, rich in complex carbohydrates, and high in soluble fiber, but all in smaller portions -- not big servings. Use whole grains, not refined and bleached, so eat rolled oats, barley/rye flour, and brown rice, starches like whole grain pasta and legumes like beans are all good choices -- but control and limit amount/size of servings of corn (it is called ""sweet corn"" for a reason); cooked, dried peas/beans (eat cooked snap-peas, green beans); non-stuffed baked potato, unsweetened yam (limit sweetened or sugared foods). Unsweetened/fresh fruit may also be a good idea for some, as its natural sugars do not require insulin., Improve hypoglycemia, pre-diabetes or diabetes by including soluble fiber in your diet. It's an effective way to make sure that sugars enter your blood slowly, gradually, and not all at once. Most complex carbohydrates and unrefined/unprocessed grains contain fiber, as do vegetables. Make sure to load up on fibrous vegetables like broccoli, leafy greens, or green beans.

, Doctors in the past advised that hypoglycemics should eat high protein meals four to five times per day in order to keep themselves satiated and to avoid blood sugar highs and lows. However, recent research suggests that a high-protein diet may actually impair glucose tolerance – and hence is counter-productive.It is a good idea to consult with your doctor or nutritionist to see what is best for you.

, Physical exercise is equally good for someone with low blood sugar as someone with high blood sugar. Again, though, you need to be vigilant. Exercise suppresses blood sugar levels, so you should make sure to snack beforehand. A banana with peanut butter or an apple and some cheese are sensible ideas, combining sugar with protein. If you exercise in the evening, consider having a snack before bed in order to stave off a hypoglycemic reaction., If you are here, you probably already know or suspect that you have a blood sugar problem. It is best to see a doctor, first of all. One will assess your symptoms, give a diagnosis, and inform you about what is wrong. It may be diabetes, which is caused in Type 1 by a lack of insulin, or in Type 2 is due to resistance to insulin in the body. This lack of insulin leads to chronically high levels of blood sugar (hyperglycemia) that over time can damage the kidneys, nerves, retinas, cardiovascular system, and feet and legs.Another potential issue is low blood sugar or hypoglycemia. The opposite of hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia can be hereditary or a reaction to diabetic medication.Consult with a registered dietitian when trying to regulate blood sugar (diabetic, pre-diabetic or not). Dietitians can create custom meal plans for you that accomplish your goals in a healthy and safe way.
In case you are diabetic, the doctor will also advise you on a plan to manage the disease through diet, exercise, and perhaps an insulin program. This will be the foundation for managing your blood sugar levels.Hypoglycemia can also be a serious medical condition and should be managed through diet and exercise.

, Managing your problem will be a learning process. Part of what you can do is to recognize how high or low blood sugar levels manifest themselves in your body. There are certain things to look for. Do you sometimes feel dizzy, shaky, weak, or faint? These are all possible symptoms of very low blood sugar. Or, are you frequently very hungry or thirsty (polyphagia / polydipsia)? Do you urinate often (polyuria), especially at night? Does your urine smell sweet? Have you experienced weight loss? Any of these might indicate poorly managed high blood sugar., Diabetes and its related problems are chronic and life-threatening. There is no cure. It is absolutely in your interest to inform yourself as much as possible about the disease by talking to your doctor, reading on your own, and consulting other resources. There are many good sites online devoted to living with diabetes, for example. Try visiting the American Diabetes Association at http://www.diabetes.org/ or Diabetes.uk at http://www.diabetes.co.uk/ to get started. These sites offer plenty of information, tips, food recipes, and general support.

Give the patient 3 glucose tablets, if available.,
Wait 15 minutes, then test the person's blood sugar.",How to Give Glucose to a Diabetic1," These tablets contain roughly .14 ounces (4 grams) of glucose each. You can find them at most pharmacies without a prescription.


If you do not have glucose tablets, you can give the patient one tablespoon (15 ml) of sugar, honey or sweetened jelly.
Alternately you could give the person 4 ounces (118 ml) of fruit juice or non-diet soda. As a last resort, if you have nothing else on you, give the patient 5 or 6 pieces of hard candy.;
, The meter should read above 70 mg/dl (4 mmol/L). If the blood sugar level is still too low, repeat the treatment and test again.

Check the expiration date on the emergency glucagon kit.,
Turn the person onto his or her left side.,
Tap the syringe gently with your finger to check for bubbles.,
Clean the injection site with an astringent.,
Pinch a fold of skin in one hand.,
Quickly push in the needle completely into the pinched area of skin.

,
Push the plunger in completely and give the amount stated on the kit's bottle.

,
Remove the syringe slowly.,
Place the cover back over the used needle.,
Follow the procedure for a conscious patient when the person becomes alert.",How to Give Glucose to a Diabetic2," If the kit is still usable, mix the glucagon powder and liquid as directed on the box.

, This will prevent choking if he or she vomits, which can occur after an injection of this medicine.

, If any appear, push the plunger slightly to force out the air.

, An easily accessible spot would be the upper arm. Let it dry for a few seconds.

, Hold the syringe close to the fold with your fingers off the plunger.


Usually the syringe is held at a 90-degree angle, however a 45 degree angle is often needed for small children and thin adults. This is to prevent the injection from going into the muscle.

,,, Be sure it is being removed at the same angle it was inserted.

, Dispose of the used needle in a sharp disposal box as soon as possible.

,


Emergency services should be called immediately if the patient does not come to within 15 minutes.

"
Diet is part of the cure of Type 2.,
Exercise may be a cure (Type 2).,
Have a medical plan for exercise to adjust dosage downward, ""if taking insulin or using blood sugar lowering drugs"", because exercise lowers blood glucose, and too much insulin can possibly result in hypoglycemia.

,
Take medications on time as instructed, keeping all self-testing records.,
Follow your doctor's guidelines, including, but not limited to: checking your blood sugar as directed, taking insulin/medication as directed, following a meal schedule, if necessary.,
Have your hemoglobin A1c test done every 3 months or as directed by your physician.,
Stop smoking!,
Know how to treat hyperglycemia, or high blood sugar which can occur in both Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes.,
High (hyper) blood sugar is life-threatening for another reason -- untreated it can rapidly progress into diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which frequently requires hospitalization.,
Low (hypo) blood sugar is, also, life-threatening -- called hypoglycemia caused by too much insulin, for little or no food, or other overdose: you need to know how to recognize and treat it -- mainly when taking insulin or glucose lowering drugs.,
Once the patient has self-treated, wait 10-15 minutes, then test his or her blood sugar to confirm that blood sugar levels have risen above 70mg/dL (3.9mmol/L).,
Intervene for another person.,
Get emergency help, if the diabetic is: unconscious, unable to swallow, or having a seizure, as outside intervention is necessary.,
Know how to use a glucagon emergency kit; get one and instruct family members and friends how to use it.",How to Improve Your Health as a Diabetic," Type 1 and 2 need to maintain a healthy diabetic diet, on schedule (don't get too hungry) to get better. Follow the advice of your doctor or diabetes educator.



Eat slowly; the sensor in your brain needs about 20 minutes to get the ""I'm full!"" signal.
If you eat quickly, you get full, even overeating -- but still feel hungry.
Drink water with your meal to avoid overeating.

, If it is medically safe, start exercising 30 minutes a day, of vigorous but low impact activity. A 30-minute walk at a quick pace can help to reduce blood sugar, and possibly the amount of medication needed. You can also break your exercise into 3, 10- or 2, 15-minute periods, throughout the day.

,, Make and keep appointments with your health team and doctor, and for getting laboratory tests as instructed.Missing your insulin doses can cause hypoglycemia or ketoacidosis (high blood acid) -- either may cause ""seizures, coma and death"".

,
Get regular eye, kidney function, and foot checkups.
Communicate with your health care professional, developing an effective treatment plan for diabetes -- by working together with your health team -- so you are better prepared to handle the illness.

, Aim for a value of 6.5% or less as recommended by the American Diabetes Association. This test measures your average blood sugar levels over a period of 2-3 months and is a strong indicator of overall glycemic control.

, Smoking raises blood sugar levels, damages blood vessels which can lead to heart disease and stroke, and adversely affects circulation due to constriction of blood vessels. Heart disease, stroke, and circulation problems are frequent complications of diabetes, even in non-smokers; a diabetic smoker greatly increases his or her risk of developing these complications.

,


High blood sugar occurs at a level above 126mg/dL (7mmol/L), occurring as a result of stress, insufficient insulin, too much food, or an issue with oral medication.

Watch high sugar symptoms including: frequent thirst, frequent urination, unusual hunger, fatigue, and irritability.
Treatment includes adjusting insulin treatment (frequently, patients using insulin will simply take a correction shot based on the level of their blood sugar), or adjusting oral medications.
Untreated hyperglycemia is a leading cause of complications from diabetes, thus it is important to recognize and treat hyperglycemia as directed by your physician.
While patients taking insulin will typically adjust their insulin dosages to lower blood sugar, patients taking oral medication or patients using diet or exercise will typically have to adjust their carbohydrate intake to control blood sugar.

,


Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, unquenchable thirst, diarrhea, and muscle cramps. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms of DKA, SEEK URGENT MEDICAL ATTENTION, from not enough insulin.

,


Hypoglycemia occurs when the blood sugar level is below 70mg/dL (3.9mmol/L). It can occur as a result of stress, too much insulin, too little food for the amount of insulin you used, or an issue with oral diabetes medication.

Watch low sugar symptoms including: shakiness, tremor, rapid heart beat, sweating, clamminess -- even possible seizure, coma or death.

Caution: untreated hypoglycemia can rapidly progress into the worst results of seizures, coma, or death; thus, it is very important that hypoglycemia is quickly recognized and treated as directed by your physician.
In any situation where the patient believes that he or she is suffering from hypoglycemia, the patient should confirm with a blood sugar test; however, the patient should treat immediately, if they feel that the hypoglycemia is severe and it would take too long to test. Mild hypoglycemia can be treated by the patient and usually involves consuming 15 grams of carbohydrates, in the form of sugary (not diet) soda, fruit juice, glucose tablets/gel, or a small snack in the form of crackers, pretzels, hard candy, etc. It is important to note that candy bars contain a high amount of fat and can slow the absorption of sugar from the candy bar; therefore, it is not advised that patients use high-fat candy bars to treat hypoglycemia as the blood sugars may not rise fast enough to prevent drops in blood sugar.;
,


If the blood sugar levels are still below 70mg/dL (3.9mmol/L), the patient should repeat the treatment process, and if upon testing again after 10-15 minutes blood sugar levels are still below 70mg/dL (3.9mmol/L), the patient should treat once again and consult his/her physician immediately.
After successful self-treatment for a hypoglycemic event, if the patient has a meal planned within the next 30 minutes, the patient should continue as normal but continue to monitor his or her symptoms or blood glucose to check for any additional episodes of hypoglycemia.
If his/her next meal is beyond 30 minutes, the patient should consume a small snack (1/2 of a sandwich and an 8oz glass of milk, or a pack of peanut butter crackers).

, Severe hypoglycemia is an urgent medical condition that requires immediate intervention, and can sometimes require intervention from a second- or third-party. It can occur when blood sugars fall so rapidly that the patient is not well enough to self-treat, or when the patient suffers from ""hypoglycemia unawareness"" (perhaps a child or elderly diabetic).


Severe hypoglycemia can result in fainting, seizures, or death. Treatment may or may not be possible by the patient themselves due to significant impairment, however, treatment remains the same: raise blood sugar levels as rapidly as possible. This may be achieved using oral carbohydrates, if the patient is conscious.

, Contact 911 or emergency medical technicians or paramedics.
, It may save your life, if you have ""severe low blood sugar and are unconscious"". The paramedics may not arrive in time.

Learn everything you can about diabetes and possible dangers when taking insulin.,
Ask your friend what you can do to help.",How to Help a Friend Deal With Diabetes (Type 1)1," This is an introduction. The Web sites at the end of this article will give you a good place to start from here.

, Some people are not comfortable with everyone knowing they have diabetes -- nor do they want everyone to try to help out. They may try to keep it very low-key.

For your friend using insulin: learn symptoms, when to treat, while following doctors' and parents' instructions for a low blood sugar attack -- be ready to help, if possible.,
""Low"" blood sugar (hypoglycemia) attack: realize it can quickly cause sickness, harm cells and organs, and become life-threatening -- when the patient needs to raise blood sugar.,
Know when to test and treat by looking for the many symptoms (signs) of deadly serious ""low"" blood sugar: feeling sick, fatigue (unusual tiredness), weakness, dizziness, forgetfulness, nervousness, anxiety, faint, fainting, insomnia, sweating, hunger and confusion.",How to Help a Friend Deal With Diabetes (Type 1)2,"


Terms: (1) ""gly·ce·mi·a"" -- noun -- the presence of glucose (simple sugar) in the blood. (2) ""hyp-o-glycemia"" -- low blood sugar (""hypo"" means low). (3) ""hyp-er-glycemia"" -- high blood sugar (""hyper"" means high, syn. super).;
, Why? The patient: (1) may have had too much insulin, and it keeps moving sugar out of the blood, into cells as sugar (or some sugar that was changed into fat was moved into fat-cells), (2) or because of ""over-exercising"" the body used available insulin/and sugar and is ""out of fuel"", or (3) not enough food was eaten for the amount of insulin in the dose used.Adjusting: Your friend always needs to try to balance the amount of insulin used to the expected exercise and how much and what kind of foods are appropriate.
Ask how to adjust insulin, food and snacks as instructed by their doctor or parents.


Usually sugary snacks are: one small serving of fruit juice, glucose tablets, a little sugar, or a few sugary candies/sweets (such as fruit pastilles or jelly babies) that can quickly supply sugar, neutralizing the symptoms of hypoglycemia. Do NOT give your friend chocolate, crackers, biscuits or so on if they are hypo (usually under 4.0). These are slow-release carbohydrates and s/he needs fast release carbohydrates. Treat as instructed by the doctor and parents.

, When your friend has some of the symptoms, they help both of you to identify the dangers of hypoglycemia. (Also, more general feelings of: depression, fear, mood swings, temper outbursts, confusion, sadness and crying may indicate low blood sugar condition, as well.)



Learn when, how and why to - ""test, treat, wait, re-test"".

Typical treatment, after each testing that showed low sugar, is with one of the sugary snacks. Wait the correct number of minutes, as instructed by doctor or parents, after the snack -- before re-testing.
If your friend still has low sugar after waiting and re-testing, then treat again, wait and test again.

Hyperglycemia - the high blood sugar attack, also, can quickly become life-threatening when the patient is using insulin.,
Know the signs (symptoms) of a ""high"" blood sugar attack: extreme thirst, frequent urination, unusual/blurry vision , leg cramps, fatigue, feeling faint/or fainting, unusual weakness, trembling, nausea, irritability and stomach cramps.

,
Test when there are symptoms, and treat right -- wrong treatment is dangerous -- life-threatening.,
Get emergency help, if the patient cannot treat themselves, and no other help is available.,
Ask about the worst possible dangers of high blood sugar:


Shock
Unable to talk coherently (confusion)
Seizure, incapacitation
Unconsciousness
Coma (prolonged unconsciousness)
Death is possible if help is not quick enough

,
Be taught to give shots, you might need to do so in the future.,
Eat the same foods as your friend when you spend time together.,
Ask questions -- if there is something you don't know, that you feel is important, make sure to ask or find out yourself!",How to Help a Friend Deal With Diabetes (Type 1)3," Insulin needs an occasional ""adjustment"" -- because of having (1) possibly not used/forgotten a dose of insulin -- or the dose of insulin was not enough: (2) or did little or no exercise, not burning the sugar and leaving sugar too high -- or 3) eating too much food, especially of the wrong foods, including too rich and sugary, starchy and greasy foods) for the amount of insulin injected; combinations of those raise sugar to a dangerous level.

,, Ask your friend and their parents about what you can learn what to do in these situations!


As above, ""test, treat, wait, re-test"" but for high blood sugar.

, Don't hesitate to call the ambulance.

,, Have someone show you how to give insulin shots, so you can give one in an emergency, when the patient is unable to do so.

, A diabetic diet is very healthy. Your friend will appreciate the support.

Ask about being hungry after dinner: suggest your friend to: ""Ask your doctor about adjusting insulin so that you won't usually ""need"" to eat an unhealthy, heavy snack to counterattack your evening insulin"".
Your friend can use these ""free"" foods that have few, if any, carbohydrates and calories, so one of them won't cause weight gain or increase blood sugar -- from Mayo Clinic article:

""Are late-night snacks a 'no-no' for people who have diabetes?"" -- Ans: ""No!"" Try these ""free"" foods as late snacks:A can of diet soda,
A serving of sugar-free gelatin,
Five baby carrots,
Two saltine crackers,
One vanilla wafer,
Four almonds (or similar nuts),
One piece of gum or small hard candy.
Any food with less than approximately 10g of carbohydrate for a child and 15g for an adult is okay between injections

Consult your doctor for exercise recommendations.,
Buy a medical identification bracelet to wear at all times, and especially when exercising.,
Figure out your diabetes-safe diet before you start an exercise regime.,
Eat a doctor-approved snack about 1 and a half hours before you work out.,
Use a pedometer.,
Ask a friend to start exercising with you, or find 1 at a diabetic support groups.",How to Get More Exercise If You're Diabetic1," Diabetes can affect the extremities and cause pain, requiring you to choose exercises that work best with your abilities, until you feel better. Most doctors suggest that diabetic patients should start with no-impact or low-impact exercise.


Your doctor may recommend that you see a physical therapist before you start exercising on your own. If you are new to exercise or you have recently injured a part of your body, then a physical therapist can lead you down the proper exercise path to help you recover. Go to sessions for 1 to 2 months before starting your individual workout program.;
, You should have your name, your condition, a number to call and other instructions on the bracelet so people working out around you will be able to help you if anything goes wrong.

, Studies have shown that it is easier for people to adopt good behavior if they only have to focus on changing 1 thing in their life at a time. Follow your doctor's or nutritionist's recommendations for a month before starting to make workouts part of your day.


Exercise moderately, immediately after three meals each day. This curbed risky blood sugar spikes all day. This works for people who do shorter/intermittent exercise on a daily basis.
The study found those three short walks each day after meals were as effective reducing blood sugar within 24 hours as was a single 45-minute walk at the same moderate pace. The innovative exercise science study was conducted at the George Washington University School of Public Health and Health Services (SPHHS).

, Approximately 100 to 200 calories of healthy carbohydrates will work to keep your blood sugar steady, and you will benefit from the extra energy. However, do not eat right before your workout.

, Wear it around for a whole, average day to see how many steps you take. Set goals to do 1,000 more steps per day each week, resulting in the overall goal of at least 10,000 steps per day.


Doctors recommend an average of 10,000 steps a day as a good parameter for judging if you have an active lifestyle. Stanford University scientists found that people that wear pedometers increase their overall activity by approximately 30 percent. Many people who commute, drive to stores or work in an office do not meet that goal. Think of diabetic exercise as an element of overall goal of an active lifestyle.

, Many towns and hospitals host these groups. Studies have found that diabetics, especially those over 60, change their behavior if they have a ""contract"" to exercise with a friend.

Obtain insurance.,
Call your existing insurance company.,
Consider Medicare.,
Try Medicaid.,
Ask for veteran benefits if you are a veteran.",How to Get Free Diabetes Supplies1," If you do not have insurance already, you should enroll in an insurance program. Insurance can provide free or discounted diabetes supplies under basic coverage.


You can enroll in an insurance program through healthcare.gov, a public database provided under the Affordable Care Act. Under AFA, you cannot be turned down for preexisting conditions and you may be eligible for a discounted premium depending on your current income. There is a toll-free number to call if you have any questions.You can try to pursue a private insurance program on your own. You will have to undergo a health insurance physical, which will serve to determine your pay rate. This choice may be costly, especially if you already have diabetes. This may increase your monthly premium.
If you are currently employed, see if your employer provides health care options and what you need to do to get on their plan.;
, If you're already insured, call your insurance company to talk about diabetes coverage. You can ask them what supplies will be covered under their program, what the copay is, and whether local pharmacies will offer you free or discounted supplies. If you're unhappy with your current coverage, consider pursuing an alternative insurance plan.

, Medicare is a government assistantship program that provides discounted health care to those 65 and over. If you're in this age group and need help paying for diabetes supplies, look into Medicare.



Medicare Part B is basic medical insurance provided by Medicare. Part B will cover blood sugar self-testing equipment and supplies, insulin pumps, and therapeutic shots or shoe inserts.If you have or are at risk for diabetes, you'll be encouraged to enroll in Medicare Part D, which is Medicare's prescription drug coverage. This will cover diabetes supplies insulin and other anti-diabetic drugs.Make sure you find health care providers that accept Medicare as a form of payment. Not all providers do and you'll be required to pay full costs of coverage if your medicare is denied., Medicaid is a state-administered health insurance plan for low income individuals and families. If you qualify for Medicaid, you may be able to get diabetes supplies for free or at a discounted rate.


Medicaid should cover inpatient and outpatient services for most medical issues. This means doctor's appointments regarding diabetes will be covered as well as diabetes supplies.As with Medicare, make sure the health insurance provider you choose accepted Medicaid before making an appointment. If your doctor does not accept Medicaid, you'll be expected to pay full costs., If you are a US veteran, you are entitled to certain health care benefits upon returning from active duty. Call your local VA office to ask about coverage.


Certain herbicides that veterans are sometimes exposed to during service can cause diabetes. If this is the case for you, you may be entitled to full coverage and disability assistance.Even if your diabetes is not a result of your service, you are entitled to some health care coverage as a veteran. A variety of diabetes supplies may be covered depending on your program and benefits. Talk to someone at your local VA office to ask about coverage."

Start slowly.,
Try classes at a local gym or recreational center.,
Start with a water exercise program.,
Create a mix of cardiovascular exercise and strength training.,
Choose exercises you enjoy.,
Journal about your exercise.,
Test yourself frequently.",How to Get More Exercise If You're Diabetic2," Many people with Type II diabetes have not exercised for a number of years, and others suffer from obesity. The first goal is to exercise for a total of 30 minutes per day, but for the first few weeks to a month, you should break up your exercise into 10 to 15 minute intervals.

, After you are able to complete 30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise at 1 time, you can try to join a dance, water aerobics, kickboxing, yoga, spinning, pilates or other class. You may find that you have more fun when you mix up your exercise routine with classes and at-home or gym workouts.

, Go to a local pool and consider taking a class in swimming, aqua aerobics, stretching or water walking. Water supports your body weight, making it easier on your joints and giving you resistance.

, Studies have shown that those diabetics who followed a mixed exercise regime, rather than simply weight training or doing aerobic exercise, had the largest improvement in their condition. Doctors suggest trading days you walk, bike or do other cardio exercises with days you use small weights or resistance bands so that you don't overload yourself, but you do both each week.

, The best chance you have at starting a good habit of exercise are when you look at them as fun activities. Working out with a friend and mixing up your routine may be ways to have more fun when you exercise.

, Keeping track of your daily diabetic workouts and improvements will spur you on to exercise more. It is the same behavioral reasoning that works with keeping a ""contract"" to exercise. You feel obligated to work out and then write down something positive in your journal.


If your doctor gave you an ""ideal weight"" to reach through diet and exercise, track your progress in your journal. Limit yourself to using the scale only once per week, so that you can see your changes on a reasonable step by step basis, rather than based on daily ups and downs. Exercise should be more than about losing weight, and you should develop a program that you will continue long into the future.

, As part of a healthy lifestyle, you should already be testing yourself at regular, often daily times. If you find that your tests improve with exercise, then you will be encouraged to keep doing it.

Try a GoFundMe campaign.,
Hold an event fundraiser.,
Look for fundraising opportunities in your area.",How to Get Free Diabetes Supplies3," GoFundMe is an website that allows you to crowd fun for a variety of projects and causes. If you need help paying for diabetes medications, you can open a GoFundMe page to ask friends and family members to help you pay for meds.


GoFundMe does charge a flat fee of 5% on all donations collected. Plan ahead for the fact that the total money collected for your cause might not be the total money you'll receive.You can only hold an online even for so long. Try to appeal to your needs. Explain your financial situation and cost of medication. Give ranges of donations that would be helpful. Be very gracious for any donations you receive., An event fundraiser can be any get together where guests are asked to donate money to a cause. Many people undergoing health problems host fundraisers in their hometowns or cities to raise money for medical needs.


Choose an event people will enjoy. Dinners, drinks, and competitions tend to draw in crowds. Try collaborating with a local business. A local bar, for example, might host a drink night where a certain percentage of their profit for the night goes to your cause.
You can advertise using social media, which is probably the cheapest route. You can also put up fliers around town and ask local newspapers and radios to spread the word.

, Oftentimes, churches, community centers, hospitals, and other organizations fundraise for specific medical issues.

Educate yourself so that you will better understand how this disease and its complications work. Knowledge is power. Learn how to make lifestyle choices that will put you in the driver's seat. Then, take what you learn and put it into action. Action gets results.
Attitude is important in managing diabetes. Instead of viewing diabetes as a compromised life filled with ""do's"" and ""don'ts"", look at this as an opportunity to live a healthier life that may even be healthier than you've ever lived before.
Embrace a totally new lifestyle rather than try to ""fix"" the old one. View your old life as dead and gone, walk away from it and don't ever look back. Successful diabetes management isn't giving up on living but rather considering it to be a way to move up to a new, different way of living that is healthier and more enjoyable.

Your doctor will perform an exam to determine if you're healthy enough for exercise. According to the American Diabetes Association, your doctor may advise against weight training if you have the following diabetes complications.If your doctor advises against weight training, that doesn't mean you can't be in shape- try lighter activities like walking or jogging.


Retinopathy. This condition causes capillaries in the retina to balloon in size and form pouches. Weightlifting is usually not advised with this condition because the strain of lifting can burst the pouches and damage the eye.Neuropathy. This condition affects the body's nervous system and inhibits body systems from working properly. Dehydration makes this condition worse, so your doctor may advise against exercising or will recommend that you take adequate breaks to prevent complications.High blood pressure. Heavy lifting can over strain your body if you have high blood pressure. Your doctor may recommend training with lighter weights and cardio exercises to get your blood pressure down before allowing you to move on to heavy weights.;
, If you have diabetes, you know that wounds can take a long time to heal and can easily get infected. If you workout with bad shoes, blisters and abrasions can form on your feet and cause potentially serious complications. To prevent this, always practice good foot care when working out.Get a pair of shoes with good cushioning. They should fit well- shoes that are too big or small will rub against your feet and cause abrasions. When trying on a pair of shoes, walk around and make sure there are no pressure points where the shoe rubs against your foot.
Always check your shoes for pebbles or other objects before putting them on.
Also wear smooth socks, and don't reuse them before washing. Sweaty socks can increase your risk for athlete's foot and other infections.

, If you've been active before, you might already know this. But if you've been inactive for a while, you may not know how exercise will affect your body. Before starting any kind of weight training regimen, you should start out with light exercises like a brisk walk. Test your blood sugar before, during, and after the walk. If your blood sugar doesn't drop too low, you can move on to exercising with light weights. Again, test your blood sugar before, during, and after. If your body tolerates this, and your doctor has cleared you for physical activity, then you can start working to build muscle., This isn't necessary, but it will be very helpful, especially if you're new to weight training. A personal trainer can talk with you about your goals and design workouts to help you reach them. Most gyms have personal trainers on staff, so ask about these services at your gym.Make sure you inform a personal trainer about your diabetes. This will help him design workouts that will work best for you. It is also important for safety, because your trainer can monitor you for signs of hypoglycemia or other complications.

, When working with weights, aim to do two or three sets of 8-12 repetitions within each set. Let your body rest for about a minute in between sets. When lifting, breathe out when you perform the lift or exertion, and breathe in when returning to your start position. You can apply these general guidelines to any weight-based workout., This focus will give you faster results over your whole body. The major areas you should concentrate on are the back, chest, arms, and legs. There are several workouts you can do to train each of these areas and increase your overall muscle mass., While beginners to weight training often overlook the back, it is important for balanced upper body strength. There are large muscles here that can be strengthened and toned with several good workouts.Pull-ups. This simple exercise can be performed with only a bar and no other equipment. It trains the muscles of your upper and mid back. Grasp the bar with your hands roughly shoulder-width apart, then pull your chin over the bar. Make sure you keep your shoulder blades pinched together to ensure that you are keeping the workout focused on your back muscles. As an added bonus, pull-ups will strengthen your biceps as well. See Do Pullups for a more detailed description of performing pull-ups.
Lat Pull-down. This workout is similar to a pull-up, except it is done sitting down with a machine. Grab the bar with your hands a bit wider than shoulder-width apart. Then pull the bar down to your chest and smoothly raise it again.
Cable row. With this workout, you'll sit down on a bench and pull a weighted handle towards you. This workout trains the middle back, as well as the biceps. Click here for a video description of this workout.
Shrugs. This workout will train your trapezius, the muscle between your neck and shoulders. To perform a shrug, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Hold a barbell, or a dumbbell in each hand. Then raise your shoulders to your ears.

, The chest contains the pectoralis major and minor muscles. These are large muscles that can add a lot of mass if trained properly. Try the following workouts to increase the size and strength of your chest.Pushups. You don't need any equipment for this workout, just the floor. It will train your chest, as well as your triceps. Read Do a Push Up for a detailed description of proper technique and variations of this workout. Pushups are also a good way to warm up before lifting heavier weights.
Dumbbell press. This is similar to a pushup, except it is done on a bench with dumbbells. Lay back on a bench with a dumbbell in each hand. For your starting position, hold the dumbbells just above your shoulders. Then press your hands up and have the dumbbells touch above your chest before returning to the start position.
Pectoral Flyes. This workout is done with a machine. You sit upright on a bench and place your hands on the pads or handles that will be on each side of you. Then you push forward and have your hands meet in front of you. This exercise isolates the chest more than pushups or the dumbbell press, so use it if you want to focus on the chest.

, The two major muscle groups in your arms are the biceps and triceps. You should train both groups to strengthen your arms and build muscle mass. Several of the exercises already mentioned will also train your arms: pullups and pull downs will train your biceps, and pushups and dumbbell presses will train your triceps. In addition, there are other exercises that will isolate the arm muscles and train them specifically.


Bicep curls. With this exercise, you will isolate the biceps. You can perform this exercise standing or sitting. Take a dumbbell in each hand and start with your arms at your sides. Then bend your arms at the elbows, bringing your hands up to your shoulders. Click here for an instructional video demonstrating a proper curl.
Tricep push downs. This exercise isolates the triceps and is done with a machine. Grab either a bar or rope attached to a weight. Your starting position should be with your hands in front of you about chest-height. Then, using only your elbows, push the bar down to your hips before returning to the start position., Some of the biggest muscles in your body are in your legs, so training this area will give you a big increase in muscle mass. There are numerous workouts you can choose from, all of which will train your legs in different ways.


Squats. This workout primarily trains the quads and glutes, but it also works the entire leg and lower back. Read Do a Squat and watch this video to learn the proper technique before trying this. It would also be a good idea to consult a trainer at the gym to instruct you- it is a great workout, but you can seriously hurt your knees, back, and neck if you don't use proper form.
Leg extensions. This workout trains the quads. It involves placing your feet into a machine. Then you extend your legs forward, which will lift a weight attached to a cable.Lunges. This workout will train your hamstrings, on the back of your leg. To perform the workout, hold a dumbbell in each hand. Then stand with your feet shoulder-width apart with your arms at your sides. Take a big step forward with one leg, then bring your other leg forward so you are standing with your feet shoulder-width again. Read Do a Front Lunge Exercise for more details on this workout.Calf raises. This workout will train your calves, which are on the lower part of your leg. They can be done either with a machine or by just holding a weight. To perform the workout, place your feet halfway onto a ledge so your heels dangle off the back. Then, either holding a weight or using a machine, shift your weight to the balls of your feet and lift your heels up. Then return to the starting position with your heels dangling off the side of the ledge., When you workout with the same exercises for several weeks, your muscles start to adjust, and the exercises won't give you great results anymore. This is called a plateau. To avoid this, don't let your muscles get used to the workout. Perform only one or two of these suggested workouts per muscle group at a time. Then in a few weeks, replace the exercises with a new one. By keeping your muscles guessing, you'll ensure that you see maximum results from your workout regimen., You should continue to check your blood sugar before and after working out, even when you've been exercising for a while. If you being noticing that your blood sugar drops a lot during workouts, you should consult your doctor for the best action to take., Exercise can lead to a sharp drop in blood sugar, or hypoglycemia. This can lead to fainting or a diabetic coma. If you experience any of these symptoms, stop working out immediately and test your blood sugar.Dizziness and confusion.
Shakiness and muscle weakness.
Extreme hunger.
A headache.
Irritability.
A pounding heartbeat.
Pale skin.

, If you feel hypoglycemic, test your blood sugar. If it is too low, take a rest and eat this emergency snack. It will help bring your blood sugar back up and prevent further complications. There are a number of sources of carbohydrates that you could use to treat hypoglycemia.A few pieces of hard candy (not sugar-free).
1/2 cup of a soft drink.
1/2 cup fruit juice.
1 cup skim milk.
Glucose tablets designed to treat hypoglycemia.

, This will let any emergency personnel know that you are diabetic. This is important because if you experience hypoglycemia, you could faint. If first responders know that you are diabetic, they can treat you more effectively. Consider wearing this sort of identification while working out just in case of emergencies., Staying hydrated is an essential part of exercising safely. Be sure to replace all of the water you're sweating out while exercising.Be on the lookout for the following symptoms of dehydration.Dizziness or confusion.
Dry mouth and swollen tongue.
Fatigue.
Decreased or ceased sweating.

, These minor injuries can be very slow to heal if you have diabetes and could get infected if left untreated. Be sure to inspect your body for any injuries after every workout. Focus especially on your hands and feet, since these will be stressed the most during your workout. If you find one, see your doctor as soon as possible so he can properly clean and wrap the wound., With or without diabetes, rest is essential for any weight training program. You have to give your body adequate rest time to repair itself after workouts. Otherwise, not only will you not build muscle, but you could seriously hurt yourself. When doing a weight training program, aim to workout every other day. That will allow your body to rebuild its muscles so you build the muscle mass you're looking for., Exercising depletes the body of essential nutrients and fluids. In order to make your workout successful, you have to replace these to help your body recover and build muscle.Use the ingredients suggested in this section to put together a high-quality meal that will help you build muscle and avoid affecting your blood sugar.

, Protein is the essential ingredient for building muscle. While doing your weight training regimen, include proteins in every one of your meals to give your body the building blocks it needs to strengthen your muscles. There are many options for including protein in your diet.Nuts. Any kind of nut is high in protein. You can't go wrong including these in your meals or just snacking on them throughout the day.
Beans. Not only do these give you a high dose of protein, but they have a low glycemic index, so they won't affect your blood sugar. If using canned beans, be sure to drain the liquid so you don't overdose on sodium.
Fat-free dairy products. Milk and yogurt are great sources of protein. Have a glass of milk or a cup of yogurt for an easy dose of protein.
Fish. Salmon, tuna, and herring are usually considered the best options for protein, but any fish will do as well. Make sure you avoid fried fish, however, or you'll consume saturated fats that could be harmful.

, You need carbohydrates in your diet because without them, your body will use protein for energy. This will divert protein from your muscles and you won't build any mass. Carbohydrates from bleached or enriched products like white bread have a high glycemic index and will raise your blood sugar. Whole wheat products, however, will give you non-enriched carbohydrates. Eat whole wheat bread, pasta, and cereals to give yourself a good serving of carbohydrates., It is a fallacy that we should cut fat out of our diets. While saturated and trans fats should be avoided, mono and polyunsaturated fats are beneficial for your health. They can reduce your cholesterol levels and also help you build muscle. Try some of these foods for good sources of good fats.Avocados.
Fish. Salmon and sardines contain high levels of omega-3 fatty acids.
Olive oil.
Seeds, especially sunflower, sesame, and pumpkin seeds.

Understand the risks of injecting insulin.",How to Give Insulin Shots," Before giving yourself or your child a shot, you need to gather together your little insulin bottle (vial), syringe and alcohol pads. Check the label to make sure you have the right kind of insulin, as it's available in short-acting, intermediate and long-acting varieties — your doctor will explain what type is best for you.There are different devices used to inject insulin, including various sized syringes, insulin pens, pumps and jet injectors.


Syringes are the most common method of insulin delivery. They’re inexpensive and most insurance companies pay for them.
Syringes vary by the amount of insulin they hold and needle size. Most are made of plastic (made for one-time use) and have the needles already attached to the end.As a general rule: use a 1mL syringe if your dose is 50 to 100 units of insulin; use a 0.5mL syringe if your dose is 30 to 50 units of insulin; use a 0.3mL syringe if your dose is less than 30 units of insulin.Insulin needles used to be 12.7mm in length, but shorter needles (4mm – 8mm) are just as effective and lead to less discomfort.;
, Insulin is typically stored in the refrigerator because the colder temperature deters it from spoiling or going bad — the cold essentially preserves it longer. However, you should only give insulin shots once the insulin is at room temperature.As such, take the vial of insulin out of your fridge about 30 minutes prior to injecting it in order to give it enough time to warm up. Never microwave or boil it to get it warmer quicker as that will destroy the hormone.


Injecting cold insulin into your body is usually a little more uncomfortable and the insulin can lose a little of its potency or effectiveness. Always use at room temperature for best results.
Once you open and start using a vial of insulin, it can be kept at room temperature for up to a month before there's any concern of it expiring or becoming less potent.

, Before filling the syringe, check that you have the correct insulin type and that it's not expired. Liquid insulin should never have clumps in it.Sanitize your hands before removing the plastic cover from the insulin vial, then wipe the top of the vial with an alcohol wipe to disinfect it. Next, take the cap off the needle, pull back the syringe plunger to the mark that corresponds to how much insulin you want, then put the needle through the rubber top of the vial and push the plunger down. Keep the needle in the vial and turn it upside down, then pull back the plunger again to get the correct dose of insulin into the syringe.


Short-acting insulin is clear with no particles in it. Don't use it if there are clumps or particles in the vial.
Intermediate-acting insulin is cloudy and must be rolled between your hands to mix it — don't shake the vial as it can cause the insulin to clump.
Check the syringe for air bubbles, as there shouldn't be any. If there are, tap the syringe so the bubbles float to the top and inject them back into the insulin vial.
If you see no air bubbles put the loaded syringe down carefully and then proceed to select your injection site.

, Some types of insulin can be mixed, but not all, so never do so unless you are told to and shown by your doctor. Once you doctor has told you how much of each type you need, add their individual totals up to get one total volume and proceed to fill your syringe as described above by pulling it back. Your doctor will also tell you which insulin to draw up into the syringe first — always do it in that order.Usually, short-acting insulin is drawn into the syringe before intermediate varieties and the intermediate types before the long-lasting ones.


Since short-acting insulin is clear and long-acting insulin is cloudy, you can use the following to help you remember the order when drawing insulin up: always start clear and end cloudy.
Insulin mixing is done to provide both immediate and long-lasting effects in dealing with high blood glucose levels.
Using syringes allow you to mix different types of insulin, whereas other injection methods (such as insulin pens) don't.
Not all diabetics need to mix different types of insulin to effectively treat their condition and some find the procedure too complicated or time-consuming. Usually, this is an evolution of process; as diabetes worsens over time, more insulin is needed to adequately treat the patient.
The physician prescribing the insulin should train you on this method of insulin delivery so that you can practice under her supervision before doing it on your own.

, Insulin should be injected into the fatty tissue just below your skin, which is called subcutaneous fat.As such, the most common injection sites are areas that tend to have a good layer of subcutaneous fat, such as the abdomen, thigh, buttocks or underneath the upper arm. People who get insulin shots every day need to rotate their injection sites to prevent injury. You can rotate to different injection sites within the same body part (keep at least an inch between sites) or switch to different body parts.


If you inject insulin deeper into muscle tissue, it'll get absorbed too quickly and potentially lead to dangerously low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia).
Injecting too much into the same site can trigger lipodystrophy, which leads to either a breakdown or build-up of subcutaneous fat. This is important to know because this can affect insulin absorption and if this happens, it will not work as well in injected in the area where lipodystrophy forms. This is why it is important to alternate injection sites.
Keep your shots at least 1 inch away from scars and 2 inches away from your belly button. Never inject into an area that's bruised, swollen or tender., Once you've chosen the site, it's time to inject the insulin. The site should be clean and dry — wash it with soap and water (not alcohol) if it's unclear. Pinch your skin and fat together and gently pull it away from underlying muscle, then insert the needle at a 90° angle (perpendicularly or straight up / down) if your tissue is thick enough.If you're lean (common with type 1 diabetics), insert the needle at a 45° angle for more comfort. Insert the needle all the way in, then let go of the skin and inject the insulin slowly and steadily by pushing the plunger until it's all gone from the syringe.


When you're finished, place the needle / syringe in a designated plastic container and keep it away from children. Never reuse needles or syringes.Keep a chart of places you have used for injection sites. Your doctor may be able to provide you with an illustrated chart / diagram to keep track.

, After injecting the insulin into a chosen site, it's a good idea to leave the needle / syringe in place for at least 5 seconds to allow all of the hormone to absorb into the tissue and prevent it from seeping back out.While the needle is in place, try not to move your body part in order to prevent discomfort. If needles always make you feel a little queasy or weak in the knees, then look away for the 5 seconds before proceeding to remove it.


If some insulin leaks from the injection site, press down on your skin for 5-10 seconds with a clean tissue to absorb it and stop the flow.
Remember to pull the needle out at the same angle it went in to avoid any tissue injury — either a 90° or 45° angle.

, Insulin shots with regular syringes / needles are not as painful as most people think, although using insulin pens is often more comfortable and convenient. Other advantages include: there's no need to draw the insulin from a vial; doses can be easily dialed into the pen, and it can be used for most insulin types.The main disadvantage is that you can't mix different kinds of insulin together if that's what your doctor prescribes.


The pen may be the best choice for school-aged children who must deliver injections at school as it is easy for them to carry the pen with them and there's no need to retrieve their insulin from a refrigerator.There are different insulin pens for you to choose from — some are disposable while some use replaceable insulin cartridges and needles.Pens and cartridges may be more expensive than syringes and insulin vials.

, Check your pen to make sure it is the right prescription and that it has not expired. Wipe the tip of the pen with an alcohol swab. Remove the protective tab from the needle and screw it onto the pen. Your doctor should have given you a prescription for both the pen and the needles.If you are using short-acting insulin, it should appear clear, with no particles, discoloration, our cloudiness.Open the pen to expose the needle and clean the needle with an alcohol swab.
Intermediate- or long-acting insulin will appear cloudy, and will need to be mixed before injection.Gently roll the pen between your hands and turn the pen up and down ten times to mix the insulin sufficiently., Remove the outer needle cap, which you can reuse, and the inner needle cap, which can be discarded. Never reuse a needle for an injection., Hold the pen with the needle pointing toward the ceiling and tap the pen to force any air bubbles to the top. Turn the dosage knob, usually located near the injection button, to ""2,"" then press the injection button until you see a drop of insulin appear on the tip of the needle.Air bubbles can cause you to inject the wrong amount of insulin., Again, locate the dosage knob on the end of the pen, near the plunger. This allows you to control the amount of insulin you inject. Set the dial to the dosage amount prescribed by the doctor.

, Insulin should be injected into the fatty tissue just below your skin, which is called subcutaneous fat.As such, the most common injection sites are areas that tend to have a good layer of subcutaneous fat, such as the abdomen, thigh, buttocks or underneath the upper arm. People who get insulin shots every day need to rotate their injection sites to prevent injury. You can rotate to different injection sites within the same body part (keep at least an inch between sites) or switch to different body parts.


If you inject insulin deeper into muscle tissue, it'll get absorbed too quickly and potentially lead to dangerously low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia).
Injecting too much into the same site can trigger lipodystrophy, which leads to either a breakdown or build-up of subcutaneous fat.
Keep your shots at least 1 inch away from scars and 2 inches away from your belly button. Never inject into an area that's bruised, swollen or tender., Wrap your fingers around the pen with your thumb on the injection button. Place the needle against your skin fold at either a 45 or 90-degree angle (ask your doctor which is best for the pen you are using) and press and hold the injection button for at least 10 seconds., Cap and unscrew the needle tip of the pen and dispose of it, but don't throw away the pen until it runs out of insulin — they typically last 28 days depending on the type of insulin. Do not leave the needle on the pen between shots.As with syringes, you should have a designated area for your discarded needles. Store them in a hard plastic or metal container (make sure it is labeled). When it is full, tape the container shut and dispose of it appropriately in health products disposal site. You may call your local trash or public health department in regards to sharps disposal programs in your area.

, Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose (sugar) levels are too high (hyperglycemia) due to a lack of insulin or a tissue insensitivity to it.In general terms, type 1 diabetes is more serious because your body (pancreas) doesn't make any insulin, whereas with the type 2 variety your body doesn't make or use insulin efficiently.

. Both forms can be fatal if not treated.

All type 1 diabetics need insulin shots on a daily basis, whereas a large proportion of type 2 diabetics can manage their condition with special diets, weight loss and exercise.
Type 2 diabetes is much more common and is linked to obesity, which causes tissues of the body to be less sensitive to the effects of insulin — essentially ignoring its impact.
Insulin can't be taken by mouth (orally) in order to lower blood glucose levels because stomach enzymes interfere with its action.

, People with type 2 diabetes tend to be overweight and develop their symptoms slowly, whereas type 1 diabetics experience symptoms quickly and they tend to be more severe.The most common symptoms of type 1 diabetes include: increased thirst, frequent urination, extreme hunger, unexplained weight loss, sweet smelling breath (due to ketone breakdown), severe fatigue, irritability, blurred vision, slow-healing sores and frequent infections.


Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, although it usually appears during childhood or adolescence. Diabetic kids are usually very thin, gaunt and tired looking.
Type 2 diabetes can develop at any age, although it's most common in people older than 40 who are obese.
Without insulin treatment, diabetes can progress and lead to nerve damage (neuropathy), heart disease, kidney damage, blindness, numbness in limbs and various skin conditions.

, Having diabetes and needing to inject insulin on a daily basis is sometimes like walking on a tightrope. Injecting too much insulin can lead to hypoglycemia due to having too much glucose removed from your bloodstream. On the other hand, not injecting enough promotes hyperglycemia as too much glucose is left within the blood stream. Your doctor can estimate the amounts, but it depends on your dietary choices. As such, diabetics must monitor their own blood sugar levels and determine for themselves when to inject.


Symptoms of hypoglycemia include: excessive sweating, shakiness, weakness, hunger, dizziness, headaches, blurred vision, heart palpitations, irritability, slurred speech, drowsiness, confusion, fainting and seizures.Skipping meals and exercising too much can also promote hypoglycemia.
Hypoglycemia can be treated at home in most cases by consuming quickly absorbed carbohydrates, such as fruit juice, ripe berries, white bread with honey and/or glucose tablets.

, Think about what keeps you doing the things you love, exactly what are the things that make your from performing it and what in case you do in order to assistance with that.

, You will also want to avoid diets which are extremely low in carbohydrates; these strenuous diets can deprive the body together with the nutrients it deserves.

, Stress and depression could cause a diabetic's blood glucose levels in diabetics. Also, you can use breathing exercises to rest, which provide wonderful benefits since you can do then anywhere.

, The danger from this is very real, and you will be considered a coma. Symptoms include extreme thirst and confusion. These symptoms are treated through insulin shots and increased hydration.


You can prevent Ketoacidosis by making sure that blood sugar levels are normal, keeping your blood sugar levels in order, taking insulin and knowing your treatment methods.

, Once you skip or delay meals as being a diabetic, you may trigger your diabetes to fall out of control. When this blood sugar is coupled with higher blood sugar levels which is typical of type two diabetes, there can be a dramatic spike of sugar.

, Never examine your insulin kit inside your bags, which are checked. They can be subjected to extreme temperatures, or exposed to dangerous temperatures.

, If some of these occur, you must immediately test yourself, and administer insulin promptly as needed.

Distinguish Type 1.,
Recognize the symptoms.,
Take the Glycated Hemoglobin (A1C) test.,
Get the Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) test.,
Do the Casual (Random) Plasma Glucose test.",How to Diagnose Diabetes1," Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile or insulin dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition most often diagnosed in children. However, it can be diagnosed during any point in a patient's life. When a patient has Type 1, the pancreas makes little to no insulin. In most cases, this is due to the body's immune system mistakenly attacking and destroying the insulin producing cell in the pancreas. Since the body is not producing enough insulin, the glucose in your blood cannot be converted to energy. This also means that the glucose will build up in your blood stream, causing problems.Contributing factors to Type 1 diabetes are genetics and the exposure to certain viruses. A virus is a common trigger in adult onset Type 1.
If you are diagnosed with Type 1, you will likely have to use insulin.;
, The symptoms of Type 1 include frequent urination, excessive thirst, extreme hunger, unusual and rapid weight loss, irritability, increased fatigue, and blurry vision. The symptoms are severe and typically come on within a few weeks or months. These symptoms can also be mistaken for the flu at first.An additional symptom in children may include sudden and uncharacteristic occurrences of bedwetting.
Women may also develop yeast infections., This test is used to determine Type 1 diabetes and prediabetes. A blood sample is taken and sent to a lab. The lab measures the amount of blood sugar attached to the hemoglobin in the blood. This reflects the patient's blood sugar levels over the past two or three months. This test results vary by the age of the person being tested. Children can have a higher percentage than adults.If there is 5.7% or less sugar attached to the hemoglobin, the levels are normal. If the percentage is 5.7% to 6.4%, the adult patient has prediabetes. If the patient is an adolescent or younger, the level range goes up to 7.4% for prediabetes.
If the percentage of sugar is higher than 6.5%, the adult patient has diabetes. For adolescent or younger patients, a percentage of sugar higher than 7.5% means the patient has diabetes.Conditions such as anemia and sickle cell anemia have been known to interfere with this test. If you have these issues, your doctor may use a different test., This test is the most commonly used test because it is accurate and costs less than other tests. During the test, the patient goes without food or liquid other than water for at least 8 hours. The doctors or nurses draw blood and send it to get tested for glucose levels.


If the levels are calculated below 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl), the levels are normal and the patient doesn't have diabetes. If the levels are determined to be between 100 and 125 mg/dl, then the patient has prediabetes.
If the levels measure above 126b mg/dl, the patient likely has diabetes. If anything other than a normal amount is measure, the test will be repeated to make sure that the results are sound.
This test can also be used to detect Type 2.This test is typically given first thing in the morning because the patient has to go without food for so long.

, This test is the least precise of the tests but is effective. The blood is drawn from the patient at any point, regardless of how much or recent the patient has eaten. If the levels come back above 200 mg/dl, then the patient may have diabetes.


This can also detect Type 2 diabetes."
"
Understand Type 2.,
Identify the symptoms.,
Take the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT).,
Take the Glycated Hemoglobin (A1C) test.",How to Diagnose Diabetes2," Type 2 diabetes, once called adult-onset or noninsulin-dependent diabetes, occurs most often in adults over 40. Type 2 diabetes develops when the body resists the effects of insulin or when the body stops producing enough insulin to maintain the glucose levels in the blood. With Type 2 diabetes, the liver, fat, and muscle cells stop using insulin in the proper way. This causes the body to need to make more insulin in order to break down the glucose. Although the pancreas does this at first, over time the pancreas loses its ability to produce enough insulin for meals. This causes the build up of glucose in the blood.


Over 90 percent of people diagnosed with diabetes have Type 2.
Prediabetes is the early stages of Type 2 diabetes. Prediabetes can often be reversed with treatments through diet, exercise, and sometimes medication.
The primary risk factor for Type 2 is being overweight. This is true for children as well, as the number of childhood or adolescent diagnoses of Type 2 diabetes increase.
Other risk factors include sedentary lifestyles, family history, race, and age, especially ages 45 and older.
Women who had gestational diabetes and those with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) are more prone develop Type 2., Type 2 symptoms do not show up as early as Type 1. It often isn't diagnosed until they do. The symptoms of Type 2 include those associated with Type 1. These symptoms are excessive thirst, frequent urination, increased fatigue, extreme hunger, unusual and rapid weight loss, and blurry vision. The symptoms unique to Type 2 are dry mouth, headaches, cuts or sores that are slow to heal, itchy skin, yeast infections, unexplained weight gain, and numbness or tingling in the hands and feet.


1 out of 4 people that have Type 2 diabetes do not know they have it., This test is given over a two hour period at the doctor's office. The patient's blood is drawn before the test. Next, the patient drinks a special sweet drink and waits two hours. Blood is then drawn over the course of the two hours and the levels are calculated.


If the levels are less than 140 mg/dl, then the levels are normal. If they are between 140 and 199 mg/dl, the patient has prediabetes.
If the levels are 200 mg/dl or above, the patient likely has diabetes. If anything other than a normal amount is measure, the test will be redone to make sure that the results are true., This test is also used to determine Type 2 diabetes and prediabetes. Blood is taken from a patient and sent away for testing. The lab measures the blood sugar percentage attached to the patient's hemoglobin in the blood. This illustrates the patient's blood sugar levels over the past few months.


If there is 5.7% or less sugar attached to the hemoglobin, the levels are normal. If the percentage is 5.7% to 6.4%, the patient has prediabetes.
If the percentage of sugar is higher than 6.5%, the patient has diabetes. Since this test calculates the blood sugar levels over a long period of time, this test is not redone.Certain blood conditions such as anemia and sickle cell anemia have been known to interfere with this test. If you have these or other blood issues, your doctor may have to use an alternate test."
"
Understand gestational diabetes.,
Notice the symptoms.,
Get the Initial Glucose Challenge test.,
Take the Glucose Tolerance Test.",How to Diagnose Diabetes3," Gestational diabetes is only diagnosed in pregnant women. During pregnancy, a woman's body increases the production of certain hormones and nutrients that can cause resistance to insulin. This causes the pancreas to increase its insulin production. Most of the time, the pancreas is able to deal with making more insulin and the mother will have slightly elevated blood sugar levels, but it will remain manageable. If the body starts building up too much insulin, then the mother will be diagnosed with gestational diabetes.


If you are pregnant, you should get tested between week 24 and 28 to see if you have it. There are no symptoms, which makes it hard to diagnose otherwise. If it goes undiagnosed, it can cause problems with the pregnancy.
This type of diabetes goes away after the baby is born. It can redevelop at Type 2 later in life., Gestational diabetes does not have any obvious signs or symptoms, but the mother is at risk if she lived with diabetes before the pregnancy. If you feel like you may be at risk, you can get screened before you get pregnant to see if you might have any early indicators such as prediabetes. The only way to know for sure, however, is to be screen during your pregnancy., This test requires the patient to drink a syrupy glucose solution. Then the patient has to wait for an hour. Once the hour is up, the blood is tested for blood sugar levels. If the levels are below 130-140 mg/dl, then the patient's levels are normal. If it is higher than this, you are at risk for gestational diabetes but don't necessarily have it. You will need a follow-up test called the glucose tolerance test., This test requires you to fast overnight. First thing the next morning, blood sugar levels are tested through a blood test. Then the patient drinks another syrupy glucose solution. This drink has a higher level of glucose. The blood sugar levels are checked once an hour for three hours. If your last two readings are higher than 130-140 mg/dl, then the patient is diagnosed with gestational diabetes."

Reassure them that they don’t have to go out of their way. Shoot for bonus points by offering to bring a dish or buy some diabetic-friendly ingredients for them to cook.;
, If you take insulin, remember that heat causes it to absorb more quickly into the injection site. This could cause your blood sugar to drop suddenly. Keep active, but take regular breaks from sun exposure. Stay hydrated. Make sure you test your glucose levels more often than usual., Designate a small bag or purse. You’ll need enough room to fit all the supplies you require throughout the day. Because high temperatures can damage your supplies, ask the host if you can leave your bag in the house. Your bag should include your:

Glucose meter, testing strips, and lancets
Insulin or pills
Syringes or insulin pump supplies
Cold pack to keep preserve your insulinEmergency glucose tablets

, The scheduled start time of the meal might force you to eat lunch or dinner later than usual. This can trigger a drop in blood sugar and a delay in your scheduled insulin dose. Pack a snack with carbohydrates to keep your glucose levels stable.You could bring:

A small apple and an individual snack cup of peanut butter
A protein bar
Crackers and cheese

, Give yourself a minute or two to look over the choices on the table or grill. Make a note of which options to take smaller portions of, which ones you can take larger portions of, and which ones to avoid completely. After that, start to fill your plate!, Fill half of your plate with non-starchy veggies. Dedicate one quarter to lean protein. Choose starchy food for the final quarter. If you have room, add a handful of healthy snacks on the side. Make sure your food pile doesn’t grow more than 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) tall.Some examples from each group are:

Vegetables: grilled eggplant, bell peppers, or summer squash; lettuce, tomato, and cucumber salad with vinaigrette dressing, broccoli, cauliflower, or Brussels sprouts.
Lean protein: black bean (or other veggie) patty, tofu kebobs, grilled lean white or red meat (includes fish and poultry) without sauce.
Starchy foods: plain mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes/yams, bean salad, whole grain burger bun.
Healthy snacks: a handful of baked tortilla chips, a handful of pita chips, 1/4 cups (59.15 g) of unsalted nuts.
Healthy dips: 2 tbsp (29.6 g) hummus, black bean dip, light ranch dip., These foods are usually high in sugar and high fructose corn syrup, which can raise your blood glucose to dangerous levels. Processed foods are also high in sodium, which increases your risk of hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS).Consider these examples banned from your plate:

Processed meats like hot dogs, deli meats, and high-fat beef burgers
Processed salty snacks like pretzels, potato chips, or fried tortilla chips
Traditional potato salad, macaroni salad, or coleslaw (made with heavy mayonnaise)
Heavy dips like traditional ranch, artichoke, or French onion
Traditional condiments like ketchup, mustard, and barbecue sauce
Baked goods like cookies, cake, or pie

, Avoid the temptation to indulge in sweet baked goods. Go for fresh fruits or fruit-based desserts. Keep your portion sizes small.Some good choices are:

One small apple, orange, or pear
1/2 banana
1/2 cup (118.29 g) barbecued fruit1/2 cup (118.29 g) fruit salad
1 cup (236.59 g) berries or chopped melon, Choose hydrating beverages like water or unsweetened iced tea. Add a slice of lemon or orange for some natural sweetness and added Vitamin C.Stay away from drinks with high fructose corn syrup.
Alcohol interacts with diabetes medication, which can cause unpredictable rises and falls of blood sugar. This can potentially lead to a medical emergency.

, High temperatures put everyone at risk for dehydration. For diabetics, the risk is even greater when your blood sugar level rises. Before, during, and after the meal, take regular sips of cool caffeine-free beverages like water, lemonade, and unsweetened ice tea. Limit or avoid alcoholic beverages., If you suffer from neuropathy, you might not feel sunburn occurring on your hands and feet. Apply sunscreen to your hands regularly, especially after you wash your hands. Put it on your feet if you’re wearing sandals or flip-flops.Never go barefoot! Stubbing your toe could cause a foot ulcer. Diabetes also causes wounds to heal slowly, putting you at risk for infection if you step on a sharp object., Many factors at barbecues can make your blood sugar fluctuate. Heat and exercise can both cause your numbers to drop. This is why you need to test often. Keep your monitor and testing strips safe from the heat but within easy reach if you need to test in a pinch.The stress of an outing or get together can also cause your blood sugar to increase. The stress causes the body to release adrenaline which causes the liver to release more glucose and cortisol into the bloodstream.

, Regular exercise is good for everyone, including those with diabetes. As long as you can recognize signs of fluctuating blood sugar, there’s no reason you shouldn’t enjoy that game of volleyball or time in the pool. Again, take caution that high outdoor temperatures and the kind of activity you’re engaging in can cause your numbers to drop.Take precautions such as eating a snack before exercising and testing your blood sugar before and after exercise.

, Barbecues are just as much about socializing as eating. Once you’ve filled your plate, sit far away from the food. This way, you won’t be tempted to overeat or neglect your loved ones. Just be alert that too much inactivity can cause your blood sugar to rise, especially if you’re used to regular activity.To reduce your risk of fluctuations, ask your companions if they’d like to take an after-meal walk with you.

, A medical alert bracelet or necklace has the power to speak for you when you can’t speak for yourself.If something causes your blood sugar to change drastically and you pass out or have a seizure, your bracelet will reveal that you have diabetes to medical professionals and others around you. This will help them know how to treat you.

Tell those around you that you are diabetic if they do not know. Don’t be shy about this; everyone has something medically that they are dealing with and a little bit of knowledge can save a life.

Understand the effects of a chronic illness.,
Avoid lecturing your diabetic loved ones.,
Ask your loved ones what they need.,
Go to doctor’s appointments with loved ones.,
Have diabetic friendly snacks on hand.,
Adopt a more diabetic friendly lifestyle.",How to Emotionally Support Diabetic Loved Ones1," It is difficult for anyone to receive unwanted news that they have been diagnosed with a long-term illness. Whether this is something that was prepared for, or sudden news coming as a shock, the effects and impact on the person diagnosed with the illness will be similarly negative.

Become mindful of the emotional states your loved one may be going through during this time, and express as much love and compassion as possible. For instance, your loved one may be feeling helpless and hopeless, experience a loss of self-worthiness, or feel fearful and/or frustrated. Depending on the constraints and type of diabetes diagnosis, there may be restrictions on what he or she can and cannot do that may increase their irritability and agitation. They may also go through a process of grieving.
Realize that all of these internal emotions that are flooding your loved one will increase their stress level, making them more prone to lashing out at you or other family and friends. It can put additional strain on relationships, which is why it is increasingly important that you provide as much tolerance and understanding as possible in times like these. They will need as much support from you as possible for strength and encouragement. Use the assistance of additional therapy or counseling if needed.;
, Having a diabetic loved one can cause a lot of worry and stress on your part. You may end up nagging your loved one to check their blood pressure or to avoid certain foods due to their health. Avoid lecturing your diabetic loved ones, as this will often lead to conflict and issues. Instead, focus on being supportive and responsive to their needs.Tell other people in your loved one’s life to avoid nagging or lecturing them. Though the lectures may be well intentioned, this can end up feeling condescending to your loved one. It can also lead to more stress for your loved one, as they are already dealing with the anxiety of having diabetes.

, Rather than lecture your diabetic loved ones, ask them what they need from you. Focus on responding to their needs as they deal with diabetes. Listen to what your diabetic loved ones tell you about the support they need, in their own words.For example, you may ask your diabetic loved one, “What can I do for you?” or “How can I support you and your diabetes?”

, Your diabetic loved ones will likely have a lot of doctor’s appointments scheduled for the maintenance of their condition. Offer to go with them to these appointments as moral support. Hold their hand if they need it during the appointments and be there in the waiting room when they are done. Simply showing up and being there during stressful times, like going to doctor’s appointments, can be a big help.For example, you may say to your diabetic loved one, “Would you like me to go with you to your doctor’s appointment?” or “I’m free the day of your appointment, want company?”
Your loved one’s medical professional will be able to assist you both with referrals and other forms of assistance (financially, emotionally, physically). For instance, there may be disability benefit options available to your loved one through the state. For federal employees and veterans, they may be eligible for VA compensation if assisted with connecting to their local VA community. Or there may be other alternative treatment options for symptom management, such as complementary measures to regular western medical approaches.

, To provide a supportive environment for your diabetic loved one, make sure you have food items on hand that are suitable for those with diabetes. This could be chips, popcorn, or cookies that are low in calories and carbohydrates. Keep these snacks in your home or in your bag so that if your diabetic loved one starts to get low blood sugar, they can have these snacks.You can also ask your diabetic loved ones which snacks they prefer and keep these stocked in your home. This way, they feel supported whenever they are at your house.

, To be a good support to diabetic loved ones, try to adopt a lifestyle that is more diabetes friendly. This could mean shifting your diet so you have more diabetic friendly meals, especially when your loved one is over for dinner. You can also lead a healthy lifestyle that includes regular exercise to encourage your loved ones to also stay healthy and fit.


Part of adopting a more diabetic friendly lifestyle is also being a good role model and ally for loved ones with this issue. Try not judge or critique your diabetic loved ones. Instead, show support and care for them.

You can also ask the loved one with diabetes to tell you about any symptoms or signs you need to watch out for.

, Keep an eye on your diabetic loved one's behavior. If you start to notice any troubling signs or symptoms, take action. Sometimes it can be hard for someone with diabetes to notice warning signs or troubling symptoms, especially if they are feeling dizzy, distracted, or tired.


For example, perhaps you notice the symptoms of low blood sugar in your loved one. You may then suggest that they test their blood sugar or have a healthy snack. Or perhaps you see the symptoms of hypoglycemia starting to develop in your loved one. You can then suggest that they have a quick, healthy meal to recover.

, Make sure you are aware of your loved one's regimen for treating their diabetes, so you can support them with this when needed. Your loved one may be taking medication, such as insulin shots, and be on a routine where they check their blood sugar regularly. If your loved one is young, such as a child, it is important that you know what medications they are taking so you can give it to them, if needed.


This is also important if your loved one is elderly and has diabetes. Make sure you know what medications they should be taking in the event they become too ill or weak to take them on their own.

Speak to a counselor or therapist.,
Join a support group.,
Practice self-care.,
Lean on other family and friends.",How to Emotionally Support Diabetic Loved Ones3," If you are struggling to be a good emotional support for loved ones with diabetes, do not be afraid to reach out to a counselor or therapist. The onset of any medical health issue and illness, whether it is yours or a family member’s affects every person within that family unit in some way. It can contribute to many unsettling emotional states, such as depression or sadness, anxiety, anger, or grief. Speaking to a therapist can not only help you feel emotionally prepared for supporting a diabetic loved one, but also help you find ways to cope with your own emotional states as well to keep you living as optimally as possible.

Look for support groups who focus on those dealing with the care and support of diabetic loved ones. Ask your doctor for a referral to a support group in your area. Search for support groups online., Coping with and taking care of a loved one with a chronic illness can drastically impact your life and your overall well-being. You may notice your emotional state becoming a little imbalanced. Perhaps your stress level has increased, or you’re feeling frustrated or overly exhausted. Maybe you feel isolated with these experiences, which is leading to guilt or depression. Or there could be added financial strains with medical bills and the cost of medications that may not have been covered by insurance.

All of these internal emotional and situational experiences can add up. You may be so focused on supporting your loved one that you forget to take care of yourself.
Practice your mindfulness, and live each day within the moment. Incorporate meditation and deep breathing exercises into your life to help keep you grounded. Deal with things as they come, because that is all you can ever do is live within one moment at a time.
Practice the art of self-forgiveness and forgiveness to the other person you may be providing that emotional support to.
Take breaks and time away from your loved one as needed so you can have time to decompress. Go for walks, take a short vacation. Become involved with a hobby of interest and get out there to meet new people in a different setting.

, It can be tough to shoulder the emotional support of diabetic loved ones on your own. Lean on other family and friends in your life to help you support the diabetic loved one. Ask for their help if you need it. Agree to divide up the emotional care and support for the diabetic loved one among friends or family. This way, you are not responsible for the emotional support for the loved on on your own.For example, you may say to family and friends, “Would you mind helping me as I support our diabetic loved one?” or “Would you be able to also offer support to our diabetic loved one?”

Remember the most healthful protein sources.",How to Eat out With Diabetes1," Vegetables with very healthy glycemic indexes include asparagus, spinach, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, leafy greens, onions, peppers, and beans.;
, Whole grains are better than refined grains; that means you should opt for whole wheat bread instead of white or Italian bread, brown rice instead of white, veggie or whole wheat pasta instead of plain pasta, oatmeal instead of sweetened breakfast cereal, and so on.

, Lean protein cuts are best for everyone, but it is also important to eat lean protein prepared in safe ways for diabetics.


Avoid meats and fish dishes smothered in sauce (like barbecue sauce or marinade), stuffed between bread or buns, deep fried or coated in batter or breading, topped with excess cheese or berry compotes, or glazed with sugar mixtures.

Fresh fruit
Canned fruit in its own juice
Frozen fruit
Dried fruit
Fruit juice;
, Foods with a low glycemic index (GI) are processed slower by the body and won't spike your blood sugar. Some fruits with a low GI include:


Pomegranates
Grapes
Apples
Blueberries
Strawberries
Plums, Fruits or dishes with high glycemic indexes release sugars into your blood stream quicker, and may spike your blood sugar levels. Thus, fruits with a high glycemic index should only be consumed in moderation by people with diabetes. Stay away from:


Fruit desserts with added sugar. For example, strawberries with whipped cream.
Smoothies with added sugar.
Cooked fruits, which have more concentrated sugar levels due to water loss.
Fresh items with a high glycemic index like dates, pineapple, watermelon, mangoes, and papaya., Since fiber slows down the rate that your body can absorb and process sugar, high fiber fruits are best for diabetics. Much like fruit with a high glycemic index, low fiber ones may aggravate your diabetes.


Avoid fruits that have been peeled.
Don't drink juice without pulp.
Stay away from heavily processed fruit juice with low fiber content.
Focus on high fiber fruits like apples, bananas, and oranges., While some fruits are great for people on a diabetes diet, you should only consume them in moderate portions. By moderating what you eat, you’ll help ensure that you maintain a stable blood sugar level. When determining portions, remember that:


People with diabetes should consume 2 to 4 servings of fruit a day, depending on their age, gender, and weight.
One serving of fruit has about 15 grams (0.5 oz) of carbohydrates. Examples of a serving of fruit (15 carbohydrates) include: ½ of a medium banana, ½ cup of cubed mango, 1 ¼ cup of watermelon, 1/1/4 cup of strawberries, and ¾ cup of cubed pineapple.
You should only consume fruit as a snack or dessert, rather than as a meal. For instance, eat a ½ cup of fruit salad as a snack between breakfast and lunch., Fruit should be just one part of an overall diabetes diet. Thus, you should think about creating a comprehensive diet that will help manage your diabetes. Your diet should include:


Proper portions of fruit.
Fresh vegetables.
Lean meats like chicken, fish, and some cuts of pork or beef.
Foods high in fiber., If you’ve consumed many carbohydrates or sugars (including fruits) over the last few hours, you should moderate your consumption of them.


You should consume roughly 45 to 60 grams (2 to 2 oz) of carbohydrates per meal.
Eat 3 or 4 snacks per day in addition to meals.
If you’ve eaten more carbohydrates than you should have at a given point, reduce consumption for a little bit.
Talk to your doctor about how many carbohydrates you should eat per day., Your doctor is the person best equipped to evaluate your individual health needs. Thus, talk to your doctor and let them know you have concerns about your ability to eat fruit when on a diabetes diet. Your doctor:


May advise you to focus on foods and fruits with a low glycemic index. Foods with a low index have glucose that is released slowly into the bloodstream – avoiding blood sugar spikes.
Might prescribe medicines to help regulate your blood sugar levels, like insulin or Glucophage., Your doctor will recommend blood tests to evaluate your overall health and the status of your diabetes. From these tests, they’ll be able to determine how foods, such as fruit, impact your health.


Blood tests will help your doctor determine how fruit will fit into your diet.
Tests might include short-term and long-term blood sugar levels.
Your doctor might recommend daily, at-home, blood sugar tests. If so, you'll be asked to test and record your blood sugar levels once or twice a day.

, A Dietitian or nutritionist who specializes in metabolic disorders may be one of the greatest resources for you when determining how fruits fit into your diet.


Food specialists will be able to consider your individual health circumstances, diabetes, and food intake and formulate a diet proper for you.
Your dietary specialist will be able to create a diabetes meal plan for you. This plan may be based on several methods, including the plate method (amount of food), carb counting (the number of carbs consumed per day), or based on the glycemic index of foods (how much sugar a food contains and how the body processes that sugar).
Make sure you consult a dietitian or nutritionist who focuses on metabolic disorders or diabetes in particular."

Recognize your risk for diabetes.,
Be aware of what doesn’t cause diabetes.,
Determine possible symptoms.,
Keep track of possible symptoms.,
Ask your significant other if he has noticed symptoms.,
See your doctor.,
Get a definitive diagnosis.,
Learn about prediabetes.,
Receive treatment for diabetes.,
Manage diabetes through lifestyle.",How to Detect Diabetes Symptoms," Although doctors are not sure why some people develop diabetes, there are many different factors that can cause or contribute to diabetes.Being aware of your potential risk for diabetes helps you recognize the signs and can ensure you get a timely diagnosis and treatment.The following factors may increase your risk of type 1, type 2, or gestational diabetes:Family history
Environmental factors, such as exposure to viral illness
Presence of autoantibodies in the system, usually after a viral syndrome when the person is young
Dietary factors, such as low vitamin D consumption or exposure to cow’s milk or cereals before the age of 4 months
Geography, countries such as Finland and Sweden have higher rates of type 1 diabetes
Weight, the more fat cells you have, the more resistant to insulin they become
Sedentary lifestyle or inactivity, exercises helps control weight and insulin
Race, certain groups such as Hispanics and African Americans are more prone to diabetes
Age, your risk increases as you get older
Polycystic ovary syndrome
High blood pressure
Abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels
Metabolic syndrome
Gestational diabetes and giving birth to a baby over 9 pounds can also increase your risk for type 2 diabetes;
, Diabetes is a condition related to blood sugar, so some people might think it’s related to eating sugar. Eating sugar doesn’t cause diabetes — but if you are overweight then you can develop peripheral resistance to sugar; therefore, you have to cut down on the amount of refined sugars that you consume., Many symptoms of diabetes may not seem serious and aren’t necessarily specific to the disease, so it’s important to watch your bodily functions to detect potential signs.Identifying possible symptoms of diabetes can help you get a timely diagnosis and treatment.Symptoms of diabetes cancer include:Increased thirst
Increased hunger, especially after eating
Dry mouth
Frequent urination (sometimes more often at night)
Unexplained weight loss
Weakness or feeling tired
Blurred vision
Numbness or tingling in the hands and feet
Cuts and sores that heal slowly
Itchy and dry skin, generally in the vaginal or groin region
Frequent yeast infections
Frequent infections of the skin and gums

, If you notice any of the signs of diabetes and are concerned they are related to the disease, pay close attention to your body. Note the symptoms you have and how frequently they occur in a notebook or on a piece of paper. These notes may come in handy if you have to see a doctor.Watch every bodily function that may be related to diabetes including how you feel after you eat, if you’re thirsty more often, if you urinate more often, and even how quickly you heal from cuts or sores.
Write down the specific symptoms, how often they occur, and what makes them better or worse.Make note of any feelings you experience that aren’t necessarily related to diabetes.

, In some cases, your partner or spouse may have noticed symptoms of diabetes that you overlooked. Talk to your spouse about any symptoms you’ve noticed and see if he has made similar observations or any others that might indicate diabetes.


Tell your spouse what the different symptoms of diabetes are so that he can tell you if he’s seen any changes in you or your bodily functions.

, If you detect any of the signs or symptoms of diabetes, schedule an appointment to see you doctor as soon as possible. Getting a timely diagnosis and treatment from your doctor can help you avoid serious and life-threatening complications.Tell your doctor any symptoms you’ve experienced and for how long. Consider using the notes you made as a reference during your exam.Make sure your doctor is aware of any risk factors you have, including a family history of diabetes.Ask your doctor any questions you may have about diabetes or its treatment.Considering writing down questions before your appointment so that you don’t forget to ask during the appointment.

, If your doctor suspects that you have diabetes, she will order additional testing. There are different types of tests to diagnose types 1 and 2 diabetes as well as gestational diabetes.The following tests are used to diagnose diabetes:


A1c blood test, which is also known as a glycated hemoglobin test.This test shows your average blood sugar level for the past two to three months by showing how much blood sugar is attached to your hemoglobin.A level of 6.5 is considered diabetic.Random blood sugar test, which examines your blood sugar at an unspecified time. A level of 200 milligrams per deciliter indicates diabetes.Fasting blood sugar test, which is conducted after an overnight fast.If your blood sugar level is 126 milligrams per deciliter, it’s considered diabetic.Oral glucose tolerance test, which requires overnight fasting and then drinking a sugary liquid the next morning. After this, your blood sugar levels will be tested over the next two hours. A reading of more than 200 milligrams per deciliter, it’s considered diabetes.Initial glucose challenge test and follow-up glucose testing analyze the blood of pregnant women who have fasted and then consumed a sugary liquid. This usually occurs at 24–28 weeks of gestation. If your blood sugar level readings are high for two of three readings, you’ll be diagnosed with gestational diabetes., In some cases, your doctor may notice that your tests have elevated blood sugar levels that don’t qualify for a diabetes diagnosis.This can indicate prediabetes, which means you could develop diabetes; however, prediabetes is also a potentially reversible condition.Test result levels for prediabetes are:5.7–6.4% on the A1c test
100–125 milligram per deciliter for the fasting blood sugar test
140–199 milligram per deciliter for the oral glucose tolerance test

, Depending on the severity of your diabetes, your doctor will likely prescribe different treatments to manage the condition.From insulin injections to healthy eating, following your doctor’s treatment plan is important to manage diabetes and minimize your risk of complications. Medical treatments for diabetes you may receive are:Regular monitoring of your blood sugar at home and by your doctor
Insulin therapy — Including daily injections or an insulin pump
Oral medication — Such as metformin to stimulate your pancreas to produce more insulin (if you have type 2 diabetes)
Physical activity — 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week
Healthy diet — Limiting calories to 1,800–2,000 a day and incorporating more fruits, vegetables, and lean meats and fish
Controlling blood pressure and cholesterol
Surgery such as a pancreas transplant for serious cases
Bariatric surgery, which is a good option for those with a high BMI and comorbid conditions such as hypertension, sleep apnea, elevated cholesterol, fatty liver disease, and others. The weight loss that follows bariatric surgery may cause type 2 diabetes to go into remission.Islet cell transplantation is an experimental treatment for type 1 diabetes in which healthy cells from a donor pancreas are transferred to the patient, In addition to any medical treatments for diabetes, your doctor will likely suggest helping to manage the disease by changing your lifestyle habits. These can also be a way to treat prediabetes and may prevent it from developing into type 2 diabetes.Some lifestyle changes your doctor may suggest to help manage diabetes and prediabetes are:



Eating a balanced and healthy dietGetting at least 150 minutes of exercise per weekLosing weightLosing just 7% of your body weight can significantly reduce your risk of diabetes.Caring for your feet by checking them for injuries daily, keeping them clean, dry, and soft, and wearing breathable shoes and socksCaring for your oral healthLimiting or avoiding tobacco and alcoholReducing stress"
"
Be aware of the psychological challenges that can follow a diabetes diagnosis.,
Recognize signs that you may be struggling emotionally.,
Open up to your doctor, or even to a trusted family member or friend.,
Include your family in your treatment plans.,
Strategize when eating out.One of the more complex tasks for people eating out is how to juggle blood sugar measurements, insulin injections (if they use insulin), and timing the insulin injections around when the food arrives, to say nothing of choosing healthier options off the menu and limiting alcohol consumption.,
Be proud of yourself.",How to Cope With Type 2 Diabetes1," Because type 2 diabetes is such a complex condition requiring constant monitoring of one's diet and lifestyle, it has been shown in studies to lead to heightened risk of anxiety and depression.Note that there is a cyclical relationship between psychological and physical health. In other words, failing to deal with psychological issues such as anxiety and/or depression can in turn make it much more challenging to maintain your physical health. This also goes in the opposite direction — failing to take care of yourself mentally can make it difficult to deal with your physical health as well.;
, If you notice yourself falling into any of the following patterns, consider checking in with your doctor and sharing with her what is really going on for you:Losing motivation to follow your regular medication routine and/or routine blood sugar checks.
Lacking desire to follow through with physical exertion or with your recommended diet — this can be a sign that the burden of living with the condition is taking a toll on you.
Withdrawing from social events. Sometimes people with diabetes begin to avoid social events, which can result either from depression or from the stigma of having to turn down certain food or drink options that are not conducive to someone living with diabetes.
Losing your overall sense of joy in life.
Constantly worrying about future complications of the condition, and the impact it may have on your lifespan and long-term health.

, Sometimes milder cases of anxiety or depression that can result from conditions such as type 2 diabetes can be eased by the simple act of sharing with someone how you are really feeling. As human beings, we are hard-wired for connection, and having someone who is sharing in your emotions and experiences, and who can help to motivate you when you are feeling down about your condition, can dramatically improve your frame of mind about it.

, Many people have reported that they find it boosts their spirits to include their families (be it their spouse, their children, or even a friend) in their treatment plan.For instance, some people do routine blood sugar measurements with their spouse as a part of their daily routine.
Others plan their exercise routine around something that involves taking the children with them, like hiking.
Some people find it extremely helpful when their whole family unites to create a healthier diet plan that is not only conducive to living with diabetes, but also beneficial to the health of everyone in the family.
A team approach can not only hold you accountable to maintaining your positive lifestyle changes, but it can also offer moral support from those who love and care for you most.

, Needless to say, there can be a lot on one's mind! Some strategies you may find helpful are:


Going to the washroom to privately measure your blood sugar, if you are uncomfortable doing this in a social setting.
Asking the waiter for an appetizer of bread so that you have a backup of something to eat after taking your insulin if there is a delay in the food arriving.
Choosing to go out with friends who are already interested in healthy eating, so that you do not feel like the ""odd one out.""

, Living with type 2 diabetes can be challenging, so be sure to reward yourself with positive self-talk, and to surround yourself with friends and family that support you and the positive effort you are making towards your own health. If you are interested, you could also consider joining a Diabetes Support Group, where you can meet others who are facing the same challenges and feel less alone.

"
"
Cut back on unhealthy foods.,
Eat ""healthy snacks"" as a substitute.Many people, as they aim to make diet modifications to improve their type 2 diabetes, find themselves craving snacks.,
Understand why diet changes can help you to improve your blood sugars.In normal physiology, when you eat sweets or other foods with a high glycemic index (such as refined carbohydrates), your pancreas (an organ in your body) secretes insulin (a hormone) that helps to distribute the sugar into the cells of your body.",How to Cope With Type 2 Diabetes2," Type 2 diabetes is primarily the result of lack of exercise and poor diet. In particular, eating refined carbohydrates (things such as white bread and white pasta) and sweets, as well as exceeding the calories your body requires all contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes, as well as the worsening of the condition with time.If you can substitute these with other alternatives you will be doing your body a great service! For instance, switching to whole grains and carbohydrates with a lower glycemic index (such as brown rice, quinoa, or whole-grain bread) is much better for you.
If you can limit your sweets to less than they were before (whether this means cutting down to one a day, or one a week — it depends what is manageable for you), you will decrease the sugar load on your body and, in turn, improve the long-term course of your diabetes.
Remember that fruits and vegetables are also carbohydrates, so make sure you are taking this into account when you are counting your carbohydrate intake.

, To satisfy the urge to eat, try eating something healthier rather than reaching for the treats in your cupboard. For instance, some great foods to snack on include:


Vegetables. Try making a salad, or simply cutting up some veggies with dip.
Yogurt, or nuts (such as almonds), are a great option as these contain protein and will give you a ""full"" feeling.
It is also better to eat frequent healthy snacks as this will prevent your cravings for too many carbohydrates and sweets.

, In this way, the sugar does not linger in your bloodstream, because high sugar in the blood over time causes damage to your body.


What happens in type 2 diabetes is that the insulin stops working properly. In a way, it is like you have ""taxed the system"" too much, oftentimes by eating too many sugars and refined carbohydrates, or simply by eating too many calories (more than your body needs).
You then become unable to process sugar in the same way you used to, before developing the disease. This causes elevated blood sugar levels, which, over time, leads to the long-term complications of the disease, such as heart disease, kidney disease, eye-related diabetic conditions (blindness), peripheral neuropathy to name a few.

"
"
Begin an exercise routine.One of the primary culprits that causes type 2 diabetes is a sedentary lifestyle, which, sadly, is becoming more and more prevalent in North American culture.,
Make sure your exercise routine is something you can stay consistent with.,
Understand the physiological benefits of exercise for type 2 diabetes.Exercise not only burns sugars and excess calories and helps you to lose weight, it also improves the ability of your cells to process sugars even when you are not exercising!",How to Cope With Type 2 Diabetes3," To combat diabetes, and potentially even reverse the disease, get on a pair of runners and go out for a walk or jog, head to the gym with some friends, or find some form of physical activity that you are motivated to add to your weekly routine.


A balance of aerobic exercise (things that elevate your heart rate over a prolonged period of time — at least 20–30 minutes), with weight and resistance training is ideal.Each of these forms of exercise benefits your body in different ways, so to blend the two is your best bet.
Try to exercise for at least 30 minutes five times per week (you can break these up into 10-minute segments if that's easier). It is important to have a consistent routine in order to reap the full-body benefits of exercise, not the least of which can be a dramatic improvement in your blood sugar levels.
There are specific recommendations for eating before and active exercise if you are diabetic, so ensure that you speak to your physician/diabetic educator before you start your plan to be properly fueled and avoid low blood sugar levels.

, It is better to begin slowly and to be able to continue your exercise regime, than to be too ambitious at the start and end up burning yourself out with the effort. Remember that type 2 diabetes is a lifelong condition, so it is best to start slow and choose a form of exercise you enjoy, or that you can do with others to add to your encouragement and motivation, to increase the chances that you ""stick with it.""


If you can find a friend to workout with, it can help to hold you accountable. It is often much easier for people to keep commitments they have made with others, than to rely solely on self-discipline for an effective exercise regime.
If you don't have a friend who is interested in joining you, consider joining a community or recreation centre class where you will be part of a group energy. Many people find this more encouraging and uplifting than working out on their own.

, In other words, the benefits of exercise are multiple, and happen by improving the physiology of your individual cells as well as offering whole-body benefits.


By losing weight through diet and exercise, you can put off depending solely on insulin injections to help process the sugar in blood. Often times, newly diagnosed diabetes can be managed through lifestyle modifications and maybe medication. Later on, insulin may need to be added.

"
"
Get good sleep.,
Try to diminish your stress.,
Know that you may even be able to reverse the condition!,
Stick to your medication routine as prescribed.Most people with type 2 diabetes are prescribed medications in pill form, as well as (in severe cases) injectable insulin.",How to Cope With Type 2 Diabetes4," Prioritizing a good night's sleep will give you more energy and make it easier to stick to your exercise routine. It will also improve your mood and decrease your stress, which can help to put you in a good frame of mind to make the positive lifestyle choices that will help your diabetes diagnosis.

, Stress is one of the top causes of over-eating, or of eating sweets (eating is known to be a form of ""emotional coping""). Therefore, if you can find ways to reduce the stress in your life you may help yourself to keep up the positive lifestyle habits that can make a big difference in coping with type 2 diabetes.


One option is to try yoga or meditation, both of which are gaining popularity as stress reduction techniques.
You can also make more time for relaxation, such as taking a hot bath in the evenings or taking time to read a book that helps you to rest and recharge.
If you are struggling to manage your stress, it may be worthwhile to see a counsellor or a life coach. They can help you to manage the demands of daily life and the added stress of living with diabetes.

, Just because you have received the diagnosis does not mean you are doomed to live with it for life. If you are pre-diabetic or in the early stages of diabetes, you can actually improve your blood sugar levels and possibly bring them back into the normal range; however, it takes dedication to positive lifestyle measures in order to reverse or improve your blood sugar values.This is an opportunity to show yourself just how much you value your health and wellbeing, by making healthy lifestyle choices a priority.


Stress, anxiety, depression, diet, and negative coping behaviors can all cause increases in blood sugars. Just as anything in life, a balance is needed to acquire control of diabetes. Change is a process, so every day promise yourself to be better than the last, and if one day is bad, forgive yourself and try again the next day.

, Even as you implement positive lifestyle changes, it is key to follow your medication routine as prescribed by your doctor. This will help to ward off any long-term consequences of the disease, such as damage to your eyes, your kidneys, your heart, digestive system, and/or your nerves.


Once you have blood tests that show an overall improvement in your blood sugar levels, you can then speak to your doctor about the possibility of cutting back on medication.Do not attempt to do so without the professional opinion of your physician.

Talk to a Registered Dietitian who is a CDE.,
Eat a well-balanced diet.,
Choose leaner cuts of protein.,
Fill up on non-starchy vegetables.,
Include a source of healthy fats everyday.,
Drink an adequate amount of fluids daily.,
Make 1/4 of your plate a starchy food.,
Enjoy small servings of fruit.,
Choose 100% whole grain foods.,
Strictly limit processed foods and foods with added sugars.,

Monitor your blood sugar regularly.,
Incorporate physical activity.,
Keep in touch with your physician.",How to Eat with Diabetes," Whenever you've been diagnosed with diabetes, it will be smart to meet with a Registered Dietitian who is also a CDE or Certified Diabetes Educator.


The dietitian will be able to teach you about diabetes, how food affects your condition and how to appropriately take your medication.
They will also teach you about what foods are beneficial and what foods are more harmful to your body with diabetes. In addition, they may also give you sample shopping lists or meal plans to use.
If you're having trouble figuring out what to eat exactly, talk to your dietitian for further support and education.;
, A balanced diet is always important to general health and wellness, but even more so when you have diabetes. Following a well-balanced diet can help keep your blood sugar in check.


A balanced diet is one that contains foods from every food group and a wide variety of foods from every food group.Always measure portions sizes as well. Part of a balanced diet is eating foods in the right proportions and in the appropriate serving sizes.
Appropriate proportions and serving sizes of foods are the top factors that will influence your diabetes. If you eat too much of a certain food or eat certain foods too frequently, you may notice you have trouble managing your blood sugars.

, Eating adequate protein is an important part to a balanced and nutritious diet. In addition, protein is naturally carbohydrate-free and can be eaten without worrying about your medications or insulin.


Include at least a serving or two of lean protein at each meal and snack. Protein helps keep you satisfied throughout the day.Like all foods, make sure to measure your portion sizes. Aim for a 3-4 oz portion of protein or a piece the size of a deck of cards.Choose lean protein sources like: poultry, eggs, seafood, legumes, tofu, low-fat dairy, lean beef or pork.
If you have diabetes, you're at a higher risk of high blood pressure, stroke and heart disease.Eating fatty cuts of meat regularly or in large portions can also increase your risk of heart disease. Stick to leaner cuts of protein to avoid this.

, Another food group that is very low in carbohydrates and sometimes completely free of carbohydrates are non-starchy vegetables.


Aim for at least 3-5 servings of these foods everyday.Not only are they naturally low carb or carb-free, they are also low in calories, but high in fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.
Many health professionals recommend including a serving or two at each meal or making half of your meal a non-starchy vegetable.
Measure out 1 cup or 2 cups of leafy greens per serving.Try vegetables like: salad, tomatoes, cucumbers, eggplant, peppers, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, broccoli, green beans, onions or mushrooms.

, Although there are certain types of fat you should limit, heart healthy fats like omega-3 fats can actually be beneficial for those who have diabetes.Studies have shown that including 1-2 servings of healthy fats each day helped decrease LDL (bad cholesterol) and decrease triglycerides in patients who had diabetes.Include some of these heart healthy fats on a daily basis: olive oil, canola oil, olives, nuts, nut butters, seeds, avocados, salmon, mackerel, tuna and sardines.

, Drinking adequate amounts of fluids and staying hydrated is essential for every healthy body, but also important for those who have diabetes.


Staying hydrated can help regulate blood sugar in your body.Drink adequate fluids daily to help prevent dehydration.
Health professionals recommend drinking 8-13 glasses of water and other hydrating fluids daily (the same goes for those with diabetes).Stick with caffeine-free and sugar-free beverages only. Try: water, flavored water, sparkling water, decaf coffee and tea.

, Starches (from foods like grains, starchy vegetables or legumes) do contain a high amount of carbohydrates. However, many sources are very nutritious and should be included in your diet to help maintain blood sugar throughout the day.Starches coming from foods like corn, potatoes, carrots, beans, lentils or whole grains are still nutritious foods. They offer fiber, vitamins and minerals that are essential to your overall health.You do not need to avoid to cut out these foods if you have diabetes. However, since they are high in carbohydrates, you need to monitor how much you're eating and follow appropriate portion sizes.
Making about a quarter of your plate one of these starchy, higher carb foods is a great way to still enjoy these foods, without over doing it. You can also measure out 1/2 cup of any of these foods for the appropriate portion size., Although fruit does contain carbohydrates (a sugar known as fructose) it can still be a nutritious and tasty addition to your diet.


Fruit is typically thought of an ""OK"" food to eat with diabetes in appropriate portion sizes because it offers minimal calories, high amounts of fiber and lots of vitamins and antioxidants.Although fruits are nutritious, you still need to count them as a carbohydrate and account for them in your daily total.
Fruits with the lowest amount of carbohydrates or sugars are berries like blueberries, blackberries, raspberries or strawberries. You can have 1 cup per serving.Dried fruit should be limited to 2 tablespoons since this is a more concentrated source of sugar.If you're choosing frozen or canned fruit in it's own juice or 100% fruit juice, stick to 1/2 cup per serving., Grains like bread, rice or pasta aren't something you need to avoid or skip if you have diabetes. However, you should choose 100% whole grains when you do eat these foods.


100% whole grains are minimally processed and contain higher amounts of fiber, protein and other essential nutrients.Measure your portion sizes of these foods to 1/2 cup or 1 oz per serving.Refined grains like white bread, white rice, plain pasta and other foods made with white flour or added sugars are lower in fiber and other nutrients. They're considered empty calories and can spike your blood sugar more than whole grains.

, One group of foods that you should limit and eat infrequently are those that are highly processed and contain a lot of added sugars.


Added sugars are those that are added to certain foods during their processing. They make foods higher in calories and carbohydrates.
In addition, these foods provide no nutrition and can spike your blood sugar.
If you choose to have a sweet treat, stick to a small serving. For example, 1 3"" cookie, 1 tablespoon of honey or maple syrup or 1 small donut.Limit foods like: ice cream, candy, cookies, cakes and pies, breakfast pastries and muffins.

, The glycemic index is a way to measure different foods and their levels of carbohydrate. Using this can help you choose foods that have carbohydrates more wisely.


The glycemic index is a tool that can be used for diabetes. It shows how certain foods affect your blood sugar and insulin levels.Low glycemic foods do not affect your blood sugar all that much, whereas high glycemic foods can increase your blood sugar greatly.Examples of low glycemic index foods are: oatmeal, most fruits, starchy vegetables and 100% whole wheat bread.
Examples of high glycemic foods are: white bread, white rice, popcorn, rice cakes and candy.
The glycemic index isn't fool proof. Always use your best judgement when choosing foods to include in your diet.

, With diabetes, its essential to monitor your blood sugar regularly. This will help you manage your diabetes and help you decide what foods to eat.


Testing your blood sugar regularly and tracking your numbers is important. Always have this information ready to give your physician or other healthcare professionals so they can help manage your condition.
Also, testing your blood sugar will help clue you in on how your diet or certain foods affect your blood sugar.

, Physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle for everyone. However, if you have diabetes it can help manage your blood sugar.


Regular exercise, especially aerobic exercise, helps to: lower blood sugar, improves insulin sensitivity, improves circulation and decreases your risk of heart disease.Aim to include about 150 minutes of aerobic exercise each week plus 1-2 days of strength training.Note that some exercises that are high in intensity or long in duration can cause a low blood sugar. Always track your blood sugar numbers and have a high carbohydrate snack or drink handy to help remedy a low blood sugar., With any chronic condition, it's important to keep in touch with your physician on a regular basis.


Your physician or endocrinologist will be your link to managing your diabetes. He or she will be the one prescribing medication, educating you on diet and giving you any additional advice or suggestions.
Always keep your physician informed of any new or worsening side effects or symptoms of your diabetes or diabetes medication.
Keep them updated on your diet, exercise and blood sugar numbers so they can treat your diabetes effectively.

Steam vegetables.",How to Cook for a Diabetic," No matter what you do, it’s important to keep your doctor in the loop about your diet. He or she can give you additional suggestions on how to keep your blood glucose stable throughout the day. This can prevent you feeling ill and help you avoid conditions such as diabetic ketosis or hypoglycemia.


Consider meeting with a registered dietician in addition to your doctor for additional suggestions on what foods to buy and how to prepare them.;
, Consuming three balanced, nutrient rich meals every day can help maintain your blood glucose at a steady level. Do this by making healthy choices from the five food groups.

Get about 1,800-3,000 nutrient-dense calories a day. The amount you intake corresponds to your age, sex, and activity level. Men usually require more calories than women, and younger adults typically require more calories than older adults. The more active you are, the higher your calorie intake should be., Despite what many people think, diabetics can enjoy fresh fruits. They contain vital nutrients and can help maintain your blood sugar during the day. Fruits can also satisfy a sweet tooth you can’t indulge because of diabetes.Get at least 1 ½ to 2 cups of fruit every day. Vary your choices to get a broad range of nutrients to keep you healthy and your glucose stable. For example, you can have blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, apples, melons, and even kiwi.Stick to whole, fresh or frozen fruits. Canned and dried fruits may be high in sugar and not be as filling as their fresh counterparts. If you have no other choice, get canned fruit in light syrup. Read product labels on fruit juice, which can also be very high in sugar.

, Vegetables are a diabetic’s best friend. They can fill you up, get you vital nutrients, and help keep your blood sugar from fluctuating. You should aim to cover at least half of your plate with vegetables at every meal.Get a total of at least 2 to 2 ½ cups of vegetables every day. Just like with fruit, it’s important to vary your choices every day to get a wide range of important nutrients to your health.Try carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, sweet potatoes and spinach.

, Stabilizing your blood sugar is an important part of being diabetic, and whole grains can contribute to maintaining a steady level. Choosing healthy whole grains like brown rice, quinoa, and barley can help you stay healthy and keep your glucose in check. Limit refined carbohydrates like white pasta and white rice, both of which can have a lot of sugar that may cause glucose fluctuations.Try to eat at least 3-5 servings of whole grains every day.Just like with the other food groups, vary your choices. Go for whole wheat bread and pasta or more unusual choices such as amaranth, buckwheat, bulgur, quinoa, and spelt., Proteins, including meats, don’t have carbohydrates so they won’t raise your glucose.However, fatty meats can contribute to heart disease and obesity, which can be problems for a diabetic.Choose the best proteins for diabetics such as nuts, seeds, fish and seafood, chicken or poultry, and eggs. Make sure to get beans several times every week, too.Buy select cuts of meat instead of prime cuts. Limit how much red meat and processed much such as deli meat and hot dogs you eat, too., You can eat dairy products as a diabetic, though you should watch what type you have. Diabetics are at a higher risk of cardiovascular disease.Getting low fat choices can keep your glucose in check and minimize your risk for cardiovascular problems.Eat lowfat cheeses and low- or nonfat yogurt. Drink skim milk and use evaporated skim milk when making cream sauces. Have fat free half and half in your coffee. Cook with or use only small amounts of trans fat free margarine.

, Foods containing magnesium, chromium, zinc, and Vitamin B3 can help stabilize your blood glucose. Incorporate some of the following foods to get these nutrients:


Green vegetables
Whole grains
Bananas
Brewer’s yeast
Seafood
Dairy, In general, diabetics can eat most of the same foods as another person with a healthy diet. However, there are some foods diabetics should avoid to prevent fluctuations in glucose levels. Limit or stay away from the following foods:Sugary foods like soda, sweets, or desserts
Fruit juice
White rice
White bread
Full fat dairy
Fatty meats
Processed foods, snacks, and baked goods
Fried foods
Alcohol

, Having a healthy breakfast is an important start to anyone’s day, especially a diabetic. It can help energize your morning and through the day, but also help keep your glucose stable. Even if you only have a few minutes, you can have enjoy a healthy breakfast to keep you going and feeling well.Have a toasted English muffin with ham or turkey and some vegetable juice.
Spread a whole wheat wrap with low- or non-fat Greek yogurt and top it with some fresh fruit.
Scramble some egg whites and put them on top of a bagel with a slice of turkey. You could also scramble eggs with some onions, peppers, and low fat cheese for a heartier breakfast.
Remember that your breakfast doesn’t have to be big. You can start small, such as with a piece of whole wheat toast and some margarine, and slowly build to see how much you like to eat in the mornings.

, Many people have dips in energy during the afternoon and reach for candy or other foods forbidden to diabetics. To keep yourself from feeling sluggish and maintain your blood sugar, have a light lunch packed with protein.Make yourself a sandwich with whole wheat bread or bagel thins, 2 ounces of reduced-sodium lean turkey, hummus, spinach, and bell pepper. Add carrot sticks, broccoli florets, or other cut veggies on the side with some light ranch dressing.
Mix cooked quinoa, white beans, chopped bell pepper, carrots and broccoli for a grain salad. Throw in some sliced almonds if you like and toss the salad with olive oil, lemon juice, and a dash of salt and pepper.
Throw together a salad using vegetables of your choice and toss with a light dressing or homemade vinaigrette of olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and mustard.
Serve yourself light tuna salad over greens. Have an apple and peanut butter on the side.
Build a parfait out of fresh fruit and nonfat Greek yogurt if you want something sweet.

, You’ve had sensible and healthy meals all day and are feeling great. Contribute to that feeling by preparing a dinner that will keep your glucose stable and that you and your family can enjoy.Try tacos with soft or hard corn shells. Add a protein like fish or chicken, shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, and some black beans. Add a bit of low fat cheese and a spoonful each of salsa, sour cream, and guacamole.
Make your favorite fish by getting fresh fish at the grocery or defrosting frozen filets the night before. Brush the fish lightly with olive oil and season it with a dash of salt and pepper. Serve with steamed vegetables and brown rice.
Add frozen vegetables and some cooked chicken to pasta. Toss with a bit of light salad dressing or low sugar marinara sauce for a pasta primavera.

, You may find that you get hungry or have low blood sugar between meals. If this is the case, eat two healthy snacks during the day to prevent fluctuations in glucose and flagging energy.Some sensible snacks are:


15 almonds
5 celery sticks and a tablespoon of peanut butter
5 baby carrots and a tablespoon of hummus
1 hard boiled egg
1 frozen sugar-free popsicle
1 cup of light popcorn
1 piece of low fat string cheese
1/4 avocado

, Because stabilizing your blood glucose is so important to diabetics, planning out your weekly meals is important. Not only can this help maintain your blood sugar and your weight, but it can promote overall wellbeing by ensuring you’re getting sufficient nutrients.


Start off every day with a healthy breakfast. Make a healthy and satisfying breakfast as an egg white omelet with low fat cheese and vegetables. Add a side of whole grain toast with avocado and a cup of whole fruit.Make sure to plan for restaurant outings if you have any scheduled. Call ahead to the restaurant or view their menu online to see what healthy choices are available for diabetics.

, If you are cooking meat at any of your meals, cut away any visible fat before cooking. You can trim additional by taking measures such as removing the skin and roasting in a dripping pan.Getting rid of excess fat can keep you—and your heart—healthy.


Remove any skin from chicken and turkey before you cook it. Cooking either with the skin will increase the overall fat content.Roast your food on a rack and let the fat drip off to further decrease the overall fat content.Chill soups overnight and skim any fat from the top before reheating it.

, Different types of fats and even sugars are popular ways to season foods. But for a diabetic, these can be dangerous and throw off blood glucose levels. Using alternative seasoning like lemon and salt-free herbs and spices can give your food lots of flavor while minimizing the risk of glucose fluctuations.Squeeze fresh lemon or lime juice on foods such as salads, steamed vegetables, broiled fish, pasta, and salad.
Cut up or mince garlic and onions to add flavor to meats and other dishes.
Sprinkle fresh or salt-free dried herbs and spices to liven up any dish.
Marinate and grill meats with barbeque sauce or your own salt-free spice rub.
Make your own salad dressings with olive oil and vinegar.

, It’s okay to use some fat when you’re cooking. But using too much or the wrong type can add a lot of fat and calories to your meal and send your glucose into a tailspin. Use a cooking spray or an oil in a spray bottle to cut down on calories and fat in your dish.Choose oils high in unsaturated fats and only use enough to lightly cover the cooking pan. Some good choices of oils to use for cooking are: olive, peanut, corn, vegetable, safflower, sunflower, or flaxseed.

, How you cook each food can also have a big impact on how much fat and calories you’re getting. Avoiding fatty frying by grilling, baking, broiling, baking, and stir frying can keep your meals healthy and delicious while helping to stabilize your glucose levels steady.Avoid frying and deep frying your meals, which often requires using butter, lard, or other fatty foods.

, Many people think they’re eating healthy when they consume deep-fried vegetables. This can be a diabetic’s worst nightmare. Try steaming fresh vegetables with a non-salt herb or spice as an enjoyable side dish to any meal.Steam vegetables in the microwave by adding ¼ cup water or low sodium broth. You can also steam vegetables in your pan by putting them in a steamer basket with a bit of water or broth.
Consider getting a separate vegetable steaming machine if you like to eat a lot of steamed vegetables.

Follow an anti-inflammatory diet.To prevent and treat type 2 diabetes (T2D), dietary approaches emphasize whole foods, complex carbohydrates and high-density nutrients including proteins and healthy fats.,
Keep your food as close to its original or natural form as possible.,
Make at least half of your carbohydrates complex carbs, as opposed to simple carbs.Complex carbohydrates are made up of individual sugar molecules that are strung together in long, complicated and often branched chains.,
Read food labels closely.,
Increase the fiber in your diet.This can be done by increasing your fruit and vegetable intake, as well as by adding specific high-fiber foods to your meals.,
Limit red meats and increase the amount of fish and skinless poultry you eat.,
Increase the amount of water you drink.,
Limit sugar intake.,
Use herbs that help your condition.,
Understand the different forms of diabetes.Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder, usually appearing when a person is quite young.,
Understand what insulin is and does.,
Understand insulin resistance.All diabetics can also be thought of as having insulin resistance.,
Look for the symptoms of type 2 diabetes.,
Get diagnosed by a physician.,
Decide if additional medical treatment is right for you.",How to Control Diabetes with Diet," These guidelines are essentially part of an anti-inflammatory diet, which is gaining more and more acceptance with physicians.


Chronic inflammation has been linked with diabetes and other diseases — including heart disease, Alzheimer's, depression, and arthritis.;
, This means that you should try to limit any processed or prepared foods and cook from scratch using fresh ingredients as much as possible.When you cook your own food, you can better control the ingredients and avoid excess sugar and other ingredients that might affect your diabetes.


If you are pressed for time, try using a crock pot or preparing the basics (like rice, beans and even meats and vegetables) ahead of time and freezing them.

, Complex carbohydrates are found in whole, unprocessed foods such as whole grains, peas, lentils, beans, and vegetables.


Carbohydrates are converted into sugar, or glucose, when you eat them, so it is important you are very aware of your intake of carbohydrates.Simple carbohydrates are often found in processed foods and include added sugars like glucose, sucrose (table sugar) and fructose (most often added as high fructose corn syrup).
Recently, the ingestion of high-fructose corn syrup (by consuming soft drinks and other beverages with HFCS added) has, like the over-ingestion of sugar, been associated with increased risk of T2D, cardiovascular disease and obesity. Obesity can lead to insulin resistance and diabetes.
The reason that processed foods should be avoided is that they include both simple carbohydrates along with added sugars. Sugar by itself does not cause diabetes, but ingesting more sugar-filled beverages, for example, is linked to an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes.

, Reading labels can be useful to determine the amount of sugars in a food, but manufacturers are not required to list added sugars. You can avoid any added sugars by sticking to the unprocessed foods.


A good rule of thumb is no “white” foods: no white bread, white pasta, white rice.

, For example, you can include a tablespoon of ground flaxseeds at every meal. Either get a coffee grinder to grind your own flaxseeds or keep pre-frozen ground seeds in your freezer (to keep the healthy oils that you also get in flaxseeds from getting rancid).

, Look for wild-caught fish, such as salmon, cod, haddock and tuna. These fish are good sources of omega-3 fatty acids that are essential for your health and are anti-inflammatory.


The skin of fish and poultry is avoided because it can be high in animal fat, as well as any added hormones and antibiotics. This promotes inflammation.

, According to the Institute of Medicine, women should consume about 2.7 liters (91 ounces, or 11 cups) of water each day, and men should consume about 3.7 liters (125 ounces daily, or 15 cups) of total water.This may seem like a lot, but that's because this measurement takes into account the water we get from foods and other beverages.Your hydration needs will vary depending on your gender, age, location, activity level, and many more factors.Beverage intake includes tea and coffee. Unsweetened, habitual coffee drinking may even decrease your risk of type 2 diabetes., A diagnosis of T2D does not mean you can’t eat ANY sugars. It means that you control the amount of sugars you eat and how you ingest them. For example, the sugars in fruit are combined with fiber and this means that the absorption of sugars from the fruit are slowed down.

, There are a large number of herbs that you can add to your diet to help control blood sugar levels. Add to taste whenever you want! These herbs may help you get over some of those sugar cravings as well. These herbs are all very safe with no side effects when taken in commonly used amounts as food:


Cinnamon
Fenugreek
Okra (not quite an herb, but more of a side-dish)
Ginger
Garlic and onions
Basil

, Type 2 diabetes is an acquired disorder. There is also gestational diabetes and prediabetes.


In Type 1 diabetes (T1D), specific cells in the pancreas, the beta cells, are destroyed. Because beta cells make insulin, in T1D, the body is no longer able to make insulin and no longer able to control blood sugar levels. People with T1D have to take insulin their whole lives.
Type 2 diabetes used to be considered an adult condition that is unfortunately appearing more and more often in children. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) or diabetes mellitus is the most common form of diabetes — genetics, diet and environmental factors play an important role in the development of Type 2 diabetes. In T2D blood sugar levels can be controlled by diet, medication, supplemental insulin, or a combination of all these.
A third form of diabetes is called gestational diabetes. It occurs in the second half of pregnancy and occurs in less than 10% of pregnant women.Some physicians include a condition called prediabetes as an early form of diabetes. Individuals with prediabetes have higher than normal levels of blood glucose, but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetics. Individuals with pre-diabetes (also known as insulin resistance) have a very high risk of developing T2D.

, Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, is the main chemical messenger that tells the cells that it is time to take up glucose. Secondly, insulin is involved in messaging the liver to take up glucose and transform it into the storage form of glucose known as glycogen. Third, insulin is involved in a wide range of other functions like protein and fat metabolism., The reason they have high blood glucose (blood sugar) is that the cells in their body do not take up glucose and the reason for this is that the cells in their body do not respond normally to insulin.


Every cell in our body uses glucose (sugar) for producing the energy needed for the cells to do their jobs. The glucose is derived from the foods we eat, primarily from carbohydrates. These are molecules composed of chains of various different sugars, including glucose. Complex carbohydrates have many chains and are often branched while simple carbohydrates have shorter, unbranched chains. Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, is the main chemical messenger that “tells” the cells that it is time to take up glucose.
If the cells become insulin resistant, they “ignore” or can’t respond to the signal from insulin. This can increase the levels of glucose in the blood. When this happens, the pancreas responds by producing even more insulin, in an attempt to “force” the glucose into the cells. The problem is that since the insulin has no effect on the insulin-resistant cells, the blood glucose levels can keep rising. The body’s response is to convert the high levels of glucose in the blood into fat, and that can set up a scenario of chronic inflammation and other disorders like full blown T2D, obesity, metabolic syndrome and heart disease.

, These can come on at any point in your life. The most common symptoms of T2D are:Increased thirst along with more frequent urination
Increased appetite
Weight gain or unexpected weight loss
Blurry or changed vision
Fatigue
Increased number of infections from cuts or bladder/vaginal/gum infections

, Type 2 diabetes is diagnosed by a number of specific blood tests that measure how well your body handles sugars. Tell your doctor your symptoms and, if she sees a need, the doctor will test your blood.


These tests include taking blood samples to test for blood sugar levels at various times, such as after fasting, after meals, or after ingesting a pre-set amount of glucose.
If you have been diagnosed with diabetes, you should let your doctor know how you have changed your diet to improve blood sugar control.
Get regular checkups, including blood tests, as advised by your physician.
If you are trying to prevent diabetes, regular checkups are also advised.

, Most cases of diabetes can be controlled with a combination of medications, diet, and exercise. While you are in charge of the diet and exercise changes, sometimes you need additional help in the form of medication. Medications include hypoglycemics, which are medicines that lower blood sugars. These medications are generally safe, but do have some side effects. Talk to your physician about any medications you are on and ask especially about potential side effects. Common hypoglycemic medications include drugs in various classes:


Sulfonylureas are the oldest medications used in T2D and stimulate insulin secretion. Examples include Glibenclamide (Micronase®), Glimepiride (Amaryl®) and Glipizide (Glucotrol®).
Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors delay glucose absorption after a meal. An example is Acarbose (Precose®).
Glinides stimulate the secretion of insulin and include Repaglinide (NovoNorm®, Prandin®, GlucoNorm®).
Biguanides such as metformin makes the cells less insulin resistant and include metformin formulations such as Glucophage®, Glucophage XR®, Riomet®, Fortamet®, Glumetza®, Obimet®, Dianben®, Diabex® and Diaformin®.
Dipeptidyl Peptidase-IV Inhibitors prevent the breakdown of certain proteins that improve glucose tolerance. An example is Sitagliptin (Januvia®) and Linagliptin (Tradjenta®).

Try vodka-based cocktails.,
Go for a Bloody Mary.,
Try light beer.,
Go for red or white wine.,
Sip some sherry.,
Drink a wine spritzer.",How to Choose Diabetes‐Friendly Cocktails1," You may want to try vodka cocktails, like a vodka martini or vodka and sugar-free Fresca. These drinks generally don’t contain many carbs, so they won’t spike your blood sugar too much. Make sure to drink these in moderation, though.Make sure to be careful of the garnish of a martini. Olives, strawberries, oranges, and other garnishes may have been soaked in sugar, which can add unnecessary carbs and sugars. Make sure the rim isn’t lined with sugar either.;
, A Bloody Mary may be a good cocktail choice when you have diabetes. The tomato juice has less carbs than a juice used in other drinks, such as orange juice. If you use low-sodium tomato juice it’s even better.A Bloody Mary has approximately seven carbs.

, If you would like to enjoy a beer with your friends, you can have one. Just make sure that you go for light beer. Light beer has lower amounts of carbohydrates, usually three to six grams. Make sure to stick to a 12-ounce beer. Skip large sizes, such as a 32-ounce.Avoid craft beers. They have more carbs, alcohol, and calories than normal beer.

, Red or white wine can be heart healthy, so a glass each night is okay even if you have diabetes. However, make sure that you are drinking dry reds or whites. They both only have around four carbs for a glass.Don’t drink flavored wines or dessert wines. These have more sugar, which can cause your blood sugar to spike.

, Drinks you can sip instead of finish quickly may be a better option when you have diabetes. This allows you to drink them slowly so your body can process them, and it lessens the risk of you ordering multiple drinks. Sherry is a great choice for this. Order a sherry and sip on it for awhile.A two ounce glass of sherry has approximately eight grams of carbs.

, Another tasty diabetic-friendly alternative is a wine spritzer. This is a cocktail made with wine, club soda, and ice. The club soda adds a bit of carbonation to the wine, making it more bubbly. Ask for a twist of lemon or lime on the side.This is a cocktail you can easily make at home. You can also ask a restaurant or bar if they can make you one.

Avoid cocktails with juices and syrups.,
Mix liquor with seltzer water.,
Order a drink with club soda or diet tonic.,
Make sugar-free cocktails.,
Use fresh fruit.,
Choose sugar-free soda.",How to Choose Diabetes‐Friendly Cocktails2," Many cocktails contain sugary juices and syrups that can negatively affect your blood sugar levels. These drinks generally contain higher levels of sugar and lower levels of alcohol. Skip these drinks for drinks that don’t contain heavy sugared mixers., Liquor inherently doesn’t have a lot of sugar or carbs. This means you can have a one-ounce drink without messing your blood sugar up too much. Try placing the liquor with plain water or some seltzer water.Seltzer water can give your drink a bit of a bubbly taste without added calories.

, Another option for a calorie-free, low-carb mixed drink is one made with club soda or diet tonic water. Most bars and restaurants will have club soda, and many will have diet tonic water.You can also buy club soda or diet tonic water at the grocery store to make a cocktail at home.

, You can have mixed drinks like margaritas and mojitos in moderation. However, make sure to make them with sugar-free mixes. If you would like to make mojitos and martinis, you can use an alternative to sugar, like stevia., Fruity drinks don’t have to be completely cut out. When you make mixed drinks, like daiquiris, consider using all fresh fruit for the mixture instead of a syrup or bottled mix. This can help cut added sugar and give you the same fruity flavor., If you like mixed drinks with soda, drink the same thing with a sugar-free or diet version. A cocktail made with sugar-free or diet soda has no carbs, unlike one made with regular soda. Regular soda may contain over 20 grams of carbs.When making them at home, you can add a diet Coke to your whiskey and Coke, or ask for diet when ordering one at a restaurant or bar.

Limit your intake.,
Choose the correct serving size.,
Eat meals if you plan on drinking.,
Wear your diabetes ID bracelet at all times.,
Monitor your blood sugar closely.,
Take other simple precautions.",How to Choose Diabetes‐Friendly Cocktails3," Most people who have diabetes can drink small amounts of alcohol. However, you want to make sure to drink in moderation. Too much alcohol can negatively affect your blood sugar.Due to the risks of drinking with diabetes, it is best to err on the side of caution regarding the number of drinks you consume. Women should stick one alcoholic drink per day. Men should only have two drinks in a day., When you have diabetes and decide to have a drink, make sure to limit the serving size. Many cocktails, beers, or wines you can get at a restaurant or bar are too large. Try thinking about the following serving sizes:12 ounces of beer
5 ounces of wine
1.5 ounces of liquor
1.5 ounce of liqueur

, You should never drink on an empty stomach. You should also not substitute your carbs or sugars from a meal as alcohol. Eating regular meals helps your body process the alcohol and alcohol sugars.You should also check your blood sugar to make sure your blood sugar is stable.

, It is important that you always wear a medical ID bracelet that indicates that you have diabetes. This is especially important if you take insulin or diabetes medications. This will help protect you if your blood sugar drops.Being buzzed and having low blood sugar looks similar. To avoid a diabetic emergency, make sure those around you are aware of your condition.

, Pay extra close attention to your blood sugar levels over the 24 hours after drinking alcohol. Also, watch for the signs of hypoglycemia while you are drinking, and keep in mind that the effects of alcohol may make it difficult for you to notice the symptoms.Be sure that the people who are with you know you have diabetes and understand that if you pass out it is a medical emergency, not a sign of intoxication., There are some other simple things that you can do to protect yourself while you are drinking. These include:Keeping a carbohydrate source with you at all times, such as glucose tablets.
Never drinking on an empty stomach.
Never replacing food with alcohol or counting alcohol as a carb.
Always drinking water with alcohol to stay hydrated.

Beans in particular contain high concentrations of fibers, potassium, magnesium, and, of course, plant proteins. This fulfills your protein needs without having to eat red meat with its harmful fats.


Green, leafy vegetables, such as spinach, lettuce, and kale, give you many vitamins with few calories; non-starchy vegetables are also healthy, such as asparagus, broccoli, cabbage, carrots, and tomatoes. All are good source of fibers and vitamin E.;
, Fish should be a mainstay in your diet now due to its high levels of omega-3 fatty acids. Salmon and tuna, in particular, are very rich in them and are very light, healthy choices, too. However, most fish are safe and good to eat. Mackerel, herring, lake trout, and sardines are good as well.Nuts also are a good source of omega acids, especially walnuts and flaxseeds. Adding them in your diet (try on your salad) is a great way to increase your omega acid intake. What's more, increasing your fish intake reduces your intake of red meat, lowering your fat and caloric consumption.

, Milk, yogurt, and cheese are all good choices if they're fat free – you can still get all their nutrition, calcium, magnesium, and vitamins without the harmful fats by choosing these varieties.


This isn't to say that all fats are bad. Your body needs some good fats in the form of natural, unsaturated fats like the ones found in olive, sunflower, and sesame oils.

, Substitute your carbohydrate intake of white flour, bread, pasta or rice with whole grains. They contain much higher amounts of magnesium, chromium and fiber. Even white potatoes can be switched out for sweet potatoes.


This also means that you'll need to stay away from fried food, as the battered coating is often mainly white flour. Instead, learn more recipes for grilled or baked food. You’ll be amazed to find the same foods more delicious and juicier, too.

, You can find sugar in many sources: fruits, sweetened drinks, ice creams, desserts, and sweet breads. Instead, use products with artificial sweeteners such as saccharin or sucralose as they provide you the sweet taste you want without glucose breaking up in your body and elevating your sugar levels.


Sweeteners like Splenda can easily be added to your food or drinks. What's more, plenty of products now advertise that they're ""sweetened with Splenda"" (or a similar sugar substitute). Read the labels while you're at the store to see what options you have.
You can eat some fruits like apples, pears, berries and peaches, once in a while. Avoid other fruits that contain high amounts of sugars such as watermelon and mangoes.

, It's important that you not only get the right amount of calories, but that you get the right kind of calories too. Every person is different – your doctor should recommend a diet that will be determined depending on your insulin dose, your overall health, and the progression of your diabetes.


General recommendations for dietary therapy are 36 calories/kg (79 calories/lb) for males and 34 calories/kg (75 calories/lb) for females. A normal diet should generally consist of about 50-60% carbohydrates, 15% protein, 30% fat, and a restriction of salt intake.
For patients with type 2 diabetes, the main goal is weight loss of about 5-10% of body weight. Calories should not necessarily be limited, but carbohydrate and fat intake should be reduced.

, Perform an exercise tolerance test to alert your physician to certain exercises you shouldn't incorporate into your routine. He'll see what intensity and duration of exercise is appropriate for you and construct a schedule that can help you lose weight and stay on track.


Exercising, in general, can improve the health of diabetes patients in such a way that the disease could actually improve if it hasn't sufficiently progressed. Performing regular exercises will also aid in reducing your weight, which will have a great effect on lowering your glucose levels, blood pressure and cholesterol levels. This is a great goal to achieve to slow the progression of the disease, keep your condition steady, and even improve your general health.

, Aerobic exercising increases insulin sensitivity and controls body weight for obese patients. To get cardio into your day, try brisk walking, jumping rope, jogging or playing tennis. Ideally, cardio activity will be a part of your schedule 30 minutes a day about 5 times a week. If you’re an exercise beginner, start with a rate of 5 to 10 minutes and increase it gradually with patience. Anything is better than nothing!


One of the easiest exercises that doesn’t require any equipment or going to gym is walking. Though it doesn't seem like much, walking every day can improve your health, breathing, thinking, mood and lower your blood sugar, blood pressure, and anxiety levels. Biking and swimming are also two enjoyable, don't-seem-like-work exercises you could consider incorporating into your routine.
Cardiovascular evaluation is important in patients with a previous history of any cardiovascular disorders, the elderly, or patients with diabetes complications. Be sure only to start an exercise regimen under the supervision of your physician.

, Strength training is your next step after aerobics. This builds up your body – when your muscles get stronger they burn more calories, resulting in weight loss and blood sugar management. Recommendations say to perform strength training along with aerobics twice a week.


You don’t have to go to the gym – even lifting water bottles at home is a very good idea. What's more, home cleaning or hard garden work can enter in the strength training range, too.

, Most patients are encouraged to lose weight and to aim for an ideal Body Mass Index; this is especially true in obese patients, typically afflicted by type 2 diabetes. BMI is measured by the weight (mass) of the patient in kilograms divided by the height in meters squared.


The ideal BMI is 18.5-25; therefore, a BMI of less than 18.5 means that you are underweight; a BMI of above 25 means that you are obese., Make sure to make a schedule for yourself to adhere to that makes it as easy as possible. Everyone needs motivation to force themselves to stick with exercise. A partner, friend or family member supporting and encouraging you, reminding you of the benefits of your training program, may be just the motivation you need.


You also can always make a reward for yourself (not with a chocolate bar!) when you achieve your goal in losing a certain weight, for example. All these things will give you extra power to show yourself that you can hit your goal and improve your quality of life.

, There are three basic types of insulin: short-acting, intermediate-acting and long-acting. Though insulin is more prevalently used in cases of type 1 diabetes, it is used to fight both types. Your doctor will decide on what type of insulin is best for you. For the record, injection is the only route currently available for insulin administration.


Short-acting insulin is where the blood glucose level drops at a very fast rate. Available insulin preparations are “Actrapid” or Humulin R, which has a rapid acting effect with a fast onset of 20 minutes, lasting for about 8 hours. This can be given subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intravenously through an IV.
Intermediate-acting insulin is where the blood glucose level drops gradually. It is called “Monotard” or Humulin N, which has an intermediate acting effect; the onset of action is two hours and lasts to almost one day. It’s also called Neutral Protainne Hagedron (NPH) and is given only by subcutaneous injection.
Long-acting insulin is where the blood glucose level drops even more gradually. It is called “Insulin Ultra lente” or Insulin L; it has a very slow onset of action at about six hours and lasts up to 2 days. It is also given by subcutaneous route only.
An example dosage of insulin is Humulin R at 20 international units, three times a day.This is given with food to ensure that the required level of blood glucose is achieved.

In type 2 diabetes, adequate diet and proper exercising can be sufficient to control your condition. If not, oral hypoglycemics will be prescribed.



, Other formulas of insulin are insulin mixtures such as “Humulin Mixtard” or Initard 50/50 which is a mixture of the fast-acting and intermediate-acting types of insulin. This, quite clearly by design, has immediate and longer-lasting effects.


This, while seeming like the best of both worlds, is only advisable in certain situations. Your doctor will know which type of insulin (and how much) is best for you and your health.

, A multiple dose insulin injection device such as a “Novolin pen” or insulin pen can save you time and frustration. It can be adjusted to match your treatment therapy plan and it’s less painful than regular needles. It's easily carried, too, when you're on your way to work or going out.


Regardless of whether you're using pens or needles, human insulin is much preferred than animal derived sources as it’s less antigenic and won’t be triggered by the body as a strange substances, insulin normally increase the glucose uptake by the cells to be able to use it, stimulate glycogen storage, and decrease gluconeogenesis (glucose production).

, All insulin preparations should be kept in the refrigerator and not in the freezer; however, though drug companies have produced insulin pens to be stable at room temperatures, studies have shown that insulin pens should be kept in the refrigerator before the first usage.After your first dose with it, you should keep it outside the refrigerator and in room temperature to avoid insulin crystallization.
It has been also reported that refrigerated insulin that takes on the cool temperature of the fridge could be more painful when injected than the one kept at room temperature.

, All people with diabetes need to ensure that they monitor their blood sugar levels at home. This is important because it helps in the regulation of medicines given to control the amount of glucose in the blood. If you don't, you may get hypoglycemia, where there is reduced blood glucose in your blood, leading to many complications such as blurred vision and dehydration.


Take note of your levels half an hour before and after eating because after food is ingested, blood sugar levels are altered. This will also help in lowering the risks of micro and/or macro-vascular and neuropathy complications.
It is generally advised to take the samples from the side of your finger, not the tip, to reduce the pain as it’s less innervated than the finger tip. You should record your readings in a special personal notebook in order to be easily rechecked by your doctor as a medical calendar for you sugar levels.

, There are unfortunately some problems during insulin therapy that patients must be aware of. The most common issues are the following:


Hypoglycemia – especially if the patient didn’t have an adequate meal prior to his dose or due to an overdose of insulin.
Insulin allergies may happen if the insulin is from animal sources. Your doctor should then substitute it with human insulin, adding some topical steroids or antihistamines to reduce the allergic reaction, itching, swelling or pain.
Insulin resistance may occur, which is more likely to be accompanied by other diabetes complications. If this happens, you should seek medical help as you may need to increase your insulin dose or alter your therapy plan accordingly.
Weight gain and feelings of hunger, especially in patients with type 2 diabetes that were taking oral hypoglycemics and then started to take insulin in addition.
Insulin lipodystrophy, which is hypertrophy of the fatty tissues in the subcutaneous layer of the skin at insulin injection sites, is also a common issue.

, These drugs lower the blood sugar by inducing the pancreas to release more insulin that is needed to regulate the blood sugar. The blood sugar levels lower at such a rapid rate they need to be taken while you are eating to maintain insulin balance. This prevents you from having a very low blood sugar level that can lead to hypoglycemia.


An example of this hypoglycemic drug is tolbutamide, or Diamol, with a dosage being between 500 and 3000 mg daily. It is available in tablet form and can be used safely in those with renal diseases and in the elderly.
Another form is chlorpropamide, or Pamidine. The daily dose of this drug, in tablet form, is up to 500 mg. Pamidine can cause hyponatremia (low sodium concentration in the plasma), however.
Second generations of this drug are as glibenclamide (Daonil, one 5 mg tablet per day), gliclazide (Diamicron, one 80 mg tablet per day); safe with renal disorders), glipizide (Mindiab, one 5 mg tablet per day), and glimepiride (Amaryl, available in 1, 2, and 3 mg tablet form).

This drugs contain sulfa. If you're allergic, consider other oral hypoglycemics. It should also be used with caution in those with renal diseases and the elderly.



, This drug works by increasing the release of insulin from the pancreas. This variety acts within one hour after being taken. They are usually given around half an hour before meals to reduce the risk of the possibility of a hypoglycemic episode.


This drug is used to reduce the sugar in the blood as metabolism takes place. The dose is given as 500mg-1g once or twice a day depending on the level of glucose in the patient’s blood., These lower glucose absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and the glucose production by the liver, and they also work on enhancing insulin resistance and raising glucose anaerobic metabolism. They are often used with sulfonyl urea as additional therapy in obese patients. However, they have some side effects such as stomach upset and diarrhea and patients with hepatic or renal disorders may develop lactic acidosis.


Examples of biguanides are metformin (Glucophage, available in 500 and 850 mg tablets) with a daily dose up to 2000 mg, repaglinide (Novonorm, 0.5 or 1 mg taken before each meal), and pioglitazone (Glustin, 15 / 30 mg once daily).

, Pancreatic transplant can be done where the patient has severe complications from diabetes. This involves implanting a pancreas that is healthy – i.e. one that is able to produce insulin regularly. This is only advised when all other routes have been exhausted.


This can be taken from a patient who has just passed on or a partial pancreas that is from another person who is still alive.
Your doctor will know if this is a treatment that could be applicable to your situation. For most, insulin therapy and diet and exercise will be enough to manage the condition.

, For this test, you must fast from any food or drinks except water for about 6-8 hours beforehand to get accurate results. Fasting normal values are between 75-115 mg/dl; borderline results, like 115 or 120 mg/dl, should undergo further tests, such as the oral glucose tolerance test, or OGTT.


Post prandial (“PP”) blood sugar tests are usually given after two hours from starting to eat, or after two hours of a 75 mg glucose intake. Normal values are known as <140mg/dl; readings of PP with more than 200 mg/dl is a confirmed diagnosis of DM.

, This is usually performed in cases with borderline readings, in suspected individuals, or in case of gestational diabetes. With this test, the patient should consume a normal diet for at least three days, then a fasting venous sample is taken and the glucose level is identified. The patient is then asked to empty their bladder before taking the sample.


Then the adult patient eats 75 mg glucose orally; for pregnant women, a 100 mg tablet of glucose is given to them. After that, blood and urine samples are taken at time intervals like of half, one, two and three hours.
It’s said to be normal when having fasting results of <126 mg/dl, pp <140 mg/dl and having a peak for results not exceeding 200mg/dl.

However; some abnormalities are seen with OGTT, like impaired glucosuria, or a flat response. This is when the difference between the fasting and your peak is about 20 – 25 mg/dl. This can happen due to absorption abnormalities or over insulin production.



, The most important thing when it comes to diabetes is patient education. You need to fully understand how to use your medications, their mechanisms of actions, why you're taking this drug and why your doctor selected it for you, in addition to the hazards, interactions, and side effects.


This step, along with diet control and performing exercises, will lead to greater success in managing the disease and suppressing the progress of the complications process, leading to enhancing your lifestyle and keeping you healthy.

, During a visit to your doctor, report any signs of a complication or new symptom that you have experienced. Your doctor will physically examine you to evaluate your neurological state, examine your feet and legs for any sign of a diabetic foot, ulcers or infections, and do all periodic tests that should be performed, like blood, urine, lipid profile, renal and hepatic functional tests and serum creatinine levels.


Your doctor should talk to you about the risk of having a diabetic foot and how to control it with early antibiotics treatment. Taking care of yourself with personal hygiene to avoid the progression of gangrene is effective, too.

, Upon its onset, diabetes has a few, barely noticeable symptoms:



Frequent urination. This is where the patient passes a lot of urine during the day or night. This occurs because the blood glucose levels are high and increases the absorption of water into the blood stream. This in turn increases the urine that is passed.

Increased thirst. This is where the patient intakes a large amount of water – more than eight glasses per day – and this does not quench his/ her thirst. This occurs because the amount of urine passed is increased and this leaves the patient dehydrated, increasing thirst.

Increased hunger. This is where the patient consumes more food than their usual portions. This is because there is lack of insulin that is required for the glucose in blood to be transported to the cells where it is used to provide energy for the body. When there is no insulin, the cells in the body lack glucose and this leaves the patient feeling starved.

, As this disease progresses, it slowly takes on more serious symptoms:



Passing of ketones in urine. This is where there are inadequate carbohydrates and sugar in the body because there is increased sugar in the blood. The body breaks down the stored fatty acids and fats for provision of energy and this process leads to formation of ketones.Fatigue. This is where the patient becomes tired very easily. This is because of the lack of insulin that helps in transporting the glucose in the blood to the cells where it is used to provide energy to the body. This leaves the patient with reduced amounts of glucose in the cells therefore, resulting in less energy.

Delayed healing. This is in cases where the patient has a wound; it takes much longer than usual for healing to take place. This is because of increased sugar levels in the blood. Blood transports the nutrients needed for healing, and when glucose is in excess, nutrients are not appropriately carried to the site of healing thus causing delay.

, Certain people are at higher risk for diabetes due to circumstances that are often out of their control. The risk factors for diabetes include:



Obesity. Diabetes is common in people who are overweight because there is elevated cholesterol in the body. This is broken down into sugar where it is transported to the blood stream. The increased glucose level is so high such that despite some of it being taken up by the cells, there is still a large amount that is left in the blood stream, thus causing diabetes.

Genetics. The condition is common in people who have a genetic makeup where there is insulin resistance or the pancreas does not produce enough insulin.

Lack of exercise. Exercise is needed by the body for effective metabolism to take place. When one does not engage in exercises regularly, the glucose that is present in the blood is not appropriately taken up by the cells, resulting in diabetes.

, If treated, diabetes doesn't have to affect your life. However, if left untreated, the complications are many. When diabetes isn't addressed medically, the following may occur:Cell damage. Glucose alcohol accumulation within the cells causes osmotic damage leading to cell injury that affects nerves, kidneys, lens and blood vessels. Because of this, its avoid to avoid injury as much as possible.

Hypertension. Glycosylated collagen increases the thickness of the capillary basement, narrowing their lumens and affecting retina blood vessels. The net result is that blood vessels undergo sclerosis due to protein and glycogen glycation. This increases clotting and blood pressure.

Xanthomas. This is the technical term for yellow lipid nodules on the skin or in the eyelid due to hyperlipidemia.

Skin complications. Fungal and bacterial infections, recurrent furuncles, and neuropathic foot ulcers are all common. They ares usually painless because there is a poor blood supply, causing neuropathy (nerve damage) and therefore no sensation

Ocular complications. New, abnormal blood vessels may form in the iris. In time, cataracts may form in the lens as well.

Nervous system complications. This includes delayed nerve conduction, nephropathy, retinopathy and neuropathy as a result of destruction of the small blood vessels in all vital organs.

Macrovascular complications. This includes atherosclerosis, coronary heart diseases, stroke, peripheral ischemia especially in the lower limbs, and claudication (pain in the lower limbs).

Gangrene of the foot. This is also known as ""diabetic foot.""

Renal complications. This presents itself in the form of urinary tract infections, which often recur.

Gastrointestinal complications. This includes constipation, diarrhea, and gastroparesis with gastric dyspepsia.

Genitourinary complications. Impotence may happen due to poor blood flow in men; in women, vulvovaginal infections (infection of the mucous membrane of the vagina), and dyspareunia (painful sexual intercourse for females, mainly due to dryness of the vagina), are also common.

, Type 1 is mainly an autoimmune disorder resulting in a complete shortage in insulin secretion. Its onset is acute and the patients are normally thinner and younger; 3 out of 4 people with type 1 develop it before the age of 20.In type 2 diabetes, on the other hand, there’s a defection in insulin secretion as well as insulin resistance, which is a condition in which the body produces insulin but muscles, fat and liver cells don’t respond properly. More insulin is needed to make glucose tolerance normal (with no value to it), resulting in high sugar levels and high insulin levels at the same time. Patients are normally older, most are overweight or obese, and most cases are asymptomatic.

Prioritize your primary goals.,
Consult your doctor for recommendations.,
Read user reviews and check ratings.,
Get a monitor that’s as easy to use as you need it to be.",How to Buy a Glucose Meter1," Some models of glucometers offer basic readings but do not store records over time. Others include memory storage that maintains data about each reading, including the date and time for several months. There are models that require only a small sample of blood to successfully complete a reading, something that diabetics who must monitor blood sugar once daily or more will find helpful. Even a factor such as size may be important for choosing the right machine.


To narrow down what you need, make a list of the top 5 most important aspects that you’re looking for in a glucose meter. Number them from most to least important. Consider price, memory storage, type of strips needed, how much blood is needed, size, or any other element that is important to you. ;
, Often times choosing a glucose meter is based on personal preference, but some doctors may be able to make recommendations for you. Endocrinologists, who specialize in treating people with diabetes, probably have a lot of knowledge from other patients about what brands are the most accurate and easy to use. Ask your doctor if they prefer any specific meter over others., Investigate the ratings of any blood glucose monitor that seems like a good fit. As with most products, some meters are more reliable than others in terms of readings, integrity of data archived and other attributes. By taking the time to check into consumer ratings and comments, you can avoid investing in a glucose meter that fails to live up to the promises made by the manufacturer.


This is especially important for measures of accuracy. See what people have to say about how accurate their brand of machine is, versus what the company reports.It is also a good idea to consult with a buying guide, such as the one put out by Diabetes.org., Most models today are easy to use, requiring nothing more than placing a small blood sample on a test strip and inserting one end of the strip into a specific slot on the meter. A few are somewhat more complicated, requiring you to press keys to adjust the settings or reset them each time. Consider ease of use - if you want something simple and easy, go with models that require no more than 2-3 steps to obtain a reading.

Look for a meter with extra functions.,
Aim for data transfer ability, if applicable.,
Check your ketones, if applicable.,
Consider your language needs.,
Avoid using GDH-PQQ test strips if you take a medication containing sugar.",How to Buy a Glucose Meter2," Many glucometers will calculate and store your average blood sugar readings over 1 week, 2 weeks, and/or 1 month periods. Some let you “flag” results as being either pre- or post-meal, which can really help you and your physician monitor your diet and how much insulin you need at different times.Ask your doctor if functions like these are important for you to have in your glucose meter. They will be able to tell you how valuable this information might be.
If you have poor eyesight, get a machine with a large, bright screen, or one that gives results out loud.

, Maybe you have a hard time keeping track of your blood sugar over time. Maybe your partner, child, or parent accompanies you to your doctor and helps you maintain your diabetes. Some meters allow you to transfer all the information to someone else’s computer, usually with a USB cable. Consider whether this is an important tool for you., For some patients, being able to check for ketones in their blood is a necessary function of a glucose meter. Obtain a glucometer with this function if you have type I diabetes or are prone to ketoacidosis., If you, or a loved one you are caring for, speak a language other than English, take this into consideration. Some meters can speak or write in non-English languages, and finding one that’s appropriate can make care much easier., Some blood glucose meters use what is called GDH-PQQ test strips. It’s been found that these strips and meters may give an inaccurate reading if you are taking certain medications that contain sugars. Meters that still use GDH-PQQ test strips are Accu-Chek, TRUE2Go, TRUEtest, and TRUEresult. Avoid these models if you use any of the following:Peritoneal dialysis solution icodextrin
Certain immunoglobulins like Octagam 5%, Vaccinia Immune Globulin IV, HepaGamB, Gamimune N 5%, or WinRho SDF liquid.
Orencia (abatacept)
4% icodextrin adept adhesion reduction solution
The radioimmunotherapy medication Bexxar
Anything that contains or metabolizes into galactose, maltose, or xylose.

Check what test strips are readily available to you.,
Visit your local pharmacy to get your meter.,
Buy a glucose meter online.",How to Buy a Glucose Meter3," Different glucose meters use specific test strips, so before spending money on your meter decide how you’re going to purchase your test strips. This may be from a pharmacy, or you may buy them in bulk over the internet. Find out what test strips are available to you, so that you definitely get a compatible glucose meter without a monthly hassle of finding more strips., Almost every pharmacy like RiteAid, Walgreens or CVS will have glucose meters for sale. They are commonly-used products that should be readily available. You can ask the pharmacist or a sales associate to help you locate them in the store.


Stores like Target and Walmart that have health items should also carry them in stock.

, Shopping online is efficient and easy, as long as you obtain the right product. Buy from recognizable online stores like Amazon, and only buy new products – never used. You can also decide which type of glucose meter you want and purchase one from the company’s website directly.


Avoid buying from outside your own country, as specifications might be different than what you and your doctor are familiar with.

Get a prescription for a glucometer from your physician.,
Check with your insurance about coverage.,
Look for a glucose meter at a good price.,
Project the future cost of using the glucose meter.,
Save money on test strips.",How to Buy a Glucose Meter4," Your healthcare provider should be able to write a prescription for you to get a glucose meter, lancing device, and test strips. This should enable you to use your insurance, and can greatly decrease the price of your supplies. Ask your doctor for a prescription for these items if they do not write one for you automatically.

, Call your health insurance company to ask what models of glucose meter they will cover. Some insurance companies may only cover specific brands, and you definitely want to use your insurance to help cover costs every month., There are many different brands and models on the market today. Some of the private branded models offered by chain pharmacies have a very low price tag, and name brand meters can sometimes be purchased on sale.


Determine what type of other supplies come with the meter as part of a starter kit, such as a few lancets and possibly a small number of test strips.

, A common ploy by manufacturers is to offer a particular brand of meter for a sale price to attract buyers, but they fail to tell you that the test strips required for use with the meter may be very expensive.Look beyond the initial purchase and get some idea of how much you will pay for supplies in the future.


When making your selection, it might help to make a spreadsheet of the costs of the meter, strips, and lancets. See what each brand will cost for one month of use. Multiple by 12 to see what each brand will cost to use for a year. Even multiply that by 5 for a 5-year estimate. You might find that one brand becomes a better financial choice over time.

, It is often possible to purchase strips at online retail sites to save money. When using this approach, always check for the expiration date on the strips and determine if you can reasonably use all those strips before that date. You can also try to save money by getting supplies through your health insurance or using a pharmaceutical assistance program.

Discover online support groups. With online support groups growing as a strong resource, take an opportunity to search for an organization that may be suited to your needs and join in on a discussion.

, If you have been diagnosed with adult onset diabetes, then there is a good chance it is reversible. Consider the reasons you may have been diagnosed. These may include lack of exercise, smoking, and increased weight. Drug addiction and bad eating habits can also be causes of adult onset diabetes.

Talk to your doctor about getting the disease under control. Remember to maintain a positive attitude and seek to educate yourself about how to beat the disease. Many people have made lifestyle changes and reversed their diabetic diagnosis as a result.

, The A1c test measures the amount of sugar your blood cells are carrying, also known as ‘glucose.’ Having over 5.7% of this sugar in your blood can not only diagnose your condition, but also tell what you can do to keep everything in check.Know which type of diabetes you have to consider your methods. Be prepared to ask and research about your type, how often you should test your blood glucose and what percentage is an ideal goal.Arrange doctor appointments routinely.

, Once diagnosed, you will need to evaluate your diet and consider limiting or discovering future meals. Ask your doctor their opinion on your diet is and what should your diet look like .


Recall how often do you eat in one day. Along with new tastes, you may need to keep record of how often you may go to the kitchen every time you feel hungry. Tell your doctor when you eat will provide an incredible amount of information about your body.
Most diabetics make the mistake of thinking that only sugar is to blame. Carbohydrates such as white bread, flour, and pasta convert quickly in the body into complex sugars.
Alcohol is nearly impossible to take safely in the initial stages of diabetes. The sugar in beer and wine is very high. This is not a life sentence without alcohol, but until you are stable it is best to avoid it.
The challenges of a diabetic are mostly felt when eating out. Avoid high calorie and carbohydrate restaurants. Have fun finding new places to eat that offer salads and vegetables. Don’t be afraid to tell the waiter you are a diabetic. You may be surprised at how many people are. They can offer alternatives, desserts, and even sugar-free alcoholic beverages.

, Even with diabetes, your body may react differently to different medications based on previous conditions or family history. Discuss with your doctor any concerns over your medication, whether it be dosage amount or frequency.


Read every prescriptions’ side effects carefully. Should you experience unexpected behaviors since taking medication, review your medicine for possible side effects. If you begin to experience unusual symptoms, call your doctor immediately for further consultation.
Diabetes is simple really. There are mainly two methods of treatment. One is the oral hypoglycemics and the other is injectable insulin. It is preferable to begin on oral hypoglycemics. However, your doctor will know the severity of your diabetes and make that decision.

, Beyond contacting your primary doctor, seek out additional assistance with medical professionals who will assist in forming a new, healthy system.


Call your insurance company to find out exactly what they will cover and how often. Most insurance companies may have benefits available to you that cover some of the cost of diabetic supplies and medications.

, When you go shopping, you will probably need to purchase several diabetic equipment and medication. Write these products on every shopping list and organize local stores which supplies your needs. The more you perform these actions, the easier it is to form a typical shopping routine.

This type of diabetes is an autoimmune disease. While it can occur suddenly due to infection, symptoms will usually appear after an illness.Symptoms in type 1 are usually quite noticeable, more severe and quicker to cause illness. Symptoms for type 1 or advanced type 2 often include:Increased thirst and frequent urination
Dehydration
Possibly extreme hunger with loss of appetite (nothing satisfies you)
Unexplained blurred vision
Unexplained weight loss
Unusual weakness/fatigue
Irritability
Slow-healing sores
Frequent infections (such as gums or skin infections and vaginal infections),
Nausea and/or vomiting
Ketones in the urine, in medical tests -- ketones are a byproduct of the unhealthy breakdown/loss of muscle and fat (wasting away) that happens when there's not enough available insulin to support life.;
, These can be life-threatening. They may include weakened immunity to infectious diseases, and generally poor circulation (including in the eyes and kidneys), and other illnesses. Pay attention to any unexplained pain in your feet and legs, numbness and increasing infections in toes and feet, or gangrene in toes, feet and legs -- and seek medical attention immediately.

Because the initial symptoms of Type 1 diabetes can be severe, it is not uncommon for you to have to stay in the hospital for a short time after your diagnosis. If you suspect that you have diabetes and delay seeing a doctor, you can end up in a coma. Always rely on the advice of a qualified doctor or specialist when deciding on any plans to fight your diabetes.
Neither Type 1 nor Type 2 diabetes can be completely cured, but with a lifelong commitment to your treatment plan, these diseases can be managed to the point that you will be able to live a normal life. Begin your treatment plan immediately after you develop diabetes, for better health. If you think you may have diabetes, do not wait on seeing a doctor. It is highly recommended that you see a doctor., You're here, so you are in the right mindset. Diabetes educators are highly recommended. These experts help you understand the different tools available to you, and can help you adjust your meals to better control blood glucose levels. For those who are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at a young age, an appointment with a diabetes trainer/educator is often mandatory, and they will often meet with you while in the hospital., The body of a person with Type 1 diabetes needs insulin because their pancreas is damaged in a way that will not produce enough insulin as needed. Insulin is a chemical compound used to break down sugar (glucose) in the bloodstream. Those with type 1 diabetes must work with their doctor to find their correct dosage of insulin, because different individuals have different reactions to various types of insulin, and because some individuals with this type of diabetes may still be producing insulin at mild levels. Without insulin, the symptoms of Type 1 diabetes will rapidly worsen and eventually cause death. To be clear: Individuals with Type 1 diabetes need to take insulin every day or they will die.Your precise daily insulin dosages will vary based on your size, diet, activity level, and genetics, which is why it is so important to see a doctor to get a thorough evaluation before beginning your diabetes treatment plan. Insulin is generally available in several different varieties, each of which is formulated for specific purposes. These are:Rapid-acting: ""Mealtime"" (bolus) insulin. Usually taken right before a meal to prevent elevated blood glucose levels after eating.
Short-acting: Basal insulin. Usually taken between meals once or twice a day to control ""resting"" blood glucose levels.
Long-acting: A combination of bolus and basal insulin. Can be be taken before breakfast and dinner in order to keep blood glucose levels low after meals as well as throughout the day.
Intermediate-acting: Combined with rapid-acting insulin. It covers the blood glucose elevations when rapid-acting insulins stop working. This type is typically taken twice a day., Your blood glucose level is entered into the device at meal times and in accordance with your normal testing schedule, and your bolus is calculated for you. In addition a carbohydrate ratio can be set and be added to the bolus calculation as well.

There is the new tubeless insulin pump that is an ""all-in-one"" unit that typically come loaded with a three day supply of insulin with the battery and pump built-in, it is the Omnipod, that is wirelessly controlled by a Personal Diabetes Manager (PDM). It takes ideally requires about ten pumps per month that come in a box holding a 30 day supply.The old, standard injection set consisted of a plastic cap attached to a catheter that injects the insulin (subcutaneous delivery of insulin). It was inserted into your chosen injection site brought from the pump by tubing called the cannula. The pump set might be attached to a belt or near the delivery site with an adhesive pad. On the other end, the tubing connects to a cartridge that you fill with insulin and insert into the pump unit. Some pumps have a compatible glucose monitor that measures glucose levels just below the dermis. While not as effective as a glucose meter, this device will allow early detection and compensation for sugar spikes and drops.
Pump users typically monitor their blood sugars more frequently to evaluate the effectiveness of insulin delivery by the pump, to be aware if the pump malfunctions. Some malfunctions of the insulin pump include:

Pump battery is discharged
Insulin is inactivated by heat exposure
Insulin reservoir runs empty
Tubing loosens and insulin leaks rather than being injected
The cannula becomes bent or kinked, preventing delivery of insulin.



, In general, people with diabetes should strive to be physically fit. Physical exercise has the effect of lowering the body's glucose levels - sometimes for as long as 24 hours.Because the most harmful effects of diabetes are caused by elevated glucose levels (blood sugar ""spikes""), exercise after eating is a valuable tool that uses sugar naturally and allows people with diabetes to keep glucose at manageable levels. In addition, exercise also provides the same benefits to those with diabetes that it does to those without it - namely, greater overall fitness, weight loss (but rapid weight loss is a bad symptom indicating food and sugar is not used properly by your system). You can gain higher strength and endurance, higher energy levels, elevated mood, and more benefits of exercise as well.


Diabetes resources generally recommend exercising at least several times per week. Most resources recommend a healthy mix of cardio, strength training, and balance/flexibility exercises. See How to Exercise for more information.
Though low, manageable glucose levels are generally a good thing for moderate activity for people who have diabetes. Exercising vigorously while you have low blood sugar levels can lead to a condition called hypoglycemia, in which the body doesn't have enough blood sugar to fuel its vital processes and the exercising muscles. Hypoglycemia can lead to dizziness, weakness, and fainting. To counter hypoglycemia, carry a sugary, quick-acting carbohydrate with you while you exercise, such as a sweet, ripe orange, or a soda, a sports drink or such as recommended by your health team., Whether the cause is physical or mental, stress is known to cause blood sugar levels to fluctuate.Constant or prolonged stress can cause blood sugar levels to rise in the long term, which means you may need to use more medication or exercise more frequently to stay healthy. Generally, the best cure for stress is a preventative one - avoid stress in the first place by exercising frequently, getting enough sleep, avoiding stressful situations when possible, and talking about your problems before they become serious.


Other stress management techniques include seeing a therapist, practicing meditation techniques, eliminating caffeine from your diet, and pursuing healthy hobbies. See How to Deal With Stress for more information.

, As both an actual physical ailment and as an indirect source of stress, illness can cause your blood sugars to fluctuate. Prolonged or serious illness can even necessitate changes in the way you take your diabetes medication or the diet and exercise routines you'll need to keep. Though the best policy when it comes to illnesses, is to avoid them by living a life that is as healthy, happy, and stress-free as possible. If and when you do come down with an illness, be sure to give yourself the rest and medicine that you need to get better as quickly as possible.


If you have the common cold, try drinking plenty of fluids, taking over-the-counter cold medications (but avoid sugary cough syrups), and getting plenty of rest. Since having the cold can ruin your appetite, you'll want to be sure to eat roughly 15 grams of carbohydrates every hour or so.Though having a cold usually elevates your blood sugar levels, refraining from eating as may feel natural can cause your blood sugar to fall dangerously low.
Serious illnesses always require the advice of a doctor, but managing serious diseases in patients with diabetes can require special medicines and techniques. If you are a person with diabetes and you think you may have a disease that is more serious than an ordinary cold, see your doctor right away.

, Women with diabetes have unique challenges when it comes to managing blood sugar during their periods and menopause. Though diabetes affects every woman differently, many women report having elevated blood sugar levels in the days before their periods, which can require using more insulin or changing your diet and exercise habits to compensate.However, your blood sugar levels during your menstrual cycle may be different, so talk to your doctor or gynecologist for specific guidance.


Additionally, menopause can change the way that the body's blood sugar level fluctuates. Many women report that their glucose levels become more unpredictable during menopause.Menopause can also lead to weight gain, sleep loss, and temporary vaginal ailments, which can increase the body's levels of stress hormones and elevate glucose levels.If you have diabetes and are going through menopause, talk to your doctor to find a treatment plan that's right for you.

, Right after you are diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, it is likely that you will need to meet with your doctor regularly (as much as once a week or more) to get a sense for how to best control your blood glucose levels. It can take a few weeks to develop an insulin therapy regimen that perfectly matches your diet and activity level. Once your diabetes treatment routine is established, you won't need to meet with your doctor quite as often. However, you should plan on maintaining a good relationship with your doctor, which means scheduling semi-regular follow-up appointments. Your doctor is the person who is best-suited to detecting discrepancies in your blood glucose levels before they become serious and are valuable resources when you need to manage your diabetes during times of stress, sickness, pregnancy, and so on.


Those with Type 1 diabetes should expect to see their doctor once every 3 - 6 months once a routine is established., If you have Type 2 diabetes, your body is able to produce some insulin, as opposed to none at all, but has a diminished capacity for producing insulin or is not able to use the chemical correctly. Because of this crucial difference, Type 2 diabetes symptoms can be more mild than Type 1 symptoms, and have a more gradual onset, and can require less drastic treatments (though exceptions are possible). However, as with Type 1 diabetes, seeing your doctor before beginning any treatment plan is still essential. Only a qualified medical professional has the knowledge definitively diagnose your diabetes and design a treatment plan that's tailored to your personal needs.

, As noted above, people with Type 2 diabetes have a diminished (but not nonexistent) capacity to make and use insulin naturally. Because their bodies do make some insulin, in some cases, it's possible for people with Type 2 diabetes to manage their disease without having to use any artificial insulin. Usually, this is done through careful diet and exercise, which means minimizing the amount of sugary foods consumed, maintaining a healthy weight, and exercising regularly. Some people with mild cases of Type 2 diabetes can potentially live basically ""normal"" lives if they are very careful about what they eat and how much they exercise.


It's important to remember, however, that some cases of Type 2 diabetes are more severe than others and can't be managed with diet and exercise alone and can require insulin or other medications.
Note: see the sections below for information relating to diet and medications.

, Type 2 diabetes is known to be a progressive disease. This means that it can get worse over time. This is thought to be because the body's cells responsible for producing insulin get ""worn out"" from having to work extra hard in people with Type 2 diabetes.As a result, cases of Type 2 diabetes that once required relatively minor treatment options can eventually require more drastic treatments, including insulin therapy, after several years. This is often not due to any fault on the patient's behalf.


As with Type 1 diabetes, you should keep in close contact with your physician if you have Type 2 diabetes - regular tests and checkups can help you detect the progression of Type 2 diabetes before it becomes serious.

, Obesity is one of the leading causes of Type 2 diabetes. However, being obese can make any case of diabetes more dangerous and harder to manage. The added stress that obesity puts on the body can make it extremely difficult to keep blood sugar at healthy levels. In Type 2 diabetes cases where patients have high body mass indexes (usually greater than 35), doctors will sometimes recommend weight-reduction surgeries to bring the patient's weight under control quickly. Two types of surgery are usually used for this purpose:Gastric bypass surgery - the stomach is shrunk to the size of a thumb and the small intestine is shortened so that fewer calories are absorbed from food. This change is permanent.
Laparoscopic Gastric Banding (""Lap Banding"") - a band is wrapped around the stomach so that it feels fuller with less food. This band can be adjusted or removed if needed.

, Because the potentially harmful effects of diabetes are triggered by elevated blood sugar levels, it's important for people with diabetes to check their blood sugar levels fairly regularly. Today, this is usually done with a small, portable machine that measures your blood sugar from a tiny drop of your blood. The exact answers to when, where, and how you should check your blood sugar can depend on your age, the type of diabetes you have, and your condition. Thus, you'll want to talk to your doctor before beginning to monitor your blood sugar levels. The advice below is for general cases and is not meant to replace the advice of a doctor.


Those with Type 1 diabetes are often instructed to check their blood sugar three or more times a day. This is often done before or after certain meals, before or after exercise, before bed, and even during the night. If you are sick or are taking a new medication, you may need to monitor your blood sugar even more closely.Those with Type 2 diabetes, on the other hand, usually don't have to check their blood sugar quite as often - they may be instructed to check their levels once or more per day. In cases where Type 2 diabetes can be managed with non-insulin medications or diet and exercise alone, your doctor may not even require you to check your blood sugar every day., Just as it is important for people with diabetes to monitor their blood sugar from day to day, it's also important to have a ""bird's eye"" perspective of long-term trends in blood sugar levels. People with diabetes should generally have special test called A1C (also known as Hemoglobin A1C or HbA1C) tests at regular intervals - your doctor may direct you to have such tests every month or every two to three months. These tests monitor the average blood sugar level over the last few months rather than giving an instantaneous ""snapshot"" and thus can provide valuable information about whether or not a treatment plan is working well.


A1C tests work by analyzing a molecule in your blood called hemoglobin. When glucose enters your blood, some of it binds to these hemoglobin molecules. Because hemoglobin molecules usually live for about 3 months, analyzing the percentage of hemoglobin molecules that are bound to glucose can paint a picture of how high blood sugar levels were over the past few months., If your body lacks insulin and can't break down the glucose in the blood, its organs and tissues will quickly become starved for energy. This can lead to a dangerous condition called ketoacidosis in which the body begins to break down its fat stores to fuel its important processes. Though this will keep your body functioning, this process produces toxic compounds called ketones which, if allowed to build up, can be potentially life-threatening.If you have a blood sugar reading over 240 mg/dL or exhibit the symptoms listed below, test for ketoacidosis every 4-6 hours (this can be done with a simple over-the-counter urine strip test).If your test reveals you have a high amount of ketones in your urine, call your doctor immediately and seek emergency treatment. The symptoms of ketoacidosis are:Nausea
Vomiting
Sweet-smelling, ""fruity"" breath odor
Unexplained weight loss.

, Because Type 2 diabetes can progress so gradually that it's difficult to detect, it's important to be on the lookout for possible complications from the disease so that they can be addressed before becoming serious. Diabetes can cause nerve damage and change circulation to certain parts of the body, especially the feet and eyes. Over time, this can result in loss of the feet or blindness. People with Type 1 and people with Type 2 diabetes are both at risk for these complications. However, because Type 2 diabetes can progress gradually without being noticed, it's extra-important to schedule regular foot and eye exams to prevent either condition from developing.


Comprehensive dilated eye exams check for diabetic retinopathy (vision loss from diabetes) and should normally be scheduled about once a year. During pregnancy or illness, more-frequent is likely to be necessary.Foot tests check for pulse, feeling, and the presence of any sores or ulcers on the feet and should be scheduled about once per year. However, if you have had foot ulcers before, having tests as often as once every 3 months may be necessary., When it comes to controlling your diabetes, diet is crucial. Carefully managing the types and amounts of foods you eat allows you to manage your blood sugar level, which has a direct effect on the severity of your diabetes. The advice in this section comes from reputable diabetes resources, but every diabetes plan should be individually-tailored for you based on your age, size, activity level, condition, and genetics. Thus, the advice in this section is intended only as a general advice and should never replace the advice of a qualified doctor or nutritionist.


If you are unsure of how to obtain personalized diet information, talk to your doctor or general practitioner. S/he will be able to guide your diet plan or refer you to a qualified specialist.

, When someone eats more calories than s/he burns, the body responds by creating an increase in blood sugar.Since the symptoms of diabetes are caused by elevated blood sugar levels, this is undesirable for people suffering from diabetes. Thus, people with diabetes are generally encouraged to eat diets which provide as many essential nutrients as possible while keeping the total calories consumed per day at a sufficiently low level. Thus, foods (like many types of vegetables) which are nutrient-dense and low-calorie can make up a good portion of a healthy diabetes diet.


Low-calorie, high-nutrient diets are also helpful for diabetes because they ensure you remain at a healthy weight. Obesity is known to strongly contribute to the development of type 2 Diabetes. , In recent years, a lot of the health dangers posed by carbohydrates have been brought to light. Most diabetes resources recommend eating controlled amounts of carbohydrates - specifically, healthy and nutritious varieties of carbohydrates. Generally, individuals with diabetes will want to limit their intake of carbohydrates to moderately low levels and to make sure that the carbohydrates they do eat are whole grain, high-fiber carbohydrates. See below for more information:


Many carbohydrates are grain products, which are derived from wheat, oat, rice, barley, and similar grains. Grain products can be divided into two categories - whole grains and refined grains. Whole grains contain the entire grain, including the nutrient-rich outer portions (called the bran and germ), while refined grains only contain the innermost starchy portion (called the endosperm), which is less nutrient-rich. For a given calorie amount, whole grains are much more nutrient-rich than refined grains, so try to prioritize whole grain products over ""white"" breads, pastas, rice, and so on.
Bread has been shown to raise a person's blood sugar more than two tablespoons of table sugar., Fiber is a nutrient contained in vegetables, fruits, and other plant-derived foods. Fiber is largely indigestible - when it's eaten, most fiber passes through the intestine without being digested. Though fiber doesn't provide much nutrition, it does provide a variety of health benefits. For instance, it helps control feelings of hunger, making it easier to eat healthy amounts of food. It also contributes to digestive health and is famously known to help ""keep you regular"".High-fiber foods are a great choice for people with diabetes because they make it easier to eat a healthy amount of food each day.


High-fiber foods include most fruits (especially raspberries, pears, and apples), whole grains, bran, legumes (especially beans and lentils), vegetables (especially artichokes, broccoli, and green beans)., Protein is often (rightly) lauded as a healthy source of energy and muscle-building nutrition, but some sources of protein can come loaded with fat. For a smarter option, choose low-fat, high-nutrient lean protein sources. In addition to supplying the nutrition needed for a strong, healthy body, protein is also known to produce a greater, longer-lasting feeling of fullness than other sources of calories.


Lean proteins include skinless white meat chicken (dark meat has a little more fat, while the skin is high-fat), most fish, dairy products (full-fat is better than low-fat or fat free), beans, eggs, pork tenderloin, and lean varieties of red meat., Contrary to popular belief, dietary fat isn't always a bad thing. In fact, certain types of fat, namely mono and polyunsaturated fats (which include Omega 3's) are known to provide health benefits, including lowering the body's level of LDL, or ""bad"" cholesterol.However, all fats are calorie-dense, so you'll want to enjoy fats sparingly to maintain a healthy weight. Try to add small servings of ""good"" fats into your diet without increasing your overall calorie load per day - your doctor or dietician will be able to help you here.


Foods that are rich in ""good"" fats (mono and polyunsaturated fats) include avocados, most nuts (including almonds, pecans, cashews, and peanuts), fish, tofu, flaxseed, and more.On the other hand, foods that are rich in ""bad"" fats (saturated and trans fats) include fatty meats (including regular beef or ground beef, bacon, sausage, etc.), fatty dairy products (including cream, ice cream, full-fat milk, cheese, butter, etc.), chocolate, lard, coconut oil, poultry skins, processed snack foods, and fried foods.

, Cholesterol is a lipid - a type of fat molecule - that is naturally produced by the body in order to serve as an important part of cell membranes. Though the body naturally requires a certain amount of cholesterol, elevated levels of blood cholesterol can lead to health problems - especially for people with diabetes. High cholesterol levels can lead to a variety of serious cardiovascular problems, including heart disease and stroke. People with diabetes are naturally predisposed to having cholesterol levels that are unhealthy, so it's extra important for diabetes sufferers to monitor their cholesterol intake than for people without the disease.This means choosing foods carefully to limit the intake of cholesterol.


Cholesterol comes in two forms - LDL (or ""bad"") cholesterol and HDL (or ""good"") cholesterol. Bad cholesterol can build up on the inner walls of the arteries, causing eventual problems heart attack and stroke, while good cholesterol helps remove damaging cholesterol from the blood. Thus, people with diabetes will want to keep their level of ""bad"" cholesterol intake as low as possible while eating healthy amounts of ""good"" cholesterol.""Bad"" cholesterol sources include: Fatty dairy products, egg yolks, liver and other types of organ meat, fatty meats, and poultry skin.
""Good"" cholesterol sources include: Oatmeal, nuts, most fish, olive oil, and foods with plant sterols, Alcohol is often called a source of ""empty calories"", and for good reason - alcoholic beverages like beer, wine, and liquor contain calories but little in the way of actual nutrition. Luckily, most people with diabetes can still enjoy these entertaining (if not nutritious) drinks in moderation. According to the American Diabetes Association, moderate alcohol use actually has little effect on blood glucose control and does not contribute to heart disease.Thus, people with diabetes are generally encouraged to follow the same guidelines as people without diabetes when it comes alcohol: men can enjoy up to 2 drinks daily, while women can have 1 drink.Note that, for medical purposes, ""drinks"" are defined as standard-size servings of the beverage in question - about 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1 & 1/2 ounces of liquor.Note also that these guidelines do not account for sugary mixers and additives which may be added to cocktails and can negatively impact the blood glucose level of someone with diabetes.

, One of the most frustrating things about any diet, including a diabetes diet, is that eating too much of any food - even healthy, nutritious food - can cause weight gain which leads to health problems. Because it's important for people with diabetes to keep their weight at a healthy level, portion control is a serious concern. Generally, for a large meal, like dinner, those with diabetes will want to eat plenty of nutritious, fiber-rich vegetables along with controlled amounts of lean protein and starchy grains or carbohydrates.


Many diabetes resources offer sample meal guides to help teach the importance of portion control. Most of such guides offer advice that strongly resemble the following:Devote 1/2 of your plate to non-starchy, fiber-rich vegetables like kale, spinach, broccoli, green beans, bok choy, onion, pepper, turnip, tomatoes, cauliflower, and many more.
Devote 1/4 of your plate to healthy starches and grains like whole grain breads, oatmeal, rice, pasta, potatoes, beans, peas, grits, squash, and popcorn.
Devote 1/4 of your plate to lean protein like skinless chicken or turkey, fish, seafood, lean beef or pork, tofu, and eggs.

, Diabetes is a serious illness which can require special medications to treat. However, if misused, these medications can lead to problems which can be serious in their own right. Before taking any medication for your diabetes, talk to your doctor to develop a plan that takes all treatment options (including diet and exercise) into account. Like all serious medical conditions, a case of diabetes requires the advice of a qualified professional. The information in this section is purely informative and should not be used to pick medications or formulate dosages.


Additionally, you won't necessarily want to stop taking any medications you are currently on if you discover you are have diabetes. A doctor must evaluate all of the variables at play - including your current medication usage - to develop a plan to treat your diabetes.
The effects of using too much or too little diabetes medication can be serious. For instance, an overdose of insulin can result in hypoglycemia, leading to dizziness, fatigue, confusion, and even coma in severe cases.

, Insulin is perhaps the most well-known diabetes medication. The insulin that doctors prescribe to people who have diabetes is a synthetic form of a chemical naturally produced by the pancreas to process sugar in the blood. In healthy individuals, after a meal, when blood sugar levels are high, the body releases insulin to break down the sugar, removing it from the bloodstream and rendering it into a usable form of energy. Administering insulin (via injection) allows the body to process blood sugar properly. Since medicinal insulin comes in several strengths and varieties, it's important to receive a doctor's advice before starting to use insulin.


Note that people with Type 1 Diabetes must take insulin. Type 1 diabetes is characterized by the body being completely unable to make insulin, so it must be added by the patient. People with Type 2 Diabetes may or may not take insulin depending upon the severity of their disease.

, There are a variety of options when it comes to orally-administered diabetes medications (pills). Often, for people with moderate cases of Type 2 diabetes, doctors will recommend trying these types of medications before using insulin as the latter represents a more drastic, life-affecting treatment option. Because there are are such a wide variety of oral diabetes medications with different mechanisms of action, it's important to talk to a doctor before starting to take any sort of diabetes pills to ensure that the medication is safe for your own personal use. See below for the different types of oral diabetes medications and a brief description of the mechanism of action for each:Sulfonylureas - stimulate the pancreas to release more insulin.
Biguanides - lower the amount of glucose produced in the liver and makes muscle tissue more sensitive to insulin.
Meglitinides - stimulate the pancreas to release more insulin.
Thiazolidinediones - reduce glucose production in liver and increase insulin sensitivity in muscle and fat tissue.
DPP-4 inhibitors - prevent the breakdown of normally short-lived chemical mechanisms which regulate the level of blood glucose.
SGLT2 Inhibitors - absorbs blood glucose in the kidneys.
Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors - lower glucose levels by preventing the breakdown of starches in the intestine. Also slow the breakdown of some sugars.
Bile Acid Sequestrants - reduces cholesterol and simultaneously lowers glucose levels. The method for the latter is still not well understood.

, The medications specifically designed to fight diabetes above are not the only medications prescribed for diabetes. Doctors prescribe a range of medications, from aspirin to flu shots, to help manage diabetes. However, even though these medications are usually not as ""serious"" or drastic as the diabetes medications described above, it's usually a good idea to consult with your doctor before supplementing your treatment plan with one of these medicines just in case. Just a few supplementary medicines are listed below:


Aspirin - sometimes prescribed to reduce the risk of heart attacks for people with diabetes.Mechanism of action is not well-understood but is thought to relate to aspirin's ability to prevent red blood cells from sticking together.
Flu shots - since the flu, like many illnesses, can cause blood glucose levels to fluctuate and make diabetes harder to manage, doctors often recommend that patients receive yearly flu shots to reduce their chance of contracting this disease.
Herbal supplements - though most ""homeopathic"" supplements have not definitively been proven effective in a scientific setting, some diabetes patients offer anecdotal testimonies to their effectiveness.

Explain type 2 diabetes to those that misunderstand it.,
Don’t be ashamed that you’re diabetic.,
Offer to explain what you are doing.,
Contact media organizations that misrepresent type 2 diabetes.",How to Combat the Stigma of Type 2 Diabetes1," Much of the stigma associated with type 2 diabetes is associated with a lack of knowledge about the disease. You should never feel as though it is your responsibility to educate others. That said, informing someone that their assumptions about the disease are not accurate may cause them to treat you and others with the diseases differently.There are a few go-to phrases you can rely on to combat common misconceptions.
For instance, say something like, ""While lifestyle factors are important, type 2 diabetes is not always caused by an unhealthy diet or a lack of exercise. These are two common misconceptions about type 2 diabetes.""
Alternatively, ask others what they know about type 2 diabetes when they bring it up, then politely clarify any misunderstandings they convey.;
, Some people are tempted to check their blood glucose levels and administer insulin injections discreetly because they don’t want others to know that they’re diabetic. Remind yourself that you are not obligated to do so. The more comfortable you are with others’ knowing that you’re diabetic, the easier it will be able to talk about it when it comes up.Checking or adjusting your monitor, for instance, can lead to conversation about your disease, and the opportunity to educate another person about diabetes.
Letting others know about your diabetes is not only helpful for them, it could be life-saving for you. The more people that know you are diabetic, the faster they can respond if an emergency arises.

, If you notice someone staring at your monitor or watching what you’re doing, offer to tell them what you’re up to. Demystifying the disease helps contribute to improved knowledge, and less stigma. Further, some people may be uncomfortable if they see you give yourself an insulin injection and assuming you’re using a recreational drug.For instance, say something like, “Ever seen one of these before? I need to use it because I have diabetes. What do you know about diabetes?”

, One major contributor to the stigma associated with type 2 diabetes is misrepresentation in the media. For instance, some of the common misunderstandings about the disease are often reiterated in media sources that many people consume.


An example is the implication that type 2 diabetes can be avoided with changes in diet and more frequent exercise. This is not always the case.
Write to a newspaper or TV network and point out anything they may have misrepresented by saying something like, “I wanted to write to discuss your portrayal of people with type 2 diabetes. Everyone you featured in your segment was significantly overweight, which contributes to the idea that this is a “lifestyle disease.” While it’s true that lifestyle factors can affect someone’s risk of getting the disease, sometimes otherwise healthy people develop the disease as well.”

Join a diabetes support group.,
Meet with a therapist.,
Avoid blaming yourself.,
Don’t allow yourself to stigmatize others.",How to Combat the Stigma of Type 2 Diabetes2," Meeting and speaking with others who know what it feels like to experience stigma can be incredibly helpful. You can likely find a support group that includes people with diabetes generally, or with type 2 in particular. Not only can a support group feel more comfortable with what you're feeling, it can also be a source of new ideas to help talk to others in your life about your disease.Note that people with type 1 diabetes experience stigma as well, and sometimes may even contribute to it by resenting those with type 2 diabetes. Meeting others and learning from their perspectives and experiences can help temper any negative sentiments.
Ask your doctor or therapist about diabetes support groups in your area.

, Your medical team probably already includes an endocrinologist, a nutritionist, and another type of doctor or two. Consider getting help staying on top of your mental health too, by meeting with a mental health professional. Many people find it beneficial to speak with a therapist or psychologist to help cope with challenges of having a serious diseases, including the stigma that is often associated with certain diseases.Ask any of your doctors for recommendations regarding a mental health professional they are familiar with. You can likely even find someone with experience helping people talk to friends and family about type 2 diabetes.

, Many people with type 2 diabetes end up buying into the stigma against the diseases themselves. Even when you know it’s not literally your fault, it can feel like it sometimes. If you’re experiencing feelings of guilt, remind yourself that self-blame is a negative practice that will make you more unhappy. Instead, focus on what you can do to help your condition, and make an action plan i you haven't already.When negative thoughts do arise, recognize them for what they are and immediately turn them around using neutral self-talk. Neutral self-talk is typically more believable, and helps make the transition to positive self-talk easier.
For instance, when you're feeling guilty about failing to exercise for a couple days in a row, think to yourself, ""I'm glad that I recognize the importance of staying active, and I'm going to take this negative feeling as a reminder to get back on track starting right now.""

, You may find yourself resenting others with the disease without realizing it. For instance, when you see someone you know has type 2 diabetes behaving in an unhealthy way, you may be frustrated that they are fulfilling negative stereotypes about people with the disease. However, it’s important to check your own assumptions, and remind yourself that they likely suffer from stigma as well."
"
Respond to rudeness patiently.,
Learn more about diabetes yourself.,
Study misconceptions in particular.",How to Combat the Stigma of Type 2 Diabetes3," Some people may even make their judgments of you apparent. For instance, someone may question why you’re eating something, or you may notice their demeanor change if they ask about your diabetes and you reveal that you have type 2. When you're treated this way, it can be frustrating, but try to take the opportunity to educate someone instead of becoming upset.For instance, say something like, ""I appreciate your interest in my health. I am eating this in order to get my blood glucose levels back up to a safe level.""
Alternatively, ""I know that lots of people don't know what to say when I tell them I have type 2. Trust me, I've learned a lot about how to address my own behavior, as well as how to educate others about the additional factors that cause diabetes.""

, Since educating others is the best way to reduce stigma against type 2 diabetes, it’s worth educating yourself as much as possible about the disease. Perhaps more importantly, knowing as much as you can about the disease can put you in the best position to keep it from hindering your life.


Your doctor and other members of your health team are likely the best source of information about type 2 diabetes. If there is anything you don’t understand about causes, treatment, or anything else, do not hesitate to ask them where you could find more information.
Do research through reputable sources such as university websites about anything you want to know more about.

, The unfortunate reality of a stigma against type 2 diabetes is based on a few popular misconceptions that you’re likely well aware of. Instead of being frustrated when these misconceptions arise, have a fact-based response ready to go.For instance, other people may believe you can’t eat sugar, that you’re diabetic because you’re overweight, or that you could cure your diabetes if you exercised more or ate a healthier diet.
By familiarizing yourself with specific common misconceptions, you’ll know exactly what to say when someone makes one of these assumptions.
For example, you could clarify with something like, “While lifestyle factors are important to development of type 2 diabetes, some people develop the disease despite maintaining an extremely healthy lifestyle.”

Recognize the average cost of diabetic expenses.,
Identify elements of cost.,
Read recent medical bills.,
Review past out-of-pocket expenses.,
Talk to your insurance provider about plan options.",How to Budget Medical Expenses for Diabetes1," On average, people who have diabetes incur $13,700 in expenses every year. The expenditures stem from the following components:Inpatient care, 43%
Prescription medications to treat diabetic complications, 18%
Anti-diabetic agents and diabetes supplies, 12%
Doctors’ office visits, 9%
Nursing and/or residential facility stays, 8%;
, Diabetic care has several different components that make up the average costs per year, including out-of-pocket costs. Identifying these components can help you better anticipate and budget the cost of your care. You should include the following components when calculating medical expenses:Medications
Testing supplies such as lancets and strips
Injection supplies such as alcohol swabs, syringes, and pen needles
Insulin pump, if you use one
Continuous glucose monitoring, including regular supply shipments
Doctor’s visits, including specialists
Healthy food
Fitness programs and/ or weight loss tools

, Government and private insurance cover many medical expenses if you’re diabetic. No matter if you are insured or uninsured, you likely receive bills for medical care. Carefully reading through these can help you figure out how much your insurance covered medical expenses. Reading through medical bills for the previous six months or year can give you a good idea of what your total and out-of-pocket expenses were.Request copies of medical bills from your doctors’ offices, hospitals, and insurance company if you do not have or cannot find them.

, Part of your medical bills will usually include your out-of-pocket cost. Compile this information with those from other sources such as receipts for services and bank statements. This will inform you about how much you spent on diabetic care and can provide a baseline number for your budget.Include items in your out-of-pocket expenses that may not seem related to your diabetes. For example, many diabetics have problems with their feet that require wearing special shoes for diabetes. Diabetic shoes are an expense for which you’ll want to review cost and budget funds.

Discuss the budget with your family.,
Gather financial information.,
Assess your overall expenditures.",How to Budget Medical Expenses for Diabetes2," In many cases, budgeting medical expenses impacts your family members. Talk to your partner, spouse, or other loved ones about the budget and how it may affect them. You can also strategize on ways to optimize your financial means towards your medical needs.Be open and honest with your family members. Say, “Hey Joe, I’m really concerned that my diabetes costs are affecting us. I’d like to look at our finances and my medical costs to come up with a way that we can all save. Would you help me?”

, In order to budget for your medical expenses, you’ll need to have a picture of your finances. Collect any documentation that contains information on how much money you have and what you can allot to medical expenses. Some of the documents you can use to help create your budget include:Pay statements or stubs
Tax documents
Bank statements
Statements of investment
Life insurance policies
Mortgage or home equity paperwork
Search for diabetes-specific expenses.

, Use your financial information to gain a picture of your overall expenses and what you can spend on medical costs. This can help you more accurately compose your budget for medical expenses. Some questions to ask yourself include:What is my monthly income?
What are my monthly expenses for home, utilities, phone, food, transportation, and medicine?
When are my bills due?
What are my non-essential expenses such as shopping or entertainment?
What do I do with money in my wallet? Do I keep a spending diary?

Compose a budget.,
Work with a financial planner.,
Allot funds every payday.,
Track your expenses.,
Save for emergencies.,
Adjust your budget as needed.",How to Budget Medical Expenses for Diabetes3," Once you’ve gained an overall perspective of your income and expenses, you’re ready to write your budget for medical expenses. You can write your own budget or use an online tool or smartphone app to guide you.For example, the Federal Trade Commission offers a basic worksheet to create a budget that includes medical expenses.Use the budget as your baseline for how much you can reasonably spend on your diabetic medical expenses.


Tweak your budget for medical expenses if you have more income than you expected. Likewise, if you have less income than you expected, you can cut out non-essentials to help defray the cost of your medical expenses.

, If you are able, consider working with a financial planner to compose your budget for medical expenses. The CFP, or certified financial planner, can advise you on how best to use your income, insurance, and other programs to cover medical expenses. In addition, a CFP may have knowledge of tax credits and aid programs that may further assist you with medical expenses.Work only with a certified financial planner, who is licensed to advise your financial situation. In the United States, you can find a certified financial planner in your local area at http://www.napfa.org. Looking for associations of CFPs in other countries can point you to someone who can advise you on a budget for your diabetic medical expenses.
Consider the planner’s pay structure. Someone who works on commission may have incentive to steer your decisions in a particular direction. A CFP who charges an hourly fee may be a better option., You may have medical expenses for your diabetes throughout the month. One way to ensure you have enough is to break down your budget per paycheck. You can then set aside the money to cover your medical expenses every time you get paid. This can ensure that you stick to the budget and have enough to pay for what you need.Consider setting aside cash and keeping in a place where you can access when you need it. For example, you could have a separate wallet with cash for your medical expenses that you only take when you’re purchasing supplies or medications. This can ensure that you don’t spend the money on unnecessary things.

, Any time you purchase something—medical expense or otherwise— keep the receipt and write it down in the same place you keep your budget. You can write down expenses every day or once a week. This can ensure that you stick to your budget and adjust for unexpected changes in income. It can also help you with long-term planning and budgeting.Make sure to write down every purchase—even the seemingly little ones. Those can add up and throw off the budget.

, Sometimes people experience unexpected events that require payment for services. This includes medical emergencies, such as going into diabetic shock that requires hospitalization. The costs of this can run into the thousands of dollars. If you are able, include money for savings in your budget. Save whatever amount you can based on your necessary expenses. This may help you pay for medical expenses related to your diabetes.Build an emergency fund by setting aside one dollar a day. You can save this through simple things such as switching to filter coffee from fancy drinks or opting for a smaller or less expensive at a restaurant.

, Every six months to a year, you should reassess your expenditures and budget for diabetic care costs. This can help you stay on track without getting behind in payments or having to skip medications. Items such as reductions or increases in income or bills and emergencies can have a significant impact on your budget for medical expenses from diabetes.

If you have family members, especially parents or siblings, with diabetes, you're automatically at increased risk for acquiring diabetes.In addition, if your family background is African American, American Indian, Alaska Native, Hispanic, Asian American or Pacific Islander you're also at a higher risk to acquire this disease.Outside of genetics, if you're over the age of 45 you're at increased risk as well. This isn't a genetic issue, however it's a factor you have no control over and cannot change.;
, Outside of your genes, weight plays a key role in determining your overall risk for Type 2 Diabetes. Those people who are overweight or obese become more resistant to insulin and can eventually develop diabetes.Calculate your BMI to determine if you're overweight. A BMI of: 20-24.9 is considered normal weight, 25.-29.9 is considered overweight, 30-24.9 is considered obese and anything over 40 is considered morbidly obese.A BMI over 25 puts you at increased risk for diabetes. As BMI continues to rise or increase, the risk level for acquiring diabetes also increases.Use ideal body weight in addition to BMI to see how much excess weight you carry. Use an online calculator to determine your ideal body weight and possible excess weight.
The more excess weight you're carrying for your gender and height, the higher your risk for diabetes.

, In addition to how much excess weight you're carrying, how and where you carry that excess weight may also predict your risk for diabetes.


Waist circumference is a measurement taken around the middle of your abdomen. It can help determine your risk for diabetes in addition to many other chronic diseases.You're at increased risk if: you're a women and your waist circumference is >35 inches or if you're a man and your waist circumference is >40 inches.
To measure your waist circumference, take a cloth measuring tape and wrap it around your waist at belly button height. Make sure the tape is parallel to the floor all the way around your waist. Take note of the measurement.
If your waist circumference is high, your BMI is also most likely elevated.

, Not participating in regular physical activity is another risk factor that increases your risk for diabetes.Regular exercise helps to increase your cell's sensitivity to insulin so they are better able to use insulin when it's secreted.In addition, when you're muscles are working, they are better able to take up blood sugar or blood glucose.Fortunately, physical activity is a modifiable risk factor. This means that you can change your routine by either starting to be more active or including more physical activity in your day.

, Besides genetics and lifestyle factors, your past and current medical history can also play a role in determining your overall risk for Type 2 diabetes.If you have a history of cardiovascular disease (like atherosclerosis) you're at increased risk for diabetes in addition to high blood pressure and stroke.High blood pressure will also increase your risk of diabetes. In addition it damages your blood vessels and cardiovascular system.PCOS or polycystic ovary syndrome is a common condition that is frequently associated with obesity and diabetes.High cholesterol and triglyceride levels increase your risk for diabetes in addition to cardiovascular disease., Including regular amounts of physical activity is a great way to stay healthy, lose weight and reduce your risk of Type 2 Diabetes.


Aim for a total of 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic exercise every week. This is about 30 minutes 5 days a week.When you exercise, you should get your heart rate up to 50-70% of your maximum heart rate for the entire time that you exercise. You should calculate your target heart rate here.
This type of exercise helps your muscles and body use both insulin and blood sugar more effectively.
In addition to cardiovascular exercise, aim to include a few days of strength training. Work every major muscle group and participate in these exercises for at least 20 minutes.Strength training helps your muscles become more sensitive to insulin.

, A big factor that will determine your risk for Type 2 Diabetes is your weight. Losing even 5-7 percent of your body weight will cut your risk for getting diabetes in half.Cut out about 500 calories daily from your diet. This generally will help you lose a safe 1-2 pounds per week.Count your calories for a few days to get an average of how much you eat. Subtract 500 from this amount and use this new amount as your calorie goal for weight loss.
If you don't need to lose weight, but want to make sure you do not gain weight, count the total amount of calories you eat on a typical day. Try to stick to this amount on a regular basis to keep weight in check.

, Even if you're at a moderate weight, having an unhealthy diet can still affect your health and your risk for diabetes.


A balanced diet means you're eating nutritious foods from every food group each day. In addition, it's important to eat a wide variety of foods from within each food group.
To decrease your risk of diabetes, focus on lower calorie and lower fat foods. This means choosing lean protein like low-fat dairy, poultry, eggs, lean beef and legumes.Also focus on lower calorie and low-fat cooking techniques. Don't fry foods, cook them in a lot of oil or butter and avoid using heavy and rich sauces or gravies.
In addition, eating a diet high in fiber can also help decrease your risk of diabetes. Make sure to eat a fruit or vegetable at each meal and choose 100% whole grain foods., Eating large quantities of processed foods or eating them on a regular basis can decrease the quality of your diet. Overtime, this may lead to weight gain and an increased risk of diabetes.Processed foods can be dangerous because they are typically higher in calories, fat, sugar and sodium.Try to avoid or minimize these types of foods in your diet: fried foods, fast food, frozen TV meals or canned meals, processed meats, sweetened beverages, candy, cookies, cakes or pies, breakfast pastries, and alcohol.

, If you smoke, you're 30-40% more likely to get Type 2 Diabetes compared to non-smokers. Quit immediately to help decrease your overall risk.More recent research has shown a direct link to smoking and diabetes. In addition, the more you smoke, the higher your risk.Stop smoking immediately. Try quitting cold turkey or using over-the-counter products to help you give up the habit.
If you're having difficulty quitting, talk to your doctor. They may be able to refer you to a smoking cessation program or provide prescription medication to make quitting easier.

A meal plan is a guide that you create to help you get organized and visually see all of your meals and snacks for an entire week.
Include information about each meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner), snacks and beverages that you'll consume in your day.
Having this meal plan can also allow you count up carbohydrates, carbohydrate servings or calories.
In addition, your meal plan can serve as a guideline of what to buy at the grocery store. This may save you on time and money.
If you have a smartphone, look through the different fitness and dieting apps. There are many — like MyFitnessPal — that can act as a food log/diary and help you calculate your caloric intake.;
, Balanced meals are important in any type of diet;however, making sure your meals are balanced when you have type 2 diabetes is even more important.


Well-balanced meals include most food groups (protein, dairy, grains, fruits and vegetables). A well-balanced diet means that you're consuming all five food groups each day and consume a wide variety of foods within each food group.Well-balanced meals will help support more normalized blood sugar in people who have type 2 diabetes. It's the combination of foods that prevent blood sugar spikes or quick drops in blood sugar., Many people associate ""snacks"" with high-calorie or sweetened foods or beverages; however, a snack can be a great opportunity to add in more nutrition to your day and give you better control of your blood sugar.Snacks can be a great idea for diabetics. This is especially true if you have a long time between meals or typically experience low blood sugar in between meals. Plan to have snacks ready and available to you so you don't get a blood sugar that's too low.
Try to include a healthy source of carbohydrate (fruit, starchy vegetable or dairy foods) and protein in each snack. This combination will give you a little boost in energy, help stabilize blood sugar and keep you feeling satisfied.Examples of nutritious snacks include: 1/3 cup of hummus and 1 cup of raw vegetables, 1/4 cup of nuts, 1/4 cup of cottage cheese with fruit or 1 small apple and a cheese stick.
It may also be smart to keep a shelf-stable snack with you at all times in case of a low blood sugar. Most health professionals recommend either 100% fruit juice or regular soda so that you do not choke on solid foods if you were to get dizzy or pass out from a very, very low blood sugar.
Limit snacks to 200–300 calories per sitting.

, If you skip a meal, you run the risk of having your blood sugar levels drop to very low levels.This is very important if you taking medications that lower your blood sugar levels, as most people with diabetes do. In order to keep your body functioning properly, you must eat meals throughout the day while also taking your medications.Having your meal plan may help prevent you from skipping meals or being unprepared.
In addition, try to stick to the same meal schedule each day. To help your body regulate blood sugar and keep your metabolism working swiftly, you should try to stick to a meal plan in which you eat your meals and snacks at roughly the same time each day.
Similarly, you should also try to take the medications you are taking to control your diabetes at around the same time each day. Most diabetes medication is supposed to be taken with meals, so when you eat at the same time each day, you can also take your medication.

, When you have diabetes, it will be very helpful to meet with a registered dietitian that is also a CDE or Certified Diabetes Educator. These nutrition professionals will be able to guide you towards a nutritious diet that can also help manage diabetes.


The dietitian will review what type 2 diabetes is, how foods affect your condition and help you design a meal plan that will keep you healthy and fit into your lifestyle.
You may want to meet with your dietitian several times until you've gotten control of your diabetes and eating patterns.
Many insurance companies will cover the costs of some meetings with a CDE. Sometimes, meeting with a CDE is even required by insurance companies after you're diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.

, Protein is an essential part of your diet and important macronutrient to your body. It helps maintain metabolic function, support tissue growth and repair.Lean proteins are a great food to include in any type of diabetic diet. They help keep you feeling satisfied longer and when combined with carbohydrates will slow the release of sugar into your blood.There are a variety of lean protein options. These proteins are lean and do not contain any carbohydrates: poultry, eggs, lean beef, pork and seafood.
Other sources of lean protein include: low-fat dairy products, nuts, legumes and tofu. Although they do contain protein, these foods also contain carbohydrates and will raise your blood sugar slightly.Include a 3-4 oz serving of protein-based foods at each meal.You may also want to include 1-2 oz of lean protein at snacks to help control the release of glucose into your bloodstream.

, Both fruits and vegetables contain a lot of essential vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and fiber. Although some of these foods do contain carbohydrates, they are still a nutritious part of a diabetic diet.


Many diabetics wonder if they can eat fruit since it contains sugar (a carbohydrate). The answer is yes, you can and should eat some fruit most days.Stick to one serving of fruit at a time. Measure out 1/2 cup of chopped fruit or one small piece.Try to avoid fruit juices and dried fruit as these are more concentrated sources of sugar.
Fill up on as many leafy green and non-starchy vegetables as you like. These are very low in carbohydrate and will not spike your blood sugar. One serving is 1 cup or 2 cups of leafy salad greens.Starchy vegetables, like potatoes, yams, carrots, peas and corn, contain higher amounts of carbohydrates. These foods should still be included in your diet; however, following appropriate portion sizes is important. Stick to 1 cup of non-starchy vegetables per serving., Many diabetics try to stay away from grain-based foods as they contain very high amounts of carbohydrates. Although this is true, some grains can still be eaten as a part of a nutritious, balanced diet.


One of the most important things to remember when you're eating grains is to follow the appropriate portion size. Although they will raise your blood sugar, portion control helps to keep your blood sugar within more normal ranges.One serving of grains is 1 oz or 1/2 cup. For example, 1 slice of bread is about 1 oz or you may choose to half a 1/2 cup of oatmeal.Also try to choose 100% whole grains. These foods are higher in fiber and other beneficial nutrients compared to refined grains like white flour.The extra fiber will also help minimize blood sugar spikes.Whole grain foods to try include: brown rice, quinoa, 100% whole wheat pasta, oatmeal or 100% whole wheat bread.

, Although carbohydrates get most of the attention when it comes to type 2 diabetes, fats are another important component of your diet.


Healthy fats, like Omega-3 fatty acids can protect against heart disease, particularly when you have diabetes. You're at higher risk for heart disease if you have type 2 diabetes.These fats have also been shown to help to fight inflammation and improve your mood.Foods that are high in omega-3 include: flax seeds, walnuts, fatty fish like sardines and salmon, olive oil and olives, chia seeds and avocados.

, Higher fiber diets have been proven to be better for diabetics by enabling them to have more control over their blood sugar.When you have a high-fiber diet, the fiber may help slow or delay gastric emptying (the rate of food being digested). This blunts the amount of blood sugar or glucose that's released into your bloodstream.Eat a minimum of 20 to 25 grams of fiber each day to help slow down your body’s absorption of carbohydrates. You can even eat up to 38 g (especially for men).

Insoluble fiber: This kind of fiber helps with bowel movements and the rate of digestion. You can find insoluble fiber in seeds, bran, vegetables and cereals.

Soluble fiber: These foods dissolve during digestion and absorb water so they help to decrease cholesterol and control glucose levels. You can find soluble fiber in barley, legumes, and fruit.

, Adequate hydration is important for overall general health and wellness. Although it won't necessarily improve your blood sugar, drinking sugar-free low calorie fluids will help you manage your blood sugar better.Most experts recommend consuming about eight to 13 glasses of clear, sugar-free beverages everyday. The same recommendation is also appropriate for diabetics.Stick to sugar free beverages like: water, flavored water, decaf coffee, decaf tea and sugar-free sports drinks.
Skip or restrict calorie containing or sugary beverages like alcohol, regular soda, fruit juice or juice cocktails, sweetened coffee drinks or sports drinks.

, Just because you have diabetes does not necessarily mean that you need to cut sweets out of your diet entirely. The occasionally sweetened item can be apart of your diabetic diet in moderation.


Try to eat sweet foods with a meal. When you eat sweets by themselves, they can cause your blood sugar levels to spike.The key to including sweets or desserts into your diet is to eat small portions very occasionally. Larger portions of sweets will spike your blood sugar more quickly and to a higher level., Combining your new diet with cardiovascular exercise can help you to shed any excess weight and better manage your diabetes.


Exercising regularly helps to enhance your general health, lower your blood pressure and cholesterol, reduces pounds of weight, and helps to overcome your insulin resistant state so that you can get back to normal glucose tolerance levels.Health professionals recommend including at least 30 minutes of cardio five times a week for a minimum of 150 minutes of exercise each week.In addition, it's recommended to not go for more than two days without performing some type of aerobic activity.
You can include a wide variety of activities or exercises each week including: walking, swimming, hiking, dancing or cycling.

, If you have not done much exercise recently, it is best to start small and gradually increase how long you exercise for.


Begin with short periods (like 10 minutes) of exercise, and work your way up to exercising for 30 minutes for five days a week.You can also start your new exercise routine by just increasing baseline activity. These everyday lifestyle activities are things you're already doing — like household chores and walking to and from your car.
Increase your total steps and movements throughout the day to get you more active all day long.

, Strength training focuses on building up your muscles to help you burn more calories and increase your muscles’ uptake of glucose.


When you get stronger, your body uses more insulin, which in turn can help to manage your diabetes.Specifically, it helps lower your hemoglobin A1c.It's typically recommended to include two to three days of strength training each week. Try to work each major muscle group per session.Talk to a physical therapist or specialist at your gym to determine which strength training exercises would be best for you and your situation.

, Anyone with diabetes my experience a low blood sugar or hypoglycemia during or after exercise.It's important to be prepared to deal with this situation appropriately.


When you're exercising your body uses glucose and insulin more efficiently and is able to take up glucose more quickly.If you start to feel like you're having a low blood sugar, discontinue exercise and treat yourself as your normally would.
Have a small serving of a carbohydrate like a sports drink, regular soda or 100% fruit juice. Wait 15-20 minutes and check your blood sugar again to see if it's normalized.

, Regardless of what health condition you have, following up regularly with your doctor is very important.


Diabetes requires regular follow up and check-ins with either your primary care physician or your endocrinologist. Always talk to them prior to making any changes to your diet or exercise program.
If you notice your blood sugar levels are changing (due to diet or exercise changes), be sure to call your doctor and inform them of what's going on. They may change your medications or tell you to discontinue what you've been doing.

, In order to check how your body is reacting to specific foods that you eat, doctors generally recommend that you check your blood sugar levels before and after you eat.Do this regularly to get an idea of how your body responds to foods and medications.


It might be wise to start a blood sugar log or journal to keep track of how your numbers look each day. This can also help guide your physician when they are prescribing a medication or making changes to your dosages.
If you notice that a certain food has caused your blood sugar levels to go above the normal range, you may want to consider limiting how much you eat that specific food.

, Smoking is not only bad for your lungs, it can also damage your heart and blood vessels. Smoking combined with poorly managed diabetes can be a very dangerous mix.If you feel like you can, try quitting cold turkey or slowly tapering yourself off of cigarettes. The quicker you stop, the better.
Seek professional help if you're having difficulty quitting. Doctors may be able to give you medication or help enroll you in a smoking cessation program.

, De-stress to improve your insulin uptake. Stress and anxiety can actually increase your body’s insulin resistance.Because of this, it is important to reduce your stress levels if you are trying to reverse your diabetes. Try the following:


Light intensity exercises. Light intensity exercises like walking, are a great way to relax and de-stress.
Doing yoga can help to relax your mind and strengthen your body. It can also increase your metabolism, motion activity, muscle flexibility and mood.
Aromatherapy: Specific scents can refresh your mind and body. In particular, jasmine, lavender and peppermint are thought to be helpful when reducing stress.
Acupuncture: A specialist targets pressure spots in your body that can contain stress. The specialist uses very fine needles to relieve these pockets of stress.
Talking to a counselor or behavioral specialist.

An essential energy source, glucose is present in the bloodstream after digesting food. Insulin, normally produced by the pancreas, assists the glucose out of the blood and distributes it to the liver cells, muscles, and fat, where it is turned into usable energy for the body. There are two types of diabetes: Type 1 and Type 2. Approximately 10 percent of people with diabetes have Type 1, while Type 2 is more prevalent. In brief, the background to the types of diabetes is as follows:Type 1 diabetes: This condition involves destruction of more than 90 percent of the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas, causing the pancreas to cease making insulin or to make very little. Type 1 diabetes tends to occur prior to the age of 30 and it may involve an environmental factor, as well as a genetic predisposition.Type 2 diabetes: While the pancreas continues to produce insulin, or even higher levels of insulin, the body develops a resistance to the insulin, causing scarcity of insulin for the body's needs and blood sugar levels remain permanently too high. While this type of diabetes can occur in children and adolescents, it usually begins in people over 30 and becomes more common as people age. It tends to run in families and around 15 percent of people over 70 have diabetes Type 2.Type 2 may not show symptoms for years or even decades before being diagnosed, as health may, silently, reach a crisis event before one seeks medical attention. Pay attention to possible indicators...

Gestational diabetes develops during pregnancy. Left undiagnosed and/or untreated, serious side effects can injure the mother and affect the unborn child. Having gestational diabetes, that resolves after delivery, increases your chances of developing Type 2 Diabetes in some point of your life and getting gestational diabetes in a next pregnancy. It also increases the chances of getting cardiovascular diseases after 15 to 20 years from 1.5 to 7.8 times!
Diabetes due to surgery, drugs, malnutrition, infections, and other illnesses, hereditary disorders that may lead to diabetes (such as cystic fibrosis), may all account for 1 percent to 2 percent of the diagnosed cases of diabetes.Diabetes insipidus is not related to blood sugar levels.It is a relatively rare disease and is not covered in this article.

, Your IBW is obtained from standard height and weight charts, which are different for men and women. However, you can get a rough estimate in kilograms by subtracting 100 from your height in centimeters.


For example, if you are 5'10 (approximately 179 centimeters), your ideal body weight is 179 minus 100, or 79 kilograms.;
, Your BMI denotes whether you are obese, normal, or underweight. You can determine your BMI by dividing your weight in kilograms by the square value of your height in meters.


If your weight is 85 kilograms, and your height is 5'10 (1.78 meters), your BMI is 85 divided by 1.78 squared, or 26.8.
A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 indicates normal weight. A value less than 18.5 indicates that you are underweight; a value more than 24.9 indicates that you are overweight. If your BMI is over 30, you are obese.

, Your calorie factor is a measure of how many calories you should consume per kilogram of body weight. It is calculated considering your level of activity and current BMI.


For obese people, the CF is 20-25 for a sedentary worker, 25-30 for a moderately active worker, and 30-35 for a heavy worker.
For people in a normal weight range, the CF is 30 for a sedentary worker, 35 for a moderately active worker, and 40 for a heavy worker.
For underweight people, the CF is 35 for a sedentary worker, 40 for a moderately active worker, and 45 for a heavy worker.

, Once you've done all of these calculations, you can determine how many calories you should be consuming each day under normal circumstances. To figure this out, multiply your ideal body weight by your calorie factor.


For example, if your IBW is 80 kilograms, and your CF is 25 (you are obese and moderately active), you would multiply 80 by 25 to get 2000. You should aim to consume 2000 calories per day.

, Your total daily food intake should be distributed uniformly throughout the day, especially where carbohydrates are concerned. This is because your body can control a steady glucose level much more efficiently than a fluctuating glucose level.


Aim to eat six times a day. Have three major meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) and three snacks (mid-morning, mid-afternoon, and bedtime). If you are obese, it may be better to skip the snacks. Talk to a doctor or nutritionist.
Try to eat consistently from day to day. If you eat on time, your body will become ready to handle the intake at a particular time every day.

, When you are trying to avoid diabetes, it helps to be mindful about where you spend your calories. In general:


50-60% of your total calories should come from carbohydrates, which are the most available and convenient source of energy. In other words, if you eat 2000 calories a day, 1000-1200 of them should come from carbohydrates.
10-20% of your total calories should come from protein, which is required to build muscle and other body tissues and breaks down to provide energy only when carbohydrates and fats are depleted. If you eat 2000 calories a day, 200-400 of them should come from protein sources.
30% of your total calories should come from fat, which is the most energy dense substance we consume. On a 2000-calorie diet, then, about 600 of them should come from fat.

, Eating foods that contain high amounts of sugar and fat can cause your cholesterol and fat deposit levels to get higher. When this happens, your chances of developing type 2 diabetes increases. This is because fats and cholesterol affect insulin action, which can lead to insulin resistance, which is when your body produces insulin but can’t use it effectively.Avoid foods like:


Processed meats like hot dogs, sausages, and salami.
Fried foods and fast food.
Commercialized juices from concentrate.
Commercially-baked cakes, cookies, and crackers.

, Some drinks have very high sugar levels that can lead to weight gain. Being overweight is one of the risk factors that can lead to developing diabetes.Because of this, you should try to avoid drinks like:


Sodas.
Commercialized fruit juices.
Sweetened iced teas.
Sports drinks.
Energy drinks.

, ‘White’ products are grain products that are made with wheat berry flour. Wheat berries are made up of three parts: the bran (the outer layer of the wheat), germ (the inner layers of the wheat) and endosperm (the starchy part of the wheat berry).White breads and pasta are only made with the endosperm, while whole grain (or whole wheat) breads and pastas use all three parts of the wheat berry, making them more nutritional. White bread can cause your sugar levels to spike.


White products: White bread, regular pasta, and white rice.
Whole grain products: Whole grain pasta, brown rice, whole wheat bread, and oatmeal., Protein should be taken during your main meals -- breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Animal proteins like eggs, meat, milk, and fish are first-class proteins that provide essential amino acids. Aim to get at least 2 or 3 servings a day.


Plant proteins are considered ""second-class"" proteins. Individually, they do not provide all of the essential amino acids. However, when they are combined, the quality improves. Examples include dry beans, cereals, and nuts. These protein sources are lower in fat than animal proteins, but you should avoid them if you have chronic kidney disease.

, Sugar found in fresh fruits and vegetables is a natural sugar that is easily absorbed and processed by your body. Both fruits and veggies have enzymes that can increase your metabolism and insulin production. You should try to eat 5 to 13 servings of fruits and vegetables each day (which equals 2 ½ to 6 ½ cups each day).Low sugar vegetables include Broccoli, asparagus, kale, spinach, Brussels sprouts, and cabbage.
Low sugar fruits include berries, peaches, plums, apples, and pears.

, Fiber-rich foods are easily digested because they go through your digestive system in small amounts and do not cause your blood sugar levels to increase. You should try to eat at least 5 grams (0.18 oz) of fiber a day. You can take a supplement if you do not eat enough fiber each day. Fiber is mostly found in complex carbohydrates like:


Brown rice.
Oats.
Soy products.
Whole grain products.

, Excessive fat consumption can lead to obesity, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular disease, and too much fatty tissue impairs the ability of insulin to exert its action. However, fat is essential to your diet. For the best results, reduce your intake of saturated fats, which increase LDL cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood, placing you at increased risk of diabetes. Replace these with healthier fats.


Foods to avoid because of high levels of saturated and trans fats include fried and processed foods, butter, margarine, cakes, dark chocolates, dairy products, ice cream, chips, sausages, cheese, and lard.
Any fat that is solid at room temperature is probably saturated. As such, trim any visible fat from your meat.
Instead, choose poultry, fish, olive oil, soybean oil, corn oil, sunflower oil, avocado, walnuts, and other nuts. These fats increase your HDL cholesterol, which is good for your overall health. They scavenge bad cholesterol from peripheral tissues of the body to be used in the liver.
Instead of frying, boil, roast, bake, or stew. Frying converts good cholesterols into bad ones (unsaturated to saturated).

, Eating more omega-3 fatty acids can help reduce insulin resistance (a condition wherein the body is able to produce insulin but it is not use effectively), thereby reducing your chances of developing type 2 diabetes. If healthy omega-3 fats are deposited in the cells layers, insulin will easily attach to them and help your body use energy well.Omega 3 fatty acids include:


Fish like salmon and sardines.
Flaxseeds.
Olive oil.
Soy beans, navy beans, or kidney beans.
Walnuts.
Winter squash.

, Alcohol is bad for almost every organ in your body, including your heart and liver. It also carries a risk of delayed hypoglycemia (low blood glucose) in people who take insulin or oral secretagogues. Alcohol is toxic to the pancreas, which secrete insulin; in fact, excessive alcohol intake is the primary cause of chronic pancreatitis in many patients. Chronic pancreatitis is associated with diabetes because insulin secreting cells get damaged in the inflammation process.


If you drink, limit alcohol intake to one drink per day if you are female and two drinks per day if you are male. One drink equals 15 grams of ethanol. Note than ethanol concentration varies in different drinks. For example: beer, 4%; wine, 9-16%; sake, 15%; liqueur, 15-55%; vodka, 35-50%; rum, 37-80%; gin, 40-50%; whiskey, 40-60%.

, Some salt is necessary to maintain the electrolyte balance in your body, but excess salt is bad for your heath, causing water retention and aggravating hypertension. Although there is no direct relationship between diabetes and salt intake, avoiding salt will decrease the likelihood that you develop hypertension and lower your risk of heart attack, stroke, eye disease, and kidney disease.


Limit your salt intake to less than 6 grams per day. If you already have hypertension, kidney disease, or liver disease, your doctor may recommend that you limit your intake even further.

, It's important to preserve the pleasure of eating, even when you are trying to avoid diabetes. You should not and need not sacrifice the taste of food to develop a healthier diet. Don't begin with dramatic changes; this may lead to a loss of appetite or make it impossible for you to stick to your new program.


Consider contacting a dietician or nutritionist to formulate a diet plan based on your preferences. This may involve reducing certain foods and including certain other foods.

"
Make an appointment to discuss your overall health with your trusted health team.,
Follow your recommended diet with care.,
Know what is healthy to eat as a diabetic.,
Drink at least 6 to 8 cups of fluid daily.,
Include ""treats"" in your diet.,
Exercise regularly.,
Take your medications as directed.,
Keep your records updated.,
Check insulin levels (adult level is given).,
Watch for diabetic complications.,
Seek support from people who care about you and from people who know what you're going through.,
Ask your doctor about lowering your blood sugar and the need for insulin or snacks for your sleep (night or day): not eating other than light protein snack near bedtime, especially stopping non-essential nutrients 2 or 3 hours before your sleep-time, drinking only water (not alcohol, no caffeine or other stimulants) at such times, telling yourself: ""That food will be here tomorrow!"",
Sleep (on an almost empty stomach!)",How to Live a Healthy Life As a Diabetic," This is important, both so that you understand what will help you and you don't feel alone dealing with this disease. In particular:


Always seek medical advice for any questions or concerns you may have.
Do not let small things go unnoticed––even little changes can mean something significant and the sooner you bring it to the attention of your doctor, the better.
If you have not been following your recommended diet, or taking your medications as directed, you need to see your doctor.;
, Your doctor or dietitian should have given you a diet to follow; diet is key to maintaining wellness when you have diabetes. Every diabetic individual has differing needs, so it's likely that your doctor has tailored the diet suggestion to your specific needs.


If you haven't been given a recommended diet, ask for one.
Ask questions about what special needs you have and where you can source healthful options from if they're hard to obtain in your area.
Remember to drink carefully too––many commercial and homemade drinks contain sugar and other additions that may spoil a carefully followed diet if not accounted for.
A food diary can be helpful if you're struggling to stay on track. This will let you see where you have food triggers (such as emotional eating when upset or eating sugary foods when tired, etc.) and allows you to plan ahead and prevent bad eating habits.
Learn to read labels. Everyone should read nutrition labels on food but for diabetics, this is even more important.

, The American Diabetes Association recommends food that is healthy for all persons, whether diabetic or not, so it's nice to know that you are eating for health generally, not just to control the diabetes. The Association's recommended foods include:


Whole grains, beans, noodles, and starchy vegetables (including unrefined potatoes): 6 or more total servings per day. (Breads and cereals should be limited and low in sodium, avoiding white flour.)
Fruit: 2-4 servings per day
Vegetables: 3-5 servings per day
Meat, fish, and cheese: 2-3 servings per day
Milk and yogurt: 2-3 servings per day
Fats, sweets, and alcohol: Small amounts (subject to your doctor's recommendations)
Condiments should be low in sodium and free of sugar. Check the labels of foods that have been cured, pickled, corned, marinated, smoked and canned.
Keep abreast of changes in advice about food intake, as revisions do occur from time to time. Get updates in email format, talk to your doctor regularly and stay alert about nutritional discoveries for diabetics.

, While tap water is your absolute best first choice, you can also consume tea, coffee, unflavored soda/mineral waters, diet drinks, artificially sweetened drink powders, low calorie drinks, etc., unless otherwise advised by your doctor. You may need to limit the intake of milk due to its natural milk sugars––ask your doctor for advice.


Drinks to avoid or minimize completely include: sugary sports drinks (loaded with salt/sodium and sugar), sweetened soda drinks, tonic water, fruit juice, and milk (try Almond milk with only 30 calories per 8 oz (250 ml).

, Be sure to ask your health advisers about the role of treats in your diet and what sort of treats are permissible. While sugary confectionery and sugary baked items are now out, this doesn't mean the end of enjoying sweet treats. There are plenty of good diabetic cookbooks both in stores and online that you can use to recreate sugar-free treats that still taste fantastic. Many health food stores stock diabetic-suitable sweets and treats too, so start hunting around for substitutes that will still ""hit the spot"" and keep your sweet tooth satisfied.


A healthy small snack includes as much as a medium piece of fresh fruit, a small serving of yogurt, a few wholegrain crackers, small handful of nuts, or celery sticks with hummus, etc.

, Ask your doctor for the recommended amount of exercise in your case. Go for a walk with your mates, or maybe you like going to the gym. Different exercise works for different people, so experiment to find the exercise that you like most, after taking advice from your doctor.


Exercising moderately, immediately after three meals each day curbed risky blood sugar spikes all day. This works for people who do shorter/intermittent exercise on a daily basis.That study found those three short walks each day after meals were as effective reducing blood sugar within 24 hours as was a single 45-minute walk at the same moderate pace. The innovative exercise science study was conducted at the George Washington University School of Public Health and Health Services (SPHHS).
If your weight or painful joints prevent you from exercising effectively, ask your doctor about water assisted exercise, such as aqua jogging, aqua aerobics or simply walking in a pool.

, If you have been skipping doses of your medications, then you're skipping life saving help and risk complications developing. Follow your doctor's instructions for taking your medications on time and in the correct dosage.


Be aware of the possible interactions between medications and food, drink and other drug intakes. Ask your doctor for clear advice as to what is safe and not safe to combine with your medications and how to balance medication and food intake.
If you see a different doctor from your usual one, make sure he or she knows that you are diabetic and explain what medications you're taking. It is vitally important that you do not mix some medications. Your doctor needs to know everything you're taking, including vitamins and herbs.

, Your doctor gave you a record sheet to record your blood glucose levels. While it may seem like a chore, it is important to keep those records accurately and to show them to your doctor regularly.


You may also want to keep a food and exercise diary/journal. The more information you keep, the more your doctor can advise you on the best way to stay healthy and manage this disease.

, For type 2 diabetes the American Diabetes Association recommends that blood sugar targets should be individualized within safe ranges:Before meals (fasting) -- try for 70 to 130 mg/dl (3.9 to 7.3 mmol/L)
After meals (1 to 2 hours after eating) -- try for less than 180 mg/dl (10 mmol/L) for adults.
At bedtime -- try for from 90 to 150 mg/dl (5 to 8.3 mmol/L).

, Knowledge is power over fear and if you're aware of what can go wrong, you have a better chance of noticing the signs early enough to do something about them. Some of the complications that can arise when diabetic include:


Heart Disease and Stroke: People with diabetes have extra reasons to be mindful of heart and blood vessel disease. Diabetes carries an increased risk for heart attack, stroke, and complications related to poor circulation.
Kidney Disease: Diabetes can damage the kidneys, which not only can cause them to fail, but can also make them lose their ability to filter out waste products.
Eye Complications: Diabetes can cause eye problems and may lead to blindness. People with diabetes do have a higher risk of blindness than people without diabetes. Early detection and treatment of eye problems can save your sight.
Oral Health and Hygiene: Diabetes gives you a greater risk for gum disease. It's a good idea to see your dentist regularly.
Diabetic Neuropathy and Nerve Damage: One of the most common complications of diabetes is diabetic neuropathy. Neuropathy means damage to the nerves that run throughout the body, connecting the spinal cord to muscles, skin, blood vessels, and other organs.
Foot Complications: People with diabetes can develop many different foot problems. Foot problems most often happen when there is nerve damage in the feet or when blood flow is poor.
Skin Complications: As many as one-third of people with diabetes will have a skin disorder caused or affected by diabetes at some time in their lives. In fact, such problems are sometimes the first sign that a person has diabetes. Luckily, most skin conditions can be prevented or easily treated if caught early.
Gastroparesis and Diabetes: Gastroparesis is a disorder that affects people with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
Depression: Feeling down once in a while is normal. But some people feel a sadness that just won't go away. Life seems hopeless. Feeling this way most of the day for two weeks or more is a sign of serious depression.

, Explain your disease and how it impacts you to your loved ones and friends. They will be supportive when they understand how it affects your life. In some cases, you'll probably find that family and friends are willing to help you with exercise, food choices and doctor's visits. Beyond your close circle of friends, you can also reach out to people who have diabetes just like you, by joining a local diabetes support group and attending meet-ups. You may even make new friends but most importantly, you will get a sense of support and discover what others do to cope and lead a healthy life with diabetes.


Consider joining a larger diabetes organization too. As well as offering support, diabetes organizations are a good place to obtain information and diet plans.

,



Realize, those late-night snacks should be a no-no for people who have diabetes, per Mayo Clinic article.Hungry after dinner -- these ""free"" foods have few, if any, carbohydrates and calories, so ""one"" of them won't cause weight gain or increased blood sugar. Choose a ""free"" food, such as:A can of diet soda,
A serving of sugar-free gelatin,
Five baby carrots,
Two saltine crackers,
One vanilla wafer,
Four almonds (or similar nuts),
One piece of gum or small hard candy...



Give your nerves, liver and the digestive system time to finish work, and to rest and for general recovery, from the sugar produced by digestion when asleep;
Stop blood sugar being unnecessarily elevated during sleep.
Stop fats or sugars being processed all night in the liver (and allow in-digestion to clear, as well).

, -- get 6, preferably 7 or more hours of sleep for recovery time for the nerves and all other systems to settle and rest. This will lower your diabetes problems, i.e.: blood sugar levels .


If you need help sleeping, (1) try the one antihistamine to cause drowsiness that does not cause higher blood pressure (HBP), as cheap as $4 for 100 (as Equate brand 'Chlortabs'): it is chlorpheniramine maleate -- also sold as 'Chlortrimeton' and as 'Corcidin-HBP'. (Do not use any sugary antihistamine syrups.) (2) Taking Valerian as a highly relaxant herb -- helps with sleep and is especially known to reduce body aches and pains. If you wake up too early, drink water and take another dose of both, if four hours or more have passed since the first dose. (3) Take calcium with magnesium and vitamin D3 and B-vitamins, omega3, omega3-6-9 which all work together, causing much improved relaxation and many other healthful benefits! (4) A ""small serving of protein food"" helps sleep -- such as plain turkey or chicken, and do eat almonds (have more fiber!), walnuts, pecans, sunflower and pumpkin seeds, pistachios, red peanuts with skins-on (also, those kinds of seeds and all nuts have essential oils!).

Look for stomach troubles.,
Notice feelings of hunger.,
Monitor for feelings of nervousness.,
Check for cold, wet, or clammy skin.,
Monitor for a rapid heart rate.",How to Spot Low Blood Sugar Warning Signs1," If you have low blood sugar, you might experience a loss of appetite or nausea.Nausea is a feeling of queasiness or an upset stomach. In serious but rare cases, you might actually vomit due to your nausea., Hunger is always partially a result of having low blood sugar. The lower your blood sugar, the hungrier you will feel. Mild hypoglycemia may in fact cause feelings of extreme hunger.If this is your only warning sign of low blood sugar, you can probably remedy the situation by grabbing a snack like a banana.

, If you feel nervous or jittery, you could have low blood sugar. Look for involuntary motions like a bouncing leg when seated, a need to pace back and forth, or a racing heart to detect feelings of nervousness.More extreme jitters or bodily trembling might also occur.

, Sweaty or clammy skin might indicate hypoglycemia. To spot cold, wet, or clammy skin, lay your hands on your skin. Alternately, look for a pallor or sheen of sweat.If you have nocturnal hypoglycemia – that is, low blood sugar while sleeping – you might wake up sweaty in the morning or in the middle of the night.

, A racing heart (tachycardia) could indicate low blood sugar. Heart palpitations (any irregular heartbeat, such as pauses, skipping a beat, or rapid heartbeat) may occur briefly.Tachycardia describes a racing heart and is common in cases of mild hypoglycemia.The best way to diagnose heart palpitations or other irregularities is by getting evaluated by a doctor. If palpitations occur regularly there may be an underlying issue other than hypoglycemia, so it's important to get this checked.
You could also discern heart palpitations by staying conscious of your body’s feedback mechanisms. A racing heart might manifest, for instance, as a beating in your chest.
Tachycardia often has no symptoms."
"
Look for mood changes.,
Check for cognitive difficulties.,
Look for headaches.,
Look for weakness.,
Look for a lack of coordination.",How to Spot Low Blood Sugar Warning Signs2," Mood changes could take many forms. Any shift away from your normal level of anxiety, anger, restlessness, or irritability could be a sign of low blood sugar.If you feel a sudden change in your mood without an easily identifiable cause, it could be due to low blood sugar.If you or the person you’re evaluating for low blood sugar is normally irritable, anxious, and short-tempered, looking for changes in their mood will not be an ineffective mode of identifying low blood sugar warning signs.

, Cognitive difficulties refer to a suite of mental problems, including confusion, attention problems, and a general inability to think clearly.If you or someone you’re evaluating demonstrates difficulty staying mentally focused in a sustained way, they might have low blood sugar., These headaches could occur in your temples, on top of your head, or at the back of your head. When related to low blood sugar, they might be accompanied by dizziness or blurred vision.If you have nocturnal hypoglycemia — that is, low blood sugar while sleeping — you might experience headaches in the morning when you wake., A feeling of fatigue and tiredness often accompanies low blood sugar. If you need to lie down, sit down, or relax due to low energy levels, you might have low blood sugar.Nocturnal hypoglycemia is also often accompanied by waking up tired, rather than refreshed, as you should after getting a full night’s rest.

, As your blood sugar level crashes, you will lose the ability to control your motor functions. Speech will become slurred and you might become clumsy and stagger about, unable to walk properly."
"
Look for seizures.,
Check for a loss of consciousness.,
Check for low body temperature.",How to Spot Low Blood Sugar Warning Signs3," Seizures or convulsions occur when your blood sugar gets excessively low. If you have seizures, get medical attention immediately, as this is a serious low blood sugar warning sign. Common indications that you’re having a seizure include:Uncontrollable head and eye movement
Sweating and anxiety
Unusual body posturing
Difficulty speaking

, If you faint or even just feel drowsy, it could be due to low blood sugar.And in extreme cases, you might slip into a coma — a prolonged period of unconsciousness from which it can be difficult to awaken.You can identify a loss of consciousness by suddenly waking up on the floor or in another unusual position that you can’t remember putting yourself in.
If a diabetic has lost consciousness, inject them with glucagon (a hormone used to raise blood sugar levels) if you know how. Call emergency services immediately.Do not attempt to give an unconscious person food or drink.
Alternately, call an ambulance if you do not have glucagon, if you do not know how to inject glucagon, or if the injection has proven ineffective after 10 minutes.

, If possible, take your temperature to spot one of the extreme low blood sugar warning signs. If your temperature is below 95°F (35°C), you will go into hypothermia, a condition characterized by shivering, then abnormal organ function. Seek medical attention immediately if you have hypothermia."
"
Eat regularly.,
Eat before and after workouts.,
Check your blood sugar.,
Treat low blood sugar promptly.,
Let your family know of your condition.",How to Spot Low Blood Sugar Warning Signs4," You should eat three meals per day — one when you wake, another towards the middle of the day, and another in the mid-to-late evening. Missing a meal or consuming fewer carbs than your body requires could cause your blood sugar to crash.If you miss a meal or cannot eat a meal, grab a snack like popcorn, trail mix, or a banana.

, Exercise takes a lot of energy, and your blood sugar typically declines after an intense workout. Consume a source of carbs within three hours of your workout, but not within the hour prior to your planned workout. After you’re done working out, have a source of protein and carbs (a protein smoothie, for instance) within 20 minutes to prevent low blood sugar., If you have diabetes, check your blood sugar regularly, as directed by your doctor. You can do this using a blood sugar monitoring device. If you do not have a blood sugar monitoring device, consult your doctor for a recommendation regarding the most reliable such device available.Follow manufacturer directions to use the blood sugar monitoring device.

, When you notice signs of low blood sugar, it is important to address it as quickly as possible. You should consume about 15 grams of glucose or simple carbohydrates. Wait 15 minutes, then check your blood sugar again. If you are still hypoglycemic, eat another 15 grams. If your next meal is more than an hour or two away, eat a small snack once your blood sugar has returned to normal. Try the following sources of simple carbohydrates:4 ounces of juice or soda (not diet)
1 tablespoon sugar, honey, or corn syrup
8 ounces of nonfat or 1% milk
Glucose tablets or gel (follow package instructions).

, If your family and friends know you have diabetes, they will be able to help you spot low blood sugar warning signs. By catching your low blood sugar levels early, you could avoid more serious complications associated with low blood sugar.Wear a medical ID bracelet that identifies your condition and carry a medical ID card as well. If you are in an emergency situation and unable to communicate (such as if you fall unconscious), this information can help the emergency medical staff determine treatment."
"
Assess your risk for gestational diabetes.Gestational diabetes occurs in women who are pregnant.,
Look for the risk factors of pre-diabetes.Pre-diabetes is a metabolic condition in which blood glucose (sugar) is higher than the normal range (70-99).,
Evaluate your risk for type 2 diabetes.This is sometimes referred to a “full-blown” diabetes.,
Check for the risk factors of type 1 diabetes.Experts believe this condition is caused by a mix of genetic predisposition and environmental factors.,
Get tested for gestational diabetes during pregnancy.Women with gestational diabetes often show no symptoms at all.,
Be vigilant for symptoms of pre-diabetes.,
Evaluate your symptoms for type 2 diabetes.Whether you have the risk factors for the condition or not, you can still develop type 2 diabetes.,
Suspect type 1 diabetes with sudden symptoms.,
Seek immediate medical attention when necessary.People often ignore the symptoms of diabetes, allowing the condition to progress to a dangerous degree.,
See a doctor immediately if you experience symptoms.,
Get a blood glucose test.,
Submit to an A1C test.This blood test is also called the glycated hemoglobin test.,
Have a ketone test done if necessary.,
Request routine testing.,
Make lifestyle choices with pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes.,
Eat fewer carbohydrates.,
Eat more foods high in healthy proteins and fats (saturated fats, omega-3 and omega-9 polyunsaturated, and monounsaturated fats).,
Maintain a healthy weight.Insulin resistance goes up with an increasing waistline.,
Do not smoke.,
Do not rely on medication alone.If you have type 1, type 2, or gestational diabetes, your doctor may recommend medication in addition to lifestyle changes.,
Take oral hypoglycemic medications if you have type 2 or gestational diabetes.,
Administer insulin injections if you have type 1 diabetes.,
Ask about new treatments for diabetes.",How to Know if You Have Diabetes," If you're at higher risk, you may be tested during your first prenatal visit and then again in the second trimester. Women at low risk will be tested in the second trimester, between weeks 24 and 28. Women who experience gestational diabetes have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes within ten years after the birth of their child. Risk factors include:


Pregnancy over the age of 25
Family or personal health history of diabetes or pre-diabetes
Being overweight at the time of pregnancy (a BMI of 30 or more)
Women who are black, Hispanic, Native American, Asian, or Pacific Islander
Third pregnancy or greaterExcessive intrauterine growth during pregnancy;
, Still, it's lower than recommended for treatment with medication to control blood glucose. The risk factors for pre-diabetes include:


Age 45 or older
Being overweight
Family history of type 2 diabetes
Sedentary lifestyle
High blood pressure
A previous experience of gestational diabetes
Having delivered a baby who was 9 pounds or greater

, In this condition, the body’s cells have become resistant to the influence of leptin and insulin. This increases your blood sugar levels and causes the symptoms and long-term side effects of the disease. Risk factors for type 2 diabetes are similar to those for pre-diabetes, and include:


Over 45 years of age
Overweight
Physical inactivity
High blood pressure
History of gestational diabetes
Delivered a baby over 9 pounds
Family history of diabetes
Chronic stressYou are black, Hispanic, Native American, Asian, or Pacific Islander

,


White people have a higher incidence of type 1 diabetes
Cold weather and viruses may trigger the development of type 1 diabetes in susceptible people.
Early childhood stressChildren who were breast-fed and ate solids at a later age have a lower risk of developing type 1 diabetes even with the genetic predisposition
If you have an identical twin with type 1 diabetes, you have about a 50% chance of also developing the disease., As such, you should always request a test for it if you have the risk factors for gestational diabetes. This disease is especially dangerous because it affects both you and the baby. Because it can have long-term effects on your child, early diagnosis and treatment is important.


Some women feel very thirsty and need to urinate frequently. However, these are also common signs of any pregnancy.Some women report that they feel uneasy or uncomfortable after eating foods that are high in carbohydrates or sugar.

, Like with gestational diabetes, there are often very few symptoms of pre-diabetes. Diabetes symptoms are caused by very high blood sugar levels, which people with pre-diabetes don't have. If you have the risk factors for it, you must be vigilant, get tested regularly, and be on the lookout for subtle symptoms. Pre-diabetes can develop into diabetes if left untreated.


You may have pre-diabetes if you have ""acanthosis nigricans"" on specific areas of your body. This is simply thick, darkened patches of skin that most often appears on the armpits, neck, elbow, knees and knuckles.You might experience a feeling of uneasiness after eating a meal high in carbohydrates or sugars.
Your doctor may test for pre-diabetes if you have elevated cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, or other hormonal imbalances, such as metabolic syndrome, or if you are overweight.

, Be aware of your health condition and watch for these signs that your blood sugar may be elevated:


Unexplained weight loss.
Blurry vision or vision change
Increased thirst from high blood sugar
Increased need to urinate
Fatigue and drowsiness, even with adequate sleep
Tingling or numbness in the feet or hands
Frequent or recurring infections in the bladder, skin or mouth.
Shakiness or hunger in the middle of the morning or afternoon.
Cuts and scrapes appear to heal more slowly.Dry, itchy skin or unusual bumps or blisters.Feeling more hungry than usual.

, Although most patients develop this type of diabetes during childhood or adolescence, it can also develop well into adulthood. The symptoms of type 1 diabetes may appear suddenly or be subtly present for a long time, and can include:Excessive thirst
Increased urination
Vaginal yeast infections in women
Irritability
Blurred vision
Unexplained weight loss
Unusual bedwetting in children
Extreme hunger
Fatigue and weakness

, The symptoms of type 2 diabetes appear slowly over time. But with type 1 diabetes, your body can very suddenly stop making insulin. You will experience more severe symptoms that are potentially life-threatening unless treated immediately. These include:


Deep rapid breathing
Flushed face, dry skin and mouth
Fruity breath
Nausea and vomiting
Stomach pain
Confusion or lethargy

, Your doctor will need to perform several tests to determine if you have diabetes. If you do, in fact, have diabetes or pre-diabetes, you will need to follow-up with regular treatment by following your doctor's instructions.

, The blood glucose test does exactly what it sounds like it does: it tests the amount of glucose (sugar) in your blood.This will be used to determine whether you have diabetes or are at risk of developing it. This test will done under one of three circumstances:A fasting glucose blood test is done after you haven’t had anything to eat for at least eight hours. If it is an emergency, your doctor will do a random blood glucose test regardless of whether you have eaten recently.
A two-hour postprandial test is done two hours after eating a specific number of carbohydrates to test your body’s ability to handle the sugar load. This test is usually done in a hospital so they can measure the number of carbs eaten before the test.
An oral glucose tolerance test requires you to drink a high glucose fluid. They will test your blood and urine every 30-60 minutes to measure how well the body is able to tolerate the additional load. This test is not done if the doctor suspects type 1 diabetes.

, It measures the amount of sugar attached to the body's hemoglobin molecules. This measurement gives the doctor a good indication of your average blood sugar measurements over the past 30 to 60 days.

, Ketone is found in the blood when an insulin shortage forces the body to break down fat for energy.It comes out through the urine, most often in patients with type 1 diabetes. Your doctor may recommend a blood or urine test for ketone:If your blood sugar is higher than 240 mg/dL.
During an illness such as pneumonia, stroke or heart attack.
If you experience nausea and vomiting.
During pregnancy.

, If you have diabetes or are at risk of developing it, it's important to monitor your health and blood sugar levels regularly.High blood sugar will cause damage to the microvascular (micro-blood vessels) in your organs. This damage can cause problems throughout the body. To monitor your overall health, get:


An annual eye exam
Evaluation for diabetic neuropathy in the feet
Regular (at least annual) blood pressure monitoring
Annual kidney testing
Dental cleaning every 6 months
Regular cholesterol testing
Regular visits with your primary care doctor or endocrinologist

, These conditions often develop because of the choices we make, rather than our genetics. By changing those choices, you can reduce your blood sugar or prevent the development of the condition.

, When your body metabolizes carbs they turn to sugar, and the body needs more insulin to use it. Cut down on grains, pastas, candies, sweets, soda and other foods that are high in simple carbohydrates, as your body processes these too quickly and they can cause a spike in blood sugar.Talk to your doctor or a registered dietitian about incorporating complex carbohydrates with plenty of fiber and a low-GI (glycemic index) rating into your diet. Low-GI, complex carbs include:Beans and legumes
Non-starchy vegetables (most vegetables, except foods like parsnips, plantains, potatoes, pumpkin, squash, peas, corn)Most fruits (except for certain fruits such as dried fruits, bananas, and grapes)Whole grains, such as steel cut oats, bran, whole-grain pasta, barley, bulgur, brown rice, quinoaDon't limit your fiber. Instead, subtract it off the total carbohydrates (per serving size) on the Nutrition label. Fiber is not digestedand actually prevents blood sugar spikes, resulting in better control of blood sugar levels., Although once thought to be the source of heart disease, the healthy fats found in avocados, coconut oil, grass-fed beef and free-range chickens are now known to be good sources of fuel. They can help to stabilize blood sugar and reduce your food cravings.Always avoid trans-fats, as these are the bad fats.The omega-3 fatty acids found in cold water fish such as tuna and salmon may decrease your risk of type 2 diabetes.Eat one to two servings of fish per week., When you can maintain a more healthy weight you can stabilize your blood sugar more easily. A combination of diet and exercise will help keep your weight in a healthy range. Get at least 30 minutes of exercise a day to help your body to use blood glucose without insulin. This also helps you maintain a healthy weight and improves your quality of sleep.

, If you currently smoke, quit. Smokers are 30 – 40% more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than people who don't smoke, and your risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases the more you smoke. Smoking also creates serious complications for people who already have diabetes., However, you cannot rely on medication alone to manage the disease. It must be used to support the major changes caused by your lifestyle changes.

, These medications are taken in pill form, and reduce blood sugar throughout the course of the day. Examples include Metformin (biguanides), sulfonylureas, Meglitinides, Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors and combination pills., This is really the only effective treatment for type 1, though it can also be used for type 2 and gestational diabetes. There are four different types of insulin available for this treatment. Your physician will decide which will be most effective in controlling your blood sugar. You may take just one, or use a combination of types at different times of the day.Your doctor may also recommend an insulin pump to maintain your insulin levels 24 hours a day.Rapid acting insulin is taken before meals, and often in combination with long acting insulin.
Short acting insulin is taken about 30 minutes before meals, and usually in combination with longer acting insulin.
Intermediate acting insulin is usually taken twice a day, and lowers glucose when the short or rapid acting insulin stops working.
Long acting insulin can be used to cover the time when the rapid and short acting insulin stops working.

, There are some new medications that can help lower blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes. One type of medicine, called an SGLT inhibitor, helps your kidneys get rid of extra glucose from the blood and send it out in your urine. Examples of SGLT inhibitors include Canagliflozin (Invokana) and Dapagliflozin (Farxiga).Ask your doctor if these drugs are right for you.

Use a dry brush before you shower.,
Shave with moisturizing shaving cream.,
Use a super intensive moisturizing lotion.,
Take a multivitamin.,
Always protect your skin with sunscreen and/or layered clothing when you go outside.

",How to Reduce Keratosis Pilaris," Brush the affected area(s) with upward strokes (toward yourself) in order to exfoliate dead skin. This also helps your body get rid of toxins and leaves your skin feeling smoother and softer overall.;
, Razors with moisturizing strips are also very effective for this purpose—the more you saturate your skin, the easier it will be to unblock the follicles.


If you don't like shaving, you can wax, but be careful because waxing tends to be a harsher process than shaving.

, Put it on your problem areas as soon as you get out of the shower. In terms of brands, Nivea, Renew Intensive Skin Therapy, and Aveeno lotions are best for easily irritated skin.

, This will help you get all the vitamins you need, which could be part of your problem.

Use a cold compress to bring down swelling.,
Rest and elevate the bruised body part.,
Try arnica.,
Take medication to relieve pain.,
Apply a warm compress to promote healing.,
Use home remedies.,
Remember RICE.",How to Reduce Bruising1," Apply a cold compress when an accident occurs. This will help to bring down any swelling, minimize discoloration, and help with pain. The dark color of bruises is caused by blood leaking out of burst blood vessels. Applying a cold compress helps to constrict the blood vessel and minimize the amount of blood that leaks out, which reduces discoloration.To make a cold compress, use an ice pack, a couple of ice cubes wrapped in a towel or rag, or even a bag of frozen vegetables wrapped in a clean towel. Do not apply the cold compress directly to your skin; you should always wrap it in a towel or cloth to protect your skin from damage. Hold the compress against the bruised area for 10 minutes, then give your skin a break for 20 minutes before reapplying. Do this several times a day, up to 60 minutes of cold compress application daily.;
, As soon after your injury as possible, take a seat and try to elevate the bruised body part above heart level. Elevating the injured body part helps to reduce blood flow to the bruise, which minimizes discoloration.


If the bruise is on your leg, try propping it up on the back of a chair or rest it on a stack of pillows. If the bruise is on your arm, try resting it on an arm rest or the back of the sofa., Arnica is a plant belonging to the sunflower family whose extract is used to reduce the inflammation and swelling associated with bruises and sprains. There is some evidencethat it may help reduce the appearance of bruising, however the evidence is inconclusive.Arnica is available in gel, ointment, and cream form at most health food stores. Just rub a little on the bruise according to the instructions on the packaging.
It is also available in pill form, which can be taken by mouth daily to help with bruising., Severe bruising can be painful, especially when the bruise is fresh. You can relieve the pain and tenderness by taking certain pain medications, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or NSAIDs, which can help with swelling.Be aware, however, that NSAIDs like Motrin can actually cause you to bruise easily.


Although ibuprofen-based pain medications can thin the blood and cause an increased flow of blood to the bruise, they can be taken as well. However, if you have other issues such as stomach ulcers, heart disease, or are on blood thinning medication, do not take NSAIDs without talking to your doctor., After the initial swelling has gone down, which should be 48 to 72 hours after the injury, you can switch from cold compresses to warm compresses. Warm compresses increase blood flow to the area, which helps to clear away any pooled blood and promote healing.To make a warm compress, you can use a heating pad, a hot water bottle, or a clean washcloth soaked in warm water. Use the warm compress for 20 minutes, two to three times a day. Make sure the hot water bottle isn’t too hot. You don’t want to burn your skin.

, There are many home remedies which claim to reduce the appearance of bruises, however not all are proven to be effective. Although there is no scientific evidence this is effective, topical vitamin K has been studied in relation to bruising, and the application of crushed, leafy greens (such as kale or parsley) may reduce your bruise. Since these greens have a high content of vitamin K, they may be effective. Blend up a handful of parsley leaves (or kale, etc.) with witch hazel and apply the mixture to the bruised skin. The parsley is believed to reduce inflammation and discoloration.While it may not help in the moment, consuming vitamin K, rather than applying it to your bruise, can help reduce future bruising.
There is insufficient evidence for St. John’s wort oil, but it has been used for bruises and inflammation. Rub a little St. John's wort oil directly onto the bruise several times a day.You can use a net bag or nylon sticking to hold the parsley before you dip it in the witch hazel. This can make the process less messy.

, Although some of these methods have been outlined, there is a great acronym to help you to remember what to do to reduce bruising. The acronym RICE stands for Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation. Here is how each one should be followed:


Rest: Rest your injured body part for at least one to two days.
Ice: Apply a cold ice pack to help with pain and inflammation. Apply an ice pack to the area 10 to 20 minutes at a time.
Compression: Compression can help limit swelling. Tie an elastic bandage or clothing to the injured area.
Elevation: Elevation can help reduce swelling using gravity. Try keeping the injured limb above the level of your heart.

Adjust your diet.,
Monitor children to be sure they are playing safely.,
Stay out of the sun for extended periods of time.",How to Reduce Bruising2," Eating a healthy diet rich in vitamins and minerals will help your body to heal itself faster and prevent bruising in the first place. In particular, vitamins C and K are important for preventing bruises.Vitamin C lessens bruising by strengthening capillary walls, making them less likely to leak blood when bumped or knocked against. Severe deficiency of vitamin C (scurvy) can result in bruising. It often occurs in the chronically institutionalized, severely malnourished, and alcoholics. Good sources of vitamin C include citrus fruits, strawberries, pepper, and multivitamin tablets.Vitamin K promotes blood clotting, which helps bruises to heal faster. People with low levels of vitamin K have a higher rate of bruising. People with a vitamin K deficiency may have a bacterial overgrowth of the intestines, celiac disease, chronic pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, or abuse alcohol. Good sources of vitamin K include broccoli, spinach, cabbage, and Brussels sprouts., Children often fall, have bicycle wrecks, hit each other, run into objects, and have accidents that cause a bump to the skin. With children, the best way to reduce bruising is to prevent them from playing too roughly.


Always check your child's protective gear. Make sure it fits and is comfortable so it can protect them from bruises in sports or during outdoor activities.
Put foam pads on sharp edges of counters and coffee tables. You can remove the tables when your child is playing, if possible.
Make sure your child wears shoes to protect their feet. High cut sneakers provide ankle support to prevent bruises on their feet.

, Sun damage to the skin can cause bruising to occur more easily. This is especially true for older people, whose skin is naturally thinner and therefore more prone to damage and bruising. This makes it important to always wear sunscreen, especially on the face, and to wear hats and long-sleeved t-shirts to minimize sun exposure.


Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants whenever possible, which provides an extra layer of protection and padding for the skin when you receive a bump or a knock or protection from the sun."

Learn about bruises.,
Understand medicine-triggered bruising.,
Know when to contact a doctor.",How to Reduce Bruising3," A bruise is a mark on your skin caused by injury to small blood vessels under the skin. When the skin is not broken and the small vessels leaks blood, it creates a bruise. Bruises are usually painful, tender, and swollen. In addition, there are different types of bruises, those that occur on the skin, to muscles, and on bones. Skin bruises are very common while bone bruises are the most serious.Bruises can last weeks to months and change color as they heal starting as red, purple/blue then yellow.
If there is family history of bruising then, then your doctor may look for a hereditary clotting factor deficiency.

, There are some medications that can cause you to bruise easier. These medications cause the blood to thin, which makes any little bump to the skin produce a bruise. In addition, blood thinners can cause easy bruising. Unexplained bruising while on a blood thinner may be a serious sign that your dosage is too high. Your doctor may be able to adjust your medication or offer some advice on how to reduce the bruising.


Blood thinners such as Coumadin, Xarelto, aspirin, Warfarin, Heparin, or Pradaxa may cause you to bruise easier than typical for you. While on these medications, bruises may also look worse than before. This is because bruising need blood to clot as it leaks from the broken vessels. Blood thinners prevents clotting and makes it take longer for the blood to start leaking.
Other medication such as NSAIDS, corticosteroids, and antineoplastics can lead to platelet dysfunction and easy bruising.
Nutritional supplements such as Vitamin E, Fish Oil, Garlic, and Gingko have been connected to easy bruising.
Use any of the methods suggested even while on these medications, but talk to your doctor if any bruise spreads or if there is significant swelling or pain., Although most bruises will heal by themselves and will disappear within a couple of weeks, in some cases bruising can be a symptom of a more serious injury or condition. These can range from blood clotting issues to a number of diseases. Therefore, you should consult your doctor if:


The bruise is extremely painful and surrounded by swollen skin.
Bruises appear suddenly or unexpectedly, for no apparent reason.
You are currently taking blood-thinning medication.
You are unable to move a joint near the location of the bruise. This may be an indication of a broken bone.
You have continued, significant bruising, such as five or more spots without significant trauma.
Personal or family history of abnormal bleeding.
The bruise is located on the skull or face.
You have abnormal bleeding other places, such as nose, gums, or in excrement. Vomit that resembles coffee grounds or black, tarry stools can also indicate GI bleeding."

Treat low sugar quickly.,
Check your blood sugar.,
Make adjustments for the heat.,
Avoid exercise when blood sugar and ketones are irregular.,
Know target blood sugar levels.,
Learn how to adjust your insulin.,
Check your urine.",How to Avoid Diabetic Emergencies1," If you are experiencing hypoglycemia, you should treat it quickly before it turns into something more serious. You should always have fast acting glucose items around in case of an emergency. These are foods or drinks that will quickly raise your blood sugar.You can take glucose tablets.
Drink five to six ounces of a soda, lemonade, or fruit juice with sugar in it
Take four or five teaspoons of sugar
Check your blood sugar levels 15 minutes after you eat or drink the sugar item. If your levels are not normal, take another sugar item. If they are normal, eat a carbohydrate food, such as a slice of bread, a large apple, medium banana, or a granola bar.;
, One way to prevent diabetic emergencies is to keep up with your blood sugar levels. This helps you know where your blood sugar is and if there are any problems, like elevated or sudden changes in levels.You should check your levels before and after you eat, when you wake up, and before you go to bed.
Discuss with your doctor if there are any other times you should check your blood sugar throughout the day.
Checking your blood sugar levels can help you prevent low blood sugar or high blood sugar emergencies.

, Your body uses insulin differently in the heat. This means your normal amount of food, drink, or insulin may not be enough. Check your blood sugar often when you are in a hotter environment to make sure your blood sugar is not dropping or climbing.You may need to take a different dosage of insulin, drink more, or eat more or less in the heat.

, Exercise is an important part of managing diabetes. However, there are times you should not exercise because it can cause more harm than good. If your glucose levels are higher than a certain point, usually 250 mg/dL, and you have ketones in your urine, you should not exercise.If you exercise without following doctor’s orders, you may end up with a low blood sugar emergency. Exercise may cause your blood sugar to dip significantly. Always follow your doctor’s orders when exercising.If this occurs, you should consider contacting your doctor.

, Another way to avoid any emergencies is to know where your blood sugar levels should be. Talk to your doctor about the range where your blood sugar is normal, and what levels move into dangerous territory because they are too high.When you know your range, you can pay closer attention to your blood sugar if it gets too close to the high or low end so you can avoid letting it go over and causing an emergency.
High blood sugar emergencies usually happen over a few hours or days. Knowing your target range can help you monitor whether or not the levels are creeping towards too high., You may need to adjust the amount of insulin you take based on various factors. You should discuss with your doctor how much insulin to take depending on your activity level, your blood sugar level, the food you eat, if you are sick, or anything else.Knowing how much insulin to give yourself in certain situations can help you avoid giving yourself too much or too little and causing problems.

, If you have take insulin or have problems with diabetic ketoacidosis, you can prevent emergencies from occurring by checking your urine. You can buy urine tests at the drugstore that test for the amount of ketones in your urine. Monitoring your ketones can help you avoid getting too many in your blood."

Commit to a healthier lifestyle.,
Follow your treatment plan.,
Wear diabetes identification jewelry.,
Stay hydrated.",How to Avoid Diabetic Emergencies2," One of the best ways to avoid diabetic emergencies is to commit to a healthier lifestyle and managing your diabetes. This includes eating healthy foods that are approved by your doctor or dietician and staying away from foods that cause blood sugars to spike. You should also make exercise a daily routine.Avoid foods and drinks with sugar or refined and simple carbs. This includes junk food, such as snack cakes, ice cream, crackers, chips, white pasta, white bread, and similar items.
Talk to your doctor about adopting an exercise program right for you. Good ideas for exercise include walking, yoga or Tai Chi, dancing, gardening, and riding a stationary bike.

, One reason why people end up with a diabetic emergency is because they are not following their treatment plan. You should follow your treatment plan as outlined by your doctor. This includes taking any medication and insulin as directed, and following dietary guidelines.Check your blood sugar if you have gotten off your treatment plan for any reason. Getting off your normal routine can cause blood sugar problems.

, One way to help avoid emergencies is to wear a diabetes identification item. This may be a bracelet, necklace, or other item on your body. This lets people know that you have diabetes in case your symptoms have made it so that you cannot speak.You can buy medical alert items on the internet or in a pharmacy.

, Staying hydrated is extremely important when you have diabetes. If you are experiencing high blood sugar, you can easily get dehydrated because your body is making more urine. Another problem that can arise with diabetes is diabetic ketoacidosis. Drinking plenty of water can help prevent dehydration and flush harmful ketones from your body.Diabetic ketoacidosis occurs when the levels of ketones in your blood is too high. Ketones occur when you don’t have enough insulin in your blood. The extra ketones in your blood can act as a poison.When you are in a hot environment, you may get dehydrated more quickly. Make sure that if you are out in the heat or in a hotter environment that you drink plenty of water.Drink at least six to eight eight-ounce glasses of water each day.
Avoid drinks with a lot of sugar, such as sodas and fruit juices, along with caffeinated beverages and alcohol.

Recognize sores, particularly in the face of a child, as a possible manifestation of impetigo.,
Check skin where hair grows for the signs of infection in hair follicles.,
Check the genital and underarm area for hidradenitis suppurativa.,
Look out for redness and swelling in the face and scalp, accompanied (possibly) by fever and acute inflammation.,
Consider cellulitis as the cause, if examining someone who has recently been wounded.,
Look for necrosis and fascia, especially in the extremities.,
Consider anthrax as a potential cause if you notice necrotizing skin with hemorrhage and acute inflammation of the affected skin.,
Recognize the symptoms of leprosy.",How to Recognize Skin Bacterial Infections1," It is a bacterial infection which is caused by the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. This disease occurs primarily in children usually appears on the face, but it can be experienced by adults and appear in other areas of the body. It can spread to other sites of the body by scratching. This disease in contagious and is transmitted from person to person by skin contact. Impetigo has a fairly distinct look, comprised of red sores that have a ""honey-colored crust"" on top of them.;
, Infection of hair follicles can occur with the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus causing folliculitis. It can occur wherever in the body where there is hair. It produces acute inflammation with pain and swelling and edema of the skin. Furuncle and carbuncle are two types of infection that afflict the hair follicles. Furuncle is more superficial while carbuncle occurs in the subcutaneous layer of the skin. Carbuncle is common among diabetic patients and can predispose to infection of the blood or bacteremia. , This is an infection of the apocrine skin glands. These glands are characterized by their sweat secretion.This infection can resemble folliculitis, but its cause is unknown. See a dermatologist if treatment for presumed folliculitis does not work, as perhaps you have hidradenitis instead. Hidradenitis is much less common than folliculitis.

, Erysipelas is commonly caused by the bacterium Streptococcus.


The sites of infection are usually the face and scalp. It differs from furuncle and carbuncle in that it is an infection on the dermal layer of the skin. The rash is firm, raised, warm, and red, with distinct borders. In addition, there are systemic symptoms such as fever and acute inflammation. , Cellulitis is a general term for any bacterial infection that goes deep into the dermis or second major layer of skin. It is usually caused as a complication of more superficial skin wounds or infections. Many, many bacteria can trigger cellulitis, including strep and staph. There is inflammation of the affected area with redness and heat on the skin. It is important to treat cellulitis while it is still confined to the skin in order to avoid the very serious complication of bacteremia, or the bacteria getting into the bloodstream.

, Necrotizing fasciitis is a deeper infection of fascia, which are connective tissue layers in the body. Necrotizing fasciitis can be very serious because in this disease the bacteria travel quickly along the fascia and can cause rapid necrosis (death) of tissue. This is an uncommon disorder. The usual site of infection is the extremities and abdominal wall. This infection is usually caused by anaerobic bacteria..

, Anthrax is another very rare disease that is caused by the bacteria Bacillus anthracis. It is a spore forming gram positive bacteria that is usually found in farm animals. There are two forms — one travels via the air and infects the lungs; this is the bio-terror weapon you hear about. The same bacteria can also just cause a skin infection which can be bad but isn't necessarily deadly.

, There are two types of leprosy. These are called: tuberculoid leprosy and lepromatous leprosy. Leprosy is a common disorder in the tropical regions and is caused by Mycobacterium leprae. Tuberculoid leprosy occurs in patients who have hypersensitive T-cells which are triggered by the bacteria to attack their own skin. You will notice skin lesions which don't heal and appear lighter than your normal skin color. These areas will be less sensitive to touch, temperature, and pain.Lepromatous leprosy occurs in people with low level of activity of their immune system. In this condition, the bacteria infect the skin as well as the blood. It may also spread to the eyes.
Lepromatous leprosy is a serious medical condition that can cause massive tissue destruction and often leads to disfigurement."

Distinguish skin bacterial infections.,
Calculate your risks for staph infections.,
Locate the infection site.,
Seek medical attention.",How to Recognize Skin Bacterial Infections2," The most common type of skin bacterial infections are staphylococcal. Staphylococcal, or staph infections, are more common and live in your skin and mucous membranes. Sometimes, this bacteria is harmless; in fact, a significant proportion of the population is considered to be ""colonized"" with staph on their skin. However, certain strains of staph or inoculation with high amounts of staph can cause serious infection. Common staph infections include:


Ecthyma — Also known as “crusted ulcers.” This may be a deep form of impetigo, and is characterized by deep and crusted sores. Hair follicle infections — This may include boils, abscesses, sycosis, folliculitis, or carbuncles.
Skin infection wounds — These wounds include dermatitis and diabetic ulcers.

, Anyone can get a bacterial skin infection. Staph infections may occur if you have a cut or open wound that is not cleaned properly. You may pick up a staph infection if you come into contact with someone who already has one.

, A staph infection can occur anywhere on the body. If you were recently in the hospital, you may have developed an infection in an injection or surgery site. You may get an infection near a tube or catheter opening. Also check cracks on the feet and any sites where you may have been scratched.

, You will want to seek medical attention from your doctor or emergency room or urgent care if you think you have any of these illness. Staph infections usually need to be treated by a doctor, either with antibiotics, by draining an abscess, or both. Failure to do so may cause spread of the infection or even death.

"
"
Distinguish between strep and staph infections.,
Calculate your risks for strep infections.,
Locate the infection site.,
Seek medical attention.",How to Recognize Skin Bacterial Infections3," A second type of skin infection is a streptococcal, or strep, infection. Strep infections include:


Impetigo — This is also known as “school sores.” This is a common skin infection that may cause blisters or sores. This commonly affects children.
Strep throat — Your throat may become sore and white dots might appear on your tonsils or the roof of your mouth.
Scarlet fever — You may experience a very high fever. You may also have a red rash with a sandpaper like texture. Your throat may be coated in a white mucous and you may experience swollen glands. Toxic Shock Syndrome — TSS may be caused by pregnancy, hospital stay, or extended tampon use. The symptoms include a sunburn-like rash, fever, and swollen glands. , Some strep infections are fairly common and are frequently passed around from patient to patient in the school or work environment. These common infections include strep throat and impetigo. Other strep bacteria, such as scarlet fever, are a bit rarer.

, Like a staph infection, a strep infection can occur anywhere in the body. Infections such as scarlet fever and strep throat may be more easily diagnosed by examining for discoloration or swelling in the throat or mouth. External rashes, sores, or scabs may be the sign of diseases such as cellulitis or toxic shock syndrome.

, Strep infections can be contagious and need to be treated immediately. Go to your doctor or dermatologist (if you can get an immediate appointment) if you think you have any of these diseases. These infections can be treated with antibiotics, and should be monitored closely by a healthcare professional.

Determine whether you are at risk.,
Consider whether you may have been exposed to an allergen.,
Examine the potential side effects of your medications.,
Reflect on your environment and lifestyle.,
See your doctor to rule out any underlying conditions.",How to Recognize Hives (Urticaria)," This is caused by the production of histamine meant to fight off the allergen attacking your body. These welts come in different sizes and tend to spread on the different areas of your body.Sometimes they may appear brown or skin-colored. They normally have a wheal or a linear raised central area surrounded by a red ring or halo. The wheals appear annular (ring-shaped), round or oval as they enlarge.;
, Multiple small hives will sometimes join together to form bigger hives. Pay attention to the progression of your hives to determine if this seems to be happening. Keep in mind that this is common and the hives will go away in a matter of hours.


If you are unsure if your hives are growing, you can circle one or two with a marker and see if they expand beyond those lines.

, If your lips and/or eyes are swollen, then you may be suffering from angioedema. This condition is related to urticaria, but it affects deeper tissues. If the cause of your hives is angioedema, then you may also notice:Welts that are large and thick
Pain, redness, and warmth around the welts
A swollen or itchy throat or tongue — if you think your tongue or throat are affected, this may be an sign of a more systemic issue, and you should call emergency services right away

, Hives have a sudden onset and then go away within a matter of hours. Even though hives may look severe and frighten you, they should go away without producing any long-lasting effects. Hives seldom last longer than 24 hours and, in most cases, they may even be gone much sooner.If your hives last longer than 24 hours, consult your doctor, as it could be urticarial vasculitis, an autoimmune disease often confused with simple urticaria or hives.

, In some cases, dermatographia may be present along with hives. Dermatographia is when one “writes” on their skin with their fingernail and the tracing lingers on the skin. The writing lasts for about 30 minutes in the form of a raised linear lesion. This cause of this condition is unknown, but some people who suffer from hives may also have dermatographia., Hives usually go away on their own, but if they do not go away within 24 hours, then you should call your doctor. If you are experiencing any of the following serious symptoms, seek immediate medical attention.Difficulty breathing or swallowing
Pain or tightness in your chest
Dizziness
Wheezing
Swelling in your face, especially the tongue and lips

, Some people are at a higher risk of developing hives. Knowing if you are at risk may help you to determine if you are suffering from hives or if it may be something else. People who are at a higher risk of developing hives include:Anyone with known allergies
People who have had hives before or who have family members who have had hives
People with certain medical conditions such as lymphoma, thyroid disease, or lupus

, Some people have certain allergic triggers that can cause hives to erupt. If you only have hives in one area of your body, then it may have been caused by an allergen.Some common contact allergens include insect bites, animal dander, and latex. Think about what the affected part of your body has come into contact with to determine if an allergen may be to blame.
Some dietary allergens may also cause more widespread hives. Common allergies that may cause hives include shellfish, nuts, fresh berries, tomatoes, eggs, nuts, chocolate, and milk.If you suspect that you have an allergic trigger that is causing your hives, make an appointment with your doctor to get checked for allergies. To avoid hives in the future, you will need to avoid your triggers., Hives are a potential side effect for many medications. If you develop hives and are currently taking a medication, this may be the cause.If hives are mentioned as a potential side effect of a medication that you are taking, call your doctor right away. Your doctor may decide to try a different medication, but do not stop taking the medication without asking your doctor first.
Treatment for hives includes antihistamines that can cause drowsiness and corticosteroids that can lead to weight gain and elevations in blood glucose levels. Corticosteroids should never be used for an extended period of time as this can cause serious side effects, such as muscle weakness and increased risk of cataracts and glaucoma.

, Environmental and lifestyle factors may also cause hives. If you have been exposed to excess heat, cold, moisture, sunlight, or some other extreme condition, then this may be to blame for your hives. Even high levels of stress and excess exercise can cause hives sometimes.Wear loose, light clothing like cotton.
Avoid scratching your skin and avoid known triggers.
Shower using warm or cool water and use a cleanser that is gentle and non-drying.

, Although there are no tests to determine whether or not you are suffering from hives, your doctor can perform an allergy test and check to see if there are any other underlying conditions that may be causing the hives. Make sure that you make an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible to get a thorough checkup and diagnosis."

All registered dietitians can help you come up with a meal plan that fits your lifestyle and health. However, a dietitian that's also a CDE (Certified Diabetes Educator), will have specific training in managing diets of diabetics.
Talk to your dietitian about your current diet and how you'd be interested in adding more fruits to your current eating pattern.
Ask your dietitian what fruits are best for you, ask them to teach you how to measure serving sizes and even ask if they'll be able to provide you with a meal plan showing how to add fruit to your diet.;
, Regardless of what type of fruit you're going to be eating or how you're planning on adding fruit to your diet in general, the first thing you need to do is measure the portion size.


Sugar, including the sugar found in fruit, will increase your blood sugar after you've eaten it. Most fruits have about 15 grams of carbohydrate per serving.
However, depending on the type of fruit, some servings will be larger than others. A higher sugar fruit will need to be a smaller serving, compared to a lower sugar fruit. The serving sizes will be different, but have the same effect on your blood sugar.In general, the serving size for all fruit is about 1/2 cup, 1 small piece or about 4 oz. If you're eating dried fruit, the serving size is 1/4 cup or about 1 1/2 ounces.Use a measuring cup or a food scale to keep your portions in check.

, All fruit contains the natural sugar fructose. However, some fruits have a higher sugar content than others. Try to choose the lower sugar fruits to minimize your sugar intake.


Some of the lowest sugar fruits include: cranberries, strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, raspberries and apples.Higher sugar fruits include: bananas, pineapple, mangoes, figs, grapes and oranges.
Remember, even the fruits that are higher sugar are still considered nutritious. You just need to measure the portion and ensure you stick to a small portion to minimize their effects on your blood sugar.

, Natural fruits that are whole and unprocessed only contain the sugar that's found in them naturally. However, once you get into fruits that are more processed (like canned fruit), you need to be extra careful of any added sugars.


If you grab an apple or orange from the produce section, you can be confident there is no added sugar in that apple or orange. The only sugar is the fructose found naturally.
However, if you pick up canned fruit, dried fruit or even frozen fruit, there could be added sugars. This will increase the sugar content, calorie content and spike your blood sugar higher.If you're buying canned or frozen fruit, read the label thoroughly. It should only contain the fruit either in 100% juice or water. If it says sugar, packed in syrup (even light syrup), there is added sugar.
Dried fruit very commonly has added sugar. Read the ingredient label on dried fruit to see if the manufacturer has added sugar to these fruits.

, When you're including fruits into your diet, you can choose to eat them plain without any other foods or pair them with a protein or healthy fat to help curb your blood sugar.


When you eat fruit or any other carbohydrate with a protein or healthy fat, the protein and fat naturally help slow down your digestion.This prevents the sugar from the fruit spiking your blood sugar. Instead, it's slowly released for a more subtle rise in your blood sugar over a longer period of time.
Instead of grabbing a lone piece of fruit, try something like: an apple with natural peanut butter, sliced pears with cheddar cheese, blueberries on plain cottage cheese or unsweetened dried fruit and nuts.
Other sources or protein include eggs, poultry, lean beef, pork, low-fat dairy, tofu, and nuts.
Sources of healthy fat include avocados, fatty fish, nuts, and cheeses.

, The glycemic index is a numerical index that rates carbohydrate-rich foods on a scale of 0 to 100. The index measures how much blood sugar rises following the ingestion of a carbohydrate. The higher the number, the higher blood sugar rises. Because fruits mostly contain carbohydrate in the form of fructose and fiber, most fruits have a low glycemic index. Here are some common fruits and their glycemic index scores:

Grapefruit (GI-25)
Bananas (GI-52)
Apples (GI-38)
Oranges (GI-48)
In comparison, oatmeal has a GI score of 54, white rice has a GI score of 64, and carrots have a GI score of 47., Perfect for a summer dessert or afternoon snack, grilling fruit brings out their natural sweetness. Adding high protein greek yogurt can help slow the digestion of these naturally sweet peaches.


Start by turning on your outdoor or indoor grill pan to medium high heat. Lightly spray the grates with vegetable oil.
Slice 2-3 just-ripe peaches. They shouldn't be overly ripe so they're soft or mushy. Remove pit, but keep the skin on them. Spray cut side with vegetable oil.
Put the flesh side of the peach down on the grates. Grill for about 5 minutes or until the flesh has nice golden brown grill marks.
Remove from grill and serve with a dollop of low-fat plain greek yogurt. Sprinkle with cinnamon and serve immediately.

, For a light fruit dish, try marinating your favorite melons. This bumps up the flavor without adding a lot of calories or sugar.Start by using a melon baller to cut out small spheres of your favorite melons. You can try watermelon, cantaloupe or honeydew. Measure out about 4 cups of melon balls total.
In a large bowl, add in 1/2 of diet berry flavored sparkling water and 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) of white balsamic vinegar. Stir quickly to combine.
Add in your melon balls and toss to coat the melon evenly with the marinade. You can also added chopped mint or lemon verbena for an extra kick of flavor.
Allow melon to marinate for at least 2-4 hours. Serve chilled with a sprig of mint.

, If you need a quick breakfast or a snack, try making a homemade fruit smoothie. Keep the sugar low by using lower sugar fruits and sugar-free ingredients.In the bowl of a blender, add in 1/2 cup of almond milk, 1/2 cup of plain greek yogurt and 1/2 cup of frozen mixed berries. You can use all one type of berry or use a combination (like blackberries, blueberries and strawberries).
Blend your smoothie on high until there are no more chunks or bits of frozen fruit. You may need to scrape down the sides occasionally.
Taste your smoothie for the desired texture and sweetness. If the smoothie is too thick, add in more almond milk. If it's too thin, add a few more frozen berries. Serve cold.

, Swap out tomatoes for strawberries in this fun twist on a classic salsa. Serve with 100% whole grain pita chips for a nutritious snack.Combine the following ingredients in a medium sized bowl: 1 US-pint (470 ml) of finely diced strawberries, 1 jalapeño seeded and diced, 1/2 cup of diced red onion, 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of lime juice and salt and pepper to taste.
Mix ingredient together and allow to sit in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Stir and taste for seasonings. Adjust as needed.
Serve salsa chilled or room temperature with 100% whole grain pita chips.

, Incorporating the right amount and types of fruits to your diet is just a small part of an overall healthy and balanced diet. Focus on balancing all types of foods in your diet.


A nutritious and well balanced diet is essential - especially for those with diabetes. It will help you manage your blood sugar during the day and in the long-term.A well balanced diet means your'e eating a wide variety of foods from within each food group everyday. That includes higher carbohydrate foods like fruits, grains or starchy vegetables.
However, you need to measure portion sizes of all your foods and include the appropriate serving sizes everyday.
In addition to including all the food groups daily, also choose a variety of foods from within each food group as well. So don't just eat apples daily, but have apples, strawberries, blueberries and pears throughout the week.

, As mentioned, protein-based foods do not contain carbohydrates. They do not affect your blood sugar. However, it's still important to choose nutritious sources of protein.


You need to include a serving of protein at every meal. Not only does this help you meet your daily protein needs, but also can help blunt the release of carbohydrates into your blood stream and read food labels to check for added sugar.Choose lean protein sources since they are lower in unhealthy sources of fat and overall calories.Try naturally lean protein like: eggs, poultry, lean beef, pork, low-fat dairy, tofu, seafood and nuts.
Measure the portion sizes of your protein sources. They should be around 3-4 oz or 1/2 cup per serving.

, When you're doing meal planning for a diabetic diet, non-starchy vegetables are generally considered ""free foods."" They're very low in carbohydrates and calories and can be eaten without worrying about your blood sugar or waistline.


Non-starchy vegetables are those that do not contain a lot of starch which is form of carbohydrate. These types of vegetables should be included at most of your meals.
They include vegetables like: lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, mushrooms, eggplant, asparagus, brussels sprouts, cabbage, onions or green beans.
Even though non-starchy vegetables are considered ""free foods"" you still want to measure the appropriate portion size. Measure out 1 cup or 2 cups of leafy salad greens per serving., On the opposite side of non-starchy vegetables, there are high starch vegetables. These are still very nutritious, but they do contain more carbohydrates.Starchy vegetables, like fruit, are typically thought of as ""high carb foods"" and ones that should be avoided or limited due to their carbohydrate content.
However, starchy vegetables are equally nutritious and contain a wide variety of vitamins, antioxidants and fiber. They include vegetables like: winter squash (butternut or pumpkin), beans, lentils, potatoes, yams or corn.
Because these vegetables are higher in carbohydrate, you do need to measure the portion sizes. It's still a 1 cup serving per portion of these higher carbohydrate veggies., Another food group that's commonly limited and avoided due to their carbohydrate content are grains. However, if you choose 100% whole grains, these foods still offer beneficial nutrients.


Grains typically get pegged as a high carb food - and they are. To make these carbohydrates more nutritious, choose 100% whole grains.
Whole grains are less processed and contain more protein, fiber and other nutrients compared to more refined grains (like white bread or white rice).Try whole grains like: quinoa, brown rice, whole wheat bread, whole grain pasta, farro, barley or millet.
Because grains do contain a lot of carbohydrates, it's essential that you measure your portion size of these foods. Measure out about 1 oz or 1/2 cup of whole grains per serving."

Itching tends to be more severe at night and has the potential to interrupt the sleep of infested individuals.;
, Along with the itching, you may develop a rash. The rash also represents an allergic reaction to the mite.The rash is typically described as pimple-like with surrounding inflammation and redness.Mites prefer to burrow into the skin in certain parts of the body.


The most common places that adults can have an itchy rash associated with scabies are the hands, especially the webbing between the fingers, the skin folds of the wrist, elbow, or knee, the buttocks, the waist, the penis, the skin around the nipples, the armpits, the shoulder blades, and the breasts.In children, the most common sites of infestation include the scalp, face, neck, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet., When you have scabies, tiny burrows are sometimes visible on the skin. These appears as tiny raised and crooked grayish-white or skin-colored lines on the surface of the skin. They are usually a centimeter or more in length.Burrows may be difficult to find as most people have only 10 to 15 mites in an average infestation., The intense itching caused by scabies sometimes leads to sores on the skin. The sores are at high risk for infection, which is often a complication of scabies. The sores are most often infected with bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, or beta-hemolytic streptococci, which predominate on the skin. These bacteria can also lead to inflammation of the kidneys and sometimes sepsis, which is a life-threatening bacterial infection of the blood.To avoid this, try to be gentle on your skin and do not scratch it. If you can't help yourself, consider wearing mittens or wrapping your fingertips with band-aids to keep yourself from damaging the skin. Keep your nails trimmed short.
Signs of infection include increased redness, swelling, pain, or pus or discharge from the sores. If you believe your rash is infected, call your doctor right away. Your doctor can prescribe an oral or topical antibiotic to treat the infection.

, There is another form of scabies that has an additional symptom. Crusted scabies, also known as Norwegian scabies, is a severe form of the infestation. It is characterized by tiny blisters and thick skin crusting that can cover large areas of the body. Crusted scabies primarily occurs in individuals with weakened immune systems. The impaired immune response allows mites to reproduce unchecked, with some infestations reaching upwards of two million mites.Another consequence of the impaired immune response is that itching and the rash may be less severe or totally absent.
You are at risk for the development of crusted scabies if you are elderly, have a weakened immune system, or are living with HIV/AIDS, lymphoma, or leukemia. You are also at risk if you have received an organ transplant and have any condition that may prevent you from itching or scratching, such as a spinal cord injury, paralysis, loss of sensation, or mental debility., If you suspect you may be infested with scabies, you should quickly consult a physician for a clinical diagnosis. Your physician will diagnose scabies by examining you for the scabies rash and mite burrows.Your physician will likely use a needle to scrape off a very small piece of skin. The doctor will then examine the matter under the microscope to confirm the presence of mites, eggs, or mite fecal matter.It is important to note that an individual can still be infested with scabies even if mites, eggs, or fecal matter cannot be found. An infestation of scabies averages 10 to 15 mites found over the entire body., Your doctor can use an ink test to identify the burrows of scabies mites. Your doctor will rub ink around an area of skin that is itchy or irritated and then use an alcohol pad to wipe off the ink. If a mite burrow is present in your skin, it will trap some of the ink and the burrow will show up as a dark, wavy line on your skin., There are numerous other skin conditions that may be confused with scabies. The main way to distinguish them is through the mite burrows, which are not associated with any of the skin conditions that may be confused with scabies. Ask your doctor to rule out these other conditions so you can be sure you have scabies.


Scabies is sometimes confused with other insect bites or stings, or with bed bugs.
These skin conditions include impetigo, which is a highly contagious skin infection. The red pimple-like rash of impetigo is most commonly seen on the face around the nose and mouth.It can also be confused with eczema, which is a chronic skin condition involving inflammation of the skin. The red pimple-like rash of eczema represents an allergic reaction.People with eczema can also get scabies, and the condition is more severe for them.
You could also have folliculitis, which is an inflammation, and usually infection, in the area associated with a hair follicle. This conditions causes small white-headed pimples to crop up on a reddened base around or near hair follicles.It may be confused with psoriasis as well, which is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by excessive growth of skin cells that leads to the formation of thick, silvery scales and itchy, dry, red patches., Treatment for scabies involves getting rid of the infestation with prescription medications, which are called scabicides because they kill the mites. There are currently no over the counter medications to treat scabies. Your doctor may prescribe you permethrin 5% cream, which is the drug of choice for the treatment of scabies. It kills the scabies mites and eggs. The cream should be applied from the neck down over the entire body and washed off after eight to 14 hours.Repeat the treatment in 7 days (1 week). Side effects may include itching or stinging.
You should talk to your doctor or pediatrician about treating infants and young children with scabies. Permethrin cream is safe for infants as young as 1 month old,but most experts recommend also applying it to the head and neck area for infants and young children.Make sure you can do so without getting it into your child's eyes or mouth.

, Crotamiton cream or lotion may also be prescribed to you. To use it, apply it from the neck down over the entire body after a bath. Apply a second dose 24 hours after the initial dose and bathe 48 hours after the second dose. Repeat both doses in seven to 10 days.


Crotamiton is considered safe when used as directed.However, frequent treatment failure has been reported with this scabicide, which means it isn't the most effective or widely used anymore., This lotion is similar to other scabicides. The lotion should be applied from the neck down over the entire body and washed off after eight to 12 hours in adults and after six hours in children. Repeat the treatment in seven days. Lindane should not be given to children younger than two, women who are pregnant or nursing, or people with weakened immune systems.


It is potentially neurotoxic, which means it can cause damage to the brain and other parts of the nervous system.The prescription of lindane should be restricted to individuals who have failed treatment with or cannot tolerate other medications that pose less risk., There is one oral medication for scabies. Evidence suggests that this oral medication is safe and effective for the treatment of scabies. However, it is not approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this use. Ivermectin is prescribed in a single oral dose of 200 mcg/kg. It should be taken on an empty stomach with water.Repeat the dose in seven to 10 days. The prescription of ivermectin should be considered in individuals who have failed treatment with or who cannot tolerate FDA-approved topical medications for the treatment of scabies.
A potential side effect of ivermectin is an elevated heart rate., Symptoms and skin lesions may take up to three weeks to resolve despite the killing of the scabies mites with scabicides. If they do not resolve in this time frame, retreatment should be considered as there may have been treatment failure or reinfestation.Symptomatic treatment of itching may be accomplished with the cooling of your skin. Soak in a tub of cool water or apply cool compresses to the irritated areas of skin to help with the itching.


Sprinkling some oatmeal or baking soda in your bath can have a soothing effect on the skin.You can also try calamine lotion, which is available over the counter and has been shown to effectively relieve the itching of minor skin irritations. Good options include Sarna or Aveeno anti-itch moisturizers. Avoid anything with added fragrances or dyes, as these can irritate the skin., Both of these drugs can help with the associated itching of scabies, which is actually due to an allergic reaction to mites, eggs, and waste. Steroids are very powerful inhibitors of itch and inflammation. Examples of topical steroids include betamethasone and triamcinolone.


Since it is an allergic reaction, over the counter antihistamines can also be used. These include Benadryl, Claritin, Allegra, and Zyrtec. These can be especially helpful at night to reduce itching so you can sleep. Benadryl also acts as a mild sedative for many people. You can also get prescription antihistamines such as Atarax.Topical hydrocortisone 1% cream can be purchased over-the-counter. It is often effective for itch.

, The most common way to transmit scabies is by direct skin-to-skin contact with someone who is already infested. The more prolonged this contact is, the greater the chance to get scabies. Less often, scabies may be transmitted via items such as bedding, clothing, and furniture. The human itch mite can survive 48 to 72 hours devoid of human contact. In adults, scabies is often contracted through sexual activity.Crowded conditions are a common cause for scabies outbreaks.Thus, areas such as prisons, barracks, child-care and elder-care facilities, and schools are common sites.Only humans, not animals, can spread scabies., In a person newly exposed to scabies, it can take two to six weeks to develop signs and symptoms of the disease. It is important to note that an infested individual can spread scabies even if he is not exhibiting signs and symptoms of the disease.


In a person with previous exposure to scabies, signs and symptoms develop much quicker within a time frame of one to four days., There are certain groups of people who are more likely to pass scabies to one another. These groups include children, mothers of young children, sexually active young adults, and residents of nursing homes, assisted-living residences, and extended-care facilities.The mechanism responsible for the increased risk in the above populations is skin-to-skin contact.

, Measures to control and prevent re-exposure and re-infestation with scabies include simultaneous scabies treatment. This is usually recommended for other family members residing in the household and close contacts, including sex partners.The day scabies treatment is started, all personal clothing, bedding, and towels used within the last 3 days should be washed in hot water and dried on the highest heat setting or be dry-cleaned. If it cannot be washed and dried or dry-cleaned, place it in a closed plastic bag for at least seven days. Scabies mites can only survive for 48 to 72 hours away from human skin.The day scabies treatment is started, vacuum all carpet and furniture in your home. Throw away the bag or empty and thoroughly wash the canister after you've finished vacuuming. If the canister is not removable, wipe it clean with a damp paper towel to remove any scabies mites.Don’t treat your pets. The human itch mite cannot survive on other animals and other animals cannot transmit scabies.Environmental removal of infestation using pesticide sprays or fogs is unnecessary and is discouraged."

Identify if you fit into the right demographic.",How to Recognize Morgellons Symptoms," People with Morgellons often report that they have chronic skin rashes. These skin rashes are often accompanied with intense itching. Some people with Morgellons often report sores instead of rashes. But regardless of whether it is a sore or a rash, both are one of the primary symptoms of Morgellons.


If you develop sores or rashes for an unknown reason, contact a medical professional.
Take a photograph of your sores.
Do not scratch at or pick your sores or rashes.
As with any new rash or skin lesion, carefully think back to when you first noted symptoms and any changes in your routine that might explain it. This may include food, beverages, outside activities, hobbies, personal care products and clothes, to name just a few things that might trigger some sort of irritation or reaction.
If you suspect Morgellons, avoid any homeopathic treatments and contact a medical professional immediately.;
, Many people who have been diagnosed with Morgellons report that they feel a crawling sensation underneath their skin. They say that this sensation feels like there are insects or worms moving underneath their skin.This is often paired with biting or stinging sensations under the skin.
This is one of the telltale symptoms of Morgellons disease.
Avoid scratching if you exhibit this symptom.

, Common skin disturbances associated with Morgellons include granule-like materials, threads, fibers on or beneath the skin. People struck with Morgellons often develop fibers or threads growing out of sores on their skin. The appearance of granule-like fibers are perhaps the most notable symptom of Morgellons. The cause of the fibers is yet unknown.Most often the fibers are black in appearance.
The fibers sometimes appear clear, white, blue, or black. Less often, they are red, pink, green, or gold.
They might have a metallic look to them.
Make sure that your Morgellons fibers are not remnants of medical bandages, clothing, or other household fabrics.

, There are a substantial number of other conditions that can cause itching and rashes or sores which would be considered before Morgellons. This is because the symptoms of Morgellons are relatively common and general. As a result, in order to help yourself identify if you have Morgellons, you should consider other conditions that can have similar symptoms. Consider that your physical symptoms might indicate:Toxoplasmosis
Pinworm infection
Other parasitic infections
Fibromyalgia
Other fungal and bacteria caused skin diseases

, People with Morgellons often report feeling extremely fatigued. This severe feeling of fatigue is not one that can be alleviated through rest and nutrition, but is chronic and persistent. Fatigue, then, is perhaps one of the most debilitating aspects of Morgellons disease., Many Morgellons victims report experiencing visual or aural disturbances. Visual disturbances might include blurred vision or other problems seeing clearly. Aural disturbances include tinnitus or a ringing in the ears. These visual or aural disturbances may or may not be directly related to Morgellons. Consult your doctor if you suspect that they are in fact caused by Morgellons.Visual and aural disturbances alone are not symptoms of Morgellons.
Visual and aural disturbances must be paired with other physical symptoms to be an indication of Morgellons.
Before suspecting Morgellons, try to rule out other potentially life-threatening causes.

, Contact your doctor if you suddenly feel anxious or prone to panic attacks. Some people diagnosed with Morgellons have increased anxiety and are prone to panic attacks. It’s not clear if this anxiety is a direct symptom of Morgellons or is a result of the debilitating effects on people who struggle with it. , People reporting the physical symptoms of Morgellons also report decreased intellectual capacity. Morgellons sufferers, then, are not simply crippled by physical manifestations of the disease, but are also harmed by its intellectual symptoms. Consider:Morgellons victims often report feeling confusion.
Morgellons victims report short-term memory loss.
Morgellons victims sometimes have difficulty concentrating.

, Many Morgellons victims also suffer from depression. At this point, it is unclear as to whether depression is brought on because of the effects of Morgellons or if Morgellons is a manifestation of depression and other psychological problems. Make sure to see your mental health specialist if you suspect your depression is somehow linked to Morgellons., Since its relatively recent appearance less than two decades ago, debate has raged between doctors and in the scientific community as to whether Morgellons is a physical disease or a mental illness. While some doctors believe that sufferers of Morgellons are indeed plagued by a real physical disease, others believe that Morgellons is a delusion. Advocates of the idea of Morgellons as a mental illness point to:the fact that sores and other physical symptoms are a result of picking, scratching, and are generally self-inflicted.
Fibers that appear on Morgellons victims are cotton and other medical products introduced by Morgellons sufferers in their effort to care for their self-inflicted wounds.
Doctors cannot identify a source of the disease or isolate bacteria, fungal, or viral agents responsible.

, Many researchers have concluded that Morgellons shares a close association with psychiatric conditions. It is unclear, however, if the physical symptoms of Morgellons can be completely attributed to psychological causes. Consult your mental health specialist if you suspect your Morgellons symptoms are related to psychological trauma or other issues. Morgellons symptoms could be related to:


Chronic fatigue syndrome
Gulf War syndrome
Post traumatic stress syndrome

, Some doctors have connected Morgellons with delusional parasitosis. Delusional parasitosis is when someone mistakenly thinks that their body is infested with parasites. Delusional parasitosis explains a large number of the symptoms reported by Morgellons patients. As a result, anyone trying to arrive at a proper diagnosis should consider delusional parasitosis when evaluating a Morgellons case.Delusional parasitosis could be caused by psychological problems that do not involve a delusions of parasites.
Delusional parasitosis has been associated with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
OCD-related delusional parasitosis could explain Morgellons' psychological and physical symptoms, specifically the obsession with feelings of itching or movement under the skin.

, Certain demographics, people from certain regions, and people with certain medical and psychological backgrounds are struck with Morgellons at a higher rate than others. As a result, you should consider your age, ethnicity, region, and other factors when evaluating whether you exhibit symptoms of the disease.Originally it was described in children and more recently in women.
Women 35 to 50 years old tend to develop Morgellons at higher rates than other groups.
Many Morgellons cases have been reported in Texas, Florida, and California.
Half of Morgellons victims have a history of depression or drug abuse.

Know who's at risk.,
Watch for round, raised lesions.,
Take notice if the bumps get red and inflamed.,
Look for a small indentation.,
Practice good hygiene.,
Avoid sexual contact.,
Don't scratch the bumps.,
Keep molluscum lesions covered.,
Wait and see.,
Get the bumps/lesions removed.,
Try medications.",How to Recognize Molluscum (Molluscum Contagiosum)," Molluscum contagiosum is common enough that you probably know someone who's had it. It's not limited to kids, but it's most common in children between the ages of 1 to 10 years who have weakened immunity due to poor nutrition or other illnesses.Other people at increased risk for the skin infection include chemotherapy patients, the elderly and people infected with HIV.


Having atopic dermatitis (allergic skin reactions) may also put you at higher risk of developing molluscum contagiosum.
Participation in contact sports is a risk factor for molluscum contagiosum.
In general, molluscum contagiosum infections are more common in warm, humid climates where people live crowded together, such as India and parts of Asia.;
, The lesions or bumps characteristic of molluscum contagiosum are typically small, round and raised above the surface of the skin.Most people get between 10 – 20 bumps on their skin, but people with AIDS can develop 100 or more bumps. In terms of color, they are usually whitish, pink or flesh-colored.


The raised bumps range in size from about 2 – 5 mm millimeters in diameter (about the size of a tip of a crayon to the size of a pencil eraser), although they can get bigger around the genitalia of adults.
These bumps can appear anywhere on the body, but are usually seen on the face, neck, armpit, arms and hands.The only places they will not appear are the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. They appear about seven weeks after being exposed to the virus.
The fleshy lesions are known as mollusca and can sometimes mimic warts, heat blisters and other benign growths such as skin tags.

, Normally the lesions or bumps (mollusca) are not particularly itchy, although that can change if you scratch them. By scratching, itching or rubbing the lesions, you can make them red, inflamed and itchy, which increases the likelihood that they'll spread to surrounding skin and make the condition worse.Mollusca can easily be removed by scratching, rubbing, or even just casual contact, unlike pimples, warts and other skin lesions.
Mollusca that have turned red and inflamed without any scratching is usually a sign that your immune system has regained enough strength to fight the infection.
Once red and inflamed, mollusca can look a lot like regular pimples, ingrown hairs or even chicken pox.
Inflamed lesions should not be confused for infection and do not need antibiotics.

, Mollusca can often be identified from other skin lesions and blemishes because they have a characteristic indentation, dimple, or pit in their center that's called an umbilication.This central umbilication may be filled with a thick, white substance that is cheesy or waxy looking. The material can be squeezed out, but it makes the infection much more contagious, so don't pick at them.


The umbilication can sometimes make mollusca look like blackhead pimples or pustules (whiteheads).
The waxy or cheesy material inside of the mollusca contain millions of viruses mixed with your skin's oily secretions and often some pus, which is dead white blood cells.

, Practicing good hygiene is an effective way of avoiding or preventing many different kinds of infections, including molluscum contagiosum; therefore, wash your hands frequently with warm water and soap, especially if you shake hands or touch someone with visible lesions on their body.Hand washing also removes viruses (and other germs) that you pick up from contaminated surfaces, toys, clothing or towels.


After bathing your body, don't be too aggressive while drying it. Pat yourself with the towel gently instead of rubbing because you don't want to remove the mollusca and make the skin infection more contagious.
In addition to washing your hands, try to stop the habit of putting your hands into your mouth or rubbing your eyes — it'll help prevent infection also.
An alcohol-based hand sanitizer is also effective against molluscum contagiosum and can be used as a good alternative to soap and water.
Infection can spread via bath sponges, towels, pumice stones, or razors. Avoid sharing these items.

, The viral infection also spreads by sexual contact among teens and adults because the lesions can develop on and around the genitals of both genders (upper thighs and lower abdomen are common locations also).Practicing safe sex (with a condom) is not enough to prevent molluscum contagiosum because it's spread by skin-to-skin contact, not in body fluids.


The best practice is to completely avoid sexual contact if you or your partner have mollusca near the genitalia until the condition completely goes away.
Oral sex also needs to be avoided if you or your partner have mollusca near the mouth or on the face.
Mollusca on the genitalia are often mistaken for genital herpes, but they don't cause the burning pain of herpes.

, As difficult as it may be, particularly if they've become inflamed and itchy, you should avoid scratching, rubbing or even touching the mollusca lesions.Picking or scratching your skin can spread the virus to other parts of your body and make it easier to spread the infection to others.


Be particularly careful about not scratching around your eyes because you increase the risk of an eye infection (conjunctivitis).
Shaving over the infected areas can also disrupt or remove the mollusca and spread the virus. As such, avoid shaving your face, underarms or legs if you have lesions in those locations.

, If you are already infected with molluscum contagiosum, then the best way to prevent spreading it to other parts of your body or to other people is to keep the infected area covered with loose breathable clothing or light bandaging.The physical barrier will prevent you from scratching and keep others from touching the mollusca.


Remember to always keep the infected skin clean and dry beneath the clothes or bandages.
Use watertight bandages to cover your bumps and change them regularly (daily if you get them wet).
Wearing loose cotton clothing is a much better choice than thicker wool or synthetic fibers that aren't breathable.

, Molluscum contagiosum is self-limiting and eventually fades away in healthy individuals, so treatment is often unnecessary.It usually takes between six to 12 months for the infection to resolve and the mollusca to disappear.In some immune-weakened people, it may take up to five years for all the bumps to disappear on their own.
Treatment is sometimes recommended by doctors if the bumps are in the genital area.

, Sometimes doctors may recommend the lesions be surgically removed before they disappear on their own (often in adults) because they tend to be so contagious and people are often self-conscious or embarrassed by them.This is particularly true if the mollusca are on or near the penis, vulva, vagina or anus. Ask your doctor if your situation is appropriate for removal.


Surgical removal can include cryotherapy (freezing with liquid nitrogen), curettage (scraping away the lesion) and laser therapy.These removal methods are usually painful and require local anesthesia. Scarring is not uncommon with these procedures.
Your doctor might attempt to remove your mollusca, but often they will refer you to a skin specialist (dermatologist).

, In some cases, prescription creams or ointments applied directly to the mollusca may be helpful and get rid of them quicker. Common examples include tretinoin (Atralin, Retin-A), adapalene (Differin), tazarotene (Avage, Tazorac) and imiquimod.Be aware that these topical drugs cannot be used during pregnancy due to risk of side effects to the unborn baby.


Sometimes preparations containing salicylic acid or potassium hydroxide are used for molluscum contagiosum — they help dissolve lesions by causing blisters to form over them.
Podophyllotoxin cream or podofilox may be helpful as an over-the-counter therapy to use at home. In one study patients applied 0.5% cream twice a day for three consecutive days a week, versus a group applying a placebo. Treatment was continued for four weeks. After four weeks, 92% of the 0.5% podofilox group was cured. Remember to apply this cream liberally to the affected area."

Symptoms of infection include redness, swelling, or warmth around the wound. Any pus or colored discharge indicates infection.You may also develop a fever, chills, or fatigue if the infection worsens or spreads. Seek medical attention if this happens.
An uncomplicated infection on your face can sometimes turn into facial cellulitis. This is an infection of deeper layers of skin and underlying tissue, and it can cause serious complications if left untreated. Watch for redness, pain and swelling, and yellow or green pus. , Some people heal more slowly or are at risk of complications from infections, including those who are obese, diabetic, have poor blood flow due to arteriosclerosis, smoke, use alcohol heavily, or are under stress.See a doctor about your facial wound if you fall into one of these categories. She can advise you on the best plan of treatment.

, Only minor wounds should be treated at home. See a doctor if you have deep wounds with rough or uneven edges, if you can’t bring the edges together, or if you can’t properly clean the wound. You may need stitches to pull the skin back together, or you may be at risk for infection.If the wound won’t stop bleeding, you should also go to the doctor because this indicates it is a more serious wound.

Remove any pressure from the affected area.,
Increase your protein.,
Use supplements.,
Avoid picking the scabs.,
Avoid harsh solutions on facial wounds.,
Refrain from moving your facial muscles too much.,
Use an ice pack.,
Avoid heat on the wound.",How to Quickly Heal Open Sores on Your Face3," Some facial wounds are caused by the pressure of something rubbing on the delicate skin of the face. This may be due to an oxygen tube or even eyeglasses. If this is the cause of your facial wound, remove the source of the wound for periods of time, especially while it is healing.If you are not sure how to change the way you wear your eyeglasses or oxygen tubes, talk to your doctor.

, Diet can affect your body’s natural healing properties. To help make sure your face wounds are healing as quickly as possible, increase your protein intake. Try adding meats, dairy, whole grains, legumes, and vegetables to your meals.Lean meats are a great source of protein. Try chicken breast, fish, pork, eggs, or lean beef.
Dairy products also contain a lot of protein. Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, and lowfat cheese can make good snacks to increase your protein.
Whole grains, like quinoa and bulgur, contain a lot of protein, as do black beans, lentils, soy beans, red beans, or kidney beans. Try green vegetables for protein, such as spinach or broccoli.
Avoid junk food that increases inflammation and hinders healing.

, One way to help sores heal quickly is to improve your immune system with dietary supplements. This includes vitamins like vitamins C, B, D, and E. Fish oil and zinc are also help to promote healing and to stop infections of the skin., When your open wounds start to scab over, don’t pick at the scabs. Picking at them can slow the healing process and lead to scarring. Leave the scar alone.Continue adding petroleum jelly to the wound to help keep the scab moist.

, When treating wounds on your face, don’t try to clean them with harsh solutions. This can damage the injured tissue or irritate the wound, which will slow the healing process.Don’t use antibacterial solutions, hydrogen peroxide, or iodine solutions.

, As your wound is healing, try to limit how much you use the muscles around the wound. If you move your muscles, you could irritate and pull at the wound, which can slow the healing process.Try not to smile, chew, or talk with exaggerated movements. Take it easy as your wound heals.

, If your open wound has swelling around it, try using an ice pack. Take a cold compress or ice wrapped in a towel and place it on the wound for around 10 to 20 minutes. You can do this multiple times a day.Never place ice directly on the wounds. This could cause your face to burn.

Apply honey.,
Make a chamomile compress.,
Try aloe vera.,
Apply tea tree oil.,
Use essential oils.",How to Quickly Heal Open Sores on Your Face4," Honey is a natural substance that is antibacterial and antiseptic. Used topically, it can help keep the wound from getting infected and may help speed up the healing process. Dab a thin layer of honey over the wound. Honey has to be used safely, though. Contaminated honey can spread other, secondary infectious diseases and it shouldn’t be used on open wounds. In both cases, you could end up worsening the infection., Chamomile also aids in healing because it has antibiotic and antiseptic properties.Soak a cloth in lukewarm chamomile tea and press it against the wound.You may also put cool tea bags directly onto the wound.

, Aloe vera can be used to treat wounds because of its healing properties. Try an ointment that containing aloe vera. You can also cut a piece of an aloe leaf from the plant.

Protect yourself from the sun.Take the following steps while outdoors:


Wear a hat with a wide brim to shade your head, ears, face, and neck.,
Use sunscreen.,
Try to stay in the shade.,
Protect yourself even on cloudy days.,
Take extra precaution if you have multiple risk factors.,
Avoid tanning.,
Be aware of any ""sun-sensitizing"" medications you may be taking.Some medications carry with them an increased sensitivity to sun damage.,
Take note of any new skin lesions.If you notice that a new spot, mole, or other unusual lesion has appeared on your skin, pay careful attention to it.,
Look for asymmetry.If you find a lesion on your skin that is asymmetrical, it is more likely to be skin cancer or a precursor lesion for skin cancer than one that is symmetrical.,
Examine the border of your skin lesion.Is it a smooth and well-defined border, or a jagged and irregular one?,
Be aware of the size.,
Notice the color.Lesions with uneven pigment throughout are of higher risk, as are lesions that are abnormal in color (such as very dark brown, black or blue, or showing irregular shades that vary throughout the lesion).,
See your doctor if in doubt.,
Understand that most skin cancers are easily curable.Even though the word ""cancer"" can strike fear in us the moment we hear it, skin cancer is actually one of the most curable forms of cancer.,
Biopsy or excise any worrisome lesions.When you see your doctor and show them your skin lesion, they will evaluate it and may recommend biopsying (taking a sample of) or excising (completely cutting out) any lesions that are potential cancers.,
Evaluate the ""margins"" after excision.",How to Prevent Skin Cancer,"
Cover up to protect exposed skin. Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants if possible.
Note that tightly woven fabrics and dark colors are more protective against the sun.Some clothing will have an SPF value on the label inside to indicate the degree of ultraviolet protection it offers.
Try to stay out of the sun when it is most intense, usually between 10 AM and 4 PM.;
, Sunscreen with a higher SPF (sun protective factor) such as SPF 30 or higher is best for optimum sun protection. Be sure to apply it on all exposed areas of skin such as your face, your ears, your nose, your chest and shoulders, your arms and hands, your stomach and back, and your legs and feet.


Look for a broad-spectrum sunscreen which protects against UVA and UVB rays.
Sunscreen should be reapplied every two hours, or after swimming or sweating (such as after a workout).Note that sunscreen should be used even on seemingly cloudy days, as the clouds do not stop the sun's rays from reaching your skin.

, Particularly during midday hours (10 AM – 4 PM), when the sun's UV rays are the strongest and can do the most damage, try to stay either in the shade or indoors.The best time to enjoy the sun is in the early morning or the late afternoon, as both of these times are less damaging to your skin when it comes to sun exposure and UV radiation.

, Even if the sun is not shining directly, the UV rays can still pass through the clouds and cause skin damage; therefore, if you find yourself in a warm climate where the sun normally shines but it is temporarily concealed by clouds, be sure to still protect yourself well using sunscreen, a hat, and other precautions., The following is a list of factors that may increase your chances of getting skin cancer:Light skin color
History of cancer in the family
Prolonged exposure to the sun through work or play
History of sunburns as a youngster
Skin that burns, freckles, or reddens easily
Blue or green eyes
Naturally blond or red hair
A large amount of moles
Skin that becomes painful in the sun
An inability to tan

, It is important to know that tanning is also an indication of skin damage.Many people are aware that burning their skin is a warning sign that they have had too much sun; however, few people know that tanning also demonstrates skin damage. Both tanning and burning increase your risk of skin cancer, as well as your total time spent in the sun throughout your life; therefore, limit your time tanning and prioritize the health of your skin by avoiding excess UV rays.


Keep in mind that tanning beds and sunlamps emit UV rays.The UV rays from these devices are just as dangerous as those from sunlight, so their use should be avoided.
If you want to appear more ""tanned,"" try using a bronzer for your face when you put on makeup, or a bronzing lotion for your body, as this can create the look you are after without risking damage to your skin and possible skin cancer.

, One example is the antibiotic doxycycline. Tetracycline, which is commonly used to treat acne, can also cause photosensitivity. Speak to your doctor or pharmacist to see if any of the medications you are currently on affect your sensitivity to sunlight and warrant special precautions.

, If it changes or grows with time, or appears concerning to you, it is always better to be safe rather than sorry and to consult your doctor to rule out a possible skin cancer.

, This is because cancer cells, as well as precancerous cells, tend to have uncontrolled and uneven growth patterns, often leading to asymmetry.

, Skin lesions with irregular borders are more worrisome, as it can be another sign of the uneven and uncontrolled growth that is a hallmark of skin cancer.

, If the diameter of your skin lesion exceeds that of a pea (or is greater than a quarter of an inch), this is another more worrisome sign.Particularly if the lesion continues to grow and/or change with time, you will want to get it seen by a doctor.

, These types of lesions are more likely to be cancerous, and they merit investigation by a physician.

, If you notice risk factors such as those described above when you look at your skin lesion, see a physician who can assess it and let you know whether it is a possible skin cancer. Doctors are specifically trained to evaluate skin lesions, so if in doubt it is always best to get a professional opinion.

, When caught early, it can oftentimes be removed with no long-term ramifications.


The key to curability depends on both the specific type of skin cancer, as well as the time-frame in which it is noticed and excised by a physician.
If the skin cancer is either a precursor lesion (a precancerous growth), a ""squamous cell carcinoma,"" or a ""basal cell carcinoma,"" it can most likely be removed and cured. These are types of cancers or pre-cancers that, when caught early, rarely cause long-term consequences.
Melanoma, on the other hand, is the most dangerous form of skin cancer. Although it is the least common diagnosis, it is the leading cause of death from skin cancer, and the fastest one to metastasize (spread) to other areas of the body.
Fortunately, with early identification, many melanomas can be noticed, excised, and effectively ""cured"" as well; however, the risk is certainly higher with this subtype and thus of greater concern.

, If your doctor recommends a biopsy or excision, they will most likely send you to a medical specialist (a dermatologist, who specializes in skin concerns) to undergo the procedure.


A biopsy is done if the purpose is to gather more information — i.e. if the goal is to determine the specific diagnosis of the skin lesion, and to assess whether or not it is a cause for concern. There are a variety of ways to perform a biopsy; all can be done easily in your doctor's office.
An excision is done if the goal is to completely remove the lesion due to a sufficiently high level of suspicion. Generally, skin lesions can be excised using only local anesthetic (local freezing injected in the surrounding skin with a small needle so that you won't feel any pain). It is a procedure that can most often be completed within one office visit, without needing to go to a hospital.
If the lesion is smaller, another option is that your doctor may try ""cryotherapy,"" which uses liquid nitrogen to kill the cancerous or pre-cancerous cells; however, this can only be used for lesions that are small and shallow (i.e. that do not penetrate the skin layers too deeply, otherwise the liquid nitrogen is ineffective).

, If you have had a skin lesion excised by a doctor, know that they will examine the piece of skin under a microscope after it has been removed. What the doctors are specifically looking for under the microscope is whether or not the margins (i.e. the borders) are ""clear."" If the margins are ""clear,"" meaning that they show no cancerous cells, then you and your doctor can take confidence knowing that all of the pathological cells have been removed. On the other hand, if the margins show cancerous cells, it indicates risk that the cancer has spread to other parts of your body and may not have been completely ""cured.""


If the margins show cancerous cells, your doctor will speak to you about how best to proceed, and what further forms of treatment (such as chemotherapy) may be needed to give you the best chance of a complete cure.
When surgeons or dermatologist remove suspicious spots, they will generally remove at least 1 cm of normal tissue. This helps ensure removal of all cancerous cell.

Get the shingles vaccine.The shingles vaccine is approved for adults over the age of 50, and recommended strongly for individuals over the age of 60.,
Prevent postherpetic neuralgia, a potential complication of shingles.,
Do not avoid those infected with chicken pox.Being in the presence of the chickenpox virus again is actually a hidden blessing, because it once again boosts your immunity to VZV, which in turn works to prevent shingles.,
Build a healthy immune system.,
Recognize potential signs and symptoms of shingles.Shingles most often begins with unusual sensations such as itchiness, burning, tingling, or loss of sensation in one area of the skin (and localized to one side of the body and not the other).,
Prevent complications by seeking treatment early.If you have contracted shingles and are seeking to prevent complications of the disease, be sure to see a doctor as soon as possible.,
Avoid spreading it to others.If you have been diagnosed with shingles, it is important to take preventative measures to avoid spreading the VZV virus to others.",How to Prevent Shingles (Herpes Zoster)," This is because, the older you get, the greater your risk of contracting shingles. The vaccine is recommended even if you are not sure whether or not you have previously had chickenpox.


The vaccine is not 100% effective at preventing shingles; however, it does greatly diminish your chances of getting it, despite not being a guarantee.
A further benefit of the shingles vaccine is that, in the chance that you do still get shingles, the illness will be much less severe and will most likely be without complications.People that should not get the shingles vaccination include those with weakened immune systems, those suffering from cancer, people with HIV and AIDS, as well as pregnant women. If you have had an allergic reaction to the antibiotic neomycin, then you should not get the vaccine.;
, One of the most worrisome complications of shingles, particularly for those over 60 years old, is the risk of the ""postherpetic neuralgia"" complication. This is when the pain associated with the shingles rash persists long after the rash itself has disappeared. This occurs in 10-15% of people who contract shingles, and can be a devastating complication greatly affecting one's quality of life.Fortunately, the vaccine makes the risk of this complication extremely low, even if you do still develop shingles. This is yet another reason to prioritize receiving the shingles vaccine.

, Although it is not advisable to seek out people with chickenpox, if you happen to be around someone with it consider it a bonus when it comes to your own shingles immunity.


On the other hand, if you have never caught chickenpox in your life, you will not want to be around people with chickenpox as you will catch it.
Being around people with chickenpox only helps to prevent shingles.

, It is important to understand that shingles is the same virus as chickenpox, simply reactivated later in life. When you catch chickenpox, although the symptoms disappear, the varicella zoster virus (VZV) remains stored in your nervous system. With certain triggers, the virus can ""flare up"" again down the road in the form of shingles. This is why building a healthy immune system is key, as it can help to protect you from flare ups of VZV (i.e. shingles). for strategies to strengthen your immune system.

, This may be accompanied by a general feeling of being unwell and/or a fever. One to two days after the onset of these symptoms, a shingles rash (often painful blisters in a band-like pattern) typically appears.


The rash may also occur near the eye. If this is the case, seeking medical treatment sooner rather than later is key to prevent potential complications such as blindness.
The rash will occur in a dermatomal pattern across the body, which means that the rash will cover an area of skin that is connected by the same set of nerves. Therefore, your doctor will be able to notice a dermatomal distribution and diagnose the condition.

, The quicker you start medical treatment for shingles, the less likely your risk of developing complications.


Preventing complications is key because the complications of shingles are, in many cases, more burdensome than the illness itself.
The complication of postherpetic neuralgia can lead to long-term chronic pain, and the likelihood of this can be greatly diminished with early treatment (as well as vaccination).
Having shingles around your eye can lead to serious eye problems and even blindness if not treated early.
The shingles blister may become infected with bacteria if not addressed and treated appropriately.

, Shingles itself is not contagious from person to person; however, someone who has never had chickenpox can catch chickenpox by being in contact with someone with shingles.


In particular, avoid your shingles blisters coming into contact with anyone else, as these can lead to direct spread of the VZV virus.
There have been some reports that children have spread the shingles virus to other children after being vaccinated. According to the CDC, there is no evidence to support the fact that an adult can spread shingles to children after vaccination.There are some doctors that are concerned about this fact. However, in normal circumstances it's unnecessary to avoid pregnant women and unvaccinated children after you get the shingles vaccine.

Wash your hands often.,
Do not share towels or clothing.,
Avoid sharing hair brushes and bar soap with others.",How to Prevent Molluscum (Molluscum Contagiosum)1," Perhaps the easiest and more effective way of preventing the spread of Molluscum contagiosum is to make sure you wash your hands after using the bathroom and after touching items or areas in public spaces. You should try to get in the habit of washing your hands often, as this will prevent the spread of viruses and diseases, such as Molluscum contagiosum., You should avoid sharing personal items like towels and clothing with others. This will prevent you from coming into contact with the virus, as it lives in skin cells and can be passed through towels or clothing.If you know someone who has had Molluscum contagiosum before, you should take extra care not to share towels or clothing with them. Molluscum contagiosum usually disappears within a year with the right medical treatment but it can recur and you can be infected by the disease again.

, You should also make an effort not to share hair brushes and bar soap with others, as Molluscum contagiosum can be spread through these items.You should be careful when sharing jewellery, especially wrist watches, as the skin cells that contain Molluscum contagiosum can be spread through jewellery.

Watch for symptoms on the skin.,
Be suspicious of cold symptoms.,
Recognize early symptoms to reduce exposure to persons at risk.",How to Recognize Chickenpox1," Approximately one or two days after developing a runny nose and sneezing, you may see red spots on your skin. These dots often start on the chest, face, and back, are often itchy, and can quickly spread to the rest of the body.These red spots will turn into red bumps and then small blisters (vesicles). These spots contain the virus and are highly contagious. These blisters will crust over in several days. After all the blisters are crusted, the person will no longer be contagious.Insect bites, scabies, other viral rashes, impetigo, and syphilis may look like chickenpox.;
, Chickenpox may first present as a mild cold, with a runny nose, sneezing, and a cough. You may even develop a fever up to around 101 degrees Fahrenheit. If the infected person were exposed to someone with chickenpox or breakthrough chickenpox (a milder form of the illness in someone who has received the vaccine), mild cold symptoms may really be the initial symptoms of the chickenpox., Chickenpox is highly contagious and dangerous to persons who have problems with their immune system, such as people undergoing chemotherapy for cancer or who have HIV or AIDS, and most babies, because children are not vaccinated against chickenpox until they are at least 12 months old."

Choose your oil.,
Warm up oil.,
Apply oil to your scalp.,
Comb the oil through the rest of your hair.,
Massage gently.,
Tip your head upside down.,
Hold this position for 4 minutes.,
Sit back up.,
Consider leaving the oil on for a longer period of time.,
Wash your hair.,
Repeat every 3-4 weeks.",How to Use the Inversion Method to Grow Hair," There is not one agreed upon oil for the inversion method. Try olive oil, castor oil, coconut oil, grape seed oil, or Moroccan argon oil, if you want to use natural ingredients.


Choose an oil with an aroma that you find soothing. Since the inversion method incorporates massage, pick a scented oil that you find relaxing.;
, Warm up around 3–4 tablespoon (44–59 ml) oil. Take a cup of hot water and place your oil bottle in it. You can get this water from the sink. Let the oil sit for a minute or so until it is warm to the touch. Your goal is to increase blood flow to your scalp. Warmer oil will increase the blood retention in your scalp cells. Do not overheat the oil. You don’t want to burn your scalp.

, If you’ve experienced hair loss, make sure that you cover your problem areas first, then proceed to cover the remainder of your scalp. Make sure that you cover your entire scalp with a thin layer of oil. It doesn't take a lot of oil to achieve full coverage., If your hair tends to split or break, try to spread oil to all of your hair. Hair splits or breaks when it is short on moisture and nutrients. Natural oils will help replenish both.


If you have curly hair, be gentle or avoid this step altogether. You don’t want to pull out more hair in the process., With the tips of your fingers, knead your scalp. Move your fingers in little circles - clockwise and then counterclockwise. Don't be afraid to use your palms in addition to your fingers.Your palms can apply pressure to a greater area at one time.Focus on your problem areas, but don’t forget about the rest of your scalp. Do not massage too hard or you might unintentionally rip out hair or damage hair follicles. Massage for 4 minutes and then stop., You can do this over a sink or bathtub. Alternatively, you could choose to sit upside down in a chair with your legs over the back of the chair. No matter how you choose to do it, let your hair hang loosely and hold your head at a comfortable angle. Your goal is to find a comfortable position and to relax.

, This gives the oils enough time to seep into your scalp while letting gravity increase the blood flow to the scalp. Take deep breaths. Clear your mind. Relax. This step resembles meditation., Come up slowly, or else you may feel dizzy, faint, or weak.You don't want to remain upside down too long. It can cause an unhealthy decrease in blood pressure.Do not try the inversion method if you have low or high blood pressure, a detached retina, an ear infection, a spinal injury, heart problems, a hernia, or are pregnant. The inversion position itself could exacerbate your condition or cause further injury., If you have an incredibly dry scalp, this might be a good decision. Some suggest leaving it in your hair for a couple of hours or even overnight.Take a plastic bag and cover your hair so you don't get any oil on your clothes, furniture, or bed. You can use a normal grocery bad or purchase a plastic wrap meant for hair treatments. You can purchase these from any beauty shop.
If you decide to leave the oil in your hair for longer period of time, know that it could make your scalp and hair too oily. This could cause your follicles to clog up rather than grow new hair., Be sure to completely rinse out all the leftover oil. If you miss a spot, it will be far ""greasier"" than the other parts of your head. Make sure that you don’t use a harsh shampoo. Harsher shampoos (with a pH higher than 7) will strip your hair’s natural oils.Shampoos like L'Oreal EverCreme Intense Nourishing or Heads and Shoulders work well. Generally, any shampoo geared towards dry scalps have lower pH balances. , Depending on your personal condition, you might find it helpful to perform this treatment every 3 weeks. Repeated use at a higher frequency could make your hair too oily and may even clog your hair follicles, further reducing your hair growth potential.Results will vary based on the person. Some may see results after the first use while others with more chronic follicle problems may not see results for several months. Some people may not see results at all.

Keep the mollucum lesions covered.,
Avoid contact sports and swimming.,
Do not have sexual intercourse until the lesions are treated.",How to Prevent Molluscum (Molluscum Contagiosum)2," If you discover you have Molluscum contagiosum, you should make every effort to keep the lesions covered and protected. This will prevent the spread of the disease and allow the lesions to heal properly. Cover the lesions with a bandage so no one can touch the lesions or come in contact with them. You should always keep the affected skin clean and dry to encourage healing.You should make an effort to not pick, scratch, or touch the lesions on your skin. Scratching and picking at the lesions can spread the virus to other parts of your body and to others.
Do not shave over the area with the lesions. This will only irritate them further.
You do not need to wear bandages over the mollucum lesions when there is no risk of coming in contact with others, such as you are sleeping or when you are alone at home. Keeping the lesions uncovered can help to keep your skin healthy.

, To prevent the spread of Molluscum Contagiosum you should avoid sports where you must have skin to skin contact with others, such as wrestling, basketball, and football. Cover the lesions with bandages or clothing if you do play contact sports to prevent the spread of the disease.Make sure you do not share any sports gear like helmets, baseball gloves, and balls with others. If you do share these items, only do so when your lesions are covered and protected with bandages.
You should also avoid swimming unless you can cover the lesions with watertight bandages. Avoid sharing personal items for swimming, such as towels, goggles, and swimsuits.

, Many adults contract Molluscum contagiosum due to having sexual intercourse with someone who has the disease. If you suspect you have Molluscum contagiosum, you should avoid having sex until your lesions have been treated by a doctor.Lesions that are in the genital area, such as the penis, the vulva, or the anus, should be treated by a medical professional. Leaving these untreated could lead to other health issues.

Look for bumps that are raised, round, and flesh colored.,
Note if the bumps are itchy and inflamed.,
Check your genitals for bumps.",How to Prevent Molluscum (Molluscum Contagiosum)3," Molluscum contagiosum often appears on your skin in the form of bumps that are raised, round, and flesh colored. These bumps are often small, about ¼ inch or less than 6 millimeters in diameter. There may also be a small indentation or dot in the center of the bumps.These bumps may appear as a rash, with multiple bumps appearing in one area of your body or several areas on your body. They may form in clusters on your body.

, Molluscum contagiosum bumps may also be itchy and turn red or become inflamed when you itch them. They may bust open or “pop” when you scratch or rub them, which will then spread the virus to the surrounding skin., Often, these bumps appear on your neck, face, armpits and the tops of hands, especially in children. But the Molluscum contagiosum bumps can also develop in the genital area, particularly in adults. You should check your genital area as well as your lower abdomen and upper inner thighs for these bumps, as they often form in these areas when the disease is contracted during sexual intercourse."
"
Be aware that the lesions may resolve on their own.,
Ask your doctor about physically removing the lesions.,
Talk to your doctor about oral therapy.,
Get a medicated cream from your doctor.",How to Prevent Molluscum (Molluscum Contagiosum)4," Research has not indicated that treatments for molluscum are any more effective than just letting the lesions go away on their own. However, you should discuss your personal situation with your doctor to find out what they recommend., The Molluscum contagiosum bumps or lesions can be removed using cryotherapy, where the lesion is frozen with liquid nitrogen, and laser therapy. Your doctor may also recommend piercing the core of the lesion and scraping out the pus like material inside, a process known as curettage. These treatments may be done under local anesthesia and may result in some skin irritation or scarring.You should never try and remove the lesions or the fluid inside the lesions on your own. Doing this can lead to spreading the disease to other parts of your body and to others. It also puts you at a higher risk of a bacterial infection.

, Your doctor may also recommend oral therapy for the lesions to avoid scarring and pain. Children are often prescribed oral therapy as it is safe, painless, and easy to administer. Your doctor may prescribe oral cimetidine for your lesions, to be taken at home according to your doctor’s dosage recommendations.Keep in mind oral cimetidine may not work as well on facial lesions as it will on lesions elsewhere on your body.

, Your doctor may prescribe podophyllotoxin cream for your lesions, which must be applied on each lesion on your body. This is a good home therapy for men but it is not recommended for pregnant women.Your doctor may also prescribe other medicated creams that contain iodine, salicylic acid, potassium hydroxide, tretinoin, cantharidin, and imiquimod.

Understand how the virus is transmitted.,
Know the incubation period.,
Recognize that older adolescents and adults have more complications.,
Call your doctor if the person with chickenpox is at higher risk for severe illness.,
Call the doctor if the person with chickenpox has these symptoms:


Fever that lasts longer than 4 days or goes over 102 FAny area of the rash that becomes warm, red, tender or begins leaking pus since this indicates a secondary bacterial infection
Difficulty waking up or becoming confused
Stiff neck or difficulty walking
Frequent vomiting
Severe cough
Difficulty breathing",How to Recognize Chickenpox2," The chickenpox virus is spread through the air or through direct contact, normally the product of unsanitary sneezing or coughing practices. The virus is transported in the fluid (i.e. saliva or mucus).


Touching an open sore caused by the virus or breathing it in (such as kissing a person with chickenpox) will also infect you.If you've encountered someone else who has a confirmed case of chickenpox, this will help you identify your own symptoms.

, The chickenpox virus does not produce symptoms immediately. In general, it can take 10 to 21 days after being exposed to develop any noticeable symptoms. The macular-papular rash will continue to appear over several days and the blisters will take several days to resolve. This means that you can have papular rash, vesicles and open blisters which are crusting over all at the same time.


Approximately 90% of susceptible close contacts not vaccinated will develop the illness after exposure., Although the chickenpox illness is not severe, it will cause more hospitalizations, deaths and complications in people who are adolescents and adults. The rash and vesicles can appear in the mouth, anus and vagina., Children older than 12 years, pregnant women or anyone with a compromised immune system (including the use of steroids which compromise the immune system) or who has asthma or eczema, are at greater risk for experiencing more severe symptoms.,"
"
Ask your doctor for medication if you have an extreme case or are at high risk for severe illness.,
Do not take aspirin or ibuprofen.,
Do not scratch the blisters or remove the scabs.,
Cool your blisters.,
Use calamine lotion to ease the itching.",How to Recognize Chickenpox3," The medications used to treat chickenpox are not given to everyone. In many cases, doctors won't prescribe harsh medicines to children, unless the infection looks like it could lead to pneumonia or another equally serious issue.For best results, antiviral medication must be given within the first 24 hours of the appearance of the rash.
If you have skin conditions such as eczema, lung conditions like asthma, were recently treated with steroids or have a compromised immune system, antiviral medication will be considered.
Some women who are pregnant may also qualify for administration of antiviral medication., Children especially should not take either and babies under six months old should not take ibuprofen at all. Aspirin has been associated with another serious condition called Reyes syndrome and Ibuprofen may lead to other secondary infections. Instead, take acetaminophen (Tylenol) to treat headaches or other pain or fevers resulting from chickenpox., Although the blisters and scabs are very itchy, it is important that you do not remove the scabs or scratch the rash. Removing a scab will cause that pox to scar and itching increases the risk of bacterial infections. Cut your child's finger nails if they cannot help scratching their blisters.

, Place cold compresses over the blisters. Take cooler bathes. The cooler temperature will help alleviate both the itching and fever that may accompany chickenpox.

, Take cool baths with baking soda or colloidal oatmeal or apply calamine lotion to help to ease the itching. If this doesn’t relieve the itching call your doctor for medication. The baths and calamine lotion will relieve itching (reduce the severity) but there isn’t anything that will completely take it away until the blisters have healed.


Calamine lotion can be purchased at any grocery store or pharmacy.

"
Ask your doctor about the chickenpox vaccine.,
Expose your child to the chickenpox early if you do not give the vaccine.,
Be aware of breakthrough cases of the chickenpox.",How to Recognize Chickenpox4," The vaccine is considered safe and given to young children before they are exposed to the illness. The first dose is given at 15 months and the second dose between 4 and 6 years of age.Getting chickenpox vaccine is much safer than getting chickenpox disease. Most people who get the chickenpox vaccine do not have any problems with it. However, a vaccine, like any medicine, is capable of causing serious problems, like severe allergic reactions. The risk of chickenpox vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small., Make sure to talk to your doctor about your decision. Vaccination is a personal choice for the parents. However, the older the child is when they get the illness, the worse they feel. If you choose to not give the vaccination, or if your child is or could be allergic to the vaccine, then try to expose them to the illness after age three and before age 10 to reduce symptoms and severity of the condition.

, Children who have had a vaccination can develop a milder form of the illness. They may only get approximately 50 spots and blisters which are less intense. This makes a diagnosis more difficult. However, they are as contagious as if they had the full blown illness.Adults are at risk for more severe disease and have a higher incidence of complications.
By far, the vaccination is preferable to so-called ""pox parties"" wherein parents purposefully infect their children. The vaccination may cause a mild case of chickenpox, but attending a pox party will most likely guarantee you or your child a full-blown case, which can lead to pneumonia and other terrible afflictions. In this case, you don't want to attend the party."

Wash and dry your skin frequently.,
Take particular care in keeping your feet clean and dry.,
Wash yourself immediately after playing contact sports.,
Don’t share used personal items with others.",How to Prevent Ringworm Infection1," Keeping your skin clean is the best way to prevent a ringworm infection. Dark, warm areas of your body are the spots where the fungus can grow most easily, but a ringworm infection can occur almost anywhere on your body. Wash your entire body with soap and water every day, making sure to give attention to your feet, groin, and scalp.Change your socks and underwear daily.
Physical activity in warm, humid weather or while wearing thick clothing in cold weather can increase the likelihood of an ringworm infection. Be sure to wash with soap and water after any physical activity that caused you to sweat heavily.;
, Feet provide the perfect environment for fungus to grow. To avoid exposing yourself to ringworm, wear sandals in locker rooms and public showers. Further, keep your toenails cut short and clean them whenever you wash the rest of your body.If possible, wear footwear that allow your feet access to air, such as supportive sandals.

, Take a shower as soon as you conclude playing a sport or anything else that involves skin-to-skin contact with other people. Use soap, and don’t forget to wash everywhere on your body that came into contact with others, as well as anywhere sweat may have collected, including your feet, groin, and scalp., Particularly if there is a chance someone may have ringworm, take care to avoid wearing anything that they’ve worn before it’s been properly cleaned. This may include either clothing or sporting equipment, such as a baseball helmet. Similarly, don’t use towels or sleep in sheets used by someone who may be infected with ringworm.Know that the fungi that cause infections such as ringworm can remain on many different types of items, from hairbrushes to furniture.Be sure to wear socks when using rental items such as bowling shoes or skates.

Repeat this process as recommended.",How to Use Minoxidil (Rogaine)1," Towel or blow-dry your hair as desired. You can apply Minoxidil to damp hair.;
,, Minoxidil comes in two forms: liquid (for men and women) and foam (for men).


Liquid: Load the applicator. Fill the applicator with 1 milliliter (0.034  fl oz). minoxidil solution, or use 20 drops.
Foam: Invert the can and dispense about 1/2 a cap full of foam onto your fingers.

, Part your hair where it's thinning, and evenly apply the minoxidil to the affected area, rubbing it in with your fingers. Wash any residue off your hands.

, Allow the applied minoxidil to dry completely—about 20 to 25 minutes—before adding other hair-styling products such as gels, mousses. Apply it about 2 hours before going to bed.

, Generally, this is twice a day—in the morning, and in the evening—or as often as your doctor recommends.

Be vigilant with children who have other skin problems, such as eczema.,
Watch for secondary bacterial infections.,
Be aware of other serious complications from chickenpox.,
Watch for shingles in adults, especially over the age 40, if you had chickenpox as a child.",How to Recognize Chickenpox5," Children who have a history of skin problems can develop thousands of blisters. This can be painful and increase the risk of scarring. Use the treatments described above to reduce the itching and talk with your physician about other topical and oral medications to reduce the discomfort and pain., Areas of blisters can become infected with bacteria. They will be warm, redder, tender to touch and can also leak pus. The pus is darker in color and not clear the way the fluid from the vesicles is. Call your doctor if you notice these changes to areas of the skin. This bacterial infection must be treated with antibiotics.Bacterial infections can also affect other tissue, bone, joints and even include the bloodstream, called sepsis.
Each of these infections are dangerous and require immediate medical attention.
Symptoms of more generalized infection to the bone, joint or bloodstream include:
Fever over 101 F
Area is warm and tender to touch (bone, joint, tissue)
Joint is tender or painful to use.
Trouble breathing
Chest pain
Worsening cough
General feeling of being really sick. Most children have a fever that resolves early with the chickenpox and although they have symptoms of a cold, they will often still play, smile and want to go for a walk. Children who are septic (infection in the blood) will be quiet, want to sleep often, have a fever over 101 F, increased heart rate and increased rate of respirations (more than 20 breaths per minute)., Although not common, these complications are very dangerous and can result in death.Dehydration during which the body does not have enough fluid to function properly. This affects the brain, blood and kidneys first. Signs of dehydration include decreased or concentrated urination, being tired, weak, or dizzy, or having a fast heart ratePneumonia with symptoms of increased cough, fast or troubled breathing, or chest pain
Bleeding problems
Infection or inflammation of the brain. Children will become quiet, sleepy and complain of a headache. They may be confused or difficult to arouse.
Toxic shock syndrome, Shingles is a painful, blistered rash that happens on one side of the body, trunk or face that can cause numbness and which is caused by the same virus which causes Chickenpox. The virus remains dormant in the body until later years when the immune system is not as strong. Pain, often burning pain, and numbness often resolves within weeks but other long-term damage can occur to the eyes and organs if they are affected. Post-herpetic neuralgia is a painful neurological condition that is difficult to treat and can result from shingles.Call your doctor right away if you think you may have shingles, as antiviral medications are often prescribed for this, especially if it is caught early. Older adults may benefit from a vaccination for shingles.

Recognize signs of ringworm infection on the skin.,
Watch for ringworm on the scalp and nails as well.,
Watch children in particular for signs of ringworm.,
Begin treatment as soon as possible.,
Treat ringworm on your skin with over-the-counter products.,
Treat more serious cases with prescriptions antifungal medication.",How to Prevent Ringworm Infection2," Ringworm is often visibly apparent, as it usually results in red, scaly patches or rounded bumps on the skin. Even before there are visible signs, however, an infected patch of skin will become very itchy. Actual rings of reddened, raised, and scaly skin may develop, though ringworm may be present without these rings.Neither athlete’s foot nor jock itch lead to the formation of actual rings. Rather, these infections will lead to itchy, red, and scaly patches.
Avoid scratching or otherwise irritating ringworm infections, as this may spread the infection and can also lead to bacterial superinfection.

, Ringworm on the scalp usually appears initially as a small round bump that may look like a pimple; however, the spot will quickly become flaky, irritated, red, and/or scaly.Hair may even fall out. Additionally, watch for lightening of the color of the nails, or increased brittleness, as these symptoms may also indicate a ringworm infection.

, Children are especially likely to be exposed to ringworm, and are less likely to acknowledge initial symptoms as signs of an infection that needs to be addressed. Further, schools are sites at which outbreaks of ringworm commonly occur. As such, watch out for signs of infection in kids and get children treated as quickly as possible.Factors that increase the risk of ringworm infection in children also include more frequent use of communal showers, participation in contact sports, and suppressed immune systems. These all also contribute to the rapid spread of ringworm among children.

, Regardless of the site or intensity of an infection or the age of the person infected, act immediately to treat the infection and prevent its spread.In particular, ensure any children that are infected or at risk of infection are washing frequently.

, Many cases of ringworm, particularly athlete’s foot and jock itch, can be treated with non-prescription medications. There are various lotions, creams, gels, sprays and powders you can apply to affected areas every day. These medications should clear your infection within to to four weeks.Look for a medication that includes clotrimazole, miconazole, terbinafine, or ketoconazole.
Follow the specific instructions on the packaging of whichever over-the-counter medication you acquire. Usually, you’ll want to cover the visible infection and the area immediately surround the infection.
Note that creams, lotions, and powders will not rid a case of ringworm on the scalp.

, If your ringworm infection worsens or persists beyond a few weeks, see a doctor. Ringworm on the scalp is especially likely to persist without prescription medications, which are often prescribed as oral medications that will need to be taken for one to three months.Your doctor may check your liver function with a blood test before starting the oral medications. Some antifungal medications can have adverse affects on the liver, especially in those with liver disease.
There are several antifungal prescription medications, including griseofulvin, terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole.

Wash your hands after touching your pet.,
Protect your own skin if your pet is infected.,
Disinfect the areas where your pet likes to spend time.",How to Prevent Ringworm Infection3," You should always wash your hands with soap and water immediately after playing with your pets, as cats and dogs can both catch ringworm, not to mention various other illnesses. If you believe your pet may have ringworm, take them to the vet as soon as possible. In the meantime, take steps to prevent you or anyone else from catching ringworm from your pet.If your pet’s hair becomes patchy, or you’ve noticed scratching more frequently than usual, get them to vet!

, Wear clothing with long sleeves and gloves when handling a pet that may be infected with ringworm. If your immune system is in any way compromised by illness or medication, do not handle the pet at all.If the vet reports that your pet does indeed have ringworm, be sure to have any other pets checked as well.

, Ringworm may be present on bits of your pet’s skin and hairs that are shed around your home. Clean any of the areas where they spend time, including any furniture or bedding.Use a gallon of water with a ¼ cup of bleach added, a cleaning solution with benzalkonium chloride, or a strong detergent to clean surfaces and materials.

Understand the effect is temporary.,
Use the recommended amount of minoxidil.,
Don't make up missed applications.",How to Use Minoxidil (Rogaine)2," Minoxidil is not a permanent cure for baldness, and will only be effective as long as you use it at least twice a day, every day.


Use your phone to set a twice-a-day reminder, until it becomes an automatic habit.

, Additional amounts or more frequent applications will not improve your results; you'll only waste product.

, If you skip an application, don't double up the next day. Simply pick back up where you left off.

"
"
Expect shedding hair.,
Be patient.",How to Use Minoxidil (Rogaine)3," While it seems counter-intuitive, shedding hair means that new growth has begun. This may last a few weeks, but it is just temporary: the shedding hair is older hair that would have fallen out, making room for the newer, healthier hair., New hair growth usually takes about four months, though some have results earlier than that. New hair growth may be soft and downy, like peach fuzz.


Eventually, new hairs growing in will be the same color and thickness as your normal hair. To maintain this growth, you will need to continue using minoxidil.

Limit your exposure to the sun.,
Use sunscreen.,
Cover yourself up.,
Avoid artificial tanning.,
Examine your body.,
Go for a checkup.,
Visit a dermatologist.,
Have a biopsy done on your mole.,
Be careful at work.,
Keep your hobbies safe.,
Research your family history.,
Take extra care if you have a light skin tone.,
Stay well overall.",How to Prevent Melanoma," Melanoma begins in your body’s melanocytes (the cells responsible for producing your body’s pigment or color). Ultraviolet rays from the sun interact with these melanocytes, causing them to produce a dark protective pigment. If your melanocytes are overexposed to ultraviolet rays, melanoma can begin to form. Malignant tumors are a result of cumulative cellular effects of UV light and inability of skin to mount a defense to it. Melanomas have ability to metastasize to any organ, including brain. While you may think your dark tan looks healthy, you’re actually damaging your skin.When you are outside, look for shade. By staying in the shade, you prevent your skin from taking the full force of the ultraviolet rays produced by the sun.
It only takes ten minutes of direct sun exposure for your body to get the recommended amount of vitamin D.
Just one peeling sunburn can double your risk of getting melanoma in the future.
The sun’s ultraviolet rays are usually at their strongest from ten in the morning to four in the afternoon. Try not to plan your outdoor activities between those time.;
, The American Academy of Dermatology recommends that everyone generously apply a water-resistant, broad spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher. Apply about an ounce of sunscreen and spread it over any parts of your body that will be exposed to the sun.


You should still wear sunscreen on cloudy days. Ultraviolet rays can actually penetrate your skin through the clouds.
Buy broad spectrum protection sunscreen. All sunscreen protects your skin from UVB rays (short wave ultraviolet rays) but it may not protect your skin from UVA rays (long wave ultraviolet rays). Make sure the bottle says your sunscreen is effective against both.Reapply sunscreen every two hours and after swimming or sweating profusely.

, While you’re out in the sun, wear clothes that cover as much of your body as possible. Long sleeve shirts, pants that cover your legs and long skirts can help protect you from the sun. Thick knit clothing will provide better protection than clothes made of thin material.


Wide- or long-brimmed hats keep your scalp safe and provide shade. They provide more protection than baseball caps or visors.
Sunglasses will keep the sun away from your eyes and the skin around them. Choose polarized sunglasses to decrease the risk of developing cataracts.
Look into clothing and swimwear that is made with special fabrics that protect you from the sun.
Dark colors are more effective against the sun than light ones. A white t-shirt only offers a mere SPF boost of about four., Tanning beds and lamps can drastically increase your risk of getting melanoma. They directly expose your body to intense ultraviolet radiation with little to no protection. In a tanning bed, you’ll receive five times the amount of damaging UVA rays that you would be exposed to with natural sunlight. There is a significant scientific evidence that indoor tanning before age 30 is linked to increased risk of developing the disease.You may think that after getting a “base tan” from a tanning bed, you’ll be less likely to get melanoma because you won’t get sunburns; however, people who don’t burn in the sun are at a higher risk for getting melanoma because they typically don’t take measures to protect themselves.
UVA rays penetrate your skin deeper than UVB rays and can cause your skin to age and wrinkle faster than normal.
Tanning beds can also be a breeding ground for harmful bacteria if they are not properly maintained.
Remember that tan is an evidence of injury to the skin. The thinner skin of children and teens is particularly vulnerable to damage from UV radiation.

, At least once a month, search your entire body for signs that melanoma may be forming. Look at your body from head to toe. Use a mirror to inspect the parts of your body you can’t see like your face, back, neck and the backs of your legs. Get your partner to examine some of the hard-to-see areas, like the top of your head. Remember to look at the places where the sun doesn’t shine, like the soles of your feet, behind your knees or your buttocks (this is especially true for people of color, as skin cancer in people of color is often found on areas of the body that aren’t typically exposed to the sun). Insignificant freckles or spots on your skin usually aren’t cause for alarm but you should watch out for abnormal moles or marks that may be growing or changing shapes. You can use ABCDE mnemonic to remember signs of cancerous moles.A is for asymmetry. Your mole is asymmetrical. Both halves of it look different.
B is for border. The border of your mole is uneven with notched instead of round edges.
C is for color. The color is changing or the mole consists of multiple colors. Your mole may be darker than a normal mole on your body or parts of it may turn red or purple.
D is for diameter. Your mole is larger than 6 millimeters (the size of the pencil eraser).
E is for evolution or change. If your mole is changing, it might be a time to schedule an appointment with your dermatologist. If your mole changes between self exams, then melanoma may be growing.

, Periodically, you should have your physician take a look at your skin to make sure melanoma is not growing. Early detection of melanoma plus regular skin exams are extremely important. During a general checkup, the doctor won’t have time to inspect your entire body so be prepared before you go in. Direct your doctor to take a look at any specific areas that you may be concerned about.People under the age of forty should see a physician at least once every three years.
People older than forty should see a physician at least once a year.

, If you or your doctor come across any areas of your skin that you are particularly concerned about, it might be a good idea to seek out the expertise of a dermatologist. A dermatologist specializes in treating a person’s skin and will have the training and equipment to accurately evaluate whether or not you have melanoma. A dermatologist will be able to do a total body exam and record and measure all of your moles which may provide a good baseline for the future visits.


A dermatologist will be able to examine the deeper pigment of your skin with the use of an ultraviolet lamp.
A dermatologist will have the experience to identify melanoma with more certainty than a normal doctor.
A dermatologist may perform an excision biopsy on any suspicious mole.

, To perform a biopsy, your dermatologist will cut off a tiny piece of a mole in order to test it in a lab. The detached tissue can be examined closely under a microscope and tested to see if it is in fact melanoma. If the dermatologist fears that the melanoma could have spread to other parts of your body, she might ask to do a biopsy of lymph nodes near the area as well.


A biopsy is nothing to be afraid of. It’s a very minor procedure and the doctor will use anesthesia so you shouldn’t experience any pain.
Biopsies allow doctors to look at tissue more closely than other methods like x-rays.

, People who have jobs that force them to be outdoors constantly have a higher risk of getting melanoma than people who work inside. If you work outside or are exposed to intense sunlight at your job, be sure to take every precaution you can to protect yourself from the sun. Some examples jobs that could put you at risk include:


Lifeguard
Pilot
Farmer
Construction worker
Sailor/Sailing instructor
Garbage collector

, Even if you don’t work outside for most of the week, you should still protect yourself on the weekends. Bursts of ultraviolet rays can increase your chance of getting melanoma, especially if you spend most of your time indoors.If you enjoy being outdoorsy on your days off, take good care of your skin.


Office workers have a higher risk of getting melanoma than most careers. This is because they’re skin isn’t used to being in the sun. When they do go out in their free time, the sun wreaks extra havoc on them.
Always use copious amounts of sunscreen if you play outside sports like sand volleyball or golf.

, If people in your family have had melanoma, then you may have a greater risk of getting it yourself. Gene mutations can be passed down from one generation to the next. It’s possible that your family’s genes are more susceptible to melanoma than those of other people.


You can have your DNA tested by a geneticist to get a complete understanding of all the conditions you might be prone to., It’s easier for people with lighter skin to get melanoma. The dark pigment in people’s skin serves to protect them from ultraviolet rays. Lighter skinned people also burn much easier than darker skinned people. If you have light skin tone, you should be very cautious about spending time in the sun.


People with blond hair and blue eyes also have a higher risk of getting melanoma.

, Take care of your overall heath by eating well, getting enough rest, and exercising. Keeping your body and immune system in top form may help your body battle cancerous cells.

Eat foods rich in antioxidants, such as legumes, kale, green leafy vegetables, carrots, fish (especially salmon), fruits, whole grains, and flax seed.
Take recommended daily doses of antioxidant supplements, including beta carotene, selenium, vitamin C, vitamin E and fish oils.
Drink one to two glasses of red wine a day. Resveratrol, a polyphenol found in the skins of grapes, has a potent anti-cancer properties and becomes concentrated in red wine during the fermentation process.
Avoid other forms of alcohol other than red wine, as alcohol in general is detrimental to a person’s health in many ways and suppresses the immune system.

Order wisely.",How to Eat to Lower Blood Pressure," Sodium can significantly affect how high your blood pressure is. Salt is the first element of your diet you will need to tackle to lower your blood pressure. Talk to your doctor about the amount of salt you should eat: the human body needs a small amount of salt; so eliminating it entirely can cause health problems.Most adults can consume up to 2,300 mg of sodium a day without significant health risks.But, many food products have several hundred mg of sodium in one small serving. The total can grow astronomically; so read labels and avoid extra salt.


If your blood pressure is high, your doctor might recommend you eat 1,500 mg of sodium a day. That's about half a teaspoon of salt.
You might be advised to keep your sodium intake below 1,500 mg if you have been diagnosed with kidney disease or diabetes.
Your doctor might advise you to watch your sodium if you are from a high-risk population. All women over 65 and men over 45 are at an increased risk of high blood pressure. Black men and women are prone to high blood pressure and serious complications.;
, Most of the salt and sugar you consume comes from processed foods, such as soup, chips, bread, many cereals, cakes/donuts — and mackerel/sardines, canned meats, cured meats as well as lunch meats, plus pork that has ""water added"". Prepared frozen foods, restaurant or any other meal you can buy ""to go"" is likely to be packed with sodium. North Americans eat almost twice as much salt as they should, and ¾ of that salt comes from processed foods.Foods that do not appear salty are still high sodium if they have been processed and are not marked ""low sodium.""


Cooking fresh food from unprocessed ingredients is the biggest step toward cutting salt from your diet.

, 100% unsweetened cocoa powder stirred into natural peanut butter or sprinkled over fruit with stevia makes a great snack. Eating fewer sweets is a question of lowering your sugar craving. Limited sugar will provide you with special treats and fewer health problems, as you eat it sparingly. Gradually lower sweetness of treats. Try out desserts that are sweetened with fruit, applesauce or fruit juice. Make a smoothie, juice, or mango lassi for a dessert. Lowering sugar in fruit ices, sorbets, and lemonade creates a healthier option.


Cocoa has antioxidant flavanols that you can take advantage of by eating a small amount (up to 1 ounce ) per day of dark chocolate. It reduces cell damage, helps lower blood pressure and improves vascular function..
Baked or poached fruit can be an elegant dessert for company. Poach pears or other seasonal fruit in juice, and serve with a dollop of yogurtor a garnish of fresh fruit and citrus zest (shredded peelings).
Baking low sugar/low salt granola bars and nutty cookies at home can provide you with healthy sweet snacks throughout the week.
Use applesauce in place of shortening in cookies and loaf cake.
Use plain or unsweetened flavored protein powder in place of flour in biscuits, waffles and pancakes, plain for thickening sauce or chili-con-carne.
Cut down on sugary drinks of all kinds (try stevia or stevia blends; it's an acquired taste so be patient). If you have a sweet drink, such as a soda (even sugar-free), it still counts toward your five or fewer sweets. Try to cut carbonated sodas/pops and sugary fruit drinks out of your diet entirely: it is probably the top source of added sugar in your diet., Eat whole grains rather than refined grains. Whole grains have more of the nutrients and fiber you need.They also tend to be more flavorful than refined grains, which you will appreciate as you start limiting your salt intake. Substitute brown rice (it must be cooked slowly) for white rice, whole-wheat pasta for regular pasta, and whole-grain bread for white bread.


Experiment with a variety of grains. Eliminate white flour. Use quinoa, bulgur, oats, amaranth, and barley, all good sources of whole grains.

, Vegetables provide you with the vitamins you need to lower your blood pressure, as well as valuable dietary fiber, and minerals such as potassium and magnesium. To increase the amount of vegetables in your diet, incorporate them into your main dish instead of only eating them on the side. Hearty, flavorful vegetables such as sweet potato (with low added sugar) and squash (sliced and sautéed, mashed) provide an excellent main dish. Don't be afraid to buy large amounts of vegetables at once: you can freeze the ones you don't use.


If you are vegetable-shy, try buying and cooking one new kind of vegetable a week. Find a few recipes that focus on that vegetable and try them out.
Opt for fresh or frozen vegetables. When you buy canned vegetables, make sure they have no added salt, or are labeled ""no sodium.""
Try including at least two vegetables in every meal: one green (kale, broccoli, spinach, collards) and one brightly colored (tomatoes, carrots, peppers, squash).
Use vegetables for your starch and eliminate flour products. Skip chips, high-sodium bread and pasta and replace them with delicious pieces of boiled or mashed potatoes, turnips, or parsnips.
Eat the skins of fruits and veggies. Much of the flavor and the nutrients of vegetables are found in the skin. Just make sure you clean them thoroughly.
Save the stalks. Freeze any part of the vegetable you don't eat in a bag. When the bag is full, boil it with onion and garlic for a few hours to make a vegetable stock. Strain out the vegetables, add a tiny pinch of salt and some lemon juice or vinegar, and use it as a broth.

, Fruit is mouthwatering, delicious and is full of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Fruit can be a snack, a dessert, and can also be treated like a vegetable and served with green salad, fried, or cooked into a sauce. Low-fat yogurtwith fruit and some nuts makes an excellent breakfast. Try eating fruits in season, when they are sweetest, or buy them frozen for smoothies and cooking.


Eat the fruit peel for extra fiber and roughage. Apples, pears, plums, and even fuzzy peaches can be eaten with the peel on.
Like vegetables, fruits can be frozen when they are overripe and enjoyed later.
Juice can count as a serving of fruit. Buy 100 percent fruit juice with no sugar added.
Grapefruit juice and other citrus juices can interfere with certain medications, so be sure to check with your health care provider before increasing consumption.

, Meat gives you protein, vitamins, and minerals. Opt for poultry and fish over beef. Fish such as salmon, herring, and tuna are high in omega-3 fatty acids (and consider taking a purified/concentrated omega-3 oil capsule high in DHA and EHA), and can help lower your cholesterol. Broil, bake, grill, poach, or roast your meat instead of frying it. Avoid sandwich meats and sausages unless they are marked ""low sodium"" or ""no sodium."" Some servings of sandwich meat contain more than a quarter of your daily recommended sodium.The meat you buy should be marked ""lean"" or ""extra lean,"" and poultry should be skinless.
Vegetarians can follow the DASH diet by combining the ""meat"" and ""nuts, seeds, and legumes"" categories, and eating that many servings of nuts, seeds and legumes.
Even if you aren't a vegetarian, try substituting soybean-based products, such as tofu and tempeh, for meat dishes. They contain all the amino acids you need to form a complete protein.

, Milk, plain yogurt, and real cheese can give you calcium, vitamin D, and protein. They can also be high-sodium and high-fat, so don't eat too much of them. Yoghurt is not high sodium, can be bought fat-free, and contains probiotics that are good for your digestion. Buy plain yogurt with no added sugar and add fruit. Yoghurt is good on its own and can also be substituted for cream/sour cream.Put yogurt on your tacos or chili instead of sour cream.
Stir some yogurt into your soup for a creamy finish.
Mix yogurt with chopped garlic and herbs for a vegetable dip.
Substitute frozen yogurt for ice cream, or just serve a scoop of plain yogurt with your apple pie.
Drink milk instead of buying a ""muscle"" or ""protein"" drink. Most designer workout drinks rely on milk proteins and not much else. Milk is cheaper and better for you.

, Nuts, seeds, and legumes have omega-3 fatty acids, protein, fiber, minerals and phytochemicals. They can also be high in calories and fats, which is why they are recommended for weekly rather than daily consumption. A serving size might be 1/3 cup of nuts, 1/2 cup of cooked legumes, 2 tablespoons of natural peanut butter or seeds.


Vegetarians should combine this category with the ""meats"" servings and eat 10 – 16 servings of nuts, seeds, and legumes a week.
Eat tofu, tempeh, or rice and beans to get a complete protein.Try topping your yogurt with different kinds of nuts and seeds instead of buying a sugary granola. Almonds, walnuts/pecans, peanuts, cashews, and sesame/chia, shelled pumpkin seeds and flax seeds are all delicious snacks.
Experiment with different beans. If you normally eat peas, try kidney beans, black-eyed peas, or lentils.

, Fat is good for your immune system, but it's easy to eat too much of it. A serving of fat is small: 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise or 1 teaspoon of margarine will do it. Avoid over consumption of meat, butter, cheese, whole milk, cream, and eggs. Avoid margarine/oleo, lard, shortenings, and palm and coconut oil. Eliminate trans fat, which used in processed foods for smoothness and flavor, fried foods (such as breaded fish, meat, and donuts) and commercially baked goods.


Read labels to cut down on trans fats.Cook with olive oil, canola oil, vegetable oil, sesame oil, and peanut oil. Olive oil and toasted sesame oil are both excellent in salad dressing. Stir oil and vinegar (apple cider vinegar, wine vinegar, lemon juice) for quick, cheap salad dressing. Add a pinch of black pepper, garlic, paprika or stevia for extra flavor.

, Servings can be difficult to calculate, and vary wildly depending on the product. A piece of toast might be one serving of grains, but a bowl of cereal could be easily double the recommended serving size. To calculate servings, find food you use frequently and measure out your typical serving size. Then calculate how many servings it actually is. From there, you can adjust your daily intake.If you find you are over-serving, consider buying smaller dishes. You are far likelier to overestimate how much food you need if you are serving into large dishes.Consider investing in a small kitchen scale, which will allow you measure by weight rather than volume. This is especially helpful for determining servings of cereal and pasta.

, By recording all the food you consume, you will be able to easily evaluate the problem areas in your diet. Tracking what you eat will also help you shop smarter at the grocery store and be pickier when eating out at restaurants. Set a goal for yourself and follow it with your diary. Your doctor may also be interested in reviewing your consumption when you visit.


Take a picture of your meal with your cell phone to use it to write down what you ate, later.
Tracking your consumption is not necessary for some people. If you have not been advised to watch your blood pressure, lose weight, or track your food, talk to a doctor or therapist before you begin tracking., The easiest and cheapest way to eat well is to cook at home. Make time on your days off to cook ahead for busy days. Make foods like rice and beans, soup, and baked vegetables in large batches and store in the fridge. Freeze the leftovers. Label any food you freeze, to ensure you eat it before it loses flavor. Many community centers offer free cooking lessons: see what is available in your area.


Make as many parts of your meal from scratch as you can. For instance, if you are going to make spaghetti, don't buy a canned sauce. Buy tomatoes or canned tomatoes, add onions, and garlic, and make a delicious sauce at home in minutes (let it simmer for best results).

, To build a low-salt, healthy, welcoming kitchen, buy groceries that will contribute to your health goals. Buy fresh, local, in-season food if you can afford it. If you have SNAP, or food stamps, see if you can use them at your local farmer's market. You can double the value of your SNAP benefits by spending them at farmers markets.Buy as many one-ingredient items as possible: fruits, vegetables, flour, raw meat.


Don't forget to read the label when you buy processed food. Check for labels that read ""low sodium"" or ""sodium free."" Compare different products, and buy the ones with the lowest amount of sodium.
Foods that read ""no salt added"" or ""unsalted"" are not necessarily salt-free.

, If you are eating out, go to a restaurant where food is made to order. Ask the waiter for low-sodium options. Order your sauce on the side, and avoid ordering fried, stuffed, or sautéed food. Order food described as poached, grilled, steamed, roasted, or baked. Fast food is rarely low in sodium.


If you must order fast food, order grilled chicken or a plain small hamburger instead of a cheeseburger. Skip the soda, chips and don't order jumbo anything.
Plan this strategy: Only eat half of what is served on your plate. You can even ask the server when ordering to put half of your dish in a to-go box and only serve you the other half.
Check whether the menu is online before you go. You may also be able to find out some of the nutritional content of the food before you get to the restaurant.

Juice the garlic.,
Make a honey mixture.,
Brew chamomile tea.,
Finish the salve.,
Use the salve.,
Wash your hair.,
Finish the cycle.",How to Use Garlic As a Hair Loss Remedy1," To help combat hair loss, you can make a garlic hair salve. Start off with six to eight cloves of garlic. Peel the garlic cloves. Use a garlic press to get 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of garlic juice from these cloves.


If you don't get enough juice from these cloves, juice more cloves until you do.;
, Once you've juiced the garlic, set it aside. Grab some honey and measure out 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml). Mix the honey into the small bowl of garlic juice and put the mixture in the refrigerator. , While your mixture chills in the fridge, you need to brew some tea. Take two bags of chamomile tea or three tablespoons of loose leaf tea. Add it to a pot of water and place it on the stove. Let it simmer in 24 ounces of water for 30 minutes.


Once the tea has brewed for the right amount of time, pour the mixture into a cup. If you used loose leaf tea, strain the tea as you do so. , Once the tea is done, take the honey and garlic mixture out of the fridge. Mix one egg yolk into the mixture. It may take a minute to get it combined because the honey will be thick and stubborn. Next, add one tablespoon of aloe vera gel and mix together well. , Once all the ingredients are combined, go to a place where you can easily apply it to your hair without making a mess. Gently massage the mixture into your scalp, not all of your hair. Since the hair grows from the scalp, you want to concentrate the garlic salve here. After it is all on your scalp, wrap a clean, cotton towel around your head.


Leave the mixture on your scalp for 20 minutes., After you've waited long enough, wash the mixture out of your hair with baby shampoo or another very gentle shampoo. Rinse it out thoroughly. Next, take a second egg yolk and massage that into your scalp. Rinse this off with warm water.


Make sure you get all the egg yolk out of your hair. Do not wash it again, just keep rinsing the yolk out., Once the yolk is out of your hair and off your scalp, you need to use the chamomile tea. Take the cup of tea and pour it over your scalp, rinsing your hair once again with it. Do this two to three times a week until hair re-growth begins or shedding stops.


Repeat the treatment twice a month."

Check in with your doctor before adding strength training.It's unlikely that your physician would recommend you start a strength training program directly out of the hospital.,
Stay active throughout the day.,
Look for signs that your heart is working too hard.,
Prevent injuries and accidents.,
Avoid exercising outdoors when temperatures are high or low.",How to Exercise After a Heart Attack," Make sure your doctor has cleared you for exercise before starting an exercise program. When your heart is damaged from lack of oxygen it takes several weeks to heal and return to the best function it can. You may undergo a stress test before leaving the hospital, which can give your doctor a good idea of the level of physical activity you can handle. Generally, there's not a typical amount of time you need to wait before exercising. Your doctor will decide your specific exercise time frame based on your current health, the extent of your heart damage, and your physical condition before the attack.


Your physician will recommend that you do not stress the heart muscle with exercise or sex until the muscle has healed.;
, Exercise will help strengthen your heart muscle, improve oxygen efficiency, reduce your blood pressure, stabilize your blood sugar, reduce the potential for diabetes, help manage stress and weight and help lower your cholesterol levels. All of these factors will also help to reduce your risk for another heart attack.Start your rehabilitation with aerobic exercise, or cardio.


Anaerobic exercise is exercise that is at an intensity high enough to trigger the formation of lactic acid, which can build up in your heart. Anaerobic training is used primarily for non-endurance sports to promote strength, speed, and power. This type of exercise should be avoided after a heart attack.
The anaerobic threshold is the point at which you cross from performing aerobically to anaerobically. Endurance athletes train to raise that threshold so they can perform at higher levels of intensity without lactic acid formation.

, Everyone recovers from a heart attack at a different rate. The rate of recovery is affected by the amount of heart muscle that was damaged and your physical fitness before the heart attack. During cardiac rehabilitation, your therapists will monitor your exercise program with electrocardiograms and blood pressure to prevent injury. Once you have completed six to 12 weeks of supervised cardiac rehabilitation you can be released to perform your exercise program at home.People who are involved in a cardiac rehabilitation program prescribed by the physician or through a team will have better long-term outcomes and recover faster.Despite this fact, only approximately 20% of qualifying patients are recommended to receive cardiac rehabilitation or a prescribed exercise program after a heart attack. Those numbers are lower for women and older patients., Take your pulse at your wrists and not your neck (carotid artery). You may inadvertently block the carotid artery while taking your pulse. Place the first two fingers (not your thumb, since it has its own pulse) of one hand on your wrist just below the thumb of the other hand. You should feel your pulse. Count the number of times you feel the pulsation during a 10 second period and then multiply that number by six.


You will want to keep track of how fast your heart is pumping so you can keep your heart rate within a range you determine with your medical provider.
This range will be different depending upon your age, weight, fitness level and amount of heart damage you suffered.

, Sex is a form of exercise. Many times after a heart attack you will be referred to wait two to three weeks before having sex. This time frame depends on the amount of damage to the heart and your stress test results.


Your doctor may also determine that you should wait longer than three weeks before having sex.

, With your doctor's permission, you can often start stretching in the hospital. Try to stretch at least once a day to get your body ready for exercise. Remember to relax and breathe through the stretches. Keep your joints slightly bent and never locked during stretching to prevent injuries. You should also avoid bouncing your muscles. Instead, stretch smoothly and hold the stretch for 10 to 30 seconds. Repeat stretches three to four times.


Stretching does not improve muscle strength or heart efficiency, but it does improve your flexibility, allow you to do different types of exercises more easily, improve your balance and will relieve muscle tension., Whether you were a marathon runner before the heart attack or a couch potato, your exercise program after a heart attack starts with a walking program.Do a walking warm up for three minutes. Then work up to a pace at which you are breathing heavier than when you’re sitting, but you can still talk and carry on a conversation. Walk for approximately 5 minutes at this pace. Add about one or two minutes to your daily walk each day until you are walking 30 minutes every day.


Walk with a partner for the first several weeks and stay close to home in case you become uncomfortable or very out of breath. Carry a cell phone with you in case you need help from home or to call 911 in case of an emergency.
Remember to cool down after your workout.

, Avoid strenuous activity during the four to six weeks after your heart attack. It takes your heart approximately six weeks to heal enough for moderate to heavy exercise even if you were in fairly good condition before your heart attack. Avoid things like: heavy lifting or pulling, vacuuming, scrubbing, sweeping, painting, running, mowing or sudden bursts of movement. You can start doing things like walking on a flat surface for a few minutes at a time, cooking, washing dishes, shopping, light gardening and light housework.


Increase your exercise time and intensity gradually without ever crossing over into anaerobic exercise.
Expect that your leg and arm muscles may be sore in the hours and days following the start of a program. They shouldn't be sore or feel painful during the exercise.

, Just as if you were starting an exercise program before a heart attack, you’ll want to increase your time and intensity gradually. This will reduce your potential for injury and keep you motivated. Don’t start increasing the time or intensity until your physician has cleared you to do more than walking for 30 minutes. It can take up to 12 weeks to be comfortable walking 30 minutes briskly depending upon the amount of heart damage and your previous fitness level.


Once you are comfortable walking briskly for 30 minutes once a day you can begin to incorporate other types of exercise such as biking, hiking, rowing, jogging or tennis.

, Instead, you should ask your physician about starting a strength training program.


You can use hand weights at home or a set of resistance bands that you stand on or anchor in a doorway. Resistance bands can be used for both arms and legs and will let you gradually increase the amount of resistance and energy you expend.
Give your muscles time to recover in between sessions, so don't strength train more than three times a week and wait at least 48 hours in between each session.
Strength training will also increase the likelihood you’ll be able to return to your previous level of activities, such as mowing the lawn, playing with the grandchildren and bringing in the groceries. Strength training will reduce the potential that you’ll suffer from more inactivity and muscle wasting.
Do not hold your breath while you are lifting weights or moving against the resistance bands. This increases the pressure in your chest and places a greater workload on your heart.

, Once you've exercised, don't stay in a chair the rest of the day. Research has determined that although you may exercise for up to one hour a day, if you remain in your chair for the next eight hours working or watching television you will lose all the benefits of exercise.Instead, try breaking up your day by getting up and stretching or moving about every 30 minutes. Get up to drink a glass of water, use the bathroom, stretch, or walk around for five minutes. To encourage movement, you can also:


Walk around when you are on the phone talking, or at least stand instead of sitting.
Put your glass of water across the room so you must get up every 30 minutes to drink.
Organize your space so that it encourages you to get up and down during the day.

, If you notice chest pains, nausea, dizziness, irregular heartbeat, or shortness of breath while exercising, stop immediately.The exercise may be straining your heart. Call your doctor or 911 if the symptoms do not disappear quickly. If you have a prescription for nitroglycerin, then carry it with you during exercise. You should also write down the symptoms you experienced, the time of day, when you last ate, how long they lasted, and how often these symptoms appear.


Speak with your doctor about any other symptoms before continuing an exercise program. The doctor may want to perform another stress test before you resume exercising.

, Wear the correct clothing and shoes for the type of exercise you are doing. Stay hydrated during exercise and be sure that someone knows where you are going when you leave to workout outside. Always use good judgement and stay within your limits.


It is much better to continue to work out each day at an intensity you feel is lighter than you can manage, rather than to be sidelined for weeks with an injury or be re-hospitalized with another cardiac event., In very cold or hot weather your body has to work harder to provide oxygen to your cells, including your heart. Do not exercise outdoors if the weather is colder than 35°F (1.7°C) or hotter than 85°F (29.4°C) with humidity greater than 80%."

Use other garlic remedies.,
Eat protein for hair growth.,
Consume more B vitamins.,
Have more minerals.",How to Use Garlic As a Hair Loss Remedy2," You can use pure garlic oil as a treatment for hair loss. Massage the garlic oil into your scalp before you shampoo your hair. To make it easier and more comfortable on your scalp, pre-warm the garlic oil before you use it. Repeat this two to three times a week until hair re-growth begins or shedding stops. Once it starts working, repeat the treatment twice a month. Puritan’s Pride, Boyajian, and the Eclectic Institute sell pure garlic oil.


You can also buy garlic infused hair products. Try hair oils such as Dabur Vatika Garlic-enriched Hair Oil and garlic hair masks such as Alter Ego Garlic Mask.
You can also just add pure garlic to a mild shampoo you use. Chop two to three cloves of garlic and drop them into a very mild shampoo. Use this shampoo two to three times a week.While there is no direct evidence that eating garlic or taking it as a supplement can help with hair loss, it is reasonable to think that it may. Add garlic to as many foods as you want or take garlic as a supplement to help with hair loss.
There have been some studies that looked at combining a garlic gel with steroid treatment of extreme hair loss and found that the garlic significantly improved hair growth., Hair is primarily protein and strong, healthy hair comes from the inside despite what makers of shampoos and conditioners try to tell you. Make sure you are getting enough high quality protein in order to grow more hair. You should try for a variety of sources of complete proteins, which contain all the essential amino acids, the building blocks of protein.


Eat more eggs, dairy products, quinoa, buckwheat, hempseed, chia seeds, soybeans, tofu, tempeh, natto, rice, and beans., You need to eat a diet high in B-complex vitamins. These are needed for healthy hair follicles and healthy hair growth.These foods include spinach, parsley, mustard greens, romaine lettuce, turnip greens, beet greens, broccoli, beets, turnips, bell peppers, legumes, lentils, calf and beef liver, and fortified grains., The only mineral that has been proven to be connected to hair loss is iron.While low zinc and low selenium have been implicated in hair loss, it is still not known if zinc or selenium deficiencies play a primary or secondary role in hair loss.You can take iron, zinc, and selenium in supplements as well as increasing foods rich in these minerals in your diet.


Eat more foods with iron, such as eggs, lean, grass fed red meat, dark leafy green vegetables, beans, lentils, and liver. You can also get more zinc with seafood, shellfish, spinach, pumpkin, squash, sunflower seeds, and nuts.Omega-3 fatty acids used on the scalp have been shown to increase the numbers of hair strands.Increasing the amounts of omega-3 fatty acids in your diet may be useful for hair loss. Omega-3 fatty acids are found in salmon, mackerel, eggs, flaxseed oil, soybeans, chia seeds, walnuts, herring, sardines, and bass.
If you decide you want to take mineral supplements, don’t over do it and follow manufacturer’s instructions. You can have too many minerals.

Avoid over-shampooing.,
Stop using chemical heavy shampoos.,
Avoid too much conditioner.",How to Use Garlic As a Hair Loss Remedy3," You can help your hair loss by changing your hair routine. Avoid shampooing too often because frequent shampooing can strip the natural oils from your hair. Frequent shampooing doesn’t really cause hair loss, but if you are stripping the oils from your hair, it can make the hair more fragile.


It is recommended that you only wash your hair two to three times a week., There are some shampoos that are loaded with chemicals. The extra chemicals can be rough on your hair, dry it out, and make your hair loss worse. Try natural shampoos instead that have ingredients that will nourish your hair, not strip the nutrients from it.


Avoid using products with ingredients like sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), parabens, and ammonium chloride, especially if you have thin, fragile, or treated hair., Hair loss might be caused by too much conditioner. Conditioners can weigh down the roots of the hair and damage the hair follicles, which can cause it to break and fall out. Use a conditioner one to two times a week and avoid using conditioner on the scalp.Try a natural conditioner as well, such as Nature’s Gate, Babo Botanicals, WEN, and Intelligent Nutrients.

Seek medical help.,
Use drug treatment for men.,
Try drug treatment for women.",How to Use Garlic As a Hair Loss Remedy4," If your hair loss is a perpetual problem, you need to determine the cause of your hair loss. Because of this, a full check up by a physician is strongly recommended. There are many, many diseases where hair loss may be a symptom and it is critical that you try and find the cause of hair loss. There are, however, a number of approaches that can help your situation before you get a diagnosis.

, The main drug treatment for men’s hair loss are the 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors Proscar and Propecia. The 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors that help block the activity of damaging hormones on the hair follicles. Another drug used to increase hair growth is minoxidil.


Minoxidil is generally less effective than finasteride, but it can be applied directly to the areas of hair loss., Women’s hair loss has long been ignored, even though women represent up to 40% of all those who have hair loss.The 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors are not often used for women because of potential adverse effects of female hormones. 2% minoxidil is more commonly prescribed because it can be applied to the areas of hair loss, has fewer side effects, and works better for women. Other drugs include aldactone, tagamet, and cyproterone acetate.


In women, hormone replacement therapy can be helpful. You have to be careful if you are pregnant when taking these medication because they can cause birth defects."

Know that clots in the abdominal area can produce severe pain and gastrointestinal problems.,
Understand that clots in the limbs can produce pain, swelling, and other distinctive symptoms.,
Be aware that clots in the brain can lead to a variety of frightening symptoms.,
Recognize that chest pain, shortness of breath, and sweating may signify a blood clot in the heart.,
Know that blood clots in the lungs can cause chest pain and a variety of other symptoms.",How to Dissolve Blood Clots1," The symptoms of a blood clot vary depending on the clot’s location in the body. If the artery affected is responsible for supplying blood in the bowel, symptoms typically include sharp, excruciating abdominal pain. In addition, you may notice the following symptoms:


Vomiting. Abdominal blood clots irritate the stomach lining, and the body responds by vomiting.
Diarrhea. Lack of blood supply alters the function of the digestive system and often leads to diarrhea.
Bloody stool. Any irritation to the linings of the digestive system can cause bleeding. You may therefore notice blood in your bowel movements.;
, Blood clot formation in the arms or legs can block the blood flow returning to the heart. It will cause inflammation of the vein as well. You may notice a sudden, sharp pain, caused by deprivation of oxygen due to loss of blood supply. In addition, you may have the following symptoms:


Swelling. When a vein is blocked, it will cause fluid retention and swelling in the area of the clot.
Tenderness. In addition (or instead of) sharp pain, you may have a general discomfort or tenderness in the area. This happens because of the inflammation in the area.
Discoloration. The clot blocks blood supply to the area, so the skin of your arm or leg may become pale.
A sense of warmth. When inflammation occurs, the body increases blood flow to the damaged area. The blood carries body heat from the core of the body, causing a warm sensation in the affected area.

, The brain controls almost all of the body’s functions. If a clot impedes the flow of blood to the brain, it can affect sight, speech, and virtually all other functions of the body. As a result, you may experience:


Visual disturbances.
Weakness.
Paralysis.
Seizures.
Speech impairment.
Stroke.

, When clots develop in the heart, it can cause an irregular rhythm and block the flow of blood. This leads to chest pain (which may radiate to the left arm), shortness of breath, and sweating.


Clots in the heart can lead to life-threatening problems, such as a heart attack.

, As with clots in the heart, clots in the lungs may cause severe, sharp chest pain. In addition, you may experience:


Rapid pulse. The heart compensates by beating fast in order to supply sufficient blood to the body. As a result, your pulse rises.
Bloody cough. A clot can irritate your lungs, causing bleeding. You may cough up blood.
Shortness of breath. A clot can block the passage of air in your lungs, leading to difficulty breathing.

Choose the right time.,
Gather your supplies.,
Check your pulse.,
Know your numbers.,
Consider important factors.,
Find your training heart rate.,
Get in a routine.,
Practice good heart health.",How to Find Your Resting Heart Rate," The formula for your resting heart rate is simple: it is the number of times your heart beats per minute while it is at rest. The key to calculating this rate is to make sure that you are actually at rest when you find your heart rate. Try calculating your heart rate first thing in the morning.One of the best times to find your resting heart rate is before you even get out of bed in the morning. Right after a good night's sleep is when your heart rate will be the most rested.
If you forget to measure your heart rate first thing in the morning, you can do it later in the day. Just make sure that you have been sitting calmly for several minutes and not exerting yourself physically.;
, Fortunately, you don't need much in order to track your resting heart rate. Just make sure to have a watch with a second hand to help you keep track of the time. Alternatively, you can use a digital stopwatch.Find a quiet place to sit where you will not be distracted.
If you find yourself unable to concentrate, ask a friend to keep track of time for you.

, Basically, in order to find your resting heart rate, you need to check your pulse. Take your third finger and your index finger and place them gently but firmly on the side of your neck, to the side of your windpipe. You will find your pulse slightly to the left or right from the center of your throat, an inch or so under your chin.Count the number of beats in 15 seconds. Multiply that number by 4 and you have your resting heart rate.
You can also take your pulse on your wrist. Take two fingers and place them on your radial artery. This is located on the thumb side of your wrist, between the bone and the tendon.

, Your heart rate conveys important information about your fitness levels and your overall cardiovascular health. In general, children over the age of ten and adults should have a resting heart rate of 60-100 beats per minute. Remember, these numbers are general, so check with your doctor to see if your heart rate indicates something specific about your health.Athletes generally have a lower resting heart rate. If you are a competitive athlete, your resting heart rate may be only 40-60 beats per minute.

, When you are calculating your resting heart rate, it is important to remember that there are many factors that can impact the reading. For example, the temperature of the room, your emotions, and certain medications can all affect your heart rate. Try taking it more than once and averaging the results.If your heart rate is consistently more than 100 beats per minute, consult your doctor to see if it is indicative of an underlying problem.
You should also consult your doctor if your pulse is lower than 60 beats per minute and you are not an athlete.

, You can use the same method to find your ideal training heart rate. This is the rate of exertion that you want to work towards when you are exercising to make sure that you are getting cardiovascular benefits. Take your pulse 10 minutes into your workout to find your training heart rate. Each age group has a specific target heart rate that is ideal.People between 20-30 years of age have a target heart rate of 100-170 beats per minute. 30-35 year olds should aim for 95-162 beats per minute.
People who are between 40-50 years of age will have target heart rates of 88-145 beats per minute. If you are 60 or above, your target heart rate will generally be between 75-128 beats per minute.
Remember that these numbers are general. Ask your doctor if he has a specific recommendation for you.

, Exercise is one of the best ways to keep your heart healthy and to consistently hit your target heart rate. Make it a habit to get at least 30 minutes of physical exercise most days of the week. Choose an activity that you enjoy and you will be more likely to stick with it.The best exercise programs combine cardio activity and strength training. For example, you could combine swimming with a routine that uses light weights.
Try a new sport. Sports are a great way to combine exercise with socialization. Join the work softball team or take tennis lessons.

Consult with your doctor before beginning a pineapple fast for the lungs.,
Make sure you're in ideal condition.",How to Do a Pineapple Fast for the Lungs1," You want to be healthy enough to fully participate in and benefit from the fast. You also need to make sure you are strong enough to forgo other nutrients. Children and women who are pregnant should not partake of the pineapple fast.


The fast should last at least 3 days and no more than 10. Ask your doctor how long you should fast based on your current health. Also ask about the benefits of a pineapple diet for weight loss if that is an area of concern.
A pineapple fast can be especially helpful for smokers who are quitting. Smokers have noted that they feel as if they can breathe easier following the pineapple fast. However, it may take up to a year or longer to completely remove toxins in a smoker's lungs.;
, Stop smoking at least 7 days before you start your pineapple fast. You'll also want to get rid of alcohol, eggs, meat and fish at least a week before you begin.


It's never a good idea to start a fast if you're feeling sick. Your body is going to go through a lot in the next 3 to 10 days -- so start when you're in optimal shape. If you have serious health concerns, do not take part in this fast.

, Before doing any stroke recovery exercises, it is recommended by physicians to treat the symptoms of spasticity first.


Spasticity causes tightening of the muscles, inability to stretch, aching or sharp pain, abnormality in posture and uncontrollable movement. Spasticity is usually caused by damage to the portion of the brain (as a result of insufficient blood supply) or spinal cord that controls voluntary movement.
The affected body part can start to regain its normal strength and range of motion if the medications given to the patient relieve spasticity.

, This medication acts on the central nervous system. It relaxes muscles by decreasing muscle spasms, tightness, and pain and improves range of motion.


For adults, the maintenance dose of Baclofen is 40-80 mg/day in 4 divided doses.

, This medication blocks the nerve impulses in the brain that cause spasticity.


The effectiveness of the medication lasts only for a short period of time, so it is advisable to use it only when needed for relief of extreme discomfort or when it's needed to complete certain activities.
The ideal starting dose is 4 mg every 6 to 8 hours. The maintenance dose is 8 mg every 6 to 8 hours (drugs.com).

, This medication acts on the central nervous system, relaxing the muscles and decreasing spasticity for a short period of time.


The oral dosage varies as Benzodiazepines comes in many generic names. Consult with your doctor for proper prescription.

, This medication blocks signals that make muscles contract and reduce muscle tone.


The recommended dose ranges from 25 mg to a maximum dosage of 100 mg three times a day.

, A botox injection attaches to the nerve endings and blocks the release of chemical transmitters which signal the brain to activate muscle contraction. This prevents muscle spasm.


The maximum dosage of botox is less than 500 units per visit. Botox is given by injection directly into the affected muscles.

, Phenol destroys the nerve conduction that is causing spasticity. It is given by injection directly into the affected muscles or into the spine.


The dosage may vary according to the manufacturer. Consult with your doctor for proper prescription.

, Stroke recovery exercises minimize the formation of blood clots by improving blood flow to the different parts of the body. It also prevents the occurrence of muscle atrophy (a condition wherein the muscles break down, become weak and decrease in size).


For stroke patients, muscle atrophy is common because the affected area is not used very often and stays immobile for a long time. Physical inactivity is the major cause of muscle atrophy.
Exercises and muscle movements promote good blood circulation and oxygen distribution to the affected area, thus speeding up the repair of the damaged tissue.

, Exercising the affected body part through pulling, pushing or lifting stimulates growth of the muscles and increases their efficiency.


Regular ankle exercise increases the number of myofibrils (muscle fibers) in each cell. These fibers account for 20 to 30 percent of muscle growth.
Because of the increased blood flow, the muscle fibers are being supplied with more oxygen and nutrients leading to an increase in muscle mass.

, Because of the increased blood flow, the muscles increase their mass as a result of the extra oxygen and nutrients they receive. An increase in muscle mass also increases muscle strength.

, Weight-bearing physical activity causes new bone tissue to form, and this makes bones stronger.

, When you exercise, the ligaments and tendons (which are comprised of collagen fibers, or semi-elastic protein), are being stretched.


Regular stretching of the ligaments and tendons helps maintain flexibility of the joints. Loss of flexibility decreases the range of motion of the joints.
This means that the extent and type of movement are reduced. Inability to fully move the joints restricts the activities of daily living and causes your muscles and bones to lose mass and strength.

, Heparin prevents clotting but too much of it can interfere with the results.

, Check the pulse with the tip of your fingers and look for the spot where the pulsations hit your fingertips the most. It's easier if the patient's wrist is hyper extended.

, Go at an angle of 45-60 degrees to the skin.

, You will know that you are in the artery when bright red blood enters your syringe. The blood is pulsatile. If the blood does not pulsate and is dark red, it means that you are in a vein instead.

, Bring the needle out, keeping a ball of cotton on the puncture wound. Ask the patient or his by stander to apply pressure for about half a minute.

,, Bending the needle prevents you from getting pricked.

Consider the danger of prolonged immobility.,
Be aware of the increased risk associated with pregnancy and the postpartum period.,
Know that dehydration can cause clots.,
Recognize the risks of birth control and hormone therapy.,
Understand that long-term intravenous catheter use can lead to clots.,
Remember that certain medical conditions can lead to clots.,
Consider the role of recent surgeries and injuries.,
Know that obesity increases your risk.,
Recognize the danger of smoking.,
Be aware of your family history.",How to Dissolve Blood Clots2," Blood clots sometimes form for no discernible reason, but certain conditions and situations increase your risk. The first of these is prolonged immobility. If you are on bed rest or sit and cross your legs for a long period of time, you may increase the risk of blood clots forming, particularly in your arms and legs.


Extended travel in an airplane or car can minimize muscle movement, increasing the risk of blood clots forming in the veins.

, In pregnant women, the growing uterus slows the blood flow circling back to the heart. This can increase the risk of a blood clot forming, especially in the legs or pelvis. Women who have delivered babies very recently remain at an increased risk.

, You need sufficient water in your body to make blood circulation effective. If you become dehydrated, your blood flow may slow, giving your body the chance to form clots.

, Estrogen and progesterone can increase clotting factors, leading to an increased risk of clots. Hormonal contraception (like the birth control pill) and hormone therapy both introduce these hormones into the body.

, Intravenous catheters are foreign bodies. When one is inserted into a vein, it can affect your blood circulation, leading to a clot.

, Certain conditions can irritate the bladder lining, causing bleeding and the development of clots, which can be passed through the urine. These conditions include:


Cancer.
Liver disease.
Kidney disease.

, When the body is hurt, either by an accidental injury or by a surgical procedure, excessive bleeding (and clotting) can result. In addition, the extended period of rest that usually follows surgeries and injuries increases the risk of a clot forming.

, People who are significantly overweight or obese often have a buildup of cholesterol in the body. As a result, the arteries narrow, causing the formation of blood clots.

, Smoking causes plaque to form in the blood vessels, narrowing them and leading to clots.

, If you have a personal or family history of clotting disorders, you are at an increased risk of developing clots. Clotting disorders cause the blood vessels to narrow, leading to blood clots.

Seek medical treatment immediately.,
Give your doctor a complete health history.,
Have a physical exam.,
Comply with any laboratory tests your doctor orders.,
Get imaging tests or ventilation perfusion to diagnose a blood clot in the lungs.,
Get a specific diagnosis.",How to Dissolve Blood Clots3," If you have any symptoms of a blood clot, get medical help right away. Blood clots can lead to life-threatening medical conditions.

, Your doctor should ask questions about your symptoms, your lifestyle, your personal health history, and your family health history. Answer these questions in as much detail as possible to increase the chances of a quick and accurate diagnosis.

, Your doctor should perform a complete physical, looking for any signs or symptoms that could point to blood clots.

, Depending on your symptoms, your doctor will likely order standard blood work. In addition, he or she may recommend:


Ultrasound. Using an ultrasound machine, your doctor may be able to detect the formation of blood clots in the veins.
Venography. In venography, a contrast dye is injected into a small vein in your hand or foot. Using fluoroscopy, the doctor can then observe the path of the dye, looking for possible clots.
Arteriography. In arteriography, a dye is injected directly into an artery. Similar to venography, arteriography will allow your doctor to observe the path of the dye and confirm the presence of a clot.

, If your doctor suspects a blood clot in your lungs (also known as a pulmonary embolus), he or she will recommend an imaging test and/or ventilation perfusion to check your lungs. This may involve:


Chest x-rays. X-rays cannot detect the presence of clots. However, they can reveal some conditions, triggered by clots, that lead to chest pain and shortness of breath.
Electrocardiogram (EKG). An EKG is a painless test. It simply records your heart’s electrical activity, revealing abnormalities associated with a pulmonary embolus.
Computerized tomography (CT) scan. In a CT scan, a contrast dye is injected into a vein, and your lungs are scanned for signs of clots.
Ventilation perfusion. Ventrilation perfusion is a test in which a chemical is used to identify air inhaled into the lungs. This is then compared with the blood flow in the arteries to reveal the presence of a pulmonary embolus.

, Once all of the appropriate tests are performed, your doctor should be able to diagnose you with a certain type of clot. Treatment will depend, to some extent, on the type and location of your clot. Major types of clots include:


Thrombus. A thrombus is a blood clot that develops in the veins or arteries.
Embolus. An embolus is a thrombus that has moved from the bloodstream to another location.
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT). DVT is a common and dangerous clot, usually formed in a major vein in the leg (though sometimes also appearing in the arms, pelvis, or other parts of the body). It blocks blood flow and causes pain and swelling.

Start treatment immediately.,
Take anticoagulants.,
Talk to your doctor about thrombolytic drugs.,
Consider surgery.",How to Dissolve Blood Clots4," Blood clots are life threatening, so medical action must be taken to dissolve them as quickly as possible.

, Anticoagulant medications interrupt the process of clot formation. There are several different types on the market, including:


Enoxaparin (Lovenox). Enoxaparin is a medication injected to thin the blood immediately. The typical dose for adults is 40 mg injected into a fatty area of the body, such as the arm or abdomen.
Warfarin (Coumadin). Warfarin is an anticoagulation pill, which acts as a blood thinner. The dosage depends on the particular patient. To determine the dosage and administration, your doctor may perform a test for blood clotting known as the International Normalized Ratio, or INR.
Heparin. Heparin is a traditional anticoagulant medication, given intravenously to prevent the growth of blood clots. The dose depends on your particular circumstances; your doctor should perform blood test measurements to determine dosaging.

, Thrombolytic drugs, also known as “clot busters,” dissolve the fibrin strands that hold clots together. Dosage varies depending on your particular circumstances and on hospital protocols. Talk to your doctor about the right dosage for you.

, If medication alone cannot eliminate the clot, you will need surgery. There are a few types of surgeries that might apply:


Cardiac catheterization. For blood clots in the heart, cardiac catheterization is performed to locate the clot. A balloon is inserted to open the blockage, and then a stent is placed to keep the appropriate vessel open. The pressure from the balloon and the stent breaks the blood clot into smaller pieces, restoring the flow of blood.
Catheter-directed thrombolysis. A catheter-directed thrombolysis is a surgical procedure in which a catheter is inserted directly to the blood clot, releasing medication to dissolve it.
Thrombectomy. A thrombectomy is simply the surgical removal of the blood clot itself. It is often performed with thrombolysis is ineffective, or when there is an emergency condition requiring immediate treatment.

Exercise for at least forty-five minutes per day.,
Drink lots of water.,
Eat foods rich in nattokinase.,
Add foods rich in rutin.,
Get plenty of bromelain.,
Incorporate garlic into your diet.,
Focus on fish for your protein servings.",How to Dissolve Blood Clots5," Studies suggest that regular aerobic exercise can prevent and reverse blood clot formation by increasing blood flow. Try walking, cycling, rowing, running, swimming, or jumping rope – whatever gets you moving – for forty-five minutes every day.

, Dehydration thickens your blood and damages your blood vessels. Be sure to drink plenty of water, as staying hydrated can prevent clots from forming.

, Nattokinase is an enzyme that breaks down fibrin, which may prevent clots from forming and dissolve those that have begun to form. Nattokinase is found in natto (a fermented Japanese food made from soybeans), fermented black beans, fermented shrimp paste, and tempeh.

, Rutin targets protein disulfide isomerase, an enzyme involved in blood clotting. It is found in apples, oranges, lemons, grapefruits, limes, buckwheat, onion, and tea. Have one of these fruits as dessert after each meal, or incorporate them into the meals themselves.

, Bromelain enables your body to produce plasmin, which helps to clear away the fibrin that holds blood clots together. Bromelain is found only in pineapples. If you are at an increased risk for blood clots, considering including pineapples in your dessert after as many meals as possible.

, Garlic inhibits the production of thomboxane, which is involved in blood clots. It also contains ajoene and adenosine, which helps prevent and dissolve blood clots.


Onions also include adenosine, so you should incorporate them into your diet as well.

, Too much protein (especially red meat and dairy products) seems to stimulate blood clot formation. Try to eat plenty of fish instead. The omega 3 fatty acids will reduce your cholesterol, thin your blood, and reduce clotting.


For best results, focus on salmon, tuna, herring, mackerel, and sardines.

Chow down on pineapple.,
Consume ginger or wormwood tea, raw almonds, figs and pumpkin seeds daily.,
Consider a few add-ons.,
Break the fast by eating steamed oranges or carrots.",How to Do a Pineapple Fast for the Lungs2," Eat as much of it as you can stomach to start the fast. If you're eating fresh pineapple, aim to eat a whole pineapple in one day. Also: you can eat little else (or nothing else, if you're going gung-ho). So stock up on that pineapple -- when you get hungry enough, you'll want it.


You can prepare it in different ways, but avoid cooking it. That blasts out all the helpful nutrients and enzymes you're looking to put into your body.
Avoid dried pineapple as it is usually covered in sugar.

, However, only eat these additional foods minimally. Pineapple should still be the overwhelming majority of your diet during the fast.


This is only advised by believers of homeopathy.Some physicians will advise sticking to pineapple and pineapple alone.

, Drink laxative tea or take a castor oil supplement on the third day of the fast both in the morning and at night. This will help your digestive tract normalize.


If you are feeling seriously ill, stop. The pineapple fast is not for everyone. Listen to what your body is telling you. If you have to cut it short, do so.

, Wait 6 hours, then eat steamed or raw vegetables. Your body needs to be eased into normal eating habits. Don't cave for that candy bar quite yet!


Add regular foods back into your diet slowly so you don't shock your system. You'll just end up sicker than you ever were at any point during the fast.

Understand the condition.,
Know the causes.,
Know the symptoms.,
Get a diagnosis.,
Know the available treatment options.,
Get familiar with the rehabilitation issues.",How to Fight Cervical Spinal Stenosis," Cervical spinal stenosis is the narrowing of the spinal canal in the neck.



 


The spinal canal is the open area in the central part of the bones (vertebrae) that make up the spinal column.
The spinal cord is a collection of nerves that runs through the spinal canal from the base of the brain to the lower back. These nerves allow us to feel, to move, and to control the bowel and bladder and other body functions.
In cervical spinal stenosis, the spinal canal narrows and can squeeze and compress the nerve roots where they leave the spinal cord, or it may compress or damage the spinal cord itself.
The seven vertebrae between the head and the chest make up the cervical spine. Squeezing the nerves and cord in the cervical spine can change how the spinal cord functions and cause pain, stiffness, numbness, or weakness in the neck, arms, and legs. It can also affect the control of your bowels and bladder.





;
, Cervical spinal stenosis is usually caused by age-related changes in the shape and size of the spinal canal and so is most common in people older than age 50.

The aging process can cause a ""bulging of the discs""—the spongy discs between the bones of the spine bulge out farther than normal—or a thickening of tissues that connect bones (ligaments).
Aging can also lead to the destruction of tissues that cover bones (cartilage) and excessive growth of the bones in joints. These conditions can narrow the spinal canal (spinal stenosis).
In rare cases, the spinal canal is narrowed from birth because of the way the bones are formed.

, Many people older than age 50 have some physiological narrowing of the spinal canal but do not have symptoms. Cervical spinal stenosis does not cause symptoms unless the spinal cord or nerves become squeezed. Symptoms usually develop gradually over a long period of time and may include:

Stiffness, pain, numbness, or weakness in the neck, shoulders, arms, hands, or legs.
Problems with balance and coordination, such as shuffling or tripping while walking. Cervical spinal stenosis can be crippling if the spinal cord is damaged.
Loss of bowel or bladder control (incontinence).

,

A diagnosis of cervical spinal stenosis usually is based on your history of symptoms and a physical examination.
Your doctor will ask you if neck movements cause pain, numbness, or weakness.
If cervical spinal stenosis is suspected, your doctor will recommend imaging tests of your neck and back to confirm the diagnosis and to see what is causing the narrowing of the spinal canal.
Imaging tests that may be used include X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT) scans.
Your doctor will use the results of tests, including imaging and blood tests, to eliminate other diseases—such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and vitamin B12 deficiency—as the cause of your symptoms.

,

In mild cases of spinal stenosis, symptoms can usually be controlled with medicine to relieve pain, exercise to maintain strength and flexibility, and physical therapy.
If your symptoms are severe, you have progressive weakness of your muscles or the pictures of your spine show that your spinal cord or nerves are being tightly squeezed; your doctor is likely to recommend decompressive surgery to relieve the pressure. This surgery may be done from the front or the back of the neck. It involves removing some of the disc, bone, and/or tissue that may be pressing on the nerve roots. Vertebrae are often joined together surgically (fused) to provide stability to the spine.
Cervical spinal stenosis can potentially cause serious problems with the nervous system, including problems with bowel or bladder control (incontinence) and permanent loss of strength and feeling in the arms, hands, and legs. Your doctor will not wait for you to have severe symptoms of pain, weakness, and numbness before considering treatment to relieve pressure on your spinal cord and nerves.

,

Nonsurgical rehabilitation

Patients with mild symptoms of cervical myelopathy may try nonsurgical treatment for three to six months. After wearing a neck brace for up to three months, patients will slowly resume routine activities. They usually visit their doctor every four to six weeks to check their progress.


Post-surgery rehabilitation

Some patients leave the hospital shortly after surgery, but some surgeries require patients to stay in the hospital for a few days. A physical therapist may see the patient for treatment in the hospital room after surgery. Therapy sessions are designed to help patients learn to move and begin doing routine activities without putting extra strain on the neck.
During recovery from surgery, a patient may be placed in a halo vest or rigid neck brace. These braces are used to restrict the motion in the neck to allow the fusion to heal. Patients generally need to be extremely cautious about overdoing activities in the first few weeks to months after surgery.
Most patients spend time rehabilitating at home. Bone fusion may take several months. When the surgeon is absolutely certain the bones have fused together, patients are able to discontinue using the neck brace or halo vest.
After being in a rigid neck brace for four to six months, patients are often weak and deconditioned. They sometimes need the help of a physical therapist to work on neck movement, strength, and general conditioning.
As therapy sessions come to an end, the therapist may help patients with decisions about getting back to work.
Ideally, patients are able to go back to their previous activities. However, some patients may need to modify their activities to avoid future problems.

Choose a pediculicide (head lice treatment).,
Comb out the lice with a nit comb.,
Wash the person's clothes and bedding.,
Monitor the hair for signs of life.,
Use an oil treatment to help the process move more quickly.,
Try an apple cider vinegar treatment.,
Use an essential oil spray.,
Be prepared to fight a long battle.,
Avoid spreading the lice to other people.",How to Get Rid of Lice1," Using a pediculicide is the quickest way to combat a case of head lice. Some pediculicides are formulated to kill both lice and their eggs, while others only kill crawling lice. To use a pediculicide, read the instructions on the bottle carefully.


You can get a permethrin 1% creme rinse (such as Nix) or a Pyrethrins 0.33% shampoo or mousse (such as Rid or Pronto) over-the-counter at a pharmacy.
You can also get a prescription pediculicide, such as Malathion 0.5% lotion (Ovide), benzyl alcohol 5% lotion (known as Ulesfia), spinosad 0.9%, or Ivermectin 0.5% topical lotion (such as Sklice)
Have the person being treated put on old clothes and sit in the bathroom. This makes cleanup easier. Apply the treatment to the hair and scalp according to the instructions on the bottle.
Allow the treatment to sit for the recommended amount of time. It's usually an hour or less. Don't leave the treatment on for longer than recommended. Wash out the treatment using water, not shampoo. No shampoo should be used for 2 days.;
, This step helps to hasten the treatment process if you're using a pediculicide, but you can also get rid of lice using a nit comb alone. Nit combs are handy tools that are specially designed to pull out nits (eggs) and dead lice as they are combed through the hair.


Divide the hair into sections.
Starting at the scalp, pull the comb from the roots to the end of a section of hair.
Swish the comb around in a bowl of warm, soap water. This will kill the lice and their eggs; they die quickly without a source of food.
Continue combing each section of hair until all the hair has been combed.
Sanitize the comb by putting it in a dish of very hot water after every use. Lice and their eggs die when exposed to temperatures of 128 °F (53 °C) for 5 minutes or longer.

, After this initial treatment, wash all clothes, sheets, pillowcases, stuffed animals, and any other fabrics the person has come into contact with in very hot water, then run them through a hot dryer. While lice don't live very long once they jump off a person's head, it's still important to wash everything so you can be extra sure someone else in the family won't get lice.


For items that can't be soaked in hot water, like hairbrushes and hair accessories, place them in plastic bags for at least two weeks. The lice will die without air and food.

, After the initial treatment or combing, you'll need to diligently monitor the hair every 8 hours for signs of new life. Lice hatch in cycles, and it's almost impossible to get rid of all of them in one go. Do a thorough combing every 8 hours for the first 3 days. After that, continue checking the scalp every 16 hours and combing when necessary for the next 2 weeks.


Most lice treatments require a second application after about 10 days to kill any lice that may have hatched since the initial treatment.

, Whether you used a pediculicide or not, there are natural substances that repel and kill lice. If you're sensitive to chemicals, it's definitely worth trying this oil treatment to help naturally combat the lice.


Melt 1/2 cup of coconut oil or warm 1/2 cup of neem oil and massage it into the hair and scalp. Both oils have antibiotic properties.
Use the nit comb to work through the oil-treated hair. The nits should come out much more easily.

, This is another cheap, effective way to loosen the nits. Mix 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar, and pour it over the person's hair and scalp. Use the nit comb on the hair; you should find them easier to remove. White vinegar may also work.

, Certain essential oils repel lice and cause the nits to loosen more easily. Fill a spray bottle with 5 drops of essential oil per 1 ounce of water. Try one or more of the following:


Tea tree oil
Lavender
Oregano
Peppermint

, Adult lice and immature lice are pretty easy to get rid of, but their eggs (called nits) are much harder to get rid of, and it is with these that the most problems crop up. People can think that they are rid of lice, but then get another case of lice from just a couple of eggs. Constant vigilance will be necessary to win this battle.

, Lice can spread quickly in a household. When treating someone for lice, wash all bedding, scarves, and hats with hot water, and dry clean what cannot be washed. Disinfect combs and brushes in hot, soapy water.

Keep carpets and upholstery clean by regularly vacuuming them.
Do not treat pets with lice treatments, as it could possibly harm or kill them.

Speak with your doctor about the type, regularity, and severity of back pain you are experiencing. Although your doctor will be able to provide you with general information regarding pain management, you may need to consult a back specialist if you have a disorder or serious injury.


Ask your doctor for recommendations, like “What can I do everyday to minimize my back pain?”, “Should I seek out a back specialist?”, or “Should I be exercising on my own or should I seek out further assistance?”;
, Seek out a back specialist, osteopath, or physical therapist for more tailored and specific treatment for back pain. There are many back specialists out there, from surgeons to chiropractors, that can help provide you with the assistance and support you need. Finding a back specialist will provide you with hands-on support, informational resources, and exercise plans catered to your pain and ability.


Ask your specialist questions like “What exercises do you recommend for my back condition?”, “What stretches or exercises can I do at home?”, or “
Finding a specialist starts with your primary-care physician. Back pain is so common that most family doctors will have experience providing the appropriate recommendations for a specialist and treatment., Personal trainers often have comprehensive understandings of exercise routines. Most trainers will be able to provide hands-on support while you exercise and Seek out the advice of a personal trainer at your gym to better understand the types of exercises that will help support your back.


Go to you local gym and ask to speak with a trainer. Ask the trainer about exercises they recommend for your ability, what machines or exercises you should avoid, and how to better improve your form to reduce the chances of injury.
Ask questions like, “Do you have a trainer on staff that has experience providing assistance with back pain”, “What exercises would you recommend to relieve back pain?”, or “What aerobic or strength building exercises might I still be able to do with back pain?”
If you cannot afford a personal trainer, then you may want to seek out a physical therapy consultation. There are many different types of physical therapists with different treatment modalities. For example, you can ask your physical therapist about deweighted training.

, Stretching every day, whether you plan on exercising or not, will help relieve your back of tension, increase blood flow, and help you gain mobility. There are a variety of low-impact back stretches that loosen your back and reduce your pain as much as possible.Try supported hamstring stretches, like twists, knee-tucks, and cross-legged stretches.Ask your doctor, personal trainer, or specialist for stretches you can do at home to improve your exercise routine and reduce your pain.
Mind-body exercise like Pilates and yoga are also good for the back and for stretching.

, Although exercise is instrumental to back health, be sure to start small and work your way up incrementally. Most of the exercises and lifts designed to gain body mass will often increase the chances of making your back pain or injury worse. Be sure to avoid any exercise or weight that requires that you hold a free weight in front of your body, to repetitively bend at the waist, or induces pain. Consult a trainer or physical therapist to figure out what starting weight will best promote back health.
Remember that your back health is most important. Weights that you once lifted with ease might now have to be worked back up to.

, Bodyweight exercises are simple exercises that require you to use the weight of your body to build strength. Bodyweight exercises will allow you to strengthen muscle groups that you might not be able exercise while experiencing back pain. Try to incorporate body exercises into your routine to strengthen your back without risking injury or further damage.Try back strengthening exercises like planks, scissor kicks, or knee push ups., Swimming is a great low-impact aerobic exercise that engages almost every muscle in your body. Try swimming at a slow and consistent pace for longer periods of time to increase your strength, mobility, and overall health. If you find that you do not yet have complete range, try using modifying strokes, like the breaststroke or backstroke.Try swimming in a lap pool at your gym.
If you live close to a large body of water, try swimming distances while the weather permits.
Swim for as long as you would normally do other aerobic exercises. A good place to start is around 20 minutes and to build up from there.
Another idea if you are not a good swimmer is to walk the lanes of the swimming pool. You may want to get aqua shoes and put on weights to your ankles to make it more challenging. You should to do this for 40 minutes four times a week.

, Water jogging and water aerobics are two exercises that can promote cardiovascular health and provide pain relief. The buoyancy that water provides will allow you to have greater ranges of motion while relieving tension in disc, muscles, tendons, and ligaments. Water aerobics and jogging often come with foam dumbbells and belts that can provide further support and increase resistance.Enrolling in a water aerobics class is another way to be introduced to the techniques of water aerobics in a structured environment. Many water aerobics classes are listed online by location.Try aerobic exercises like jogging in place, jogging the length of the pool, or one-legged balance exercises.
Be sure to mix intense bursts of exercise with more moderate rests, like one to five minutes of hard water running with less intense periods of walking., Free weights often require strength in ligaments and tendons, which generally are the cause for back pain. Seated or controlled weight machines will provide that support for you without jeopardizing your form or comfort.


Try a using a leg curl machine instead of squats, or a seated fly machine instead of using free weights on a bench. Try and do four to five exercises of a total body workout.

Treat body lice.,
Treat pubic lice.,
Treat canine lice.",How to Get Rid of Lice2," Body lice live in the seams of clothing and feed on human blood. They are larger than head lice and easy to spot on the body. They are commonly found in areas where people live in very close quarters or don't have access to bathing and washing facilities. Body lice are easy to get rid of once access to these facilities is gained.To treat body lice, do the following:


Throw out the infested clothing. Lice can live up to a month in clothes. Instead of trying to save them, throw them out. Wash new clothing with hot water, and dry at a high temperature.
Take regular showers or baths and use soap.
Regularly wash clothing, bedding, and other linens.
Pediculicides are usually not necessary to get rid of body lice.

, Pubic lice, also known as crabs, is most commonly spread through sexual contact. They spread very easily from person to person. Pubic lice can also live in areas of the body with coarse hair, like the eyebrows, ears and armpits. The lice and their nits are easily visible. There are a few ways you can get rid of public lice:


Get an over-the-counter lotion containing 1% permethrin (such as Nix) or a mousse containing pyrethrins and piperonyl butoxide (such as Rid or Pronto). These chemicals effectively kill the lice. Use according to the instructions on the package. Do not use them around your eyes, brows, or eyelashes.
Remove the lice with a nit comb.
Wash your clothes and underwear in very hot water.
Soak combs and other items in hot water for 5 minutes.
Shave the pubic region. Getting rid of the hair the lice cling to is effective, especially in combination with the chemical treatment.
Monitor the area for signs of new lice. It may be necessary to undergo a second treatment.
Inform any sexual partners from the previous month that they will need to be checked and treated.
Only use lindane shampoo as a last resort. It's effective but studies have shown it has a negative effect on the brain., Canine lice cannot be transmitted to humans (nor human lice to canines), but they can make your dog very uncomfortable. There are two types of canine lice: trichodectes canis, known as a chewing louse, and linognathus setosus, known as a sucking louse.Take your dog to the veterinarian. It's important to make sure that what your dog has is actually lice.
Use a powder, spray or other treatment at the advice of your veterinarian.
Wash the dog's bedding and everything he has touched in very hot water.
Soak grooming tools in very hot water for 5 minutes.

Your doctor can advise you on which types of exercise would benefit you personally based on your specific injury.If you haven't exercised for an extended period of time, you may also want to have a complete physical to ensure that you're well enough to begin an exercise program.
Your doctor also can advise you on various conditioning exercises, in addition to regular walking, that might benefit you.
If your doctor gives you any limitations, follow them carefully and don't push yourself beyond those limits without letting your doctor know you're ready to go further. There may be other risks involved with more intense exercise.;
, Walking increases circulation to your muscles and releases endorphins that reduce the feelings of pain. It exercises the entire body, including the muscles surrounding the back, so it is an excellent way to train your muscles when you are just starting regular physical activity.To get in the habit of exercising and being physically active, begin your regimen by walking for five minutes a day. Try to walk at the same time every day so the activity becomes a part of your routine. Ideally, you should walk on relatively flat, paved surfaces. You can move to hills or unpaved trails later.
If you're new to exercise or recovering from a serious injury or after surgery, it's important to start slow so that you don't overload your body and put yourself at risk of another injury.
Invest in a pair of supportive walking shoes, even if you're only walking five minutes a day to start. Keep in mind that you may experience muscle soreness, especially if you are beginning physical activity after being relatively sedentary.
Maintain good posture when you walk. Tuck your pelvis, engage your abdominal muscles, and align your neck, shoulders and hips.

, Once you're able to walk for five minutes every day, add a minute or two to your walk each week. Adding time slowly gives your muscles time to adapt so you're building strength gradually without risking injury or fatigue.For example, you might walk five minutes a day for one week. On your second week, you may increase your walks to seven minutes, and to ten minutes on your third week. Continue adding time until you're walking at least 20 or 30 minutes a day.
Once you get to the point that you're walking 20 or 30 minutes a day, walking every day isn't strictly necessary unless you're in the routine and enjoy keeping it as a part of your day. Walking is a low-impact activity that it's perfectly safe to do every day if you enjoy it.
If you were athletic or regularly involved in physical activities prior to an injury, you don't necessarily need to start as slowly as someone who previously led a sedentary lifestyle. You also may be able to increase the length of time you walk more rapidly.

, Once you've established a regular routine of walking at least 30 minutes a day, three or four days a week, you may want to incorporate other aerobic activities so that you don't get bored.Jogging or running are high-impact activities, so you may want to talk to your doctor again before you proceed from walking to running.
However, there are a number of low-impact aerobic activities that you can intersperse with your walking for a little variety. For example, you might consider doing one or two sessions a week on an elliptical trainer or step machine.
If you have access to a pool, you also might consider swimming or water therapy. The buoyancy of the water makes swimming a low-impact aerobic activity that is very good for your back.

, Ultimately, your goal should be to do aerobic or cardiovascular exercise continuously for at least 30 minutes. Once you're at this level, maintaining the same routine will gradually decrease your back pain.Just this regular physical activity can increase your cardiovascular strength and help your back heal more quickly, which will ease your back pain.
Focus on doing some sort of physical activity every day, even if your 30-minute walking regimen only takes place three or four days a week.

, If you are unsure how to work out with proper body mechanics, a physical therapist can help design a plan for you and check your form to make sure you're doing the exercises correctly.Your doctor may prescribe several weeks of physical therapy. Check with your health insurance company to find out how many physical therapy sessions are covered by your insurance.
Your physical therapist also can educate you on maintaining proper posture and using various ergonomic techniques to strengthen your back and decrease the impact of desk jobs that require you to sit for long periods of time.
At your first physical therapy appointment, your physical therapist will give you specific exercises designed to strengthen your back, with focus on the real that you have specifically injured or that are the source of your back pain.
Follow your physical therapist's recommendations carefully. If there are any other exercises or stretches that you want to try, talk to your physical therapist about them so they can incorporate them into your treatment plan if they see a benefit.

, Many physical therapists employ the McKenzie Method to treat acute low back pain, although patients with chronic back pain also may find some relief from this approach.To begin this treatment, you must first move through a series of motions with your physical therapist, who will gauge your response and use that information to classify your injury.
Based on the final assessment and classification, your physical therapist will develop a personalized exercise regimen for you that is specifically designed to decrease your pain over time.
The goal of the treatment is to gradually move the pain away from your back and out to your limbs. Thus, if extension movements cause back pain, you'll be prescribed a sequence of exercises that begin with you lying on the floor.
On the other hand, if you have more back pain when bending, the exercises prescribed by your physical therapist will involve more flex exercises from a seated or standing position.

, An exercise or stability ball can be useful to strengthen your back and core muscles, as well as improving your balance and stability. These exercises also provide a whole-body strength-training session.For example, you might do a front walkout, which begins with you laying face-down over the top of the ball. You walk forward on your hands as far as you can, rolling the exercise ball underneath you toward your feet. Roll the ball down to your thighs, keeping your core engaged. Then walk your hands back to starting position and repeat 3-5 times.
You can do the same exercise backwards, in which you sit on the ball and walk your feet away from the ball. Eventually you will be on your back with the ball under your shoulders.
Other ball exercises include reverse crunches and reverse extensions, or a combination of those two movements into one exercise.
Exercising with a ball can be difficult – especially if you've never used one before. Rather than attempting to start a new regime with an exercise ball on your own, you'll have better results if you work with your physical therapist or with a certified athletic trainer who has had experience working with people who have back pain.

, Pilates increase your stability as well as further building your core strength, which can ease back pain. Consult your doctor before you start a pilates class, and make sure to tell your instructor about your back pain so they can make appropriate modifications for you.Since good posture is one of the most important aspects of pilates practice, many of the poses and movements focus on strengthening your core and back muscles.
The slow and gentle movements of pilates practice make it a good strength-training regimen to add into your general exercise routine.
Pilates also focuses on neutral alignment and movements that don't cause stress to your spine and back, which can help you develop habits to maintain a strong and healthy back.
Your doctor or physical therapist may be able to recommend a particular pilates class in your area that is good for people with back pain.

, Basic weight-training exercises with lighter hand weights help you build the strength in your back muscles. Over time you will make you back stronger, decreasing your back pain.For example, you might add the reverse fly, which builds the strength in your upper-back and shoulder muscles. Stand with your knees slightly bent and your feet shoulder width apart. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing each other. Bend forward at the waist, keeping your back straight. Raise the weights to your sides with your elbows bent, squeezing your shoulder blades together, then release them back down.
Another strength-training exercise for back and shoulder muscles is the bent-over row. Stand with your feet about hip-width apart and bend from your hips (not from your waist) until the dumbbell in each hand is at your knees. As you keep your upper arms and elbows next to your ribs, pull the dumbbells up toward the lower part of your chest. Squeeze your shoulder blades together as you pull, then slowly release back to the starting position.
Build a strength-training program with three or four exercises that target your back and shoulders, doing two or three sets of 5 to 10 repetitions with each exercise. Gradually increase the number of repetitions or sets you do until you can complete your routine without fatigue. Then you'll be ready to increase the weight you use.
If you have a spinal injury that isn't muscle-related, talk to your doctor before you add any weight training to your exercise regimen.

, Particularly if your back pain is related to an acute injury, you shouldn't attempt any stretches without first consulting your doctor and working in concert with your physical therapist to make sure you're not doing further harm.When starting a stretching routine, be sure to wear comfortable clothes that won't bind you or restrict your range of motion.
Keep in mind that stretches should not be painful. Only move as far as you can comfortably – don't force your body to go further or you could cause additional strain or injury.
Make sure you are properly warmed up before you start a stretching routine.

, The knee-to-chest stretch is ideal to help align your pelvis as well as stretch the muscles in your lower back. You should hold each position for approximately 20 seconds, and repeat these stretches at least three times for each leg.For the knee-to-chest stretch, you should lie on your back with your toes pointed upward. Bend your right knee slowly, pulling your leg toward your chest.
Wrap your arms around your leg and hold it close to you, then release and do the same movement with your left leg.

, This stretch not only stretches the muscles that run next to and parallel with your spine, it also strengthens your core muscles, particularly your abs. Your physical therapist is likely to prescribe this stretch or something similar if you've had a spinal injury.You'll also start this stretch lying on your back with your legs extended. Bend your right knee and cross your right leg over the left side of your body.
Pull it over until you feel a gentle stretch through your back, keeping your core engaged.
After holding the stretch for approximately 20 seconds, slowly release your leg back to your starting position, then do the same thing with your left leg. Repeat the stretch at least three times with each leg.

, Even if you've not had any acute back injury, you may still suffer from lower back pain – particularly if you have an office job that requires sitting behind a desk for hours. Yoga poses can help ease this type of back pain.You don't need to join a yoga class to learn some basic poses to ease back pain. However, if you've never practiced yoga you may want to attend at least one class so the instructor can help you and make sure you're doing the poses correctly.
As you're doing your yoga poses, practice breathing deeply in through your nose and out through your mouth. In yoga, the breath is just as important as the poses – if not more important.
One yoga pose that's good for back pain is the two-knee twist. As you lie on your back, bend your knees into your chest. Your arms should be extended out beside you in a ""T"" formation. Exhale and lower your knees to the ground on your right side. Make sure both shoulders are pressed firmly into the mat. Bring your knees back to center, then move to the other side.
Another yoga pose you can do to strengthen your back and ease back pain is the sphinx. Lie on your stomach with your upper body propped up on your forearms. Your palms should be flat against the floor, your elbows at right angles. Press the tops of your feet and your palms down and push your pelvic bone forward. You'll feel this in your lower back, but focus on your breath and breathe deeply. Hold the position for between one and three minutes, then relax to the floor.

, Seated stretches, such as the piriformis seated stretch, can provide you relief and help ease back pain particularly when you have sciatica pain that radiates down your legs. The piriformis muscle is located in your buttocks and may compress the sciatic nerve, causing lower back pain that radiates down into your legs.
Ease this type of pain by sitting on the floor with your back straight, then cross your left leg over your right so that your left foot is next to your right thigh. You can tuck your right leg under your buttocks. Hold your left knee with your right arm, extending your left arm beside you to support you on the floor. Relax and breathe into the stretch, holding it for about 20 seconds before alternating sides.

, Even after you get back to work, you can still stretch your back periodically while you're sitting at your desk. These exercises and others can ease back pain if you sit for long hours.Create for yourself a mini-routine to stretch at work throughout the day. Arch your back five to ten times, then do 10 shoulder rolls and 10 shoulder-blade squeezes. You can also incorporate head and neck stretches or rolls.
If you're sitting for extended periods, you should do your mini-routine two or three times a day. You also should make an effort to stand and move around for a couple minutes after sitting for about an hour. For example, you could stand whenever you answer the phone.

Try therapeutic range of motion exercises.,
Exercise at a slow and steady pace.,
Start gentle yoga or pilates.,
Do range of motion exercises daily.",How to Exercise Sensitive Joints1," Particularly if you are recovering from a recent injury or have a health condition that causes joint stiffness, your doctor or physical therapist may prescribe therapeutic exercises for your sensitive joints.Even if you don't have a physical therapist, you can do range of motion exercises on your own to loosen your joints and increase your range of motion.
Never push past your range of motion. Each joint should be moved as far as it can comfortably go. Move each joint to the point where you feel some light resistance or some discomfort, but it does not hurt. Hold this position a few seconds and then return to a resting position. These are basic exercises specific to the individual joints you find sensitive. For example, if you have tight or sensitive shoulders, you can do shoulder rolls and then draw circles with your arms. Range of motion exercises for hips include leg raises and leg circles at different angles.
You may need to support the area near the joint during your range of motion exercises.;
, You don't want to rush exercise when you have sensitive joints, particularly range of motion exercises. Maintain good form and move slowly and deliberately, going only as far as you can without pain or discomfort., Yoga and pilates both can ease the pain and stiffness associated with arthritis and other conditions that cause joint sensitivity. Contrary to popular belief, you don't have to be extremely fit or flexible to practice yoga or pilates.Look for a class that is designed for people with sensitive joints. For example, your local community center may have a yoga class for people with arthritis.
You can use props to ease any pressure on your joints if you are having pain during the poses.

, Since these are slow, gentle movements, you generally can practice them every day without any complication. If you have a physical therapist, they may have prescribed range of motion exercises several times a day.Keeping your joints in motion keeps them from getting stiff or locking up entirely. If you have sensitive joints, keep working with them. You may improve their function or at least prevent a further decrease in mobility.

Know the symptoms.,
Teach your kids the importance of not sharing certain items.,
Be aware of lice carriers.,
Get checked.",How to Prevent Lice1," As you might know, lice are little and can be white, brown, or dark gray. They're most common around the ears and the back of the neck, and feed off of human blood. Nits are much more noticeable on darker-colored hair but lice is more noticeable on lighter hair .


The most common symptom of head lice is itchiness in and around the back of the neck.
In many children, lice don't produce any symptoms until weeks or months after they've moved in. For this reason, it's important to do regular visual check-ups with a fine-toothed comb in order to spot an infestation as early as possible.
Doctors recommend combing for lice after the child has taken a bath/shower, while their hair is still wet.;
, Because head lice commonly affect young children in school, it's important to be vigilant about situations in which children may share certain objects. Although you probably want to encourage your children to share certain things, you probably want to discourage them from sharing the following:


Hats
Headbands
Hair accessories
Pillows
Combs
Any other objects that promote direct head-to-head contact between a carrier and potential carrier.

, Obviously, although lice are irksome, they're not to be avoided like an infectious disease. Instead, be aware of anyone who may have had lice or is being treated. Knowledge is power.


If somebody had lice and was treated, but it has not been two weeks since their treatment, make sure you try to avoid contact with any of their fabrics. You don't have to be afraid of them, but casually avoid situations which involve contact with them, especially head-to-head contact.

, Lice can commonly occur in schools or summer camps. If your school or camp doesn't give out regular checks, ask the nurse for one every once in a while. If the nurse is unavailable, schedule an appointment with your child's general practitioner to check for lice.

Understand the benefits and limits of using vinegar.,
Use an over-the-counter medicated shampoo first.,
Choose the type of vinegar.,
Stand in the shower or tub and apply the vinegar.,
Run a fine-toothed comb through your hair.,
Ask your doctor about over-the-counter shampoos.,
Consult with your doctor about prescription medications.,
Consider using a natural herbal remedy.",How to Treat Head Lice with Vinegar," Vinegar is a common home remedy for head lice, but some people mistakenly think it will kill adult lice and their eggs, which are called nits. In reality, vinegar cannot kill head lice directly because it's not toxic to them. However, it can help remove the nits stuck to your hair, which prevents new lice from hatching and infesting your head.More specifically, the acetic acid in vinegar dissolves the protective shells surrounding nits and disables them from sticking to your hair.


After the application of vinegar, the nits either fall out of your hair or become much easier to remove with a fine-toothed comb.
Although vinegar can't kill adult lice, they may be able to kill newly hatched lice called nymphs. More research is needed to better understand the impact of vinegar or acetic acid on head lice.;
, Since vinegar will not kill the lice and eggs, it is important to treat the lice with a medicated shampoo first. Lice treatment shampoos are also known as pediculicides.After using a pediculicide, you can use vinegar to help remove the nits from your hair.

Using a medicated shampoo first will help to ensure that the adult lice are dead and this will reduce the chances of spreading the lice.

, All types of vinegar contain acetic acid, but some types and brands are a little more concentrated than others. In general, chose a vinegar that has about 5% acetic acid — it's enough to dissolve the coatings on nits, but not acidic enough to irritate most people's skin.White vinegar is plain acetic acid diluted in water and usually the least expensive choice. Red wine vinegar is more expensive and often has between 5-7% acetic acid. Apple cider vinegar will also work, but make sure to choose non-filtered and pasteurized types because they tend to be the strongest concentration (around 5% acetic acid).


A much higher concentration of acetic acid (more than 7%) might irritate your scalp, although much weaker concentrations might not be able to dissolve the nits attachment to you hair. Stick to vinegars that have between 5-7% acetic acid.
The itching from head lice is due to an allergic reaction to lice saliva. Not all people have an allergic reaction and get itchy.

, Once you've decided on the type and concentration of vinegar, undress yourself and stand in the tub or shower. Dampen your hair with some water first (but not too much so that it's dripping wet) and then pour on a few cups of vinegar directly to your scalp. Massage the vinegar into your scalp and try to cover as much of your hair as possible — this might be challenging if your have long hair, but take your time. Then, let the vinegar sit in your hair for between 5-10 minutes, which is enough time for it to dissolve the nit's exoskeletons (coverings).Make sure to close your eyes when you apply the vinegar. Diluted acetic acid can't damage your eyes, but it can certainly make them sting for a few minutes.
Avoid getting vinegar on your clothes because it can stain them, particularly red wine and apple cider vinegars.

, After the vinegar has been in your hair for at least 5 minutes, run a fine-toothed comb through it thoroughly. The loosened nits and some adult lice will be removed by intensive combing.For best results, consider buying a special ""nit comb"" (very fine-toothed plastic or metal combs) at the pharmacy or online. After combing your hair for a few minutes, rinse out the remaining vinegar and towel dry it — but make sure not to share your towel with anyone while you still have some head lice.


Using vinegar is great for loosening nits from your hair, but not for killing mature lice on your scalp. Thus, don't be surprised to see some head lice after a vinegar treatment.
Vinegar treatments can be done daily until no more nits remain attached to your hair. The acetic acid will also remove the oils from your hair, so it might look dry or frizzy after the vinegar treatments.
Nits hatch within 7-9 days of being laid, and mature lice can live up to 3-4 weeks. Thus, if you're just using vinegar to combat your head lice, it may take a month before the infestation is completely gone.

, Make an appointment with your doctor or dermatologist and get properly diagnosed. Then ask your doctor about the most effective over-the-counter (OTC) shampoos or ointments for head lice that can be purchased at mainstream pharmacies. Your doctor will likely recommend OTC products based on pyrethrin, a compound from chrysanthemum flowers that's toxic to lice.Popular brands include Nix (a synthetic version of pyrethrin) and Rid (pyrethrin mixed with other compounds toxic to lice).


These pyrethrin-based shampoos are effective for killing head lice, but not usually nits. As such, consider combining vinegar and pyrethrin treatments to get rid of both lice and their nits.The side effects of using pyrethrin-based shampoos include scalp irritation, redness and itchiness — especially among children allergic to chrysanthemum or ragweed.
Head lice don't spread disease (bacterial or viral), but scalp itchiness can trigger excessive scratching that leads to infected sores in some people.Do not follow up the lice treatment shampoo with a regular shampoo and/or conditioner. This will reduce the effectiveness of the lice treatment shampoo., If the head lice infestation is not controlled with vinegar and/or OTC shampoos, then you should talk to your doctor about getting a stronger medication. In some geographic locations, head lice have developed resistance to OTC shampoos, so prescription medications are all that work. The most common prescription medications recommended for head lice are benzyl alcohol (Ulesfia), malathion (Ovide) and Lindane.Collectively, medicines that can kill lice are called pediculicides and they all should be used cautiously, particularly with children.


Benzyl alcohol kills lice on the scalp by depriving them of oxygen. It's effective, but potential side effects include skin irritation, allergic reaction and seizures, so it's not recommended for children younger than 6 months of age.
Malathion shampoo is only approved for children aged 6 years or older due to potential serious side effects. Be careful not to expose this shampoo to a hot hair dryer or get it near an open flame because of its high alcohol content.
Lindane shampoo is sort a ""last resort"" treatment for head lice because of its high risk of serious side effects (including seizures). As such, it's not recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics for use on children of any age or pregnant women., Some research indicates that certain plant-based oils may have a toxic effect on head lice and their eggs (nits).The plant oils with the most promise for combating head lice include tea tree oil, anise oil, ylang ylang essential oil and nerolidol (a compound found in many plants). Although these plant oils are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat lice, they have a pretty good safety record in general and likely worth a try if your budget allows for it.


Plant oils such as tea tree oil are often found in natural medicated shampoos marketed to treat dandruff and psoriasis, but they can work well to combat head lice also.
In general, these plant-based oils are as safe for children as they are for adults — no serious side effects have been reported.
Some other natural remedies that can kill head lice by ""smothering"" them (depriving them of oxygen) include olive oil and butter. Apply either to your scalp for 5-10 minutes before rinsing off with a medicated shampoo for best results.
Head lice cannot jump or fly, so they spread to others usually by head-to-head contact.However, indirect methods of spreading are possible via sharing hats, brushes, combs, towels, pillows, scarves, hair accessories and stereo headphones.

See a doctor for diagnosis.,
Try medicated shampoo.,
Ask your doctor about prescription medications.",How to Remove Head Lice Eggs1," If you have head lice, you will need to make an appointment with a doctor or at least call your doctor for advice. There are a variety of treatment options available for removing head lice and eggs, and your doctor can recommend the treatment and also give you specific instructions on how to use medicated shampoos or oral medications., If your doctor thinks it's safe for you, she will likely recommend an over-the-counter medicated shampoo as your first course of action. Use the shampoo as your doctor instructs.


OTC shampoos contain a chemical compound called pyrethrin, which is toxic to head lice. Medicated shampoos include permethrin (Nix), which contains a synthetic version of pyrethrin, and pyrethrin with additives (Rid, A-200 Lice Killing), which combines pyrethrin with other chemicals. Pyrethrin can cause side effects such as itching and scalp redness.You will have to wash your hair or your child's hair with this shampoo. Do not use conditioner. Some people find rinsing hair with white vinegar after washing helps the treatment work faster. Follow the directions on the shampoo that will advise you how long to leave the shampoo in before rinsing.You will usually need a second treatment after the first shampooing. While OTC shampoos remove some lice eggs, some will remain in the hair and hatch. Many recommend a second treatment seven to ten days after the first but your doctor might suggest otherwise depending on the level of you or your child's infestation., In some cases, lice develop a resistance to OTC shampoos. Your doctor therefore may recommend prescription-strength shampoos to treat the infestation.


Benzyl alcohol (Ulesfia) kills lice by depriving them of oxygen. It is not approved for children less than 6 months of age as it can cause severe side effects like seizures. It is usually safe on children above this age, although it can sometimes cause redness and itching of the scalp.Malathion (Ovide) can be used on people age six and older. It is a medicated shampoo that you apply and then leave to dry. It will rinse out on its own after eight to 12 hours. Do not use this drug with a hair dryer or near fire as it is flammable.Lindane is only used when other treatments have failed. It can cause severe side effects, like seizures. It should not be used on children, anyone who weighs less than 110 pounds, pregnant or breastfeeding women, HIV patients, or anyone with a history of seizures.Rarely, your doctor may prescribe ivermectin, which can be applied topically (Sklice) or given orally."

Exterminate all adult lice.,
Try a prescription shampoo.,
Suffocate the live lice as an alternative.,
Prepare your nit-removal area.",How to Remove Nits from Hair1," Removing the nits from the hair of the person affected won't make a difference if adult lice are still able to breed. As long as there are adult lice, new batches of eggs will continue to appear on the hair. These additional eggs will then hatch into more lice, which in turn will lay more eggs. This unending cycle is not broken until all adult lice have been killed.Submerging your hair underwater for an extended period of time will not kill or drown lice. Studies show that the lice simply cling to the hair or scalp while underwater and can survive underwater for several hours. The chlorine in pool water, unfortunately, is also not strong enough to kill lice. To kill adult lice, wash your hair, or that of the person affected, with over-the-counter lice shampoo. In extreme cases of head lice, prescription-strength head lice shampoo is also available.;
, One option is Pyrethrum, which comes from chrysanthemum flowers that harbor natural insecticides called pyrethrins. Pyrethrins attack lice’s nervous systems, though some lice are now resistant to the toxin.Apply the shampoo to dry hair. Then, wait ten minutes, add water, work into a lather, and rinse. You should then try to remove nits and repeat the process seven to 10 days later, to kill any remaining bugs.

, Although there are few clinical studies on its effectiveness, some people believe that you can kill lice by suffocation. The way this works is that certain products, they argue, clog the bugs’ breathing holes. Lice can survive for hours without breathing, but eventually they will die.Try a petroleum jelly like Vaseline. Apply the jelly to your hair and scalp thickly. The jelly must remain for up to eight hours to kill, and you should wear a shower cap to restrict air flow. Keep in mind that Vaseline will be very hard to remove and will not kill the nits.Some people also advocate the use of common olive oil. Again, some claim that the oil plugs the insects’ breathing holes and suffocates them. Like Vaseline, you should apply the oil to your hair and scalp, don a shower cap, and wait about eight hours before cleaning the oil. As a bonus, the oil should loosen the nits from your hair and make it easier to remove them.Mayonnaise may work as well. Mayo contains a large amount of oil, which seems to be the suffocating ingredient. Apply to your hair and scalp like Vaseline and olive oil. Anecdotal evidence suggests that regular, high fat mayonnaise works best., Sit down in an area with plenty of natural or artificial light. This will make it easier the person removing the nits to actually see them, as they are small and are glued to the hair near the scalp.Additionally, drape a towel over your shoulders to catch any hair or nits that fall off.

Warm up thoroughly before strength training.,
Start with isometric exercises.,
Alternate between the upper and lower body.,
Use light weights.,
Focus on closed-chain exercises.",How to Exercise Sensitive Joints2," Undue stress or strain to the muscles surrounding sensitive joints can cause your joint pain to worsen. Spend five to ten minutes walking or doing some dynamic stretching before you begin your workout.Dynamic stretching is different from static stretching. Continuous lunges are an example of dynamic stretching. You should not do static stretching at the beginning of your workout, as it can lead to injury.
Make sure you're warming up the muscle groups you plan to exercise, as well as your body as a whole. For example, if you're planning to do an upper body workout, you might walk for five minutes, followed by a couple minutes of sit-ups or crunches and a couple minutes of arm swings at a gentle and slow pace.

, With isometric exercises, you contract specific muscles without actually moving your body. If your joints are stiff, isometric exercises can help you build strength in your muscles without moving the joints.Isometric exercises can be a good way to build initial strength if your joints are particularly stiff, or if you are new to exercise.
Start with the largest muscle in a muscle group, since it typically will be the easiest for you to find and isolate. Contract the muscle and hold the contraction for about five seconds, then release. Repeat slowly three to five times with appropriate rest periods over several minutes, then move on to another muscle.

, While whole-body exercises may be more efficient, if you're trying to exercise sensitive joints you don't want to overtax them. Start with exercises that target the upper body, then tackle the lower body the next day.A good strength training regimen to work up to would work your shoulders and arms one day, your legs and hips another day, and your back and core the third day. Next, to ensure the full recovery of each muscle group have a day of rest on the fourth day.

, When you first start a strength-training program, you may not be able to lift even the smallest dumbbell. Start with bodyweight exercises, and repurpose light items around the house to use as weights.For example, you might do curls and presses with a can of soup.

, With a closed-chain exercise, the limb you're exercising remains stationary while the rest of your body moves. These exercises are better if you have sensitive joints, because they require the muscles to do more work and put less pressure on the joints.Squats are an example of a closed-chain exercise. Your quadriceps do the work when you squat, taking pressure off your knees and ankles. Your feet and lower legs remain stationary.
Be cautious approaching open-chain exercises, in which your body remains still while the limb moves. These exercises are good if you're working a joint after an injury. Otherwise, closed-chain exercises are best for sensitive joints because they work more muscles around the joint. Examples of open-chain exercises would be the bench press or leg press."
"
Go for walks.,
Exercise in water.,
Try cycling.,
Work your upper body with a rowing machine.,
Build up to at least three times a week.,
Reduce joint pain with a foam roller.",How to Exercise Sensitive Joints3," When you're just starting to exercise with sensitive joints, walking is the best way to get in the habit of staying active. Start with short, five-minute walks and work your way up gradually to longer walks that cover greater distances.Either walking outside or indoors on a treadmill is equally beneficial. If you're walking outdoors, look for a relatively flat surface without a lot of hills. That will put less stress on your joints.
If you're walking for fitness, work your way up to a 30-minute walk every day. If you don't have a half-hour to set aside for exercise, try splitting it into two 15-minute walks – one in the morning and one in the early evening.

, If you have access to a pool, you might sign up for a swimming, water aerobics, or similar class. Water exercises are low-impact and safe if you have sensitive joints, and the weight of the water provides resistance so you also get a strength-training component.Large fitness centers typically have pools and offer a variety of swimming and water exercise classes. The benefit of using an indoor pool at a fitness center is that you can continue your water exercise year round.
Community pools frequently offer various water aerobics classes as well, particularly in the warmer months.

, Cycling indoors on a stationary bicycle is good exercise if your hips, knees, or ankles are stiff or sensitive. You can do cycling instead of walking, or use it to supplement your walking regimen for variety.Make sure your seat is adjusted properly, and don't add resistance until you can pedal easily and are confident that your muscles are well warmed up.
Cycling indoors generally is better for your joints than outdoor cycling, where you may have to start and stop quickly and there also is a balance component.

, If you're a member of a gym, chances are it has a rowing machine. While your legs do some work in stabilizing your body, the bulk of the work on a rowing machine is done by your arms, shoulders, back, and core.Using a rowing machine can add variety to your fitness routine, especially since it focuses on your upper body.
Rotate your fitness exercises just as you do strength training. For example, if on Monday you do an upper-body strength-training routine, and you do cardio or fitness exercises on Tuesday, choose walking or cycling for Tuesday so your upper body gets rest. Use the rowing machine after a lower-body strength-training day.

, Ultimately, you want to incorporate some form of cardio or basic fitness exercise into your life at least three times a week. If you're on a walking regimen, you may choose to go for a walk every day.If you've just started exercising, start with one day a week for 10 to 15 minutes, then work up slowly until you can do 30 minutes three days a week.
If you're doing strength training as well, alternate strength training and fitness exercise. A basic week might look something like this:

Monday: Upper body strength training
Tuesday: Cycling
Wednesday: Lower body strength training
Thursday: Rowing machine
Friday: Back/core strength training
Saturday: Walking
Sunday: Full rest



, The connective tissue surrounding your joints and muscles, called ""fascia,"" can get dry and brittle, exacerbating joint pain. Using a foam roller allows normal blood flow to return and the restoration of healthy tissue so your joints are more supported.Most gyms have foam rollers. You also can buy one relatively inexpensively online to use by yourself at home.
For example, to loosen tight hamstrings and calves that might be causing knee or ankle pain, sit on the floor with one leg extended, placing the foam roller under your upper thigh. Bend the other leg at the knee so your foot is flat on the floor. Placing your hands behind you for support, slowly roll down the roller until you feel a tender spot, then return to the starting position and repeat.

Steer clear of fumigants and other chemical sprays.,
Wash regularly worn or slept-in items if you suspect your child may have been exposed to lice.,
Soak hair care products in warm water, isopropyl alcohol, or medicated shampoo solution.,
Use the correct hair products to repel lice.,
Vacuum the floor and any upholstery that might support a colony of lice.,
Enjoy life!",How to Prevent Lice2," These sprays are not necessary to kill head lice and can do more harm than good if inhaled or ingested.

, This includes:


Washing children's sheets in hot water
Washing any clothes the child may have worn in the past 48 hours
Putting in the dryer for 20 minutes any plush toys your child may sleep with

, Hair care products such as brushes, combs, hair ties, headbands, barrettes, etc. should be soaked periodically to kill any lice. If an item is in question, it's better to be safe than sorry.

, Whether it's the smell of certain products or an adverse chemical reaction, lice tend to stay away from:


Tea tree oil. You can use a shampoo or conditioner with this ingredient to repel lice.
Coconut oil. Coconut oil is known to deter lice.
Menthol, eucalyptus oil, lavender oil, and rosemary oil. Most likely, lice dislike the smell of these strong oils.
Hair products designed to repel lice also exist. Make sure you don't use lice killing shampoo unless you actually have lice, or else it is bad for your hair.

, Once a month, do a deep vacuum and hit any carpeted areas or upholstery where lice might breed or wait for human contact.

, Don't live in fear trying to prevent something that might never happen to you. It's not worth being worried about lice until you appear to have a legitimate outbreak.

Learn how to identify lice.,
Prepare the hair.,
Comb your hair.,
Clean up.",How to Remove Head Lice Eggs2," If you want to remove lice eggs (""nits"") through wet combing, you'll need to learn how to identify lice. Spend some time familiarizing yourself with what head lice and lice eggs look like before wet combing.


Adult or baby lice are between 1/10 and 1/8 inch long. They're usually gray or tan in color. They cannot fly or jump, but do crawl quickly.Lice eggs, or nits, are small and coffee-colored before hatching. They are about the size of a sesame seed. They can be difficult to remove as they're glued securely to the hair shaft.Empty eggs/nits are usually white or clear-colored.
Use a magnifying glass to help you find lice eggs., Before you wet comb your hair, you'll need to prepare your hair for the process. Brush it with a regular brush or comb to remove any tangles. Cover your hair with conditioner to keep your hair wet. , Use a fine-toothed comb specifically designed for removing lice for the process (sometimes called a ""nit comb""). Separate masses of hair into sections the same width as the comb. This allows you to see and remove lice more easily.Comb the hair one section at a time. Take one section of hair in your hand and comb through it. Start at the scalp and pull the comb flat against the head. Go slowly, and watch for lice and nits as you comb.If you notice any lice and debris build up on the comb, dip it in a bowl of soapy water to remove., Once you're done, flush the water you used to clean the comb down the toilet. Soak the comb in ammonia water, which is made by mixing one teaspoon of ammonia into two cups of hot water. Check the hair once again for any stray lice or nits. If you see any hairs with lice or eggs, remove them individually using a pair of scissors.Continue to wet comb once a week for three weeks, checking for lice. Contact your doctor if you see live lice after three weeks.

Try tea tree oil.,
Use other essential oils.,
Try smothering agents.",How to Remove Head Lice Eggs3," While there is no scientific consensus, some research indicates tea tree oil and other natural oils may kill head lice. You can buy tea tree oil at a local health shop or order it online. See if it works at treating head lice.


Some people are allergic to tea tree oil and will have a lot of skin redness or irritation if used. Talk to your doctor before trying tea tree oil. Or, you can apply a small amount to your arm for a few days to look for an allergic reaction. Be especially careful if using on a child.
Before bed, sprinkle a few drops of tea tree oil on your scalp. Put a towel on your pillow and go to sleep, leaving the oil in overnight.In the morning, comb your hair to remove any dead lice or eggs. Then, wash and condition your hair. If possible, use shampoo and conditioner that contains tea tree oil. Look for a minimum concentration of 2% tea tree oil.Repeat as necessary. The process may take a few tries before it works.

, Some research indicates some natural plant oils may be toxic to head lice. However, scientific research is limited and not conclusive. Lavender oil, anise oil, ylang ylang oil, and nerolidol all may work at removing head lice. You can order these oils online or can find them in some drug or health food stores. Use with caution, however, as essential oils are not required to meet FDA safety regulations.Keep in mind many essential oils need to be diluted in a carrier oil, like olive oil, before use. Read the label of any oils you purchase for instructions on safe use. As with tea tree oil, use these oils with caution, especially with children. Talk to your doctor before using essential oils to treat head lice.

, Many household products can supposedly kill head lice by depriving lice and eggs from air. This can smother lice and eggs but there is little clinical evidence of the effectiveness of these treatments.


Olive oil, mayonnaise, petroleum jelly, and butter are all suggested smothering agents to treat head lice. You would apply one of these products to your hair, cover with a shower cap or hair net, and leave in overnight. Wash out in the morning and see if you notice any results."

Familiarize yourself with the reasons treatments fail.,
Wash all fabrics in your home.,
Vacuum carpeting and upholstered furniture.,
Wash combs and hair supplies.",How to Remove Head Lice Eggs4," If you do not use treatments correctly, they may not effectively remove lice eggs. Make sure you avoid common pitfalls when treating head lice.


Using conditioner with medicated shampoo can prevent treatment from working successfully. Conditioner can act as a barrier, preventing head lice medication from reaching the scalp. Avoid using conditioner when applying medicated shampoos.Follow all instructions carefully when using shampoo. Oftentimes, people neglect to read the full instructions and this results in treatment being ineffective. Make sure you apply a second treatment and wait the appropriate time. If you retreat too soon after the first treatment, not all the eggs will have hatched and you may not remove all the lice.Reinfestation is also common. You may kill all the lice on your head or your child's head but then encounter new lice from another person or your environment. Make sure you avoid people who are currently infested with head lice and treat your home to remove any lice that have wandered from your scalp., Lice usually don't live long after being separated from the scalp. However, as a precaution you should wash any items the infested person used. Wash fabrics, bedding, stuffed animals, and clothing in hot water and then dry at high heat. If you have any items that can't be washed, seal them in a plastic bag for two weeks., In rare cases, lice can get on carpeting or furniture. To be safe, vacuum upholstered furniture and carpeted floors regularly until the infestation has passed., As lice can get into supplies you use on your scalp, such items should be washed. Wash brushes, hair ties, hair accessories, hats, and any other items used on your hair in warm, soapy water."

Rinse your hair with water and vinegar.,
Begin to comb out the nits.,
Rinse the nit comb after each section.,
Repeat this process until you have combed through all of your hair.,
Wash your hair.,
Clean your materials.",How to Remove Nits from Hair2," Nit eggs are covered in a sticky substance which binds them to human hair follicles. Vinegar has been found to contain chemicals that dissolve this substance, preventing nits from maintaining their grip on human hair.








While kneeling in front of a bathtub, place your head under the faucet. Turn on the warm water and thoroughly dampen your hair. Then, turn off the water and, while still kneeling, pour a large amount of vinegar over your head. Make sure that all strands are coated with the liquid. Then use warm water to rinse your hair.
Alternatively, fill a sink with 1:1 parts of water and vinegar. Submerge your hair in the sink entirely, either by dipping your head forward or dipping it backward into the solution.
Detangle with a leave-in conditioner and normal brush. Try to get your hair entirely detangled, so that combing with a nit brush is easy and painless.

, If you are the one affected by lice, then you will need the help of another person. They'll need a metal nit comb — a fine-toothed and rigid comb that is better at removing nits than a plastic comb. You should be able to buy a nit comb at most pharmacies for under $10. They can use a magnifying lens if possible to search for hard-to-see nits.









A large number of nits could have been rinsed out of your hair during the vinegar application. However, there will likely still be eggs clinging to the dampened strands. Working with one small section of hair at a time — about the width of the nit comb — your helper should carefully comb through your entire head.

, Once the comb has run-through a section of hair, the comb should be cleaned off in a shallow bowl filled with water and dish soap. Then, wipe it dry using facial tissue or paper towel, being sure to remove any lice or nits that have clung to the comb.








, Once your helper has finished with a particular portion of hair, he should pin it flat to the side of your head to minimize the chance of re-infestation.








, You may want to wash your hair one more time after a complete comb-through. Even if all the nits and live lice have been removed by this point, a final wash may help you to feel cleaner. Consider using the head lice shampoo again to ensure complete removal of all living nits and their eggs.









Once your hair is dry, examine it carefully for signs of lice or nits. If you can see any of these creatures, start the removal process over from the beginning.

, Put the soapy nit bowl in the dishwasher or leave it full of just-boiled water for 10 minutes with a lid on it. You can also stand hairbrushes, hairclips, etc., in a container with just-boiled water, along with the louse comb but try to remove all hair and eggs from them first.









Heat over 129°F (54 °C) will kill lice and nits after five to 10 minutes.
Alternatively, combine two cups of just-boiled water with one cup of ammonia. Soak the nit comb in the ammonia water for 15 minutes, and then clean the comb with an old toothbrush.
Each family member should have his own comb.

Saturate the hair with Listerine.,
Rinse with warm water and vinegar.,
Clean up your worksite and materials.",How to Remove Nits from Hair3," Listerine or a similar mouthwash contains a high percentage of alcohol that will kill live lice and dissolve the nits’ binding to the hair follicle. While some “natural remedy” websites suggest it, be warned that other medical websites do not recommend its use.For one thing, Listerine’s alcohol content can burn the eyes and sting if it comes into contact with open wounds. It could also be accidentally consumed by a child.


If you decide to use Listerine, use it to wet the hair completely and cover with a shower cap for 30 minutes or longer. This will kill the adult lice. Repeat if needed.
You can also put the Listerine on your hair and put a towel on your pillow, to keep it from getting wet, and go to sleep and do the remaining steps in the morning.

, After soaking your hair, flush the Listerine out thoroughly with warm water and apply a generous amount of vinegar to further loosen the nits.Following the above steps, apply a leave-in conditioner or de-tangler, brush the hair, and then use a nit comb to slowly remove the eggs section by section.

, Clean the nit comb in a dish of soapy water or in the heat of a dishwasher. Also put the Listerine into a spray bottle and spray your nearby furniture. This will kill the adults and help to prevent re-infestation.


You can wash any linens, towels, or bedding in hot water. Remember that sustained heat will kill lice and nits.

Avoid head-to-head contact with others.,
Avoid contact with infested clothing accessories, personal cleaning products, and bedding.,
Wash all clothes, towels, and linens in high heat.,
Vacuum the floor and other surfaces.,
Be wary of harsh chemicals.",How to Remove Nits from Hair4," Thankfully, head lice are not very mobile. They cannot jump and cannot survive for long off of a human head. The most common way that they spread is through direct head-to-head contact.This might take place at school, while playing sports, or during sleepovers for children. For adults, it might be through contact with an infested loved one.

, Lice cannot feed if they are not on a human head and will starve to death in one to two days. But it still helps to be cautious. Avoid objects that could harbor live lice or their eggs.This includes hats, hair ties, barrettes, scarves, coats, and uniforms. Do not share these objects, either, or combs, brushes, and towels.
Soak all combs, brushes, and towels in water hotter than 130°F (54°C) for 10 minutes in order to disinfect.

, Used bedding, pillows, stuffed animals, or towels can be laundered in hot water and dried on high heat to effectively kill the insects. Again, make sure that the water is hotter than 130°F (54°C). If clothes cannot be washed or dried using high heat, take them to the dry cleaner or seal them in a plastic bag for two weeks.

, You or another infested person may have dropped live lice or eggs on surfaces in your home, like the couches or carpets. If possible, use a vacuum with a HEPA filter to ensure that any nits are absorbed during the vacuum process.


Lice or nits on such surfaces will not be viable for long and probably won’t spread. Still, it is a good precaution to clean them up as soon as possible.

, Fumigants and other harsh chemicals are not necessary to eradicate fleas and nits. The potential danger of inhaling or coming into contact with a strong chemical may be worse than the upside.Even if chemical remedies are available, be aware that overuse in the past few decades has caused their effectiveness to decline. The insects have in many cases built up an immunity to them."

Wet the hair with water and use something such as hair conditioner to lubricate it.Run the nit comb the length of the hair at least twice during a session.Repeat the process every three to four days for several weeks. Do this for at least two weeks after you find no more lice in your hair.Use a light directed on the scalp to illuminate the area on which you’re combing.A magnifying glass may also help you more effectively see the area you’re combing.Comb sections that are about 1 inch by ½ inch, starting at the scalp and ending with the tip. Make sure to clean the comb with a tissue and some hot water after you’ve combed each section.Pin up sections of the hair you’ve already combed to ensure that you get your entire scalp.;
, There is some evidence that applying natural plants oils to the hair may kill lice and eggs and soothe related itching.Be aware that although essential oils may work against, they are not approved by the Federal Drug Administration to meet safety, efficacy, and manufacturing standards, and may cause damage to your scalp if not used properly.Use essential oils such as tea tree oil, anise oil, ylang ylang oil for lice and their nits. You can also look for plant oils containing nerolidol, which is a chemical compound found in many plant oils.Examples of this kind of oils includes: neroli, ginger, jasmine, and lavender.Mix about 50 drops of your chosen essential oil or oils with 4 tablespoons vegetable oil.Apply the mixture to your hair and cover it with a plastic shower cap. Then wrap this with a towel.Leave it on your hair for an hour and then shampoo your hair thoroughly to rinse out any lice and nits.You can buy essential oils at most health food stores, some pharmacies, and many grocery stores.

, There are several household products that may deprive lice and nits of air.Applying a coat of any of these smothering agents to your hair and leaving it on overnight may treat your lice infestation.Apply mayonnaise, olive oil, butter, or petroleum jelly to your hair.Put on a shower cap over the smothering agent and leave on the mixture and cap overnight.In the morning, remove the smothering agent with baby oil and by shampooing and rinsing your hair thoroughly.Be aware that because of the nature of these products, that it may take a lot of work to get them out of your hair.Repeat this process several nights in a row., After successfully killing lice and nits, combine a mixture of 50% water and 50% vinegar. This can help dissolve the bodies of dead nits and may also help remove any lingering lice or nits in your hair.Rub the mixture vigorously into your hair and rinse thoroughly.A mixture of vinegar and olive oil may also work., No matter what natural remedy you choose to treat lice, never use any product that is flammable on your hair. Kerosene and gasoline can cause serious harm to your health and also increase your risk of having your hair catch on fire if exposed to flames., Although lice usually don’t survive past one day off the scalp, you may want to clean household items as a precaution.Wash and clean any items the affected person has used within the past two days.Wash bedding, stuffed animals, and clothing in hot and soapy water. The water should be at least 130 degrees Fahrenheit (or 54.4 degrees Celsius). Dry items at a high heat.Wash hair care items such as combs, brushes, and accessories in hot, soapy water.Soak the items in water that is at least 130 degrees Fahrenheit (or 54.4 degrees Celsius) for 5-10 minutes.Seal any items that you cannot clean or wash in a plastic bag for two weeks to deprive the lice and nits of air.Vacuum your floors and any upholstered furniture., After any treatment and for a couple of weeks following treatment, inspect your head vigilantly for evidence of any lice or their nits. This can help prevent the spread to other individuals and help ensure that you don’t have any lingering lice or eggs that need treatment.Nits hatch 7-11 days after being laid, so check your scalp for at least two weeks after treatment.You may want to use a magnifying glass and lamp to inspect hair and other household items.Check the hair daily until the infestation is gone and then every week thereafter to detect any reinfestation., Schools and child care facilities are the most commons sources of lice infestations, though they can occur any place.Contact the place that you believe is the source of the infestation in order to alert them to the possibility that others may also have it.Let the source know that you are treating your own infestation.

, In general, it’s a good idea to separate personal items as much as possible. This can minimize the risk of lice and nits spreading to others and also prevent reinfestation.Place coats, hats, and scarves on separate hooks as much as possible., It’s important not to share any personal items that you may have. This can prevent any type of head lice and nit transmission.Only use your own comb, brush, hat, and scarf.Make sure to use your own protective sports headgear such as helmets., If you find that successive natural treatments don’t kill lice, schedule an appointment with your doctor. She may prescribe medication for the lice or any related skin infection, or your doctor may be able to identify if your “lice” is another condition such as dandruff.Persistent itching from lice can break the skin and cause infections.Lice can look like other conditions including: dandruff, residue from hair products, beads of dead hair tissue on the hair shaft, scab tissue, other small insects in the hair."

Remember, the nits can be found near the base of the hair at the scalp and the adults will be present throughout the hair and scalp. You may find it useful to use a magnifying glass if you have trouble seeing the lice.
Make sure that you rinse the comb often under running hot water as you comb your child’s hair.

, Once you have completely combed your child’s hair, shampoo and rinse your child’s hair. You can repeat this process right away if you like, but you may only want to comb your child’s hair once in the morning and evening, since it is very time consuming.

, After you have finished combing your child’s hair, immediately soak the lice comb and wash the towels. You can soak the comb in a 10% bleach solution or 2% Lysol solution for 30 minutes and then rinse it well. Wash the towels on the hot setting with detergent and then dry on high for at least 20 minutes.As an alternative, you can soak the combs in vinegar for 30 minutes or boil in water for 10 minutes.

Try the suffocation method.,
Kill the lice with essential oils.,
Wash bedding and clothing.,
Bag items that can't be washed.,
Vacuum all living areas every day.,
Soak hair tools, ties, and barrettes in very hot water.,
Warn your child not to share any hats, headwear, or sporting equipment with other children.",How to Get Rid of Lice With Orange Juice3," Coat hair from roots to ends with some almond oil or olive oil. Cover your child’s hair a towel or shower cap and leave the oil on for at least 1-2 hours. Then, completely comb out the hair, shampoo, and rinse. Repeat this process every day for 3 weeks.


Before using oil, test the oil on a small area of your child’s skin to make sure your child is not sensitive to it. (Place a drop or two of the oil on your child’s forearm and wait about 30-60 minutes, then rinse off. If there is no reaction such as redness or itching, you can use that oil).
Vaseline and mayonnaise are not recommended by most experts because they are messy and can be difficult to wash out.

, There have been a number of studies showing that some natural products, including those using tea tree oil, eucalyptus oil, neem oil and lavender oil can be just as effective as OTC products and prescription medications.Before you try any essential oil, put a small drop on the back of your child’s hand. It is relatively rare, but some children do have allergic reactions to essential oils. Leave the oil on for 30 minutes to an hour and rinse off. If there is no redness or itching, you can use the oil. If there is any reaction, try again with another oil.
Mix 2 ounces of olive or almond oil with 15-20 drops of the essential oil. Apply this mixture to the scalp and work it through the hair. Leave on overnight, these oils generally take about 12 hours to completely kill the nits (eggs), nymphs (young) and adults. Comb out and shampoo, rinse and repeat.
Try one of these essential oils:Tea Tree Oil
Lavender oil
Neem oil
Clove oil
Nutmeg oil



, Wash all (everyone’s) bedding, clothing, hats, jackets, stuffed animals and other items that may have been exposed to the infested person during the two days before treatment. Wash these items using hot water (should be at least 130°F) and the high heat drying cycle.For anything that cannot be machine washed, have it dry-cleaned. Just make sure that you check first with the dry cleaner and explain that it may have lice on it, so that they can take extra precautions.

, If you have items that cannot be washed or dry-cleaned, it is recommended you place them in sealed plastic bags, keeping them sealed for two weeks. This is not always necessary, but this precaution may help ensure you kill every last head lice and nit., Lice may have gotten onto cloth furniture surfaces or they might still be living on hairs that have fallen onto these surfaces, so make sure to vacuum daily to prevent the lice from finding a host again. Vacuum your home thoroughly, especially any surface that may have have made contact with your child's head. Areas that you should be sure to vacuum include:Carpets
Mattresses
Upholstery

, Use very hot water (at least 130°F or 54.4°C) to soak all of your hair tools and other hair items. Let them sit in the solution for about 10 minutes. This should kill the lice on these items. You can also use isopropyl alcohol to soak these items. Another option is to dispose of the infested hair tools and go out and buy new ones.Make sure that each child has his or her own personal comb and/or brush.

, If your child is involved in any sport or playtime activity, make sure they have their own gear or equipment. Make sure they can keep track of it as well.


At the pool or gym, make sure your child has their own towels and other personal items.
Make sure your child understands that they can share toys, but they should NOT share combs, brushes, hats, scarves or hair accessories

Gather the clothes.,
Machine wash your clothes.,
Take the clothes to the dry cleaners.",How to Get Lice Off Clothes1," If you have lice, you will need to wash your clothes to help you make sure you and your house are rid of them. Before you do this you need to determine which clothes you need to wash. Gather together all the clothes that you wore or used over the past two days before you noticed and treated the lice.You should include everything, including things such as scarves and hats.
When you do this you should also gather all the towels, bedding and cloth toys that you have used in the two days.;
, Once you have gathered together all the clothes, you need to wash them at a high temperature in your machine. You should set the temperature to at least 130°F (54°C). Machine washing clothes at this temperature will kill the lice.If for some reason you cannot use a washing machine, you can try submerging the clothes in hot water, at least 140°F (60°C).After washing your clothes, dry them in a dryer set to a high heat., If you have clothes that cannot be machine washed you will need to try some alternative methods for killing the lice. You can take these items to the dry cleaners and have them washed there. This is a way to clean the clothes without damaging them, while still killing the lice.This method could be used for woollen clothes that you don't want to shrink in a hot wash, or silk clothes that are too delicate for the washing machine.
You should inform the person working at the dry cleaners about the lice so they can take extra care.
You may be able to use a home dry cleaning kit if this involves you putting the clothes in the dryer on a high heat for at least fifteen minutes.
As long as the clothes are exposed to a temperature of 130 degrees Fahrenheit for at least 5 to 6 minutes, the lice should be killed.

Buy a bottle of pediculicide (lice treatment).,
Dress the person being treated in old clothes.,
Apply the pediculicide according to instructions.,
Wash items with which the infested person has come into contact.,
Comb dead lice and nits out of the hair.,
Check the hair again after a week or two.",How to Kill Head Lice1," Pediculicides are available over-the-counter or by prescription. Choose a well-reviewed brand that others have found effective. If you're treating hair that is longer than shoulder-length, you may need more than one bottle.Using a pediculicide is a very effective way to kill lice. Some products kill both the crawling lice and their eggs, while others kill the crawling lice alone. Depending on the strength of the product you choose, you may need to follow up with more than one application.
Pediculicides contain chemicals that are coming under scrutiny for potentially being harmful. If you are treating someone with very sensitive skin or are concerned about using strong chemicals, try a natural method. Natural methods are equally effective, they just take a little longer to work.;
, The treatment itself may stain clothing, and lice may jump onto the clothing during the treatment process. It's best to wear older clothes that you don't mind washing with very high heat during the application process.

, In most cases you will need to distribute the product on the head and throughout the hair of the individual being treated. The treatment should then sit on the head for the directed amount of time before being washed out.


Be sure not to leave the treatment on for longer than instructed on the packaging, as it may damage the skin or hair.
Rinse the treatment out with water only, no shampoo. No shampoo should be used for at least 2 days after treatment.

, The person's clothes, bedding, stuffed animals, pillows, and other washable items should be washed using hot water, since lice die when exposed to temperatures greater than 128 °F (53 °C) for more than 5 minutes.Dry the items afterward.


If you have an item in question that isn't washable, it can be stored in a sealed plastic bag for two weeks before using.
Soak plastic combs, brushes and hair accessories in hot water for at least 5 minutes.
Vacuum carpeting and furniture.

, After 8 hours or so, check the hair. At this point you may see a few live lice that are still moving slowly. Comb all dead or live lice as well as nits from the hair at this stage. The best tool to use for this purpose is a nit comb, available for purchase at drugstores.


Continue checking the hair every 8 hours or so. Comb dead or sluggish lice and their nits from the hair for the next 2 days. Soak the nit comb in hot water for at least 5 minutes in between combings.
If you still see crawling lice after 3 days, another treatment may be necessary. Consider seeing a doctor for a product recommendation.

, If you see more lice, you may be able to control them by combing the lice and their nits from the hair every 8 hours or so. If the lice are back in full force, consider undergoing another lice treatment.

Use a dryer on a hot cycle.,
Place them in a plastic bag for two weeks.,
Clean around the house.",How to Get Lice Off Clothes2," Using a dryer after washing your clothes helps ensure that all the lice are killed. But if your clothes are not suitable for machine washing, a spin in the dryer can kill the lice on its own. Place the clothes in a dryer, turn it onto a hot cycle, and leave the clothes in there for around 15 minutes., Another way to deal with lice in your clothes is to place them in a sealed plastic bag and leave them for two weeks. Store them somewhere safe and ensure they are left for two full weeks before you return to them.This is not the most practical method, can it can be useful if your clothes are especially delicate or cannot be washed in a normal way.


For example, this method could be used for leather and suede clothes.
This method can also be used for other non-machine washable fabrics, such as wool and silk.

, The chances of becoming infested by lice that have fallen onto the carpet or a piece or furniture are relatively small, but taking some further steps to tackle lice that may have escaped your body and clothes helps limit the chances of an infestation. Vacuum the floor and furniture, paying particular attention to where the person with lice has been.Wash bedding, towels and other cotton and linen material the person with lice has come into contact with.
This step is more important for body lice, which generally live in clothing, than head lice."

Purchase a nit comb.,
Comb lice and nits from the hair.,
Continue combing the hair every 8 - 12 hours.,
Wash clothing, bedding and other materials in the meantime.",How to Kill Head Lice2," If you want to get rid of lice without using any chemicals, you can use the simple method of combing them all out with a nit comb. Nit combs aren't the same as regular styling combs; be sure to purchase the right kind at your drugstore.


If you have a comb used for getting rid of fleas on dogs and cats, that may work, too.

, Start at the scalp and work your way down the shaft of the hair to the tips, picking out lice and nits as you go. Discard the lice and nits in a bowl of soapy water. They'll die quickly once they can no longer feed.

, As more lice hatch, you'll need to keep combing them out. It's important to do so quickly, before they have the chance to lay more eggs. Keep combing out the lice and nits every 8 - 12 hours until you don't see crawling lice anymore. After that, check the hair every couple of days and comb more if necessary.


Soak the nit comb in hot water for at least 5 minutes between combings to kill the lice and nits.
When you use the nit comb method without lice medicine or other remedies, it can take a couple of weeks before all the lice and nits are totally gone. Be patient, and continue checking for lice and nits and methodically combing them out until you're sure they're dead.

, After the first combing, wash the infested person's clothing in hot water for at least 5 minutes. Wash bedding, pillows, stuffed animals, and other washable items, too. Place any items that can't get wet in a sealed plastic bag for two weeks. Soak plastic items like combs, brushes and hair supplies in hot water for at least 5 minutes.

Use apple cider vinegar.,
Try tea tree oil or neem oil.,
Spray the hair with essential oils.,
Don't forget to wash clothes and soak combs.",How to Kill Head Lice3," Soak the hair in an apple cider vinegar rinse made with 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar and 1/2 cup water. After rinsing, use a nit comb on your the hair; the vinegar helps to loosen the nits and make them easier to pick out.


Applying coconut oil to the hair for 30 minutes after doing the apple cider vinegar rinse makes the treatment even more effective.This must be done in combination with a nit comb treatment; it loosens the louse's grip, but doesn't kill them.

, Used in addition to the nit comb method, treating the hair and scalp with one of these two oils can prove fast and effective. Tea tree oil and neem oil are natural insecticides that are completely safe for human use. Use tea tree oil or neem oil in the following ways:


Add 5 drops per ounce to your shampoo, and use it every day during the lice infestation.
Make a tea tree oil or neem oil treatment by mixing a tablespoon of the insecticide with almond oil applying it to the scalp and hair for 1/2 hour before rinsing.
Add tea tree oil or neem oil to the washing machine before you run a cycle of clothes that are infested with lice., During the intervals in between using a nit comb, spraying the hair with essential oil sprays can help loosen the nits and cause the lice to die more quickly. Mix 5 drops of essential oil per 1 ounce of water and spray it over the hair several times a day during treatment. Here are essential oils that help get rid of lice:


Eucalyptus
Thyme
Lavender
Oregano
Peppermint

, No remedy will be effective if the lice are allowed to live on clothing and reinfest the hair. Remember to wash all clothing and other materials in hot water. Store unwashable items in sealable plastic bags for 2 weeks. Soak combs and other hair accessories in hot water for at least 5 minutes.

Apply medicated shampoo.,
Apply a medicated cream rinse or lotion on hair.,
”Wet comb” your child’s hair.,
Acquire an oral medication.,
Shave your child’s head.",How to Free Your Child from Lice1," There are some shampoos specifically designed to eliminate lice and nits. These shampoos are generally made so that they are safe for use on children. Depending on the severity of the child’s infestation, it may be necessary to use a medicated shampoo multiple times to eliminate lice and nits entirely. Generally these treatments are days apart.;
, Your doctor or pharmacist can prescribe topical medications for head lice infestations. Though most of these head lice medicines are safe for children, if you have any doubt, ask your pediatrician or doctor. Follow what is written on the package carefully. Never let the children handle the head lice medicine. Sometimes, just a one-time use is enough to get rid of all the lice in the hair.Most effective treatments are singular use, either over a period of 20 minutes or several hours. A follow up treatment may be indicated several days later

, Some people choose to employ the “wet combing” method, in which you apply olive oil, petroleum jelly, or mayonnaise to suffocate the lice, and then comb them out by hand. This is appropriate for children under 2 months, as they should not use medicated treatment. The ""wet combing"" method often does not work on older kids — if medicine doesn't work and you want wet combing, talk to your doctor first.As an alternative treatment, there are electronic combs designed to shock the bugs dead available for purchase from various retailers., When lice infestations are particularly severe, topical treatments may not be fully effective. If you find this to be the case with your child, your pediatrician should be able to prescribe a pill which effectively kills the remaining lice on your child’s head. , While it may not be the ideal solution, one surefire way to eliminate lice is to eliminate hair. Lice feed off of human blood drawn from the scalp, but they also need hair to plant their eggs. As the louse life-cycle is relatively short (about two days or so) shaving your child’s hair can prevent future generations of lice from appearing, stopping the infestation in its tracks.

Vacuum the carpeting and furniture.",How to Treat Head Lice," You'll be able to find pediculicides over the counter, or you can get a prescription from a doctor. Get one bottle to treat someone with short or medium hair, and two bottles for someone with long hair.Some lice shampoos are formulated to kill both the lice and their eggs. Others act only on the crawling lice. For the latter type, you'll need to follow up with a second application once the eggs hatch.
Keep in mind that chemical lice shampoos contain ingredients that are being studied for potential harmful effects. If you're worried about using chemicals that could harm the scalp and skin, try a natural method. Both ways are equally effective, but the natural method could take a little longer. If you're interested in a natural method, skip down to method 2.;
, Since the lice might jump onto the clothes, they'll need to be washed in hot water immediately after the treatment. For this reason, it's better to wear an old-shirt than something more valuable.

, It's easier to clean bathroom surfaces than upholstered chairs and couches. Have the person sit on a plastic or metal chair near the sink.

, Put it on the scalp and in the hair according to the instructions on the bottle. The treatment will need to sit on the person's head for the amount of time indicated, then washed out.


Don't leave the treatment on for longer than recommended.
Wash it out with warm water, no shampoo. Shampoo should not be used for at least two days after treatment.

, After about 8 hours, you'll see dead or sluggish lice in the person's hair. You'll need to remove these with a special comb called a nit comb. These combs are available in drugstores, and they sometimes come with the lice shampoo.


After using the nit comb, soak it in hot water for at least 5 minutes.Check the person's head again in another 8 hours or so. Remove any remaining lice.

, Since lice may have hatched since you treated the person's hair and scalp, it's important to keep checking every few days for at least two weeks. If you see more lice, start the treatment process again. If you'd prefer not to use the chemical treatment twice, try the nit comb method instead.

, A nit comb is specially designed to comb out the lice and their eggs. It's a long process, but it works just as well as using a lice shampoo. Section by section, comb through the person's hair. As you find lice and eggs, drop them into a bowl of hot, soapy water. They'll immediately die.


Comb again in 8 hours. More lice will hatch, and you'll have to be diligent and keep combing them out. Keep doing the process every 8 to 12 hours for several days.
In between combings, soak the comb in hot water.

, Make a rinse with ½ cup apple cider vinegar and ½ cup hot water. Pour it over the person's hair. Run the nit comb through the treated hair. It should loosen the grip of the nits and make them easier to remove.

, Several different types of oil have been said to be effective treatments for lice. Try the following oils:


Apply some coconut oil. Melt ½ cup of coconut oil and massage it into the hair and scalp. Use the nit comb to remove all the lice and nits.
Use neem oil. This is a natural insecticide that is safe for humans. Comb it through the hair, let it sit for a few minutes, then remove the nits.
Use tea tree oil. Like neem oil, it's a natural insecticide., You can make an essential oil spray that will cause the nits to loosen and help the lice die more quickly. Get a spray bottle and fill it with 5 drops of oil per 1 ounce of water. Try the following essential oils:


Lavender
Oregano
Peppermint
Thyme
Eucalyptus

, Clothing, bedding, towels, stuffed animals, pillows, and anything else that's washable will need to be washed in hot water. Lice die when they're exposed to temperatures above 128℉ (54℃) for 5 minutes or longer., The lice will die if they aren't exposed to air. Place wooden, plastic and metal items in plastic bags for at least two weeks before using.

, Soaking plastic combs, brushes and other hair accessories in hot water for at least 10 minutes is necessary to kill the lice.

, Lice don't tend to live very long on surfaces like carpets and furniture, since they need to feed on human blood to live. However, it's better to be safe than sorry, so vacuum all the carpeting and furniture, especially in the person's bedroom.

However, other conditions, including dandruff and scalp eczema, can cause also itchy scalp.Itchy scalps can also be a sign of an allergic reaction to hair care products such as shampoo, too.Some people who have head lice may not experience itching right away. It can take up to six weeks after infestation for the scalp to begin feeling itchy.Some people may also feel a “tickling” sensation on their scalp or head, as though something is moving or crawling.;
, White flakes may be caused by dandruff or scalp eczema. They may also be caused by an allergic reaction to shampoos and other hair care products. However, these “flakes” may actually be lice eggs (nits).Dandruff commonly occurs throughout the hair. Lice eggs commonly occur closer to the scalp and are not as widespread as dandruff flakes.
If you cannot easily brush or shake the flakes off the hair or scalp, they may be lice eggs.

, Lice may find their way into your home on clothes or bedding. They cannot fly, but they can jump great distances.You may see small bugs that look like light-brown sesame seeds on clothing, bedding, skin, or hair.

, Natural light is good if it isn’t filtered through curtains or blinds. Bathroom light is often bright enough. If you need additional light, use a bright flashlight or small desk lamp., This can be done under a faucet or with a spray bottle. Lice can be seen on dry or wet hair, but many people have an easier time spotting lice if the hair is wet.


Working with wet hair also makes it easier to carefully part sections, and clip the examined sections out of the way so you can continue to check the remainder of the hair., Adult lice are difficult to see, mainly because they can move quickly and they do not like light. As you separate sections of hair, the adult lice can quickly move back into the hair and into the shadows. Even though an adult louse is tiny, you should be able to see them if you can read the small print of a newspaper.Adult lice are light brown in color, and are about the size of a sesame seed. The adults are often found near the scalp area, in the hair just above and behind the ears, and at the hairline around the base of the neck., The eggs are firmly attached, practically cemented, to the hair. Eggs are yellowish-brown, or tan, in color before they hatch, and look like tiny seeds. Freshly laid eggs are shiny, and are often found near the scalp., Once the eggs, or nits, have hatched, the egg casing remains firmly attached to the hair. The color of the casing is practically clear., Divide the hair into small sections, and begin by placing the comb near the scalp. Use either a regular fine tooth comb, or a lice comb, and comb through each section of hair, from close to the scalp to the ends. Comb through each section more than once.Lice combs are available at drug stores. They are smaller than a regular comb, but the teeth in the comb are much closer together to more easily search for lice and nits., As you finish combing a section of the wet hair, use a clip to separate it from the hair you have not yet examined. Comb through each divided section of hair, examining the comb after each pass through the hair., These areas are places where adult lice and nits are commonly found., If you see something moving, try to catch it between your thumb and forefinger, then tape it to a piece of white paper so you can examine it more closely. It may be helpful to compare what you have found to documented pictures of lice.Catching a louse with your fingers is not dangerous. By doing this, you can confirm that the person you are examining does have a lice infestation., People of all ages have stuff that gets caught in their hair. Combing through someone’s hair so carefully is likely to reveal dandruff, knotted hair, fabric, and other small things that get lodged in their hair. Nits will not easily comb out since they are cemented to the hair. Use your magnifying glass to examine small things found as you comb through their hair to be sure., Clearly this is not as easy task, so try to get some help if possible. If you decide to check your own hair by yourself, then follow the same basic steps. Everyone in a household with one infested person should be checked for lice., Lice and nits can be seen on wet or dry hair, but examining yourself for lice may be easier with your hair wet., Bathroom lighting is often brighter than the lights in other rooms, plus you will be relying on the bathroom mirrors. If needed, use a small lamp for added light., You will need to closely examine the areas behind and around your ears. Use clips to hold your hair back, and position the hand mirror so you can clearly see the areas you need to examine., Look closely for anything crawling, and for nits or nit casings attached to your hair in this area., To best examine your own hair, you will need to separate sections and comb through them several times. Examine the comb thoroughly after each pass through your hair. Continue to use clips the separate the hair you have already examined.Remember to focus on the area around your ears and at the base of your neck. Examining your own hair for lice is difficult, so focusing on the most likely places may help you to determine if you have a lice infestation., You may want to use a magnifying glass to examine the comb each time you pass it through your hair. Identify dandruff, tangled hair, fabric, and other items carefully. Small, seed-like, casings will be firmly attached and will be difficult to remove, likely removing the hair follicle with it as you pass the comb through. This will allow you to closely examine what is pulled out and what remains in the comb, to determine if you have lice or nits in your hair., You can treat head lice using products available without a prescription. Follow the directions closely, including any measures recommended for safety., This helps just in case the ingredients contained in the treatment damage the clothing. Also be sure the person has washed their hair, but has not applied conditioner., Your doctor or pharmacist can help guide you to best product choices. Once the person has been treated following the directions of the product, examine their hair again in about eight to 12 hours. If you still see lice, but they are moving slowly, then the treatment is still working. Continue with the process of removing as many dead lice and nits as possible by the combing technique., As you examine the hair, notice if the lice are still as active as they were, prior to treatment. If this occurs, follow the package directions to re-treat the person infested., Usually, you should re-treat the person’s scalp after one week. Most available products outline how to proceed with a second treatment. Your doctor or pharmacist can help with advice on re-treatment, as well as treating additional family members.Unfortunately, lice have become more resistant to the usual treatments — even some prescription treatments. Your doctor may have to prescribe stronger medications (sometimes to be taken orally) to get rid of the lice.

, Wash and dry all bedding, towels, and clothing that the person came in contact going back 2 days prior to treatment. Use hot water, and set the dryer temperature to a high heat setting.Items that cannot be washed can be dry cleaned, or put in a tightly sealed plastic bag for two weeks., Each time a comb or brush is used to remove lice and nits, soak the items for 5 to 10 minutes in hot water that is at least 130°F., Head lice only live for about two days once they are not on a person. Nits are not able to hatch if they are removed from the normal temperature of a human body, and die within a week., Make sure you don’t accidentally cause re-infestation. Wash all clothing and bedding in hot water.Store unwashable items in airtight plastic bags for two weeks. Soak combs and other hair accessories, such as bobby pins and clips, in hot water for at least five minutes.


Make sure to wash any soft items, such as stuffed animals or pillows, in hot water.

, Lice are often spread to children when they share clothing, hats, scarves, or stuffed animals. Do not allow your child to share these things with others.Do not share soft items between family members until all signs of infestation have disappeared.

, Follow the combing procedure every two to three days, and for two to three weeks, to be sure the person has not been re-infested., After a successful treatment, your child can return to school the next day. Do not keep your child home from school for several days because of lice infestation.Make sure that your child does not make head-to-head contact with other children at school.
Alert your school nurse that you have found lice or nits on your child and that it has been treated. The school may be required to tell other parents that an exposure has taken place so families can be on alert and the nurse can check the possibly exposed students. Do not feel embarrassed as this is extremely common.

Use a fine-toothed comb to examine the hair and scalp for lice and nits. Live head lice are about the size of a sesame seed (between 2-3mm long). Nits, or lice eggs, are usually yellowish white and stick onto hairs near the scalp. They are slightly smaller than adult lice.Look for nits that are stuck to the hair shaft. Nits stuck to the hair shaft within ¼ inch of the scalp are the most likely to be viable (i.e., will hatch into lice). This is because head lice feed on tiny amounts of blood they draw from the human scalp. They also thrive on the warmth provided by your head. Nits that are further down the hair shaft are usually dead or already hatched.Use a magnifying glass to examine the hair and scalp. Dirt particles and dandruff can often be mistaken for lice, so use a magnifying glass to determine whether there are live lice in addition to nits. If you don’t see live lice and the only nits are further down the hair shaft from the scalp, the infestation is probably already over.Look behind the ears and at the hairline. Lice and nits are often easier to see in areas where the hair is thinner.;
, Although they cannot fly or jump, head lice are extremely contagious and can easily infest everyone in a household.If one person in your household has head lice, check everyone’s hair and scalp for signs of infestation.


Head lice are most easily spread by sharing hair brushes, hats, or beds with an infested person. If you have children who sleep in the same bed or room, or who share clothing regularly, make sure you examine everyone for head lice.

, If someone in your household has head lice, have them remove their clothing and put on fresh clothes. There may be some nits on their clothes, especially shirts, scarves, or hats., Head lice are not caused by poor hygiene. However, they can cling to fabric and household items and could spread from those items to other people, so it’s important to clean and disinfect those items thoroughly.Machine wash and heat dry clothing, bed linens, hats, towels, and other fabrics that have come into contact with the infested person. Use hot water and the high heat drying cycle. If the items cannot be machine washed, seal them in a plastic bag and store them for 2 weeks. This will suffocate the lice.Soak combs and brushes in very hot water (a minimum of 130°F) for 5-10 minutes, or run them through a hot dishwasher cycle.
Vacuum floors and upholstered furniture. Head lice cannot survive very long if they can’t feed on humans, but vacuuming will help eliminate any lice that have fallen off a person and keep them from attaching to someone else.

, Anyone who has signs of lice infestation, or who shares a bedroom with the infested person, should be treated immediately. Otherwise, lice may remain in someone’s hair and start another infestation.

, Tea tree oil has natural antimicrobial, anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal, and anti-viral properties.Although the exact mechanisms are not yet understood, tea tree oil has been shown to be effective in killing lice nits and reducing the number of live lice. It may also have lice-repelling properties.


A combination of tea tree oil and lavender oil has been shown to kill lice eggs and live lice.Look for pure lavender oil.
While many shampoos and conditioners have tea tree oil in them, they are unlikely to have a high enough concentration to be effective. A minimum concentration of 2% tea tree oil is required to kill lice nits.Look for “steam-distilled” tea tree oil from the Melaleuca alternifolia tree.

, This type of comb has very closely spaced teeth that help you examine the hair near the scalp.


If you don’t have one, purchase a magnifying glass too. This will help you examine the scalp after treatment.

, Because pure tea tree oil can cause skin irritation, it’s best to mix it with a mild shampoo before using it as a treatment.


Use an eye dropper to put 2-4 drops of tea tree oil in a small bowl.
Add 2-4 drops of lavender oil.
Add 96-98 drops of a mild shampoo. (If you want to eyeball it, add enough shampoo to make a small pool about the size of a quarter.)
Add a few drops of olive or coconut oil, as this will help suffocate the lice.Stir the mixture together until blended thoroughly.

, Pay extra attention to the scalp area, as that is where most of the nits and lice will be. Cover the hair with a shower cap or swimming cap. Leave the treatment in for 30 minutes.


If your child experiences itching or burning during the treatment, this may be a sign of an allergic reaction.Rinse their hair immediately with warm water and re-wash the hair with a very mild shampoo. Towel-dry the hair and then allow it to air dry. Repeat the wash if your child still has an itchy or red scalp.

, Thoroughly lather the hair and work through it with your fingers to make sure you eliminate as many lice as possible. Rinse completely with warm water.

, Because it is very thick, conditioner can help suffocate any lice that were not killed by the tea tree oil. It will also help you run the lice comb through the hair. Do not rinse out the conditioner.

, Start at the scalp, because this is where lice nits are laid and hatch. If the person being treated has long hair, divide it into sections and comb through one section at a time.


Take your time with this step! If you don’t catch even a few nits, they could hatch within a few days and start the whole infestation over again.

, This may seem like overkill, but it is highly effective. Because lice nits take about a week to hatch and mature into adult lice, maintaining the treatment for a full week helps ensure you kill any stragglers.

, Add a few drops of tea tree oil to your shampoo using the same ratio as for the treatment, or purchase a shampoo that already contains tea tree oil. Using this shampoo once a week may help prevent a reinfestation.

Avoid exposure.,
Identify any surface on which lice can live.,
Clean affected surfaces with hot water.,
Vacuum all non-movable surfaces.,
Soak all hair-care tools.,
Monitor for the near future.",How to Free Your Child from Lice3," When your child comes home with lice, it is critical not to allow the lice to spread to your other children or the adult members of your family. Remember, you are equally exposed when treating your child, so cover your head and check yourself rigorously for exposure after treating your child. Scientific findings suggest that animals are not at risk for contracting head lice from humans, so don’t worry about your dogs, cats, or other animals. , Lice can live on bed linens, towels, stuffed animals and in thick carpeting. They can also survive on hair care devices, like combs or brushes, for a short period of time. Identify all surfaces which could have potentially come into contact with the infected individual. , Any items like sheets, towels and stuffed animals can be cleaned in a washer and dryer. However, be sure that wash these items with the “hot water” setting on your washer. It typically requires a temperature of 130 °F (54.4 °C) to eliminate lice and their nits. Also, be sure to dry these items on the hottest setting your dryer provides. , Be sure to vacuum all of your rugs, carpets, cloth blinds, tablecloths, or any other soft fabric items with the highest setting your vacuum will allow. Once you have done this, immediately throw away the vacuum cleaner bag to prevent lice from escaping. , Place hair-care items like combs, barrettes, hair ties, headbands, and brushes in rubbing alcohol or medicated shampoo for at least one hour. , Lice infestations are often difficult to eliminate entirely, so be sure to monitor your house and the people in it to ensure the lice have not survived on a surface you forgot to clean or in the hair of another person in your household. Being vigilant can help you avoid re-infestation. "

Avoid sharing.,
Ensure hair hygiene.,
Teach your children steps to avoid lice.,
Make sure your child's school or organization checks for lice.,
Look for the telltale signs of a louse.,
Check your child’s hair.",How to Free Your Child from Lice4," Do not allow children to share others' combs, hats, or towels. If the child is out on a trip with friends, advise children that they should use their own pillows, combs, towels, etc. It is the sharing of these things that often leads to transmission of head lice., Ensure that your child’s hair is clean daily. Sometimes, if the child is taking bath on his own, he might not wash his hair well. So, ensure that you check your child’s hair daily to check if the hair scalp is cleaned well. Hair hygiene is important, but it won't prevent a lice infestation on its own. However, it is easier to check your child for lice when his hair is clean., Teach your children tips on how to avoid lice as mentioned above like not sharing combs, etc., and also not to mix their things with other children’s belongings, like coats and hats. Simple habits like these can go a long way in preventing head lice.

, Children are most likely to get head lice from other kids in group situations. Kids are at the greatest risk of catching head lice when in school, in recreational or community groups, and while on athletic teams. Make sure any group activity in which you enroll your child has measures in place to quarantine a child with head lice until he or she can receive proper treatment. This will help guarantee that your child is not exposed to lice in the first place.Most public schools actively check for the presence of head lice in their student body and will take proper measures to ensure that other students are not exposed. However, athletic teams, church groups, and other community organizations do not take this step, so be vigilant and check your child after any potential exposure.

, Excessive itching or scratching of the scalp and hair, while often attributable to other factors, are definitely cause for concern. If your child seems to be experiencing these symptoms, check their head and scalp for lice immediately.It may take weeks for itching to occur after the infestation has taken hold. However, many children will complain of tingling or tickling on their scalps before the infestation has become full-blown, giving you time to react., Check your child’s hair for lice or nits every weekend. Make him or her sit outside the house during bright sunlight, part the hair and check each strand for lice and nits. Even if you find any, you can take appropriate measures so that the child is ready to go to school on Monday.Lice, which are usually white or gray and the size of a sesame seed, are visible to the naked eye, but nits are often harder to identify when the adult lice are absent. Look for brown, tan, or yellow dots in your child’s hair, usually found at the roots of the hair nearest the scalp. Nits can look similar to dandruff, but can’t be removed by brushing or shaking them off. Once the nits hatch into lice, the egg shells will take on a beige or whitish hue.It is more common to find nits in a child’s hair than it is to find living lice, so be on the lookout."

, You can hold the brush in place with each stroke to systematically search for lice. This will allow you to thoroughly examine each section of your child's head. Pay extra attention to the area of the scalp around the ears and at the nape of the neck. Although lice can live anywhere on the scalp, these areas tend to be tell-tale regions during an infestation., Nits are about the size of a pinhead and are glued onto the hair shaft. They are oval-shaped and translucent in color when first laid, but turn brown as the embryo develops., Look for lice and their eggs (nits).

, Adult lice are light brown and their bodies will be about the size of a sesame seed. Nits may be brown, yellow, or white.Closely examine the comb's teeth both during and after each comb stroke, using a magnifying glass if necessary. If examining under a blacklight, the nits will appear as light blue in color., This will remove any lice that were picked up during combing. It will also wash away any dandruff your child might have, which can resemble lice nits., It may be more effective to repeat this process, as lice can move around on the scalp.

If nits pose a problem to thorough combing, try soaking hair in a 3%-5% white vinegar bath prior to using the lice comb., You might be able to pin lice against the comb using your fingers, but tweezers may be more effective.Some experts say that manually removing lice as described above may be more effective (though also more time consuming) than over-the-counter lice treatments., Lice can survive in water, and may escape if not properly dealt with after combing. You should also soak the combs used to find and catch lice in rubbing alcohol for at least one hour., If you have found lice and/or nits and removed them with a comb or tweezers, it is important to repeat the procedure on a daily basis. Eggs may take several days to hatch, so it's important to continue treatment and removal, even if it seems like the problem is getting better. Some experts recommend nightly lice inspection and removal and continued monitoring for two to three weeks after the initial treatment.While dry combing is an excellent way to detect lice, picking individual lice with tweezers can be a tiresome and time-consuming activity for both you and your child. Some experts recommend wet combing, as it allows you to quickly diagnose and partially treat the infection more efficiently.If your child has a hard time sitting still for prolonged periods, try doing lice inspection/removal with a movie or TV show on.

"
Start by identifying the cause.,
Take over-the-counter painkillers.Over-the-counter (OTC) painkillers can reduce levels of pain by interrupting the production of a certain chemical called prostaglandin which controls pain sensations.,
Get a prescription for stronger painkillers.Your doctor might prescribe stronger, narcotic painkillers if the simple painkillers are not working to relieve your symptoms.,
Try birth control pills.,
Treat bacterial infections with antibiotics.Chronic pelvic pain that is caused by an infection is commonly treated with antibiotics.,
Consider taking antidepressants.These drugs can be helpful in treating several chronic pain syndromes, so they are sometimes prescribed for women with chronic pelvic pain who do not suffer from depression.,
Look into counseling.Chronic pain may be caused by psychological factors such as depression, stress or personality disorder.,
Ask your doctor about transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS).With this therapy, electrodes are used to transmit electrical impulses into the nerve pathways, thereby helping doctors to determine and relax areas of tight muscles.,
Opt for trigger point injections.TPI is a procedure used to treat painful areas of pelvic muscle that contain trigger points.,
Undergo surgery as a last resort.Surgery is commonly the last resort if all other pain relief measures fail.,
Eat foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids.,
Exercise regularly.,
Use a combination of heat and cold.Applying heating packs or cold ice to your pelvic area can help to diminish pain and to decrease inflammation.,
Try alternative therapies.,
Know the possible causes of chronic pelvic pain.Chronic pelvic pain sometimes occurs for no apparent reason and without specific cause.,
Recognize the symptoms associated with chronic pelvic pain.,
Understand how chronic pelvic pain is diagnosed.Diagnosing chronic pelvic pain may involve a process of elimination as several disorders may cause pelvic pain.",How to Ease Chronic Pelvic Pain," If possible, your doctor will want to identify the cause of your chronic pelvic pain, as the preferable form of treatment is to identify and resolve the underlying cause directly.If no definitive cause can be identified, your doctor will focus on managing your symptoms to get your pain under control.,


Simple painkillers target the affected area to reduce levels of prostaglandins, thus lessening the severity of pain as well. Simple painkillers are commonly purchased over the counter.
Dosage for adults is usually 500 mg tablets every four to six hours. An example of simple painkiller is ibuprofen (Advil).

,


Your doctor may prescribe hydrocodone (vicodin or norco), or oxycodone (roxycodone).
Dosage may vary depending upon the severity of the pain but normal dosage of oral Tramadol for adults is about 50–100 mg every four to six hours, for instance.

, So long as you are not trying to get pregnant or have any other conditions that would interfere with birth control, you may find that taking birth control pills can have a significant effect on decreasing chronic pelvic pain.This is particularly true if your pelvic pain is cyclical and linked to a part of your menstrual cycle. Many women have worse pain during ovulation (two weeks into their cycle), and during the menstrual period itself. If you find yourself with these cyclical symptoms, speak to your doctor about birth control or other hormonal treatment options.

, Be sure to finish the full course of antibiotics that your doctor prescribes, even if your symptoms begin to feel better, as finishing the full course helps to prevent any recurrent infections or complications down the road.

,


Examples include tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline or nortriptyline (Pamelor) which contain both pain relief and antidepressant properties.
Amitriptyline works on the brain and spinal cord by suppressing the pain signals that are sent to these areas. The recommended initial dose is 75 mg per day. The maintenance dose is 150 to 300 mg per day, which can be given in single or divided doses.

, Finding time to seek help from expert counselors could help ease the stress, thereby relieving pain sensations as well.


Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and biofeedback are two techniques that have both been shown to be helpful in treating chronic pain. You can speak to your counsellor about these options if they interest you to learn more about them.

, This increases blood flow to the area and helps to prevent the accumulation of irritants such as lactic acid that can cause pain.


TENS is done using a small, battery-powered machine that is about the size of a pocket radio. Two wires that conduct electrical impulses (electrodes) from the machine are attached to the painful area. When the current is delivered, you experience less pain.Aside from relaxing tight muscles, the electricity stimulates the nerves in the painful area and sends signals to the brain that block the normal pain signals. The doctor or physical therapist usually determines the correct settings of the TENS machine before treatment.

, These trigger points are knots of muscle that are formed when the muscles do not relax. They can often be felt beneath the skin and can cause pain when palpated or pressed upon.


During this procedure, the doctor will first locate the trigger point by palpating the knots of muscles. If pain occurs, then this is the target area. It will now be cleaned with an alcohol based solution.
Your doctor will give you an injection of a numbing medicine, usually a long-acting local anaesthetic such as bupivacaine and a small amount of steroid. The injection is given at the specific spot where you are feeling pain (the trigger point) to block the sensation and to provide relief., Surgical interventions are intended to correct underlying problems which may be causing the chronic pelvic pain. Doctors may recommend:


Laparoscopic surgery: If the cause of chronic pelvic pain is endometriosis, adhesions or endometrial tissues can be removed through this procedure. Your doctor will administer general anesthesia. A small incision will be made near the umbilicus to allow entry of an instrument called a laparoscope. This instrument will guide the doctors during the removal of endometrial tissues.Hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy: This procedure may be recommended for women past childbearing age who experience chronic pelvic pain. Your doctor will administer general anesthesia. An incision will be made in the abdomen, then the uterus and the ovaries will be removed. This leads to a deficiency of estrogen, a hormone which is needed by endometriosis (cysts that may aggravate chronic pelvic pain) for growth., Omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to reduce the production of several prostaglandins which are mainly responsible for activating the pain receptors in the body.Foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids are walnuts, flax seeds, sardines, salmon, shrimp, soybeans, tofu, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts and winter squash. The recommended dose for omega-3 fatty acids is not more than 3 grams daily.

, Studies show that engaging in strenuous exercise can boost the production of endorphins — also known as the ""happy hormone"" responsible for elevating your mood, reducing anxiety and depression, and fighting pain.


Endorphins interact with the brain receptors by blocking the path of pain signals going to the brain — the same way as stronger painkiller medications do.
If possible, you should exercise for at least 45 minutes a day such as brisk walking, jogging, cycling, stair stepping, swimming and weightlifting.

, Having a hot bath is another way to apply heat to your pelvic area, and to help the muscles relax, which can decrease pain and cramping.

, Things such as massage, acupuncture, or natural remedies have been shown to help in some cases. It is worth a shot if you prefer this to traditional medical treatments. Be sure you speak with your physician before pursuing alternative therapies.

, In other cases the pain may be caused by one of a number of different medical conditions such as the following:


Endometriosis: This is a condition wherein the tissues that line the uterus grow outside of it. As a result, tissue deposits build-up in the abdomen, potentially causing painful cysts and adhesions.
Tension in the muscles of the pelvic floor: If the pelvic muscle remains semi-contracted for a long time, then blood flow may be diminished in that area. Irritants such as lactic acid may build-up in the area causing sharp, gnawing, dull or excruciating pain.
Chronic pelvic inflammatory disease: This is caused by a chronic type of infection (commonly sexually transmitted) that causes scarring of the pelvic organs, thereby leading to a sharp, dull, gnawing or excruciating pain.
Ovarian residue: During a surgical operation such as complete hysterectomy (removal of the fallopian tubes, ovaries and uterus) tiny fragments of the ovary may be unintentionally left inside the system which can lead to the growth of painful cysts.
Fibroids: These are benign growths in the uterus which may exert pressure or weight on the lower abdomen. This condition seldom triggers throbbing pain unless the affected area lacks blood supply leading to degeneration or death.
Irritable bowel syndrome: The most common symptoms accompanied by IBS are constipation or diarrhea and bloating. These symptoms often stimulate discomfort and pressure on the pelvic area.
Interstitial cystitis (painful bladder syndrome): This is characterized by the chronic swelling of the bladder and the need to urinate regularly. Pelvic pain may progress when the bladder begins to fill up and temporary relief may be felt upon urination.
Psychological factors: Chronic pelvic pain may be aggravated by certain levels of stress and depression.

, The pain associated with chronic pelvic pain can be characterized as:


Persistent, constant, intermittent, dull, aching or cramping pain in the pelvis. Pain varies with different individuals, depending on the cause.
Weight or pressure on the pelvis. If the cause is a growing cyst, then the increase in size can put pressure on the pelvis.
Pain upon urination and bowel movement. The pressure exerted by the person when urinating or moving a bowel can cause pelvic pain.
Pain with prolonged periods of sitting and standing. Discomfort may be felt during such activities which can be mild or severe and may interfere with daily routine. The pain is usually relieved after lying down.

, Tests and procedures that may be used include:


History taking: A detailed interview will be conducted to determine any relevance of existing symptoms to previous medical conditions experienced by the patient. Personal and familial predisposition of the patient may be gathered as well.
Pelvic exam: During the procedure, the doctor will assess the pelvic area for any tenderness or changes in sensation. It is important that the patient tell the doctor if she feels any pain or discomfort, as this will guide them in making the right diagnosis. Signs of abnormal growth, infection and tense pelvic floor muscles usually suggest development of chronic pelvic pain.
Cultures: A cell or tissue specimen will be collected from the cervix or the vagina for laboratory analysis. The presence of an infection like chlamydia or gonorrhea may explain the condition.
Ultrasound: This procedure makes use of high-frequency sound waves to generate a clear and detailed picture of the structures within the pelvic area. Any irregularities may be the cause of chronic pelvic pain.
Laparoscopy: An incision will be made into the abdomen to allow passage of a thin tube with a small camera attached to its end (laparoscope). This procedure will help the doctors observe the pelvic organs and evaluate them for any signs of infection or the abnormal growth of cells which can be indicative of a chronic condition.

Several studies have also shown that this herb can reduce inflammation due to arthritis, reducing pain and swelling.Turmeric is often found in Indian cooking but it can also help reduce inflammation due to arthritis when taken as a tea.Both Boswellia and turmeric have been shown to interact negatively with blood thinning medication so talk to your doctor if you are on blood thinners before trying these teas.;
, Ginger has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties and can sooth sore joints when consumed in tea form. It is also safe for pregnant women.Ginger tea may increase your risk of bleeding, especially if you are taking blood thinners like clopidogrel (Plavix), warfarin (Coumadin), or aspirin. Talk to your doctor if you are on blood thinners before having ginger tea., You can also drink green tea to help relieve your arthritis symptoms, as the antioxidants in green tea have been found to be effective on inflammation.Try to consume caffeine free green teas as caffeine can cause other health issues.

, Devil’s claw tea is good for arthritis in general but it is especially effective on gouty arthritis, which is a form of arthritis that occurs due high levels of uric acid in the blood.Devil’s claw tea should not be taken by individuals on diabetes medication or blood thinners. If you have gallstones or a history of gallstones, you should not consume this tea.

, White willow bark contains the same class of chemicals that are in aspirin, but it does not cause stomach upset or negative affects with blood thinning medication. It is a good option if you are trying to numb any pain or discomfort you may be feeling due to your arthritis.This tea contains chemical properties similar to aspirin so it should not be consumed by anyone under 18 years of age.

, Licorice tea has potent anti-inflammatory effects and can be a good option for treating your arthritis symptoms. You can find licorice tea at most health food stores and online.Consult your doctor before taking licorice tea if you have high blood pressure or hormone-sensitive cancers like breast cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, or uterine cancer. If you are taking any medications, you should talk to your doctor before having licorice tea.

, You can find many of these herbs in tea bag form at your local health food store or online. You should check the ingredients list on the package to confirm that the tea is made of all natural ingredients and a high herbal content.To prepare herbal tea in a tea bag, steep the tea bag in boiled water in a mug with a cover for five to ten minutes. You can then add honey or lemon to taste.
If you are preparing green tea, only steep the bag for one to three minutes. Steeping green tea for too long can result in a bitter tea with less pronounced flavors., You can also find these herbs in loose form and steep them in boiled water. Add one heaping teaspoon of dried herb to one cup of boiled water and let the herb steep in the water for 5 to 10 minutes.

You can then add honey or lemon to taste. Some of the loose herbs may taste very strong when steeped in water and you can mask this taste with honey or lemon.

, These roots can be prepared by peeling a 1 inch section and cutting it into fine pieces. You can then add one teaspoon of the root to one cup boiled water.Let the root steep in the water for 10 to 20 minutes. You can then add honey or lemon to taste.

, To reap the benefits of tea for arthritis, you should try to have at least four cups of tea a day. Prepare a fresh cup, especially if you are using tea bags. You may be able to get away with reusing loose herbs or cut roots a few more times before they lose their flavor and medicinal properties.If you are pregnant, only have ginger tea and limit your consumption to two to three cups a day.
Keep in mind herbal teas are more effective if they are using in tandem with medication and therapies for arthritis. Talk to your doctor before adding herbal tea to your diet.

, Most doctors will prescribe anti-inflammatory medications like oral glucocorticoids, hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine and methotrexate (MTX) for rheumatoid arthritis. Your doctor may also suggest other drugs such as anti-tumor necrosis factor agents and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

The side effects of MTX include fever, fatigue, coughing, difficulty breathing, and liver issues.

, Your doctor may suggest over-the-counter pain medication like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen sodium (Aleve) for osteoarthritis. She may also recommend acetaminophen (Tylenol) to manage inflammation and pain.

, If you are experiencing intense pain due to your arthritis, your doctor may prescribe steroids to treat your condition.You may also get a prescription for tramadol (Ultram, Ultracet) and narcotics containing oxycodone (Percocet, Oxycontin) or hydrocodone (Norco, Vicoprofen).

Consult your doctor.,
Perform the exercise ball stretch.,
Do the foam roller towel stretch.,
Perform the partner stretch exercise.,
Do the stair step exercise.,
Perform downward-facing dog stretches.,
Do a split stance stretch.,
Perform forward bend exercises.,
Do bent-over raise stretches.",How to Do Scoliosis Treatment Exercises1," The following exercises can be adapted to both C- and S-curve types of scoliosis whether the curves veer to the left or to the right. However, you should always consult your doctor to ensure you adapt the exercises correctly.


With assistance, choose the right scoliosis exercises for effective treatment. Scoliosis exercises should be specific to your curve pattern.
General, balanced, exercise is well accepted as a non-operative way to reduce the mild back pain symptoms associated with mild to moderate scoliotic curves. Do not work only one side of your body in hopes of correcting any imbalances.
While these exercises can be used as part of a larger exercise program, focusing on one side of you body only can cause a muscular imbalance and can make symptoms worse, and has not been shown to be effective at reducing or even delaying curve progression.;
, Situate yourself in a kneeling position on a workout mat. Rest a large exercise ball against your hip on the convex side of your curvature. Lean sideways over the ball until your side is resting against the ball between the hip and the bottom of the rib cage. Balance yourself with both feet and your lower hand, while stretching your upper hand out to deepen the stretch.Hold this position for 20-30 seconds, and do 2-3 reps. This exercise can be done daily.

, Wrap a towel around a foam roller and lay it width-wise across the exercise mat. Lay across the foam roller so that it is perpendicular to your body. It should rest in the space between your hip and the bottom of your rib cage. Your top leg should be straight and your bottom leg bent at the knee behind you. Stretch your upper arm out until your hand touches the floor.Try to hold the pose for 20-30 seconds, and do 2-3 reps. You can do this exercise daily.

, Lay flat on the floor on your stomach. Raise your body up in a plank position, so that your toes, forearms, and elbows are all holding you up. Your partner will kneel beside you on the convex side of your curve, put his or her hands on your midriff, and gently pull your midriff towards him or her, giving a nice, deep stretch.Hold this position for 20-30 seconds, and do 3-4 reps. You can do this exercise daily.

, As previously mentioned, one common defect that can contribute to scoliosis is a difference in leg length. Step up on a stair with the longer leg. Lower the opposite leg to the floor as you bend onto one knee. While bending, raise the arm that is on the same side as your lowered leg up as high as possible. For example, if you are lowering your left leg, raise up your left arm.Perform 2-3 sets of 5-10 reps of this exercise. Do it on the one side only. You can do this exercise daily.

, This classic yoga position is also effective for scoliosis treatment. Begin in a plank position—on your stomach, with legs and arms stretched out in front of you and your palms down against the floor. Keep your hands on the floor for balance and push your hips and buttocks slowly into the air, so that your body makes a triangle shape with the floor as the base of the triangle.Hold this position for 5 seconds, then lower down slowly into plank position once more. Do two to three sets of five to 10 reps each. You can perform this exercise daily.

, This stretch is also tailored to scoliosis stemming from unequal-length legs. Step forward with the longer leg in front of you. Keep your torso upright then begin shifting your weight back and forth between the front and back legs. Allow the forward knee to bend as you shift your weight onto it. Raise the arm that is opposite of your forward leg as high as possible. While you raise the one arm, reach back with the other arm with the palm up as far as you can comfortably go.This movement causes the torso and spine to turn toward the side of the forward leg.
Perform this exercise only on the one side. Do two to three sets of five to 10 reps each. You can do this exercise daily.

, Begin this exercise with your knees on the mat and your stomach on top of a large exercise ball. Allow yourself to fall forward over the ball in a relaxed position. From this position, ease yourself up to the point where your back is perpendicular to the ball itself. Hold your arms and legs out straight so that they, too, run perpendicular to the ball.


Hold this position for a count of 10 and do 10 repetitions.

, Start this exercise by sitting on top of a large exercise ball with your feet flat on the floor in front of your for balance. Bend over so that your body appears to be in the shape of a table and you can wrap your arms around the middle of your thighs. Pick up the light hand weights in your hands and, keeping your elbows soft and your arms close to your sides, pick up the light weights until they are parallel with the ground, then lower them back down again.


For this exercise, you can do three sets of 10 reps. You can perform this exercise daily.

Apply ice immediately after exercise or injury.,
Move around.,
Massage sore muscles.,
Stretch sore or tight muscles.,
Apply heat to the muscles.,
Hydrate well.,
Replenish your electrolytes.,
Eat plenty of protein.,
Take over-the-counter painkillers in moderation.,
Rest.",How to Ease Sore Muscles1," Ice prevents painful inflammation, and applying ice shortly after a work-out can slow down the inflammation process that causes muscle soreness. Wrap a bag of ice in a towel or t-shirt and apply to the affect muscles for 20 minutes. Rest for 40 minutes and then reapply the ice for another 20.Never apply ice directly to the skin or for more than 20 minutes, as this can cause frost-bite.
Ice baths, found in most professional athletic training rooms, are a fantastic way to ice multiple muscles at once.;
, While it is tempting to drop onto the couch, moving around slowly increases blood flow to sore muscles and accelerates the healing process. While you shouldn’t go exercise, get up and walk around or go for a light 10-15 minute jog to get your heart rate up and blood flowing.If you are really sore, simply raise your arms over your head and breathe deeply for 1-2 minutes, lightly bending and twisting to stretch.

, Massaging promotes blood-flow to sore muscles, which brings oxygen to muscles trying to recover. Use your fingertips to lightly massage the areas that hurt–the massage may not feel good in the short-term, but it will help your muscles heal faster if you sit through the pain.


Get a foam roller to massage your own muscles if you cannot get a friend to help. Simply use your body weight to roll the tube over the affected area.

, Stretching increases flexibility by elongating muscle fibers, and this can limit your soreness when done correctly. Focus on stretching the hurt muscles for 20-30 seconds each. Stretch lightly–you do not want to feel pain.Deepen your stretch as you loosen up, pushing yourself a little farther with each breath.

, While this seems contradictory to the “apply ice” advice, heat relaxes your muscles to provide short-term relief for aching muscles. Take a hot shower or bath or apply a heat back for 20 minutes to loosen your muscle fibers.


Heat will help with the pain, but it will not help heal your muscles., Water is essential for removing waste from sore and tired muscles, and you should always drink 4-6 glasses of water every day. After a workout, be sure to drink 16-20 ounces of water to replenish lost fluids.

, Many muscle cramps are the result of a lack of electrolytes, causing your muscles to spasm painfully. Eat a banana, a handful or pretzels, or drink a sports drink to replenish the essential electrolytes that your muscles need., Muscles need protein to grow back after a workout, so eat a diet heavy in protein within 1-2 hours of working out to prevent soreness. Natural sources like chicken, peanut butter, tuna, and eggs will absorb quickly, but some people love the convenience of protein powder.

, Acetaminophen (Tylenol), or a NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) like Advil, Motrin, or Aleve can ease discomfort in the short-term. However, using them frequently can interfere with your muscles' ability to heal itself. Only use pain-relief drugs rarely for the best results., The best thing to eliminate muscle soreness is to rest. Do not return to the same muscle groups in your workout for 2-3 days to give them time to recover. If you eat well, stretch occasionally, and ice after tough workouts you should be able to keep your soreness in check and return to the field or weight room soon enough.


Do not return to exercise if it causes pain, as this could be the sign of an injury.

Determine the type of scoliosis you have.,
Research braces and surgical options.,
Consult with your doctor about treatment methods.",How to Do Scoliosis Treatment Exercises2," There are three primary forms of scoliosis, and each may have different treatment options. These forms include functional, neuromuscular, and idiopathic scoliosis. Patients also vary between having a C-curve or S-curve to their spines. Your doctor will be able to help diagnose your scoliosis, and the best treatment options.


Functional scoliosis is a curvature of the spine due to some form of structural defect somewhere else in the body. One common defect that causes this is a difference in length between the legs. This can usually be corrected by an orthotic wedge, which the wearer can insert into a shoe. This will help correct the difference in the leg length and keep the spine from curving abnormally.
Neuromuscular scoliosis is curvature of the spine due to structural abnormalities in the spine itself. Because of its high potential to get worse, this is often treated with surgery.
Idiopathic scoliosis, as the name implies, is a curvature of the spine for unknown reasons. The condition often corrects itself in infancy but requires observation. If it occurs in school-aged children, there is also a high potential for it to worsen.If the curve is below 25 degrees, no treatment is needed.

, Generally speaking, curves between 25 and 40 degrees may require a brace. Surgery is recommended for curves over 40 degrees. Your doctor will determine if a back brace, surgery, or another option is best for your specific case.

, Apart from the home exercises in Method 1, your doctor or physical therapist may suggest a more rigorous treatment option based on one of the major scoliosis treatment methodologies, which include the Schroth, Nu Schroth, and Scientific Exercises Approach to Scoliosis (SEAS) methods. Each methods uses different principles and techniques tailored to the exact spinal curvature of a specific patient.


The Schroth Method treats scoliosis by striving to reverse the abnormal posture. The exercises seek to correct the position of the pelvis, use spinal elongation and then rotational angular breathing to help achieve the best possible posture, and use tension in the trunk muscles to strengthen them and promote the best possible posture. The Nu Schroth Method reflects new knowledge and understanding of this disease in recent decades. Some advantages of this method include a home exercise routine that makes it easier to perform regularly, regular imaging studies to track the progress and effects of the exercises, and chiropractic and manual therapy techniques to enhance the effectiveness of the exercises.The SEAS Method calls for exercises that are done twice a week either at home or at a physical therapy center. The advantages of the SEAS method include exercises based on Active Self-Correction (ASC) that are completely tailored to the individual patient, positions that help the patient to achieve maximum function, and the inclusion of exercises to enhance neuro-motor control and stability."

Warm up for your activity slowly.,
Stretch, but not too much.,
Try pre-workout supplements like glutamine and protein.,
Eat foods rich in omega-3s.,
Know that muscle soreness is natural.",How to Ease Sore Muscles2," One of the easiest ways to hurt your muscles is to jump right into your exercise. Whether you're jogging up a hill, bursting into a sprint, or heading straight to the court, you need to stretch. Your muscles need time to literally get warm, which allows them to elongate and contract without tearing. Try the following warm-up before stretching.


Jog lightly for 10-15 minutes.
Jump, skip, shuffle, or high-step for 5-10 minutes to activate specific muscles.
Swing your arms in small circles at your sides, gradually getting larger.
Do 10-20 lunges, push-ups.

, While everyone has heard how important stretching is, there is actually some debate about its effectiveness in preventing muscles soreness. That said, light stretching after a warm-up will elongate your muscle fibers and increase flexibility.Hold each stretch for about 10-15 seconds.


Stop stretching if you feel pain–stretching should never hurt.
Focus on the muscles you are going to work out. If you’re going to run, stretch your quads and hamstring. If you’re lifting then stretch your arms, shoulders, and back.

, While this is a disputed topic amongst sports scientists, some studies have shown the glutamine and protein supplements can aid in muscle regeneration that prevents soreness. Pick them up at your local health store or online and have one 20-30 minutes before working out.Always drink plenty of water with supplements.

, Omega-3s are a natural anti-inflammatory agent, reducing swelling and damage around your muscles. Some good sources include:


Salmon
Flax and chia seeds
Avocados
Walnuts, Even professional body-builders get muscle soreness. While it is uncomfortable, it will go away within 2-3 days. The more frequently you work out the less likely it is that you will get sore. Most muscle soreness occurs because of:


Changes in workout intensity.
Starting to work out after long periods on inactivity.
New exercises or working new muscle groups.

Identify the pain.,
Describe the pain.,
Measure your shoulder’s range of motion.,
Identify Altering factors.",How to Diagnose a Torn Shoulder Labrum1," Locate where the pain in your shoulder is exactly and to where the pain radiates.


Be precise, so that you can help your physician accurately locate the pain later on.;
, Describe the feeling of the pain.


Pain can be described as sharp, throbbing, pressuring etc.
Labrum pain is often sharp and throbbing

, Measure the range of motion in your shoulder. Note down what motion you are still able to do and what motions you are unable to perform.


The labrum stabilizes the shoulder, therefore, stabilizing the motion of the shoulder. Loss of range of motion due to the instability of the shoulder joint is quite common.

, Recognize what makes the pain worse or better.


Pain is often altered with certain posture or activity. Distinguishing what alters the pain can tell a lot about the injury to the physician.

"
"
Give a chief complaint: Tell the whole story behind the pain to your physician and then recall what you identified from the the four categories in the “Identifying symptoms” portion and articulate them to your physician as well.,
Take the labrum tear test.,
Get Imaging done.,
Find out if your labrum is torn and what degree tear you have.",How to Diagnose a Torn Shoulder Labrum2,"

Your chief complaint, is your interpretation of the injury for your doctor.
Don’t be afraid to give details. The smallest detail could make a huge difference in the course of the diagnosis

, There are 4 tests your doctor will conduct on your shoulder that specifically identify a labrum tear. If you respond in pain to any of the test, your test will be considered a pass for that specific test. Depending on how many test you pass or fail, the doctor will be able to conclude a percentage chance of a labrum tear. For example, if you test positive for 3 out of 4, you have an 80% chance of having a labrum tear.


Test 1: The doctor will ask you put the arm of injury in a 90-degree angle pointing upward. Facing you, while holding the elbow still, will push back against your forearm to see if any pain is triggered.
Test 2: The doctor will ask you to put your arms out and resist him as he applied fore down.
Test 3: The doctor will ask you to put your arms out and turn your palms in. He will then request for you to apply force against his palms as he holds them between your arms.
Test 4: Doctor will ask you to reach across with the arm in pain and grip his finger. He will across your body and ask your to resists his pull.

, The doctor will refer you to a radiologist specialist to get and MRI arthrogram done on your shoulders. Take the written script he provides you and get imaging done at local imagine center.

The MRI on its own isn’t enough to identify such a small cartilage. The arthrogram is a dye that is injected into the shoulder ligament before the MRI so that it can specify the labrum.
An MRI date can range from next day to a week from the day of your visit.
Arthrogram insertion is a 20-45 minute process and the MRI can last from30-45 minutes.

, Follow up with your doctor 1 week from when you got your MRI-Arthrogram done and find out whether your labrum is torn or not. If it is torn you well be told what degree tear you have, and that will determine the type of treatment you will receive going forward.

1st degree tear is the slightest tear is the smallest of the tears. Recovery for a such a tear comes with rest and time. Doctor will offer optional physical therapy, but it is not necessary.
2nd degree tears are also quite small, but still give the physician some concern. He will strongly recommend physical therapy to ensure recovery.
3rd degree is where surgery will come into play. 3rd degree tears can limit daily life because of the intensity of pain and limitation of mobility. Doctor will give the patient of surgery if they intend on going back to intense physical activity. If the patient just wants to regain regular daily motion, the doctor will give a script for 4-6 months of physical therapy in order to strengthen the shoulder to support the weakness of the torn labrum.
4th degree tears are the worse tears, because they are complete tears. Such tears can lead to more shoulder problems and most likely arthritis. Doctors in this case will require surgery, regardless of whether the patient is going back to sports or daily life.

In the buttock
Radiating down the back of the leg;
, Degenerative joint disease can affect the function of the joint, in addition to causing pain. If you have this condition, you may notice a number of changes in the way you are able to move your body.You may experience pain when moving, so sitting may be more comfortable than standing.
You may not be able to bend or twist your spine the same way you used to.
You may find that your body is very stiff and rigid, especially after you have rested.
Your legs may feel weak, which can make moving more difficult., Degenerative joint disease sometimes causes noticeable changes in the appearance of the body, although the changes may be subtle. Pay close attention to your body and make note of any changes you observe.You may have visible swelling in the affected area.
The normal curve of your spine may change or even disappear.

, Some people who have degenerative joint disease of the spine experience an audible cracking or crunching of the joints. If you hear these kinds of sounds, it may be caused by your bones rubbing against each other due to a lack of cartilage., Some people who suffer from degenerative joint disease experience muscle spasms. These may be uncomfortable and may force you to change your sitting position., There are a variety of different conditions that can cause symptoms like back pain, numbness and weakness. You may be able to rule out degenerative joint disease if you experience certain symptoms that are indicative of other conditions.


If the skin around the affected area is red or feels hot, you are more likely suffering from rheumatoid arthritis.If you felt a popping sensation before you began experiencing pain, you are more likely suffering from sciatica.If you experienced trauma of any kind, you may have an acute injury to your spine, such as a fracture.

, While degenerative joint disease can happen to anyone, it is much more common in older individuals, as the body's cartilage tends to degrade over a long period of time. Joint degeneration is also much more common in individuals with a history of the following:Obesity
Compromised immune system
Malnutrition
Congenital joint disorders
Prolonged abuse of joints (from poor posture, sports, or work-related activities)

, If you are experiencing any of the above symptoms, you should schedule an appointment with a doctor as soon as possible. Only a doctor can determine if your symptoms are indeed being caused by degenerative joint disease of the lower back.Your visit will likely include a physical examination and a review or your medical history.
Your doctor may want to do blood tests to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms, such as infection.

, Sometimes, doctors must manipulate the body in order to diagnose a problem. Doctors use specific tests that have been designed to isolate certain joints. While these tests may be a bit uncomfortable, they should not cause any further damage to your joints.For example, the FABER test, which doctors perform by rotating the hip externally while the patient is lying supine, is excellent for identifying joint disease in the sacroiliac joint, which is located between the spine and the pelvis.

, One of the first tests your doctor will likely order is an x-ray. This can help reveal any abnormalities that involve the bone, including fractures or growths.Bone spurs are a common complication of degenerative joint disease, and these will be visible on an x-ray. However, keep in mind that degenerative changes on an x-ray do not automatically mean that your pain is because of these degenerative changes. Approximately 90 percent of people over the age of 64 have degenerative changes, which indicates that degenerative changes are a part of ageing., While x-rays are helpful for seeing what is happening with the bone, they do not show soft tissue. Your doctor may order an MRI in addition to or instead of an x-ray. This test will help reveal abnormalities in the discs and nerve roots. While x-rays use radiation to produce images, MRIs use magnetic force.

, While x-rays and MRIs are the most common imaging tests used to diagnose lower back pain, there are a variety of other tests that your doctor may want to perform. Additional tests are particularly likely if your x-ray and/or MRI fail to reveal the source of your symptoms.CT scans are used to create three-dimensional images of your spine, including soft tissue.
Myelograms enhance traditional x-rays or CT scans by using an injectable dye to increase contrast.
EMGs use small needles to measure electrical activity in the muscles, which helps doctors diagnose nerve damage.
Bone scans use a small amount of injectable radioactive material and a scanner to take images of the bones, which helps doctors assess the extent of a patient's joint disease.

, Your doctor may inject a numbing medication into one of your joints in order to determine definitively which joint is causing your symptoms. This is especially helpful if other tests have been inconclusive or if there are multiple possible causes of your pain.This test works by temporarily relieving your pain. If you get effective pain relief, the offending joint has been identified. If you do not get pain relief, your problem is being caused by a different joint.

, Once your condition has been diagnosed, you can work with your doctor to determine the best course of treatment. There are a variety of treatments available to help patients with degenerative joint disease, and the right one for you will depend on the severity of your condition, your medical history, and many other factors.Your doctor may prescribe medication to reduce pain, swelling, and muscle spasms.
Your doctor may recommend that you receive treatment from a chiropractor or physical therapist.
You may be given a TENS device, which attaches to the skin and provides electrical stimulation that can block pain.
Alternative pain management options, such as acupuncture and biofeedback, may also be available.
Your doctor may recommend that you have injections to reduce your pain. Epidural steroid injections are commonly used for temporary relief, and nerve block therapies may provide more permanent relief.
Your doctor may also recommend an exercise program, most likely through a physical therapist. An exercise program can help to strengthen and increase the flexibility of the muscles around your back joints, which may help to reduce pain and discomfort. It may take several weeks for you to see any effect from these exercises, so try to be patient.
If no other treatment methods are successful, your doctor may recommend that you have back surgery. There are a variety of different procedures that can be performed, depending on the exact source of your pain.

Talk to a doctor.,
Look for a family connection.,
Have genetic testing.",How to Diagnose Ehlers‐Danlos Syndrome," The most visible signs of EDS are shared among most of the six different subtypes. One is having overly flexible or “hypermobile” joints. This symptom can take a number of different forms, including joint “looseness” and the ability to extend joints past their normal range. It might also include joint pain and susceptibility to injuries.One giveaway that you have hypermobile joints is that you are able to extend the joints past their normal range of motion. Some people call this being “double-jointed.”
Can you bend your little fingers back more than 90 degrees? Can you bend your elbows or knees backward? Can you put your palms down on the floor while keeping your legs straight? These are all indications that you have “loose” joints.
Besides being loose, the joints may be unstable and prone to dislocate. Someone with EDS may also suffer from chronic joint pain or develop early onset osteoarthritis.;
, People with EDS often have distinctive skin, too. The body’s weakened connective tissues let the skin stretch more than it normally would and the skin usually appears very soft and velvety. The skin is also highly elastic and will spring back into place if stretched. Keep in mind that some people with EDS display hypermobile joints but not these skin symptoms.Is the skin exceptionally soft, thin, elastic, or loose? These are all potential signs of EDS.
Try the following test: pinch a small area of skin on the back of the hand and gently pull up. For people with typical skin symptoms of EDS, the skin will immediately snap back into place.

, Another related sign of EDS is that the skin is very fragile and prone to wounding. Skin can bruise or even split easily and will take longer than usual to heal. People who are affected may also develop severe scarring over time.Do you bruise at the slightest bump? Because the connective tissue is weak, people with EDS may easily bruise, break blood vessels, or experience prolonged bleeding after a trauma.
For someone with EDS, the skin may be fragile enough to tear or break open with very slight force. It may also take a long time to heal. For instance, stitches meant to close a wound may tear out and leave a large scar.
Many people with EDS have distinct scarring that is described as looking like “parchment” or “cigarette paper.” These scars are long and thin and form where the skin has split open.

, “Hypermobility” is the least serious of all EDS subtypes but can still have major effects, especially on the muscles and skeleton. The biggest indication of this subtype is joint hypermobility. However, there may be additional signs in addition to the shared symptoms above.Apart from joint looseness, many people with the hypermobility subtype can suffer frequent dislocations of the shoulder or patella with little or no trauma and a good deal of pain. They may also develop diseases like osteoarthritis.
Chronic pain is a primary sign of hypermobility EDS, too. This pain can be severe – “physically and psychologically disabling” – and can’t always be accounted for. Doctors are not sure, but it may come from muscle spasms or arthritis.

, The “classical” version of EDS usually shows the common skin and joint symptoms, i.e. the skin is fragile and the joints are overly mobile. However, there are other symptoms that are associated with this subtype. These should be considered when trying to reach a diagnosis.People with this subtype of EDS often have scars over pressure points like the knees, elbows, forehead, and chin. The scars at these locations may also have hardened, calcified bruises. Some people also develop “spheroids” on the forearms or shins. These are small cysts under the skin that contain fat and are movable.
People with this subtype of EDS may also have poor muscle tone, fatigue, and muscle cramps. In some cases, they may suffer from hiatal hernias or even anal prolapse. Hernias can occur as a complication of surgery, too.

, Vascular EDS is the most dangerous subtype, because it affects the internal organs and can lead to things like internal bleeding, ruptures, and even death. More than 80% of people with this subtype experience a complication by age 40. The mean age at death is around 50 years old.People with vascular EDS often have a certain physical appearance. This includes thin and translucent skin, which is most visible on the chest. They may also be short with thin hair, and have large eyes, a thin nose, and ears without lobes.
Other signs of vascular EDS are clubfoot, joint looseness limited only to the fingers and toes, premature skin aging on the hands and feet, and early varicose veins.
The most serious signs for this subtype have to do with internal injuries. Bruising is very easy. Vascular EDS can also lead arteries and organs to rupture or collapse without warning. This is the leading cause of death for those with this subtype.

, Another form of EDS is the Kyphoscoliosis subtype. The main feature of this kind is the sideways curvature of the spine (scoliosis). Kyphoscoliosis EDS can show itself at birth in this as well as other major symptoms.As said, look for lateral curvature of the spine. In kyphoscoliosis EDS, scoliosis is present at birth or within the first year and is progressive, meaning it gets worse over time. Often, people with this subtype are unable to walk by their 20s or 30s.
People with the Kyphoscoliosis subtype also usually have severe joint looseness and poor muscle tone at birth. This can delay the child’s motor skills.
Another sign has to do with the eyes. The Kyphoscoliosis subtype weakens the whites of the eye or sclera, and a minor trauma can cause the eyeball to rupture.

, The main sign of the arthrochalasia subtype is the frequent dislocation of the hips starting from birth. Along with skin elasticity, easy bruising, and fragile tissue, this sign is present in all people with this variety of EDS.Arthrochalasia EDS is mainly identified by frequent dislocations and displacements of the hip joints. However, it can also include poor muscle toning and scoliosis.

, The last and least common variety of EDS is the dermatosparaxis subtype, which is named after symptoms related to the skin. People with this kind of EDS have more fragile skin and severe bruising than others but otherwise different features.Note the skin’s appearance. In Dermatosparaxis EDS, the skin is soft and doughy and there is less elasticity. Many people have excess and sagging skin, especially around the face.
People with Dermatosparaxis EDS may be prone to large hernias. However, they have skin that heals normally and do not scar as in other subtypes.

, If you think that you or a loved one might have EDS, talk about your concerns with a physician. Your regular doctor may be able to advise you but will more likely refer you to a specialist in genetic diseases. Expect a series of questions about medical and family histories and a thorough exam.Set up an appointment. Before you see the doctor, think about what symptoms you have seen or experienced.
The doctor may ask if your or your loved one’s joints are overly flexible, if the skin is stretchy, or if the skin heals poorly. She will also probably ask about any medications the patient is taking.

, Since EDS is a genetic syndrome, it gets passed down in families. This means that you or a loved one is more likely to have the mutations if a close family member had them, as well. Think carefully and be prepared to answer questions about your family history.Did any of your or your loved one’s relatives have a diagnosed case of EDS? Or, did they have symptoms like the ones you’re seeing?
Do you know of any relatives who died suddenly from a ruptured blood vessel or organ? Recall that this is one of the most serious complications of vascular EDS and may indicate an undiagnosed case.
Your doctor will try to diagnose by type, finding the EDS subtype that most closely matches the patient’s symptoms.

, Usually a specialist can make a diagnosis on the basis of the skin, joints, and a family history. However, they can also use genetic tests to confirm EDS or the specific subtype that is present. A DNA test can pinpoint the problem and show the specific genes that are mutated.Genetic testing can be done to confirm Vascular, kyphoscoliotic, Arthrochalasia, Dermatosparaxis, and sometimes Classical EDS.
For testing, expect to be referred to a clinical geneticist or genetic counselor. You’ll then give a sample of either blood, saliva, or skin for laboratory testing.
Genetic tests are not always 100% accurate. Some people recommend that they be done conservatively to confirm rather than rule out a diagnosis.

Watch for leg pain and/or trouble walking.Because Cauda Equina Syndrome (CES) affects the nerves at the bottom of your spinal cord, and because many of these nerves go to your legs, CES in the early stages may present as pain radiating down one or both legs, and/or trouble moving your legs or walking with the same ease as before.,
See your doctor immediately if you are experiencing bladder and/or bowel dysfunction.If you cannot pass urine (i.e.,
Notice if you are experience unusual challenges sexually.If you are experiencing a rather sudden and unusual decrease in your sexual sensation, and/or your ability for erection and/or orgasm, this may be a potential sign of CES.,
Look out for numbness in the ""saddle area.,
Pay attention to lower back pain.,
Be aware of loss of reflexes.,
Consider whether you have had any recent ""triggering incidents.,
Go to the Emergency Room immediately if you notice any ""red flag"" symptoms.If you are experiencing any of the symptoms described in this article — leg pain and/or trouble walking, severe back pain or pain or numbness in the saddle area, bladder and/or bowel dysfunction, diminished reflexes in the extremities, sudden changes in sexual function, triggering incidents — it is key that you go straight to the nearest emergency room immediately.,
Have your doctor perform a neurological exam.Your doctor will test your reflexes, your ability to move your lower limbs, your strength when he or she applies resistance to your leg muscles, and your sensation when he or she tests your skin with various objects.,
Obtain a CT or MRI.If your symptoms suggest that you may have CES, it is key that you receive an imaging test (either a CT or an MRI) as soon as possible.,
Receive a myelogram.In addition to standard CT or MRI imaging, you may also receive something called a myelogram.,
Receive neurologic nerve testing of the lower extremities.Neurologic tests can help confirm CES and should be undertaken as soon as possible.,
Receive emergency surgery.If you have been diagnosed with Cauda Equina Syndrome (CES), it is key to see a neurosurgeon for surgery immediately.,
Prepare for the possible long-term consequences following CES.Depending upon how quickly you received surgical treatment following the onset of symptoms, as well as the degree of neurological (nerve-related) compromise that occurred in your spinal cord, you may end up with residual long-term symptoms or disabilities following CES.,
Understand why it is key to seek treatment urgently.If you are experiencing the signs and symptoms of potential CES and fail to receive medical attention immediately, it may result in permanent paralysis of your lower limbs, permanent loss of sexual function and sensation, and/or chronically impaired bladder or bowel function.",How to Diagnose Cauda Equina Syndrome,";
, it is accumulating in your bladder and you cannot urinate), go to the Emergency Room. If you cannot control your urine (i.e. are leaking urine involuntarily), this is another potential sign of CES. Similarly, a sudden inability to control your bowels (such as inadvertently passing stool or leaking stool from your rectum) is a possible sign of CES. All of these warrant prompt medical attention and evaluation.

, Seek medical help immediately.

,""If you notice numbness in the ""saddle area"" (picture the area of your pelvis that would be in contact with a saddle if you were to sit on one), this area it is a ""red flag"" (worrisome) symptom and you need to see a doctor immediately. Numbness in the genital (""saddle"") area is not normal, and may be a sign of impending (or already present) CES.

, You may feel an aching and severe pain in your lower back, which can be debilitating. This is another red flag symptom and it may vary in intensity or grow slowly over time., You may find that your ankle and knee reflexes are diminished. You may also experience deteriorating reflexes in the anus and bulbospongiosus muscle, located between the anus and the genitals.,""Oftentimes, CES follows an incident that causes trauma or another problem in the spinal cord. Things to be aware of that greatly increase your risk of CES include:


A recent infection (it is possible that this may have spread to the spinal cord)
Recent back surgery
Recent back trauma, such as an accident or other injury
A history of cancer (sometimes cancer metastases can spread to the spine leading to compression of the nerve roots)

, Time spent waiting or hesitating is precious time lost that could cost you your long-term function and health.

, If any of these are abnormal, it may be an indication of potential Cauda Equina Syndrome (CES).


Your doctor may test your mobility and coordination by asking you to walk on your heels and toes.
He or she will examine for pain when you bend forward, backward, and to each side.
Your doctor will check your anal sensation and reflexes, as abnormalities here are key aspects of the diagnosis of CES.

, The imaging test will allow the doctor to see your spinal cord, including the nerve roots, and to evaluate what, if anything, may be causing them to be compressed. Possible sources of spinal cord compression that may be detected on CT or MRI include:A primary spine tumor or cancer metastases
A herniated disc in your spine
Bone spurs
An infection that has gotten into your spinal cord
A fracture of the spinal cord
Narrowing of the spinal canal for any reason
Inflammatory spinal disorders such as ankylosing spondylitis (inflammatory arthritis)
Spinal hemorrhages

, This is when contrast material is inserted into the cerebrospinal fluid in your spinal cord, and then an x-ray type image is taken.


The contrast allows clear visualization as to whether there are any abnormalities or displacements in your spinal column.
The myelogram may show herniated discs, bone spurs, or tumors, all of which may be responsible for causing CES.

, Your doctor may perform the following tests:


Nerve conduction velocity (NCV) — This test will measure the speed of electrical impulse as it moves through the nerve. This test can determine if there is nerve damage and can how much.The nerve will be stimulated by an electrode patch attached at one end and the electric impulse is recorded by another patch.Electromyography (EMG) — This test is often done at the same time as an NCV and it measures the electrical activity in your muscles., The surgery needs to be performed within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms, if possible, and the sooner it is done the better.


The surgery will consist of removing whatever material (such as a tumor, or an infection) that is compressing your spinal cord.
The goal is that, by treating the underlying cause (the cause of the spinal cord compression), the tension will be removed from your nerve roots, and you should hopefully be able to regain function.

, These may include:


Chronic pain — some people require long-term pain medications to ease ongoing nerve-related pain following CES.
Bladder or bowel dysfunction — some people continue to struggle with bladder and/or bowel control, even after surgical resolution of their CES. (However, the good news here is that bladder and bowel function often improve in the years following surgery; it just may take longer to regain function than other affected areas.)
Sexual problems — patients are often advised to see a sex therapist for help if they are struggling to regain sexual function.
Motor problems — problems walking or performing other movement tasks, particularly with your lower limbs.

, Needless to say, these are things you want to avoid! Therefore, if in doubt, go to your local Emergency Room for evaluation of your signs and symptoms to ensure that, if you are developing CES, it is treated and resolved as quickly as possible.

Tell your doctor about how it began.One of the things to be aware of is that gout has a characteristic onset.,
Consider that it may be a joint infection.One of the important diagnoses for your doctor to rule out is the possibility of an infected joint (or ""septic arthritis""), which may have a presentation very similar to gout.,
Be aware of the possibility of ""pseudogout.,
Take note of whether your joint self-resolves.An acute gout attack should resolve on its own within three to 10 days (although medical treatment may help to ease the symptoms during this time, to speed up recovery, and to prevent future gout attacks).,
Inform your doctor if you have a personal history of gout, a family history of gout, or other risk factors for gout.Needless to say, if you have had gout in the past, your likelihood of having a recurrent attack is significantly higher; therefore, if you have a past history of gout, your current episode is much more likely to be gout as well (as opposed to being a totally new diagnosis affecting your joint).,
Examine for the presence of tophi.In addition to acute (short-term) gout attacks, there are also people who suffer from chronic gout.,
Observe the number of joints involved.,
Get a blood test.A blood test can assess the levels of uric acid and creatinine in your blood.,
Get the fluid in the affected joint aspirated.Your doctor may use a needle to ""aspirate,"" or remove, some fluid from your affected joint.,
Have the aspirated fluid sent for a culture.,
Ask your doctor for an x-ray of the affected joint(s).,
Use NSAIDs for symptomatic relief and to decrease inflammation.If you are indeed diagnosed with gout, your doctor will likely advise you to begin taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).,
Try Colchicine.Colchicine is a medication that is uniquely effective at decreasing the pain caused by gout; however, when taken in high doses (which are usually required to combat an acute gout attack), the side effects of nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea are often too much to handle.,
Opt for corticosteroids.Corticosteroids are a method of inflammation control (and subsequent pain relief) for those who cannot tolerate NSAIDs and/or Colchicine.,
Take medication to prevent future gout attacks.In addition to treating an acute gout attack (or gout exacerbation, if you suffer from chronic gout), your doctor may offer you preventative medications.",How to Distinguish Gout from Similar Conditions," It typically begins with sudden, severe pain — often in one joint, and most commonly in your big toe (on one side or the other). It often begins at night, and may wake you from sleep. The affected joint often appears red and swollen and may feel warm to the touch, and you will likely have a decreased range of motion around the affected joint.


If your joint pain is of gradual onset and does not match the profile above, it is less likely to be gout.
It may be something else, such as rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, among other things.;
, An infection may also occur concurrently alongside a gout attack, and the two are almost impossible to tell apart without diagnostic tests.


An infected joint will likely also be sudden in onset, appear red and swollen and warm to the touch, and may be accompanied by a fever.
You will need analysis of your joint fluid to distinguish between gout and an infection.

,""Pseudogout, also known as calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD), also presents very similarly to gout (hence its name). Again, the only way to truly differentiate pseudogout from gout is to have your joint fluid looked at under a microscope.

, If you do have gout, you will experience ""attacks"" of it followed by remissions (or followed by total resolution). Gout does not tend to be a persistent, chronic, and consistent condition. Rather, it either comes as a one-time attack, or a series of flare-ups and exacerbations, followed by periods of remission (or improvement).


If the pain in your joint persists for weeks or even months, without much variability, it is likely to be another diagnosis such as rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis.

,


If your family members have had gout before, you are also at a heightened risk of developing gout. This, again, would increase the probability that your current joint problem is gout-related.
Additional risk factors for gout include: being male, being a post-menopausal female, having other health conditions (namely high blood pressure, diabetes, or kidney problems), consuming excess alcohol, being overweight, and taking certain medications (such as aspirin, diuretics, and certain immunosuppressive agents).

, Chronic gout consists of recurrent gout attacks over a prolonged period of time. It often leads to the formation of ""tophi"" (hard bumps under the skin in the joint area), which is a characteristic sign of chronic gout.


The presence of tophi — that can be visually seen in a joint — is one of the cardinal signs of chronic gout (also known as ""tophaceous gout"").
This is one of the best ways to distinguish gout from other chronic arthritic conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, because no other chronic forms of arthritis present with tophi.

, The medical conditions to consider in the differential diagnosis will depend significantly on whether you have only one joint affected, or multiple joints affected. The differences are as follows:


If you have only one joint affected, it is more likely to be gout, pseudogout, or an infected joint.
If you have multiple joints affected, it may still be gout or pseudogout. It may also be another condition, though, such as rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis.
Lastly, if you have multiple joints affected, the probability of an infection is slim to none (as an infection normally affects only one joint at a time).

, Elevated uric acid levels heighten the likelihood that it is gout. Creatinine is a measure of kidney function. Poor kidney function may lead to inadequate uric acid clearance from your body, and the resulting build-up of uric acid may predispose you to gout.


Note, however, that there is no direct correlation between uric acid levels on your blood test and a diagnosis of gout.
Many people have elevated uric acid levels, but do not ever experience clinical signs or symptoms of gout.
Similarly, many people who do have clinical signs and symptoms of gout do not who elevated levels of uric acid.
There is a correlation, for sure, and your likelihood of gout is increased with elevated uric acid levels, but it is not required (nor is it the exclusive criteria) in the diagnosis of gout.

, She will then examine this fluid under the microscope.


If it is gout, the microscope will show the presence of uric acid crystals.
It is is pseudogout, the microscope will show the presence of calcium pyrophosphate crystals.
If it is septic arthritis, the microscope will show neither uric acid crystals nor calcium pyrophosphate crystals.

,

Although looking at synovial joint fluid under a microscope can be diagnostic of gout (if the presence of uric acid crystals is detected), it is key to understand that gout and an infection are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Therefore, even if the test comes back diagnostic for gout, an infection could still potentially be present.

Having the synovial fluid sent for a culture will examine to see if any bacteria or other microbes grow.
If there is an infection, the culture dish will grow the microbe, which will be diagnostic for ""septic arthritis"" (a diagnosis that may exist alongside gout).

,

An x-ray can help to distinguish between gout and other arthritic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, which has a distinct appearance on x-ray. An x-ray is usually sufficient for imaging; however, in some cases, an ultrasound or a CT scan may also be of help in assessing your underlying joint problem, particularly if it does not appear to be caused by gout., Examples include Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and Naproxen (Aleve). These can be purchased over-the-counter at your local pharmacy or drugstore.


Stronger NSAIDs may be prescribed to you by your doctor if the over-the-counter versions are insufficient to help relieve your gout.

,


As a result, colchicine is most frequently used after an acute gout attack subsides, with the goal of preventing future gout attacks.
Taken in low doses for preventative purposes, the side effects of colchicine are rarely problematic.

, Corticosteroids can be prescribed in pill form, or they can be injected directly into the affected joint (which is usually the better option, as you avoid the side effects that can come from taking them in pill form).


An example of a corticosteroid is Prednisone.
Corticosteroids are generally given in limited amounts, such as one (or minimal) injections into your affected joint, and/or a limited course of corticosteroids taken in pill form.

, The purpose of these medications is to decrease your likelihood of future gout attacks.


Allopurinol is an example of a medication that can help to prevent excess uric acid production.
Probenecid is an example of a medication that can aid in your kidney's ability to filter and remove uric acid from your body.

Determine whether your pain is acute.,
Assess if the pain is chronic, alternatively.,
Note of the location and kind of pain you are feeling.",How to Diagnose Back Pain1," Acute mechanical back pain is pain that has been present for less than four to six weeks and is caused by an issue in the spinal joints, discs, vertebrae, or soft tissues. The bad news is that the source of acute back pain is only diagnosable about 20% of the time. The good news? It usually resolves itself fast and with little treatment.Figure out how long you have had the pain. When did it start? Can you remember the exact moment when it began?
Acute back pain often stems from strenuous activity or an injury. Can you link the pain to an event, like a game of football, shoveling snow, or picking up heavy boxes?
Where is the pain? Most acute mechanical back pain is in the lower-back or lumbar region, but it may spread into your buttocks and thighs. It may also worsen if you bend over and it can be accompanied by spasms.;
, Chronic back pain is persistent and lasts longer than acute back pain – more than several weeks. Diagnosis for chronic pain may be harder and require a trip to the doctor, who can assess your medical history and order follow-up tests. First, though, ask yourself the same questions as before.How long have you had the back pain? If it’s more than three to five weeks, chances are that the pain is chronic rather than acute.
Can you relate the pain to an injury or event, or did it set in gradually? Often, chronic back pain is the result of age-related changes in the spine.
Chronic back pain can come in many forms. It might be a dull ache, sharp pain, tingling or burning sensation, or even feelings of weakness. The pain may also be mild or so intense that it is hard to move.

, Back pain can range from a dull ache to sudden, shooting pains. The pain might also be centered in your lower back, your upper back, or elsewhere. Take note of where the pain is and how it feels, both of which can help you and your doctor locate the source of the problem.Where does the pain originate? The lower back is often where we develop stress injuries from lifting, for example.
Is your pain localized in a muscle? Is is accompanied by swelling, muscle spasms, or limited movement of the muscle? You might have a strain. Muscle strains account for 85% of all back injuries in the United States.
Are you experiencing shooting pains, on the other hand? This sort of pain might be associated with a damaged or slipped disk or sciatica. Be aware of any tingling feeling, too. Tingling can indicate nerve compression, as in radiculopathy.

"
"
Make an appointment.,
Expect to give a medical history.,
Ask your own questions.",How to Diagnose Back Pain2," Acute back pain normally clears up on its own. But consider contacting your doctor if your back pain is severe or doesn’t get better with normal rest and at-home treatment, which indicates a chronic condition. Also, make an appointment if the pain spreads down one or both legs and past the knees, or causes weakness, loss of control, or tingling in the legs.Back pain usually resolves itself within two weeks or less with rest and home treatment. If not, or if your pain is severe, see a doctor.
If the back pain is new, try to continue your daily activities as best you can. You can also use cold compresses – like a package of frozen vegetables – or over-the-counter pain relievers like Ibuprofen.
Seek medical help immediately if your back pain ever causes bladder or bowel problems, is accompanied by a fever, or is the result of a fall or other traumatic event.
Also, consider making an appointment if you start to have back pain after age 50 or if you have a history of cancer, osteoporosis, or drug and alcohol abuse.

, Your doctor will want to do her own diagnosis and will need to ask you a series of questions about the pain. After doing a self-assessment, you should be prepared to share your past medical history, the source and kind of pain, and other information. This can be critical to a correct diagnosis.Write down personal information in advance, like physical and emotional stresses in your life. Also note other medical conditions for which you’re being treated, names and dosages of medicines you’re taking, and any recent injuries to your back.
Expect questions from your doctor like, “When did the pain begin? Where is it centered? Do you have any other symptoms? Is the pain constant? Does it affect your everyday functioning? How do you rate the pain on a scale of one to 10? Do you do heavy physical work? What other kinds of activities do you do?”
The doctor may examine your back and your ability to sit, stand, bend over, walk, or lift your legs.

, During your appointment, feel free to ask the doctor questions about your back pain. Doing so will help you to understand the underlying issues but also to ease any anxieties you may have. You need to be informed about your body – consider it a right.Ask questions like, “What is the most likely cause of my back pain? What started it? What can I do to prevent a recurrence?”
Make sure that you understand the diagnosis. For example, if the doctor tells you that your back pain is likely from sciatica, ask her to explain what this condition means, how it occurs, and what the possible causes and solutions are.
Inquire what sort of diagnostic tests you’ll need, if any. If it helps, also write down your questions before you go to the appointment.

"
"
Go for X-rays or a body scan.,
Have a blood test.,
Do a nerve study.",How to Diagnose Back Pain3," One way that you and a doctor can accurately diagnose the source of your back pain is through body imaging: X-rays and MRI and CT scans. These procedures are usually done in a hospital on your doctor’s orders and can reveal problems in your skeletal or muscular systems. They are usually only necessary for chronic or specific acute conditions.X-rays use electromagnetic radiation to produce an image of your skeleton. Your doctor may order one if she suspects your back pain is a result of a misalignment in the spine, arthritis, or broken bones. However, it won’t show problems with the spinal cord, muscles, or disks.
MRI and CT scans are an option if your doctor thinks the pain is related to soft tissue. These images can show herniated disks, muscle tears, and problems with blood vessels, nerves, and the spinal cord.

, In some cases, back pain can come from infections in the back vertebrae (osteomyelitis), the discs (discitis), or the joints that connect the pelvis to the lower spine (sacroiliitis). In other cases, pain may be related to a tumor. These are not common conditions but can be diagnosed with blood tests.Your may need blood tests if your back pain is accompanied by fever, chills, headache, or neck stiffness. These are all possible symptoms of a spinal infection.
Expect the doctor to take a blood sample to check for a bacterial or fungal infection. She may also need to test your white blood cell count, c-reactive proteins, and other factors.
If the doctor suspects a deep infection, she may need to do use a long needle with X-ray guidance to remove a blood specimen from your back.

, Another way to diagnose back problems is through a nerve study, which is also called electromyography or EMG. EMG measures nerve impulses in your body as well as your muscle reactions, and can help to confirm spinal compression caused by herniated disks or a narrowing of the spinal column (stenosis).Your doctor may order an EMG if she thinks your back pain is the result of compression. You’ll be attached to electrodes where you’re experiencing symptoms. You may feel uncomfortable twinges or spasms when the electrodes send an electric current.
Before an EMG, make sure your doctor knows if you have a pacemaker or other electrical medical device, if you are on blood-thinners, or if you have hemophilia.
Take a bath beforehand to remove oils from your skin, and do not apply lotions or creams.

Look for uneven shoulders.,
Watch for a head that's not centered.,
Assess the symmetry of your hips / pelvis.,
Consider your history of skin changes.,
Be alert to constant (chronic) spinal pain.,
Make an appointment with your family doctor.,
See your chiropractor for a spinal exam.,
Get a referral to an orthopedic doctor.,
Realize that most cases are undiagnosed from childhood.,
Be alert if you have spinal arthritis.,
Watch for osteoporosis of the spine.",How to Diagnose Adult Scoliosis," There are several physical signs that may indicate the presence of scoliosis. Because most cases of scoliosis affect the mid-to-upper back (called the thoracic spine), uneven shoulder levels is a common sign.Look in the mirror with your shirt off, relax your arms, and see if your shoulders are uneven.


""Humping"" of shoulders blades (one that sticks out more) is also common with thoracic scoliosis. Bend over at the waist with your shirt off and ask a friend or family member to see if one shoulder blade sticks up more.
Your ribs may also be distorted due to scoliosis, which can cause your shoulder blades to become distorted as well.
Keep in mind that uneven shoulders are also common in certain types of athletes who use primarily one arm all the time, such as tennis players and baseball pitchers.;
, In addition to uneven shoulders, watch for other signs of asymmetry in your body, such as your head being a little off center from your torso or pelvis.Both thoracic and lumbar (lower back) scoliosis causes a crooked posture that can often be seen in how the head is positioned over the rest of the body.


Due to input from the visual center of your brain, your head will normally be completely level, so if it looks like you're leaning to one side or crooked, the problem likely exists in your body (typically your spine).
Stand away from the mirror and have a friend or family member take a picture of you in a bathing suit. Look at the picture for any signs of leaning or asymmetry in relation to your head.

, Scoliosis in the lower thoracic or lumbar regions of the spine invariably affect the balance and symmetry of your pelvis.One side will be raised and look unusually high, which makes your waist uneven. Stand in front of a mirror with just pants or shorts on. Position your hands above your waist on the sides of your hip bones (iliac crests) and see if they are uneven.


Although a crooked upper back with uneven shoulders can often be hidden with clothing, an uneven pelvis/hips is often obvious to onlookers, who might bring your attention to it.
An uneven waistline affects how pants sit on your hips, which affects the relative leg lengths of the pants. Thus, people with scoliosis often notice that one pant leg is shorter than the other. Some people even notice that one leg looks longer than the other.

, Although skin changes don't happen in every case of scoliosis, some people experience skin changes early on in life and then develop scoliosis later on. If the appearance or texture of your skin overlying your spine develops dimples, hairy patches, rough spots and/or color abnormalities, these may be signs of dysraphism, or abnormal development of the spinal cord and nervous system.However, these skin changes usually happen early in life and lead to scoliosis at a young age.


Ask your spouse or friend to examine the skin of your back closely under good light. Have them take a high resolution picture and look at or show it to a dermatologist for a professional opinion.
Other causes of similar skin changes on the back can include inflammatory arthritis, an underlying infection, skin cancer from too much sun and hormonal changes.

, Most people who develop idiopathic scoliosis, which means from unknown cause, don't feel much or any pain associated from the condition. However, between 20-25% of people with idiopathic scoliosis do feel pain, which is often described as a constant ache throughout the day punctuated by bouts of sharp pain with vigorous movements.Upper or lower back pain that doesn't get better or fade away within a week should be looked at by a health professional. If you also have any of the above-mentioned signs, then scoliosis is a possibility.
Manual therapy (chiropractic, physiotherapy, massage) does not make a significant long-term impact on back pain caused by scoliosis.
Adult scoliosis caused by degenerative arthritis, tumors, spinal trauma and/or muscular diseases have a much greater incidence of pain compared to idiopathic scoliosis that starts during adolescence.

, If you notice any of the above-mentioned signs or symptoms, see your doctor and get in efforts to get a proper medical diagnosis. Your doctor will visually inspect your spine, then x-ray it in order to confirm scoliosis or perhaps another condition. A thorough scoliosis evaluation includes a full length, whole spine x-ray in order to visualize the curve and measure in degrees.A standard exam used by most doctors and nurses to screen for scoliosis is called the Adam's Forward Bend Test — the person bends forward 90 degrees at the waist and the symmetry of their spine and shoulders is evaluated.
The curve is measured on x-ray by the Cobb Method and a diagnosis of scoliosis is made if it's greater than 10 degrees.An MRI or CT scan may also be recommended if there's concern about possible spinal cord compression or other abnormalities.

, Another type of doctor that is well trained in spinal problems and treatment are chiropractors. Your family doctor may not be as comfortable examining and diagnosing problems in your spine due to a lack of experience or training, so your chiropractor can be a good alternative. Chiropractors also conduct spinal exams, orthopedic tests and take full-spine x-rays before rendering a diagnosis.


In general, a scoliotic curve of the spine is only considered clinically significant if it's greater than about 25 to 30 degrees.Chiropractic spinal adjustments and other related therapies (such as electronic muscle stimulation) can provide short-term relief to people with scoliosis, but it doesn't cure or resolve the problem.

, An orthopedic doctor is a bone and joint specialist who can also diagnose cases of adult scoliosis. Your family doctor may refer you to one who focuses more on spinal conditions if your scoliosis appears moderate-to-severe. More specifically, scoliotic curves exceeding 45 to 50 degrees are classified as severe and often require more aggressive treatment, such as surgical techniques.Spinal surgery in adults is sometimes recommended when their curves are greater than 50 degrees and they have nerve damage that affects their legs, bowel and/or bladder.Surgery can involve spinal decompression, fusion and/or the insertion of metal rods in order to straighten the spine. Ribs may also be removed to allow for easier breathing.
Wearing spinal braces is only effective for kids with scoliosis who have not reached skeletal maturity. With adults, their spine has stopped growing, so bracing is ineffective.

, Adult scoliosis is often the result of either untreated or unrecognized cases of childhood scoliosis.If the cause of the spinal curve during childhood is unknown, it's called idiopathic scoliosis and this category comprises about 80% of all cases. If you're born with the condition, it's referred to as congenital scoliosis. Most congenital cases are also idiopathic.


Relatively common congenital causes of scoliosis include spina bifida, muscular dystrophy and cerebral palsy.
About 40% of adult scoliosis patients experience at least a small progression of their spinal curves., Although most adult cases of scoliosis are both congenital and idiopathic, up to 20% of cases are caused by known degenerative conditions of the spine, such as arthritis.The most common type of arthritis of the spine is the ""wear and tear"" type called osteoarthritis, which typically affects the lower lumbar spine because it bears the most weight from the upper body. Osteoarthritis of the spine affects the vast majority of people (to varying degrees) older than the age of 55 years.


The discs and joints connecting the lumbar vertebrae often wear down with age, and sometimes unevenly, which causes a lateral listing or scoliosis and uneven hips / pelvis. This can easily be seen on x-rays.
Your risk of developing osteoarthritis of the spine is greater if you are overweight, sedentary, do lots of sitting, and have a poor diet that's low in minerals, vitamins and protein.
Severe spinal arthritis can be treated with surgical techniques that fuse and straighten the spine.

, Another secondary degenerative cause of adult scoliosis is osteoporosis (loss of bone mass) of the spine.Osteoporosis most often affects the upper thoracic spine, and because it leads to brittle bones, the vertebrae there eventually fracture and collapse. Often osteoporosis of the thoracic spine creates a hunch back appearance, and sometimes due to an uneven collapse, the spine also lists to the side (laterally) to create a scoliosis.


Osteoporosis is much more common in Caucasian and Asian women with slight (thin) builds, especially those who are sedentary and don't exercise much.
A lack of dietary minerals, especially calcium and vitamin D, increases your risk of developing osteoporosis.
Osteoporotic spinal fractures can also easily be seen on x-rays and diagnosed by your family doctor or chiropractor.
Treatment involves surgical techniques, weight bearing exercises and dietary supplements.

Wash your hands first.,
Examine the wound closely.,
Look at your injury for redness or swelling.,
Ask yourself if the pain is getting worse.,
Don't apply an antibiotic unless recommended by your doctor.",How to Check a Wound for Infection1," Before you inspect a wound you should always wash your hands thoroughly.If you are concerned about a wound being or becoming infected, poking around with dirty fingers could make the wound worse. Be sure to thoroughly clean your hands with an antibacterial soap and water before doing anything else.Remember to wash your hands after touching the wound.;
, You must remove any bandages from the wound you are inspecting. Do this carefully so you don't risk aggravating a sensitive area. If your bandage sticks to the wound, you can use running water to tease it off the wound. The water sprayer on a kitchen sink is helpful for this.Once you have taken off the soiled bandages, they should be discarded and thrown into the garbage. Never try to re-use a soiled bandage.

, When you look at the wound think about whether it looks excessively red or if it has gotten redder than it was before. If the wound looks very red and the redness appears to be spreading out from the wound site, this is an indicator of infection.Your skin may also feel warm at the hurt area. Contact a doctor for advice if either of these symptoms are present.

, Feeling new or increasing pain is a symptom of an infected cut. Pain by itself or with other signs (such as swelling, heat, and pus) may indicate an infection is present. Consult a doctor if you notice growing pain at the site.The pain may feel like it is coming from deep within the wound.Generally, swelling of the affected area, heat/warmth and tenderness/pain are the best initial indicators that the wound may be infected.


You might feel a throbbing pain.Itching is not necessarily a sign of infection, although you should never agitate a wound by scratching it a lot. Fingernails can carry more bacteria and scratching can make issues worse.

, Studies haven't shown that antibiotic ointments significantly help a wound infection.An infection that has spread has also entered into your body, so treating the external wound after this has happened won't also treat the bacteria in your body.


Your doctor may recommend antibiotic ointments if the infection is minor and superficial."
"
Observe the wound for yellowish or greenish pus or fluid.,
Look for a build-up of pus around the wound.,
Replace the old bandage with a new sterile one after inspecting the injury.,
If the wound continues leak pus, consult a doctor.",How to Check a Wound for Infection2," This discharge may also have a foul odour. If you see pus or a cloudy fluid, draining away from the wound this is a big indicator of an infection.You should get medical care as soon as possible.


Some drainage from a wound is normal, as long as the fluid is thin and clear. Bacteria may create clear drainage that is not yellow or green. In this a case, your doctor may examine the fluid to determine a specific cause of infection., If you notice pus forming beneath the skin, around the wound site, you may have an infection.Even if you can see a build-up of pus, or feel a tender, growing lump under the skin, but it is not leaking out of the wound, this can still be a sign of infection and should be taken seriously., If there's no sign of infection, this will cover and protect the wound. If there are signs of infection, a sterile bandage will protect the wound from further contamination until you can see a doctor.Take care to only apply the nonstick part of the bandage to the actual wound. The bandage should be large enough to easily cover the wound.

, Some drainage may be normal from a wound as your body fights infection. But, if the pus becomes yellow or green and increases in amount (or refuses to subside), consider seeing your doctor. This is especially true if many previously discussed signs of infection are also present. "
"
Examine the skin around the wound for red lines.,
Locate the lymph nodes (glands) closest to your injury.,
Check your lymph nodes for abnormalities.,
Feel the selected lymph nodes for swelling or tenderness.",How to Check a Wound for Infection3," You may notice these lines moving along the skin away from the injury. Red streaking of the skin around the wound can mean that an infection has spread into the system that drains fluids from tissues, which is called the lymph system.


This kind of infection (lymphangitis) can be serious and you should get prompt medical attention if you see streaking redness from a wound site, especially if you are also experiencing a fever., The nearest lymph nodes for the arms are around your armpits; for the legs, it would be around your groin area. Elsewhere on the body, the closest ones to check would be the nodes on either side of your neck, just under your chin and jawbone on the left and right side.Bacteria is trapped in these glands during an immune response.Sometimes you can suffer infection to the lymph system without the streaking lines being visible on your skin.

, Use 2 or 3 fingers to apply gentle pressure and palpate the area for any enlarged lymph nodes, which may also be tender. A relatively easy way to find any abnormality is to use both hands to feel both sides simultaneously. Both sides should feel generally the same and symmetrical when healthy., If you can feel either swelling or tenderness, this might be a sign of a spreading infection, even if streaking lines are not present. Your lymph nodes are normally only about a half-inch across and you shouldn’t be able to feel them. They can swell up to two or three times this size at which point you will be able to feel them clearly.Swollen lymph nodes that are softer and move easily usually signify infection or inflammation.
Hard lymph nodes that don’t move, cause pain, or last more than 1 to 2 weeks should be examined by a doctor."
"
Take your temperature.,
Consider if you are feeling generally unwell.,
Be aware of your hydration levels.",How to Check a Wound for Infection4," Besides symptoms at the wound site, you may also run a fever. A temperature over 100.5 can indicate an infected wound. You should get medical attention when a fever accompanies one or more of the infection signs listed above., An indicator of an infection in a wound can be as simple as feeling under the weather (general malaise).If you have a wound and start feel sick a few days later, it could be correlated. Check your wound again for signs of infection and if you continue to feel unwell contact a medical professional.


If you notice body aches, headache, dizziness, upset stomach, or even vomit, you may have an infection. A new rash is another reason to check with your doctor.

, Being dehydrated could be indicator of an infected wound. Some of the main symptoms of dehydration include urinating less, having a dry mouth, sunken eyes, and dark urine. If you are experiencing these symptoms you should pay close attention to your wound, check it closely for the other signs of infection, and contact a doctor.Since your body is fighting infection, it is important to stay hydrated and drink plenty of fluids.

Know which types of wounds are prone to infection.,
Understand other risk factors for infection.,
Notice the signs of a severe infection.,
See a doctor.,
Consider taking antibiotics and NSAIDs.",How to Check a Wound for Infection5," Most wounds heal with little to no trouble. However, a wound is more likely to get infected if it has not been properly cleaned and treated. Cuts on the feet, the hands, and other areas that commonly come into contact with bacteria are also especially susceptible. Bite and scratch wounds inflicted by an animal or a human are also more likely to become infected.Keep a special eye on bites, puncture wounds, and crush injuries. Be careful when handling wounds from an unsanitary source: a crusty knife, a rusty nail, or a dirty tool.
If you've been bitten, talk with your doctor about your risk of getting rabies or tetanus. You might need antibiotics, or vaccines or other treatments against tetanus or rabies.If you are healthy and your immune system is strong, most wounds will heal with little risk of infection. Your body's defenses have evolved to keep infections from taking root.

, If your immune system is compromised by conditions like diabetes, HIV, or malnutrition, you are at a much higher risk of getting infected. Bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally would not cause problems for the body’s immune system can infiltrate and multiply to distressing levels. This is especially true in severe 2nd- and 3rd-degree burn wounds, where the skin—your first line of physical defense—has been greatly compromised.

, You may have a fever, and you may feel dizzy. Your heart might be beating faster than usual. The wound will be warm, red, swollen, and painful. You may notice a foul odor, as of something rotting or decaying.All of these symptoms can manifest as mild or as very severe – but if you are experiencing several of them, you need to seek medical treatment.


Do not drive if you're feeling dizzy and feverish. If possible, have a friend or family member drive you to the hospital. You may need to get some strong antibiotics to stabilize your system.
When in doubt, get checked out. In the case of infection, it is not enough to merely self-diagnose using the Internet. A legitimate medical diagnosis is the best way to know for sure.

, If you believe that your wound is getting infected, visit a medical clinic or make an urgent appointment to see your doctor. This is especially important if you have any other medical conditions, or if you meet any of the risk factors for infection.

, Antibiotics may help fight or prevent a bacterial infection, and they can be the most powerful way to knock out a roaring inflammation. NSAIDs will help your body recover from swelling, pain, and fever. You may be able to buy NSAIDs without a prescription, but most effective antibiotics will need a doctor's order.


Avoid NSAIDs if you're using blood-thinning medication. Be aware that these drugs can cause stomach ulcers and kidney malfunction in some people. Ask your doctor!

Ask your physician about painkillers that you may be able to use.,
Place an ice pack on the perineum when you are resting.,
Tighten your buttocks as you sit down.,
Talk to your doctor about sitz baths.,
Pour water over your stitches while you urinate.,
Put pressure on your wound during bowel movements.,
Reduce your risk of becoming constipated.",How to Care for an Episiotomy Postpartum1," Many medications are not safe for nursing mothers to use because they may pass through your breastmilk to the baby.Talk to your doctor about safe medication options to help you manage your pain after an episiotomy.


Paracetamol is often prescribed for breastfeeding mothers who require pain medication after an episiotomy.;
, The perineum is the area between the vagina and anus where the episiotomy was made. You can use an ice pack to help reduce swelling and ease the pain. Wrap an ice pack in a towel and place it between your legs while you are lying in bed or reclining in a chair.Make sure that you do not leave the ice pack on for more than 15 minutes at a time. Take it off now and then to prevent your skin from getting too cold.

, Tightening your buttocks as you sit down will help to pull the tissue together in the perineum, which will help to prevent it from stretching and pulling at your stitches.You may also find that sitting on a pillow or inflated ring will reduce the pressure and pain in your perineum.

, Depending on your situation, your doctor may recommend that you take a daily sitz bath. Sitz baths can help to reduce the pain, swelling, and bruising around the wound area.Fill a bathtub with warm or cool water. Warm water increases the circulation and may feel good, but cool water can decrease the pain a bit faster.
Sit in the bath for up to 20 minutes.

, Urination can cause stinging and pain in your wound area. Any urine that runs over your wound may also introduce bacteria into your wound.


To reduce discomfort and keep your stitches clean, pour water over the area using a squeeze bottle or water bottle as you are urinating. After you have finished going to the bathroom, squeeze a little more water over the area to clean it off., Bowel movements can be a challenge after an episiotomy. To provide support during a bowel movement, press a fresh sanitary pad against your perineum and hold it there while you go.Doing so should help to reduce your pain and discomfort.


Make sure that you discard the pad after you have finished and use a new one every time you have to go.

, Constipation will increase the pressure against the perineum during a bowel movement. This increased pressure will lead to increased discomfort and stretching of the incision line. To reduce your chances of becoming constipated, make sure that you drink plenty of water, eat fiber rich foods, and get some mild exercise during the day.


Drink at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day if you are bottle feeding and a few extra if you are breastfeeding.Try not to get compulsive about drinking water because over hydrating can cut your milk supply. Just don’t allow yourself to be thirsty during the day.
Eat foods that are fiber rich. Fiber rich foods will help loosen your stool and make it easier to have a bowel movement.Fruits and vegetables are good sources of fiber.
Get some mild exercise during the day.Exercise helps your colon move food along. Aim for 15 to 30 minutes of mild exercise a day in the postpartum period.
Talk to your doctor if you still experience constipation. Call your doctor if these measures do not make a difference in your bowel habits within a couple of days. Your doctor may recommend a gentle stool softener until your body becomes regular again.Do not take an over-the-counter stool softener without consulting your physician.

"
Keep the area clean and dry to encourage the stitches to heal.,
Start doing Kegel exercises.,
Expose the area to air.,
Change your sanitary pad every two to four hours.,
Talk with your doctor about sex and using tampons.,
Monitor the area for potential infection.",How to Care for an Episiotomy Postpartum2," Because the wound is between your vagina and your anus, you will need to take extra care to keep the wound as clean and dry as possible.Always rinse the area with water after urinating and wipe your bottom from front to back after you have a bowel movement. Doing so will help keep the area clean and reduce the potential for infection from bacteria in the stool.

, Start doing Kegel exercises as soon as possible after you give birth as long as your doctor says it is okay. Doing Kegel exercises will help to improve circulation and speed your healing time. It will also help your body to repair some of the tissue damage from giving birth.Kegel exercises strengthen the pelvic floor muscles that support the bladder, uterus, and rectum. In addition to helping your episiotomy wound to heal, these exercise can also help reduce urinary incontinence in women and strengthen contractions during orgasm.To perform Kegel exercises, start with an empty bladder and imagine trying to stop yourself from urinating and passing gas at the same time. You are trying to squeeze and lift the area. Be sure that you are squeezing and lifting without using any other muscles. Do not tighten your stomach muscles, squeeze your legs together, tighten your buttocks, or hold your breath. Only the pelvic floor muscles should be working., Since an episiotomy wound does not get much exposure to air during normal daily activities, it is important to expose your wound to air now and then. Exposing your wound to air for a few hours per day will help to reduce the moisture against the stitches.When you are napping during the day or at night, take off your underwear so that your wound will get some exposure to the air.

, You will need to wear a sanitary pad while your episiotomy wound heals. Wearing a sanitary pad will help to keep the wound dry and also prevent any blood from getting on your underwear. Keeping the area clean and dry will help it to heal faster. Make sure that you change your sanitary pad ever two to four hours even if it looks clean.

, Although your episiotomy wound should heal within 10 days, your internal structures have been stretched and may have minor tears in them. Most doctors recommend waiting six to seven weeks after giving birth before you start having sex again.Ask your doctor before you start resuming sexual activity to make sure that it will be safe for you to do so.

, Infections to your episiotomy wound can slow the healing process and increase your pain. If you get an infection, you will require immediate medical attention to reduce the potential for serious consequences. For the first seven to 10 days after your episiotomy, do a visual inspection of the stitches and wound area every day. Call your doctor if you notice any of the following symptoms:Increasing pain
The wound appears to break open
You have discharge with a bad odor
You have a hard or painful lump in the areaThe skin between your vagina and anus looks redder than usual
The skin between your vagina and anus looks swollen
You see pus coming from the stitches"

Understand the purpose of an episiotomy during childbirth.,
Learn about the different types of episiotomy.,
Talk to your doctor about your concerns.,
Do Kegel exercises to help reduce your need for an episiotomy.,
Give yourself a perineal massage.",How to Care for an Episiotomy Postpartum3," During a vaginal delivery the head of the baby must pass through the birth canal, through the vagina, and out of the body. During this process the head of the baby will usually press against the perineum until it stretches the tissues in this area enough for the head to pass through. Your doctor may perform an episiotomy if:Your baby is large and needs more room to exit your body
Your baby’s shoulders get stuck during the delivery
Your labor is so fast that the perineum doesn’t have time to stretch before the baby is ready to come out
Your baby’s heart rate indicates that the baby is in trouble and needs to be delivered as fast as possible.
Your baby is in an abnormal position, There are two types of incisions that your doctor can make. Both types require the same care after delivery and at home. The type of incision will depend upon your anatomy, how much room is needed, and the speed of the delivery.A midline or median incision is made from the end of the vagina back toward the anus. These are the easiest for the surgeon to repair after the baby’s birth, but they also have the highest risk of extending or tearing back to the anus during the birth.
A mediolateral incision is done at an angle from the back of the vaginal opening and away from the anus. This offers the best protection against tearing to the anus but is more painful for the woman after delivery. This type of incision is also more difficult for the surgeon to repair after the birth of the child.

, Let your doctor know that you want to allow enough time for the perineum to stretch on its own during birth. Ask for your doctor’s recommendations on how to reduce the need for an episiotomy.Make sure that your wishes are noted in the birth plan that the hospital staff will follow during the delivery. You will either develop this plan in your doctor’s office or during pre-admission.
During labor use a warm compress against the perineum to help the tissue to more easily stretch during delivery.
Ask your doctor if you can stand or squat to push. This places more pressure against the perineum, helping it to stretch.
Push for five to seven seconds gently while breathing through it in the initial stages of pushing which slows the delivery of the baby and gives the head more time to place pressure on the perineum and allow it to stretch.
Have your practitioner place gentle counter-pressure on the perineum during delivery so it doesn’t tear.

, You can also reduce the risk of needing to have an episiotomy by doing Kegel exercises throughout your pregnancy. Kegel exercises strengthen your pelvic floor muscles and get your body ready to deliver your child.Set aside a 5-10 minutes every day to perform Kegel exercises.

, In the final six to eight weeks before birth, perform a perineal massage once a day. This will help reduce the potential for tearing or the need for an episiotomy during birth. You can perform a perineal massage alone or with your partner.Lie on your back with your head against some pillows and your knees bent.
Massage a small amount of oil into the skin of the perineum. You can use a vegetable based oil or coconut oil to help soften the tissue and to help make it stretch.
Place your fingers around two inches inside your vagina and press downward toward the anus. Move your finger in a u-shape, stretching the skin between the vagina and anus. You may feel a tingling or burning sensation.
Hold this stretch for 30 to 60 seconds and then release. Do this stretch two to three times every time you do a perineal massage.

Hypoglycemia also can be caused by some medicines, especially ones used to treat diabetes. Do not change your diet before a trained medical professional rules out other causes and diagnoses you with reactive hypoglycemia., Your new diet should meet the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) in terms of the calories, proteins, minerals, and vitamins needed for a healthy adult.He can guide you as you add and remove foods from your diet. He will assist you with planning the content of your meals and snacks.

, Let others know about your diagnosis. Everyone can look out for symptoms like anxiety, irritability, hunger, sweating, shakiness, rapid heartbeat, fatigue, tingling around the mouth, dizziness, and hot flashes.Break your diet and eat sugary foods. The goal is to get your blood glucose back to a normal range as soon as possibleLet friends, family, and co-workers assist you with getting medical attention if you should develop symptoms of worsening hypoglycemia such as confusion, abnormal behavior, blurry vision, seizures, and a loss of consciousness. Let them know you may slur your words and make clumsy movements similar to an intoxicated person.You can become symptomatic for two reasons. Your body inappropriately begins the process of decreasing your blood glucose to unusually low levels after digesting food. In response to this stress, your body releases a rush of adrenaline, causing a fight-or-flight response.In addition, your body is being deprived of its major source of energy, glucose. The brain is very sensitive to this lack. You may experience an inability to perform normal tasks, changes in your mental status (how you think), or changes in your level of consciousness (how awake you are)., Simple carbohydrates are digested rapidly, causing a sharp increase in blood glucose which can trigger reactive hypoglycemia. Concentrated sweets mainly contain simple carbohydrates, also called simple sugars. You want to eat foods with a low glycemic index.Glycemic index offers information on how foods affects blood glucose and insulin. A lower number indicates a smaller effect.Read food labels looking for terms like sugar, honey, molasses, fructose, corn syrup, corn sweetener, and high-fructose corn syrup. Products like candy, cookies, cakes, fruit drinks, soft drinks, and ice cream are concentrated sweets which will have a high glycemic indexYou can use sugar substitutes like sucralose (Splenda), saccharin (Sweet’N Low), and aspartame (Equal) to replace table sugar. Read the labels on “sugar-free” foods, carefully. They may contain other ingredients which can raise your blood glucose too rapidly. Sugar substitutes may cause other health problems., Glucose enters the blood stream more slowly over a longer period time when these types of nutrients are eaten. Incorporate starch-containing foods like whole grain breads and pasta, potatoes, corn, and beans into your diet. Protein and healthy fats help to regulate blood sugar and prevent high blood sugar spikes followed by blood sugar dips (hypoglycemia). Fiber also does this. Protein can be found in animal sources as well as legumes (beans and peas), nuts, and seeds.Use complex carbohydrates and proteins as your major energy source. Complex carbohydrates are made up simple sugars connected together, like beads on a chain. These complex sugars are harder to digest. It takes a while for proteins to be converted into glucose in the body. This slower digestion is why your blood glucose levels rise in a more gradual fashion.Healthy fats should be a major energy source too. They maintain proper blood sugar levels and they also provide long satiety.

, Fiber is a non-digestible complex carbohydrate found in plants. The soluble type of fiber is found in legumes, oat products, and in fruit as pectin. When soluble fiber dissolves in water, it forms a sticky gel. Stomach emptying, digestion, and the absorption of glucose are delayed. Canned fruits with added sugars could lead to reactive hypoglycemia. Eat fresh fruit or canned fruits without added sugars.Insoluble fiber, like wheat bran, does not dissolve in water. It adds to bulk to the stool and helps keep your bowel movements regular.It could be a healthy part of your diet, but it will not help with the reactive hypoglycemia.

, The goal is to keep your blood glucose levels as even as possible. Experiment to see what works best for you. Make every meal well-balanced by eating complex carbohydrates, protein, and a fibrous food together. Snacks do not necessarily have to contain all three.Your options range from eating 3 larger meals a day with 3 healthy snacks or eating up to 6 smaller meals, evenly spaced throughout the day, with an evening snack., Both of these “drugs” can exacerbate the symptoms of reactive hypoglycemia. Alcohol lowers blood glucose levels. Caffeine stimulates the production of adrenaline.Do not counteract your efforts to prevent hypoglycemia. In some studies, the acute consumption of alcohol increased insulin secretion, thus decreasing blood glucose levels.Do not magnify your fight-or-flight symptoms (hunger, anxiety, sweating, rapid heartbeat, and faintness) by consuming caffeine., Excess weight has been shown to interfere with the body processes which control your blood glucose levels.Lose any excess weight with a healthy diet and exercise.


You can get an idea of your ideal by using body mass index (BMI), a screening tool used for body fatness or health. If you are 20 years or older, a healthy BMI is in the range of 18.5 to 24.9 . The formula is: weight (lb) / 2 X 703.It is best to consult a doctor when trying to lose weight.

Take recommended medications.,
Treat pain with injections.,
Splint your hands and/or wrists.,
Consider surgery for your affected hand.,
Attend after surgery hand therapy.",How to Care for Arthritic Hands1," Your doctor may recommend that you take certain medications on a regular basis to help reduce the inflammation and pain caused by the arthritis. Some of these medications, like ibuprofen (an anti-inflammatory), does not require a prescription and can be taken several times a day. The following medications have been known to relieve the pain and inflammation caused by arthritis:Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs — otherwise known as NSAIDs, these types of medication include ibuprofen (e.g Advil) and acetaminophen (e.g. Tylenol). Most NSAIDs are available in some form as over-the-counter medications, but you can also get a prescriptions for stronger versions of NSAIDS (i.e. Tylenol 3s and 4s, etc.)Corticosteroids — mainly used to control inflammation. These drugs are administered with an injection. Oral corticosteroids may be given for rheumatoid arthritis.Analgesics — target only pain relief and do not control inflammation and include acetaminophen (i.e. Tylenol). Analgesics are also available in a cream form (e.g. Voltaren) and can be rubbed into the skin around the area that’s painful. Low level analgesics (like regular strength Tylenol) and a variety of the cream versions, are available over-the-counter. Stronger versions of analgesics are available by prescription.Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs — otherwise known as DMARDs, these drugs actually work to modify your arthritis. DMARDs are available only by prescription.Biologic response modifiers — used mainly for rheumatoid arthritis, they work to block specific steps in the inflammation process of your body. Biologics are only available by prescription.Osteoporosis medications — help to slow bone loss or help to build new bone. There are a number of drugs that are used to treat osteoporosis and all are available only by prescription.;
, If anti-inflammatory medications are not successful, your doctor may recommend getting regular injections at the site of your arthritis. These injections usually include an anesthetic and a steroid, and they can last for several months.While you may find injections successful, they are only meant to be a temporary measure and cannot be continued indefinitely.

, Splints can also be used on your hands and wrists in addition to, or instead of, medication or injections. A splint will help support and stabilize your hand or wrist in order to reduce the stress placed upon it by certain activities.Splints are normally worn for a limited time every day, as opposed to all day, every day. Most arthritis sufferers tend to use splints when performing specific activities which may cause them more pain, such as typing, driving, painting, gardening, etc.

, Unfortunately medications and injections do not always work as well as we’d like. Another option to consider is hand surgery. The exact type of surgery will be catered to your specific situation, but the main goal of the surgery is to reduce the pain over the long-term.Surgery where the joint can be saved or reconstructed is always the first, and best, option. However, if it isn’t possible to save the joint as is, your doctor may perform a joint replacement or a fusion.
Fusing the joint(s) together can significantly reduce the amount of pain you experience, but it will permanently remove any movement you have in that joint. The fact that the joint cannot move is how the pain is eliminated, as the joint can no longer rub together.
Joint replacement involves replacing your original joint with a man-made joint. Man-made joints usually consist of plastic, metals or ceramic and can last a very long time. A joint replacement will not only eliminate the pain you’re experiencing, but it will allow you to continue to use your hand normally.

, No matter what type of surgery you may have, you will need to perform hand therapy (a type of physical therapy) afterwards. Initially after surgery you may be asked to wear a splint full-time in order to limit the movement of your hand while it heals. You may also need to change the activities you perform until your hand or wrist is strong enough.Most people can recommence normal activities approximately 3 months after surgery. However, the speed of your recovery is high dependent on the effort you put towards taking care of your hand or wrist.

See your doctor if you develop a rash or spotting on your skin.,
Treat a mild psoriasis flareup at home if you have seen and been diagnosed by a doctor in the past.,
Avoid things that trigger flareups of your psoriasis or make your symptoms worse.",How to Care for Psoriasis," The affected areas may be sore, tender or itchy, or you may not feel them at all.


Your doctor may prescribe topical creams you can apply to the affected areas. The most commonly prescribed topical applications include steroids, vitamin D, vitamin A, salicylic acid and tar applications.
A doctor may prescribe phototherapy in combination with topical ointments to deliver light to the skin where symptoms are present. Patients usually receive UV light therapy three times a week for three months. This combination method while taking topical treatment like vitamin D analogues has been proven to be effective and preferable by patients in numerous studies. For more information, researcher Griffith and his colleagues presented the specifics of these studies in 2000 in the article ""a systematic review of treatments for severe psoriasis"". Please contact a health professional for more information
Oral medications, such as methotrexate, acitretin and cyclosporine may be prescribed for psoriasis treatment.
A doctor may administer injectable therapies, including Amevive, Enbrel, Humira, Raptiva, and Remicade in more severe cases.;
, If a doctor is currently treating you, check with her before doing any treatments at home.


Carefully remove the crusty areas of skin by applying cream or lotion to soften and them, then gently pealing them off. The moisturizer will reach your skin better after they are removed.
Moisturize the effected area frequently using creams, lotions and moisturizing bath salts.
Expose your skin to the sun 20 minutes a day until the rash clears. Alternately, you could use a tanning bed.

, Known irritants include:


Injury to the skin, cuticles or nails may cause an outbreak in the area of the injury, or elsewhere on the body.
High levels of anxiety and stress may cause flareups and aggravate symptoms.
Infection anywhere in your body or on your skin.
Too much exposure to sunlight or sunburn. Although a small amount of ultraviolet light exposure helps treat psoriasis symptoms, damage caused by too much exposure increases your chances of developing psoriasis and worsens symptoms.
Alcohol aggravates symptoms.
Smoking increases the chances of psoriasis developing.

In fact, many arthritis sufferers usually experience more pain in cold environments and find keeping their hands or wrists warm all the time (e.g. wearing gloves) can help relieve pain.Wearing cotton gloves while you sleep can also help to keep your hands warm and may help reduce the amount of pain in your hands and wrists.Using a hot wax dip on your hands every morning can help start your hands off nice and warm every day. The hot wax can be kept in a crock pot and re-used many times.

, Arthritis in your hands will likely cause you not to be able to perform certain activities, such as: opening a tight lid on a jar, gripping something tightly, prying open a container, etc. There are many products on the market that can help make all those activities easier for you, especially if you don’t always have someone else around to help.The internet is usually your best source for determining what products are available and finding out where you can get them. Google “arthritis self-help devices” and research which products would be best for you.

, Glucosamine and chondroitin supplements can be found at most pharmacies and health stores. They have been shown to reduce the amount of pain and stiffness in people who have osteoarthritis, but they do not work on everyone. You may want to try taking these supplements for 2 months to see if they have a positive effect on your hand or wrist pain. If they do not give you any relief, there is no point in continuing to take them.Note that glucosamine and chondroitin manufacturers claim these supplements can help rebuild cartilage in your joints. However, there have been no scientific studies to confirm this is an accurate claim and these supplements are not approved by the FDA for that purpose.

, Omega-3, which can be found in many types of fish and in fish oil capsules, can potentially reduce the amount of inflammation in your body. While this doesn’t work for everyone, trying a fish oil supplement or adding more fish to your diet can be an option to try."

Know what creatinine is.,
Understand how the test works.,
Interpret your results.,
Understand why increased creatinine levels occur.",How to Bring Down High Creatinine Levels1," Creatinine is a waste product produced by the body when creatine, a metabolism substance that helps convert food into energy, breaks down.Usually, your kidneys help filter creatinine out of the blood. The waste product is then passed out of the body via urine.
High creatinine levels can indicate a problem with your kidneys.
High creatinine levels can be the result of regularly consuming a high amount of protein or partaking in strenuous exercise.
Creatine supplements may also increase levels of creatinine in blood and urine.;
, A creatinine test measures how much creatinine is in your blood.


Your doctor may also perform a creatinine clearance test, which measures the amount of creatinine in your urine. The amount in your blood should be low, and the amount in your urine should be high.
These tests only provide a ""snapshot"" of your kidney health. They only measure the amount of creatinine in your blood and urine from one-time samples taken within the past 24 hours.

, The normal range for creatinine levels will vary based on whether you are an adult male, adult female, teenager, or child. The value you should be at may vary further based on your age and body size, but there are general ranges you should shoot for.


Normal blood creatinine levels are:Men: 0.6 to 1.2 mg/dL; 53 to 106 mcmol/L
Women: 0.5 to 1.1 mg/dL; 44 to 97 mcmol/L
Teenagers: 0.5 to 1.0 mg/dL
Children: 0.3 to 0.7 mg/dL


Normal urine creatinine levels are:

Men: 107 to 139 mL/min; 1.8 to 2.3 mL/sec
Women: 87 to 107 mL/min; 1.5 to 1.8 mL/sec
Anyone above the age of 40: levels should drop by 6.5 mL/min for every additional 10 years of age



, There are several different reasons why you might have increased creatinine levels; some of these conditions are more severe than others, but all mean that you need to take steps to get your creatinine levels back to normal.


Renal failure or impairment: If your kidneys are damaged, they cannot filter creatinine out of your body through glomerular filtration as they are supposed to. Glomerular filtration is the outflow of filtered fluid passing through your kidney.
Muscle destruction: If you have a condition that causes the breakdown of your muscles, the broken down muscle tissue can get into your bloodstream and impair your kidneys.
High intake of meat: Eating a diet rich in cooked meat can increase the amount of creatinine in your body.
Hypothyroidism: Having a dysfunction in your thyroid gland can have an influence on your kidney function. Hypothyroidism can decrease your kidneys’ ability to properly filter waste out of your body.

Follow a balanced, healthy diet.,
Find foods rich in Vitamin A. Vitamin A can boost your immunity while reducing the risk for infection.You should look for foods that are high in this nutrient.,
Eat vegetables and fruits high in Vitamin C. Vitamin C is another important vitamin for immunity, but you can get enough of it from your diet without having to take a supplement.,
Increase your Vitamin D intake.,
Boost your iron levels.,
Consume at least 1500mg of calcium daily.",How to Build Up Your Immune System Before Surgery1," Eating a healthy, balanced diet as part of your normal lifestyle is ideal. However, if you are just looking to make some positive lifestyle changes before surgery to aid your recovery, then altering your diet is a great place to start.

Focus on eating whole foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and low-fat dairy products.
Reduce your intake of fried, processed, and sugary foods. Try to steer clear of fast food, baked goods, and snacks like chips and crackers.
Drink plenty of water. Cut back on sugary beverages, such as soda and juices. Instead, try to get most of your fluid intake from water. Aim for at least eight 8 ounce glasses of water daily.
Talk to your doctor for advice about how to improve your diet. Your doctor may be able to make specific recommendations based on your needs and diagnosis.;
, This includes:


Carrots
Sweet potatoes

You can do this by taking a vitamin or by eating Vitamin D rich foods. Good foods include fortified milk products, fortified cereals, and fatty fish such as salmon and tuna., Iron is essential to help your blood carry oxygen. Taking iron supplements before surgery may reduce your risk of needing a blood transfusion. This is particularly true with surgeries such as joint or hip replacement.You can take iron supplements once or twice a day.You can also eat iron rich foods such as:

Drink herbal tea or Green tea.,
Consider taking nettle leaf supplements.,
Talk to your doctor about salvia.",How to Bring Down High Creatinine Levels2," Certain types of herbal tea are believed to help lower the amount of creatinine in your blood. Studies supporting this benefit are limited, but the theory has not been disproved, either.


Drink around two 8-oz (250-ml) glasses of herbal tea each day.
Herbal teas worth checking out include chamomile, nettle leaf, dandelion root.
The idea is that these teas stimulate the kidneys and cause an increase in the production of urine. As such, more creatinine can be passed out of the body.

, Nettle leaf may help to increase your renal excretion, with will help to eliminate excess amounts of creatinine.Nettles contain histamines and flavonoids, which can help to increase the blood flow to your kidneys, thus increasing urine filtration.


Nettle leaves can be taken in the form of supplements or can be made into tea.

, Salvia is an herb that may increase your glomerular filtration rate, which helps to facilitate the elimination of creatinine. Salvia contains lithospermate B, which helps to promote renal function.Set up a meeting with your doctor to discuss the possible use of salvia. Do not take salvia without consulting your doctor.

Watch your fluid intake.,
Restrict your activity level.,
Sleep well.",How to Bring Down High Creatinine Levels3," As a general rule, you should drink six to eight 8-oz (250-ml) glasses of water each day. Dehydration can actually cause your creatinine levels to increase, so staying hydrated is important.


When you do not have enough fluid in your body, you produce less urine. Creatinine is washed out of your system through urine, so producing less urine will make it more difficult to flush out this toxin.
On the other hand, consuming too much fluid could also have a negative effect on your kidney functions. Too much fluid could cause an increase in blood pressure, and high blood pressure can put stress on your kidneys.
Unless otherwise instructed by a doctor, it is best to keep yourself hydrated but to avoid abnormal amounts of fluid intake.

, The body converts food into energy faster when it undergoes vigorous exercise. As a result, more creatinine is formed, causing the amount of creatinine build-up in your blood to increase.


Exercise can still offer important health benefits overall, so you may not want to exclude it from your routine completely. You should swap out high intensity exercises for low intensity ones, however. Instead of running, weight lifting, or playing basketball, try walking or practicing yoga.

, When you sleep, most of your bodily functions decrease. This includes the body's metabolism. As a result, the conversion of creatine to creatinine goes at a slower rate, allowing more of the creatinine already in your blood to filter out before additional toxins can build up.


Aim for six to nine hours of sleep per night, with seven or eight being an ideal amount.
Additionally, sleep deprivation can put physical stress on your entire body and force all of its parts to work harder to perform normal tasks. As a result, your kidneys can become stressed, which will decrease their ability to filter out creatinine.

Ask your doctor about stopping certain medications.,
Check into medications and supplements that may help.,
Take hypoglycemic medications.,
Lower your blood pressure with medication.,
Some antibiotics can be dangerous if taken incorrectly.,
Take medications targeted high creatinine levels.",How to Bring Down High Creatinine Levels4," There are some medications that have been associated with high creatinine levels. Medications that can damage the kidneys pose a possible threat, but some medications used to treat kidney disease can also cause a problem.


If you already have kidney problems, be cautious about medications, like ibuprofen, that can cause further kidney damage when used regularly.
ACE inhibitors and cyclosporine are both used to treat kidney disease but may cause creatinine levels to rise.Some nutritional supplements, like vanadium, can also cause an increase in creatinine levels and should be avoided.
Always talk to your doctor before stopping any medication. While some of these medications may cause creatinine to rise, the good could still outweigh the bad depending on why those medications were prescribed to begin with.

, Depending on the underlying cause of your elevated creatinine levels and on your overall health, your doctor may advise you to include certain medications or supplements to bring those levels down.


Most medications that treat creatinine levels also treat an underlying problem causing an increase in those levels, so your doctor will have to diagnose the underlying condition before you can determine which medication is right for you.

, One common cause of kidney damage, and thus elevated creatinine levels, is diabetes. If you have diabetes, it is very important to keep your insulin levels normal to prevent further kidney damage. There are certain medications that you can take to do this.


Repaglinide is a commonly prescribed hypoglycemic drug. The starting dose is normally 0.5 milligrams, administered before each meal. The maximum dose is 4 milligrams, also administered before a meal. Even if you happen to skip a meal, it is important to administer the drugs.

, Aside from diabetes, hypertension is another factor that can contribute to kidney damage. Keeping your blood pressure under control will also help to prevent further damage to your kidneys, thus helping to lower your creatinine levels.


Your doctor may prescribe benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide. Normal benazepril dosages are generally between 10 and 80 milligrams a day. The usual dosage of hydrochlorothiazide is between 12.5 and 50 milligrams a day., People with kidney disease need to take smaller amounts of antibiotics than people with healthy kidneys.

, Ketosteril is often prescribed to reduce levels of creatinine found in the bloodstream. Talk to your doctor about this medication and if it may be right for you. The regular dose is generally 4 to 8 tablets taken three time a day, at each meal.Other creatinine lowering drugs include:


Alpha lipoic acid (antioxidants) supplements can be used to help energize the kidneys and neutralize toxins, including creatinine. You can usually take around 300 mg each day.Chitosan is a weight management supplement that can also reduce the amount of creatinine in the blood. Benefits are usually reached when you take between 1000 and 4000 mg per day.

Address and treat the underlying problem.,
Research cold laser therapy.,
Use massage therapy.,
Learn about blood purification therapy.,
Consider alternative medicine.,
Consider dialysis as a final option.",How to Bring Down High Creatinine Levels5," High creatinine levels are rarely an independent problem. More often than not, this issue is a symptom of something more serious. To drop the levels permanently and improve your overall health, work with your doctor to find the underlying problem and remedy that.


Kidney damage and chronic kidney disease are the most common causes. This damage can be caused by illness, potentially fatal infections, shock, cancer, or low blood flow.
Type 2 diabetes is also linked to high creatinine levels.
Other possible causes include heart failure, dehydration, excessive blood loss leading to shock, gout, physically strenuous exercise, muscle injuries, muscle disorders, and burns.

, Some evidence suggests that cold laser or low level laser therapy can revitalize the kidneys and improve their overall functioning abilities. As a result, your kidneys become more capable of filtering out creatinine naturally.When used on the adrenal glands above the kidneys, cold lasers can also help reduce stress and improve sleep.
When used on the Vagus nerve in your neck, cold lasers may help improve the circulation of blood to various organs, including the kidneys.

, Massage therapy also will help blood circulation and reduce stress levels, which leads to pleasant sleep and relaxation.

, While somewhat uncommon, someone who has severe kidney damage and consistently high creatinine levels may wish to consider blood purification therapy, a.k.a. hemodialysis or dialysis. The therapy is a bit extreme, but it can be very effective.


During the treatment, your blood will be extracted and filtered through a machine. This machine removes creatinine and other toxins in the blood. Once cleaned, the blood is circulated back into the body., In particular, learn about Micro-Chinese Medicine Osmotherapy. This therapy is based on traditional Chinese medicine and may help reverse minor kidney damage. Medicated baths may also help and are also rooted in traditional Chinese medicine.


With Micro-Chinese Medicine Osmotherapy, traditional Chinese medicines are prescribed based on an individual patient's condition. Some of these medications are applied externally, while others are applied internally via an osmoscope.Medicated baths can improve blood circulation. This causes the body to warm up and produce sweat. Creatinine and other toxins can then be removed from the body via the sweat.

, If diet changes and medication do not lower your creatinine levels, talk to your doctor about dialysis. There are two types of dialysis, but the one used to lower creatinine levels is called hemodialysis.Hemodialysis involves using a machine to filter out waste, fluid, and salt from your blood so that your damaged kidneys do not have to.

There are many different ways that you can manage stress. Find something that works for you.

Try taking a long relaxing bath after a long busy day.
Call up a supportive friend or family member when you are feeling overwhelmed and talk about what is bothering you.
Try yoga, tai chi, or meditation.
Do deep breathing exercises or progressive muscle relaxation.
Avoid using alcohol, nicotine, or drugs to deal with stress. This will have a negative effect on your body’s ability to heal itself.

, Music may relax the listener and reduce stress, both of which are vital in improving your immune system. Listening to calm, instrumental music in the days leading up to surgery may help with your recovery. You may also try doing social musical activities, such as drum circles or singing groups., Patients who receive a series of acupuncture treatments prior to surgery may recover faster and with less pain.This is because acupuncture may be able to boost white blood cell activity. You can try to schedule two to three sessions in the weeks before your surgery.

, Sleep is the body's way of rejuvenating itself. In the weeks leading up to your surgery, make sure that you get plenty of sleep to reinforce your immune system. Aim for at least seven to eight hours of rest a night., Exercise may increase your white blood cell count. It may also prevent bacteria growth and lower stress. If you are inactive, you should start a moderate exercise program by working out every two to three days. If you exercise regularly already, you may not need to change your routine before going into surgery.Good examples of moderate exercise include:


Biking
Twenty to thirty minute walks
Running on the treadmill
Yoga

, While it is best for you to quit smoking entirely, you should at the very least avoid smoking for a week before you go into surgery. Smoking can interfere with your recovery by delaying wound healing and increasing your chances of infection.

Always consult with your doctor on your diet and habits before surgery. Some questions you may want to ask your doctor:


“Can I take all of my normal medications this week?”
“Are there any foods or supplements that might interfere with my surgery?”
“How should I prepare to heal after the surgery?”
“At what point should I stop eating and drinking?”
“Should I take my medication the morning of the surgery? If so, how should I take it?”, Between one and two weeks before your surgery, you should stop all natural herbal and vitamin supplements unless otherwise directed by your doctor.Ask your doctor specifically if you should do this. Some immune-boosting supplements such as calcium, iron, and vitamin D may still be taken with a doctor's approval.You should avoid certain herbs that may increase your chance of bleeding, such as:


Turmeric
Willow Bark
Chamomile
Cod Liver Oil, Depending on the type of surgery you have, you may not be able to wash properly for days. While nurses may give you a sponge bath, you should probably wash yourself the night before you go into surgery to help ensure that you are clean., Your doctor may tell you to stop eating and drinking after midnight the day of your surgery. This is to avoid complications with your anesthesia. In many cases, however, you may be allowed to drink clear liquids up to two hours beforehand. This liquid diet will provide some energy and sustenance before your surgery.This is to prevent you from going on a total fast, which may hurt your immune system.Some good clear liquids include:


Water
Gatorade
Broth
Ginger ale
Seltzer
Apple, cranberry, or grape juice. Avoid citrus drinks, prune juice, or any juice with pulp.Your doctor may recommend carbohydrate rich drinks such as Ensure or Pedialyte. In certain, specific medical cases, these drinks can boost the immune system before surgery."

Never swallow the solution since drinking salt water isn’t safe. If using this method with a child, make sure he or she can gargle without choking as well., Drinking plenty of water helps for several reasons. Plenty of liquids will help thin the congestion-causing mucus, moisten and soothe your sore throat, and prevent dehydration if your flu symptoms include vomiting.If you have a “stomach flu” that includes vomiting and diarrhea, stick to water and sports drinks (such as Gatorade) to help replace lost electrolytes.For young children, use specific fluid and electrolyte replacement options (such as Pedialyte) instead of sports drinks.For a cold, you can also drink juice and clear broth in addition to the above options.Men should aim for 13 cups of water each day, whereas women should aim to drink nine., You should avoid both caffeine and alcohol while you’re sick. These fluids are both diuretics, which means that they can actually make dehydration worse instead of hydrating you., Both the common cold and the flu are caused by viruses. Your immune system will fight off the viruses on its own, but one of the best ways to help your immune system is with lots of rest.Take time off from school or work to stay home and get additional hours of sleep.

, A humid environment can also help to thin and break up mucus, relieving congestion and soothing a sore throat in the process. Take a nice hot shower to take advantage of this natural decongestant option.

, You can also add moisture to the air around you at home by using a vaporizer or humidifier. This will help reduce congestion similar to the way a shower can.Choose a cool mist setting, and make sure that you clean the apparatus daily since it can potentially breed mold or bacteria that make your symptoms worse., To help reduce cough and sore throat symptoms, you can also take OTC lozenges or use throat sprays.These products are safe to use in conjunction with other cold and flu medicines, and they can help relieve the sore throat irritation that causes coughing.

, In addition to the numerous other health complications due to smoking, it can also worsen and prolong cold symptoms because the smoke will irritate your throat.In addition to avoiding smoking, you should reduce your exposure to other throat irritants, including secondhand smoke, fumes, air pollution, etc., Children should see a doctor for a fever of 103°F (39.4°C) or higher.Additionally, adults and children both should see a doctor for any fever lasting longer three days or one that doesn’t respond to an OTC fever reducer., If your “stomach flu” symptoms include severe vomiting and diarrhea that make it hard to keep down even fluids, then you should see a doctor immediately.Dehydration and the loss of other necessary vitamins and minerals due to vomiting and diarrhea is a serious complication. If necessary, a hospital can take additional steps to help keep you hydrated.

, If you have a young child suffering from flu symptoms, then keep an eye out for a bluish pallor to the child’s skin.This indicates a drop in oxygen levels, which is a sign that the child is having difficulty breathing. Seek immediate medical attention if your child displays this symptom.

, Most people fully recover from a cold or flu within about two weeks. If your symptoms persist without improving (or even get worse) for ten days, then you should see your doctor.This may indicate a different cause to your symptoms, or your doctor may have to prescribe antiviral medications to help your immune system beat the infection.

, If you have any trouble breathing including laboring to breathe or shrugging shoulders when breathing, signs of wheezing for breath, or shortness of breath, then you should contact your doctor.These symptoms can be an indication that the cold or flu has led to a worse infection such as pneumonia or bronchitis, which will require intervention from your doctor to help you get over the symptoms.

, If the cold or flu turns into an actual ear or sinus infection, you may notice an earache or ear drainage.This is a sign of a bacterial rather than a viral infection, which will require a prescription for antibiotics.

, If you experience any confusion, disorientation, fainting, or other altered mental state, then you should see your doctor.This can be a complication due to high fever, dehydration, or another cause for concern due to your flu symptoms.

, One of the single best steps you can take to avoid a flu infection is to get an annual flu vaccine.This yearly vaccine will protect you against several different strains that medical experts expect to be prevalent during the coming flu season. You can get a flu vaccine at your doctor’s office or even most local pharmacies.


Unfortunately, flu vaccines don’t protect against the common cold, and they don’t guarantee protection against all flu strains, but they still significantly reduce your risk of infection.

, Frequently washing your hands with warm, soapy water is the best way to kill cold and flu germs.If you’re sick, it’ll help you not to spread the virus, and it’ll help you avoid contracting the virus if you’re not already sick.

, Items that directly contact your mouth (such as cups and utensils) are a direct method of transmission for the cold and flu virus. Sharing these items with a sick person is a sure way to contract the illness. If you’re sick, avoid sharing them with others as well to decrease their chances of getting sick.


For young children, this also means cleaning toys, pacifiers, and similar items often since they regularly end up in the child’s mouth., Coughing and sneezing sends particles of the virus into the air to infect other people. It’s one of the leading ways that people contract cold and flu viruses. You should cover your mouth any time you cough or sneeze. Experts advise covering your mouth with your sleeve or your elbow instead of your hands.If you must use your hands, wash them well with warm, soapy water afterward.

, Studies have shown that taking vitamin C once you’re already sick has a minimal effect on the virus. However, taking vitamin C before the onset of a cold or flu virus may help shorten the duration of your illness.By staying up on your vitamin C requirement, you may help reduce the length of time you’re sick.

, If you are healthy but must be around a person with the flu, then you can also take an antiviral medication that decreases your risk of infection. Taken right away, antiviral drugs can reduce your risk between 70 and 90 percent.These drugs come in the form of pills, liquids, or inhalers and require a prescription. Common options include oseltamivir (Tamiflu), zanamivir (Relenza), amantadine (Symmetrel), and rimantadine (Flumadine)."

Keep an eye on your protein intake.Avoid foods that are rich in protein as much as possible.,
Increase your consumption of plant-based foods.,
Avoid phosphorus-rich foods.,
Limit the amount of potassium you consume.,
Stay away from creatine supplements.",How to Bring Down High Creatinine Levels6," Excessive sodium can cause an unhealthy amount of fluid retention and may result in high blood pressure. Both of these issues could result in high creatinine levels.


Maintain a low-sodium diet. Stay away from salty foods and drinks, and opt for low-sodium versions of common food products (canned soup, bottled sauces, etc.) when available.
Your daily average range of sodium intake should be between 2 to 3 grams per day, if not lower., Red meat and dairy products can be especially bad for you.


Dietary sources of creatine are most commonly obtained through animal products. While these amounts are not usually harmful, they can pose a problem for someone already dealing with abnormally high creatinine.
Note that you do need protein in your diet to maintain adequate amounts of energy and keep your bodily functions running smoothly, so you should not cut it out completely.
When you do consume protein, try to obtain it from plant-based sources, like nuts and other legumes.

, Vegetarian diets are often recommended to bring down high levels of creatinine and reduce the risk of kidney disease due to high blood pressure or diabetes. Eat foods rich in vitamin C such as berries, lemon juice, parsley and cauliflower., Your kidneys may have a hard time processing phosphorus-rich foods, particularly if you have high creatinine levels.Because of this, you should try to avoid foods like:


Pumpkin and squash, cheese, fish, shellfish, nuts, pork, low fat dairy products, and soybeans.

, When dealing with kidney issues, try to avoid eating foods with a high amount of potassium because that potassium can accumulate in the body if your kidneys cannot process it correctly.Foods that are rich in potassium include:


Dried fruits, bananas, spinach, potatoes, beans, and peas.

, Since creatinine is a waste product of creatine, taking creatine supplements will result in a greater build-up of creatinine in your blood.


For the average person, this is not much of an issue. If you are an athlete or bodybuilder taking nutritional supplements to improve your performance, though, creatine might be included in these supplements and should be cut out.

Buy only whey-free soy protein powders for workout purposes.,
Embrace other sources of protein.",How to Avoid Whey to Alleviate Lactose Intolerance," As a substitute for cow’s or goat’s milk, try purchasing a plant-based milk. Almond milk, coconut milk, cashew milk, and soy milk have all become more popular and easier to find in recent years. Many people find these to be healthy and tasty alternatives for dairy milk; plus, they are more friendly to the environment.


If you want dairy milk, try the Lactaid brand. Lactaid products are natural dairy products, but they include the enzyme lactase, which breaks down lactose so you can digest the dairy in their products.
Lactaid makes milk, cottage cheese, and ice cream, and can be found in most grocery stores.;
, Popular ice cream manufacturers, such as Ben & Jerry’s and Haagen-Dazs, make dairy-free sorbet that are sure to be an enjoyable sweet treat without causing the digestive issues inspired by dairy ice-creams.


Try a plant-based alternative, like coconut milk or soy milk ice creams.
Be aware of sherbet vs. sorbet. While it sounds similar to sorbet, sherbets often contain milk or cream.If you're not sure, check the ingredients list
Find dairy-free sorbet options at your local ice cream store. Many stores have dairy-free sorbet options on their menus. If you don’t see them on the menu, ask!

, You can find yogurt made out of soy, almonds, and rice, which are high in vitamins B and E as well as potassium, antioxidants, and dietary fibers in most grocery stores.As a bonus, these are also vegan-friendly treats!


Choose a yogurt with a milk-like base (such as a nut or grain milk) as well as one that contains active or live cultures, so you reap all the benefits of eating a healthy snack like yogurt.Other things you may want to look for in your yogurt is one that is low fat, and has a good source of calcium. In addition, it contains live and active cultures, which is one key reason for including yogurt in your diet.
Remember that Greek yogurt has very little or no whey. Greek yogurt is traditionally made by straining the yogurt to remove the whey.. Always read the ingredients list before purchasing Greek yogurt, because there are no steadfast regulations on what actually constitutes “Greek” yogurt.

, While “dairy-free cheese” may sound like an oxymoron, it is actually possible to find. Many dairy-free cheese are made with cashews or other nuts, but there are also several nut-free options.Do a search for “zucchini cheese” on Google. It is possible to make a dairy-free and nut free cheese using zucchini! There are many recipes available online for making zucchini cheese, and most require little more than zucchini, water, coconut oil, lemon juice, gelatin, yeast, and sea salt., This is one of the most important parts of handling a lactose intolerance because many of the terms used on our food, such as “dairy-free,” do not have regulatory definitions with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Thus, while they probably do not contain animal milk, they may still contain lactose and/or whey.


Look for products that are explicitly vegan. You can assume that these products do not contain whey.
If you are unable to check a label, opt for products labeled “lactose-free.” Though this does not guarantee the absence of whey, it makes it highly unlikely that the product will contain whey protein (which is a protein derived from milk).

, Whey can be present in many forms and in products that don’t seem to be associated with dairy. In order to completely avoid whey to alleviate lactose intolerance, it is important to check the ingredients of any and all foods that you consume. Here are some example foods to be careful of:


Breads: whey is a common preservative in many brands of bread.Check the ingredients of your bread carefully!
Breadcrumbs: whey can be found in prepared breadcrumbs. It is better to substitute traditional prepared breadcrumbs with panko breadcrumbs, which are dairy-free.Spice mix: whey powder is sometimes an ingredient in spice mixes! Look for “whey protein concentrate” in premixed spice packets. Whey protein concentrate often contains concentrated lactose that can trigger the uncomfortable digestive issues of lactose intolerance.Protein bars: whey can be found in soy protein bars (usually found as whey protein or whey protein isolates).It is important to pay attention to these ingredients!
Whey is also found in flavored potato chips, frozen dinners, and fruit-based gummies. The important point is to never neglect ingredient labels, no matter how dairy-free the food may seem!

, There are some terms for dairy-based ingredients that you may not recognize as indicating the presence of dairy. It is important to become familiar with these terms. In the case of a moderate to severe lactose intolerance, you may want to carry a list that has these ingredients listed. Here are some common whey and dairy-based ingredients, including some that you may not recognize:


Whey can be written as sweet whey, whey protein, whey powder, whey protein concentrate, delactosed whey, demineralized whey, or whey protein hydrolysate.The important thing to remember is that these products are all whey!
Dairy ingredients often include common terms such as milk, casein, ghee, and cream.
Some less recognizable dairy ingredients include iron caseinate, lactalbumin, paneer, recaldent, rennet casein, and zinc caseinate., Most products that are promoted for protein content are likely to contain whey, which is a highly digestible form of protein for most individuals.


Many sources of whey may be hidden in other protein sources, particularly in products aimed at building muscle or controlling weight. It is important to be aware of this fact before purchasing any protein powders.

, Protein powders made of soy, brown rice, hemp, pea, and egg proteins are often safe for those with lactose intolerance provided they do not also contain whey protein. There are a plethora of vegan protein powders that are whey free.


Try MRM Veggie Elite protein powder, Vega One nutritional shakes, or S.A.N. Raw fusion for a protein boost that is guaranteed to be whey-free., Getting enough protein in your diet is an important part of a healthy lifestyle: women are encouraged to get about 46 grams of protein a day, while men are encouraged to get about 56 grams. If you suffer from lactose intolerance and need to avoid whey, you are in luck because there are many tasty alternatives to whey protein.


Eat green peas. One cup of green peas contains as much protein as a cup of milk.Try quinoa. This tasty grain contains more than 8 grams of protein per cup and includes all the essential amino acids that the body needs for growth and repair.Choose nuts and nut butter. Nuts contain protein as well as healthy fats; choose varieties that are raw or dry roasted for an extra healthy option.Eat lentils, which contain 9 grams of protein per half cup and lots of fiber as well.If you’re feeling adventurous, try spirulina. This is a blue-green algae that can be added to a smoothie along with other ingredients (like bananas or berries). It provides 4 grams of protein in one tablespoon and also gives you 80% of your daily iron needs."

Understand the benefits of reducing your caffeine intake gradually.,
Decide how much caffeine you're going to cut back on each day.,
Substitute your caffeine intake with healthier choices.,
Get enough rest during the withdrawal period.,
Take paracetamol to decrease pain.,
Take naproxen sodium to alleviate pain.",How to Avoid Caffeine Withdrawal Headaches," Headaches are almost always the primary complaint of people trying to cut caffeine from their diet.


The pain associated with this kind of headaches is characterized as radiating and dull and it can last for a few hours to days.
Since your body was used to high level of caffeine, it will react to any situation where there is sudden decrease of this substance.;
, Caffeine is a substance known as a vaso-constrictor, this means that is decreases the diameter of your veins.


When caffeine runs through the blood vessels, it causes the veins to constrict or narrow. This explains why people who regularly drink coffee will eventually have high blood pressure.
When you stop taking caffeine, the veins that were constantly constricted will open up. This increase in the blood vessels' diameter leads to an increased blood supply to the brain. This sudden gush of blood to the brain causes headaches., While coffee might be the most common source of caffeine, it is only one of the thousands of food and drink products available today that contain caffeine.


The most common sources of caffeine are energy drinks, chocolate, sodas, gum, ice cream, soft drinks, teas, and others. The best way to determine whether a food or drink product contains caffeine is to read the label.
Some medications also contain caffeine. These drugs include Dexatrim (weight control drug) and pain relievers such as Excedrin, Anacin and Midol., While it might be difficult to identify exactly how much caffeine is in each drink or piece of food you consume, you should at least try to estimate.


Knowing how much caffeine you normally consume will help you to avoid headaches in the future.
The information you acquire from keeping records will assist you in determining how much caffeine you should cut down on each day.

, On average, an ounce of pure liquid coffee contains around 500 mg of caffeine. Other common sources of caffeine include the following:


Energy drinks contain about 400 mg of caffeine; sodas contain 30 mg; iced tea contains 40 mg; creamy lattes contain 100 mg; and Diet Coke contains 45 mg.
Read the label to find out the exact caffeine content of a food or drink. If you cannot find this information, but you know caffeine is present, just take note of total amount you ate or drank., Headaches can easily be avoided if you reduce your caffeine intake slowly.


Even though you might be so motivated to start your healthy living that you cut out caffeine cold turkey, taking this approach will only lead to withdrawal symptoms such as headaches.
It's much better to cut down on caffeine little by little to allow your body to adjust to the reduced caffeine intake and decrease your chance of headaches.

, Every person is unique, so your tolerance for caffeine might be very different to someone else's. Thus, deciding the amount of caffeine you need to cut down on each day is a personal choice.


However, the ideal progression is to cut out ¼ of a whole cup of caffeinated drink for every 3-5 days. This will give your body enough time to adjust.
However, it's important to remember that it is not only coffee or tea that contains caffeine. This is where your list will come in handy. Whatever food or drink you are taking, the main objective is to progressively cut down your intake. So if you are a chocolate addict, then eating a little less chocolate each day will do the trick.

, Withdrawing from caffeine does not mean that you will not be able to enjoy a warm coffee each day. While you are avoiding caffeine, you can look for healthier alternatives.


You can opt for decaffeinated varieties of coffee, drinks and food. Just remember that you should always be on the lookout for the possibility that you are still taking in caffeine, only in different form.
One strategy for decreasing your caffeine intake is to mix caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee. For example, you can use ¾ of caffeinated and ¼ of decaffeinated coffee for your first week. Then during the second week, you can use ½ of caffeinated and decaffeinated mixture of coffee.
During the third week, you can use ¼ of caffeinated and ¾ of decaffeinated coffee. Then you can switch to using an entirely decaffeinated formula of coffee. After another week, you may be able to stop drinking decaffeinated coffee altogether., Headaches can also be avoided with plenty of rest during the withdrawal period.


Coffee gives you extra energy because of its stimulant properties. However, if you try to cut down on coffee, you might experience tiredness and headaches.
Getting plenty of rest (at least 8 hours sleep a night) will decrease the possibility of headaches.

, Paracetamol does not contain caffeine, so it is okay to take it at this time. Paracetamol falls within the family of acetaminophen, which is a common drug used in relieving pain.


The main mechanism of this drug is to block pain signals and prevent them from reaching pain receptors in the brain. This drug does not lead to addiction, in contrast with narcotics.
Take 325 to 650 mg of paracetamol every 4 to 6 hours. It is recommended that you take this drug with food to prevent a stomach upset., This is an over-the-counter pain reliever that falls within the family of NSAIDs or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.


The main action of this drug is to suppress hormones that cause inflammation. By decreasing inflammation, pain is also decreased.
Avoid taking naproxen sodium if you have a known allergy to aspirin or other NSAIDs drug. The initial dose of this drug is 550 mg by mouth and followed by another 550 mg every 12 hours."

Offer assistance for various tasks such as paying bills, eating, toileting, bathing and dressing.
Arrange items such as remotes, tissues, wash cloths and wastebasket for easy access.
Ask to open blinds or curtains to brighten the room.
Organize the bedroom as close to the bathroom as possible and maintain a clear path from the bed.

, This is critical for an individual living with HIV/AIDS. Infections or germs can cause serious illness. A bacteria free environment is critical when assisting with personal care, food preparation and household tasks to prevent the person from becoming sick.


Wash your hands frequently. Hand washing should also be done anytime you sneeze, cough, handle trash or touch around your mouth and nose.
Wear disposable gloves during personal care and handling laundry.
Bandage any cuts or wounds you have.
Stay away until you are healthy if you become ill with shingles or impetigo.
Wash fresh produce when preparing meals.

Avoid forcing a conversation when the person appears preoccupied mentally.
Offer to listen if he or she may wish to talk.
Discuss topics in the news, television or books.
Touch them. Hand holding or hugging offers comfort and acceptance. Respect the person's request if they prefer not to be touched.
Go places together if the person is well enough. Take a trip to the store, museum, park or a short walk. Fresh air and sunshine can be healthy if just sitting on the patio.

, Your health and well-being are also important while caring for an individual with HIV/AIDS. Being at your best will instill confidence in the care you provide. The person you are caring for will feel good that you make a conscious effort to stay healthy in his or her environment.

Maintain regular prenatal visits.,
Get tested for B strep in your third trimester.,

Keep in mind that there is no way to prevent group B strep in adults.,
Recognize the importance of receiving antibiotics.,
Do not rely on oral antibiotics prior to labor.,
Ask your healthcare professional about your options.,
Accept treatment with antibiotics during labor.",How to Avoid Prenatal B Strep Infection," Seeking prenatal care early and continuing with your prenatal visits throughout your entire pregnancy will help to increase your chances of having a healthy baby. Your doctor will screen you for Strep B during your third trimester, and during this trimester you will need to see your doctor about once every two to four weeks.If you have not yet had a prenatal checkup, then schedule one right away. You should start prenatal visits during your first trimester, but it is never too late — it is essential that you have some prenatal care before you deliver.
If you have to miss an appointment, then reschedule it.;
, Getting tested for B strep is a normal part of prenatal care. You will be tested around your 35th through 37th week of pregnancy. If you test negative, then no extra precautions will be necessary. If you test positive for B strep, then you will receive IV antibiotics during labor.


The test is easy. Your physician will just need to swab your vagina and rectum. Then, the swabs will be sent to the lab and the results should be available from the lab within 48 hours.You may even be able to do the swabs at home on your own, though it is usually best to have these culture done under clinical supervision to make sure they are accurate.Most obstetricians and midwives offer testing for B strep beginning the 35th week of pregnancy, although you can obtain one earlier if you are concerned. It is not standard procedure to have these tests before the third trimester.

, Some women are at high-risk because they have already had a baby that contracted B strep, but there are also some symptoms that may indicate you are at high-risk of delivering a baby with B strep. Symptoms to watch for may include:Having a fever during labor.
Going into labor early or rupturing membranes before 37 weeks.
Having a labor that lasts longer than 18 hours.
Having a urinary tract infection due to B strep prior to labor.

, Although there are things you can do to reduce your baby's chance of getting group B strep, it cannot be prevented in adults. There is no vaccine available and no special precautions that you can take;however, the infection is usually harmless, so you probably will not need to worry about it.

, Do not assume that because B strep is harmless in your body that it will not harm your baby. Group B strep may cause sepsis or meningitis in babies and may also cause pneumonia, all of which can be debilitating or deadly in infants. A baby that contracts group B strep may also suffer from kidney problems, gastrointestinal problems, difficulty breathing, and unstable blood pressure and/or heart rate.Keep in mind that not all mothers who have group B strep will pass it on, but antibiotics helps to reduce the chance of passing on the infection.
Make sure your pediatrician knows that you are group B strep positive during pregnancy so that the doctor can watch out for any sign or symptoms of infection in the infant.

, A previous course of antibiotics may reduce the B strep bacteria for a short time, but it will not protect your baby during labor. B strep can live in your body and you may carry it regardless of whether you were previously treated with antibiotics or herbal remedies.


If you tested positive for B strep prior to or during your pregnancy and followed up with a course of antibiotics, it is possible the infection may have returned prior to delivery.If you are group B strep positive in the period just before delivery it is imperative that you receive antibiotics during delivery.

, Depending on the type of delivery you have, your options to avoiding passing B strep to your baby may vary.


If you have a planned surgical delivery due to particular health needs, you may not need IV antibiotics for yourself or your baby unless you naturally go into labor before the operation begins; however, some doctors will still give IV antibiotics even if you are having a caesarean section.If you intend to deliver vaginally, you may be started on antibiotics as soon as labor begins to prevent your baby from becoming infected by coming into contact with the bacteria in vaginal fluids.
If you are allergic to penicillin or another antibiotic, be sure your medical team is aware so that they can offer an alternative antibiotic in the IV fluid or treatment they provide. If it is a non-serious penicillin allergy you may use cefazolin. If it is more serious allergy with systemic implications then clindamycin is used.

, If you tested positive for B strep, then you will need to have antibiotics via an IV during labor. This will reduce the chance of passing a possible B strep infection to your child from 1 in 200 to 1 in 4,000.If you do not know the results of your B strep test or if you were unable to get tested prior to delivery, most healthcare professionals will opt to treat you with antibiotics during labor to be safe.

To help minimize your risk, be completely honest with your physician and the nursing staff about any symptoms, previous hospitalizations, recent surgeries, drug use, medications, and medical conditions you have.Alert your doctor to any hospitalizations in other countries. Most of the cases of CRE come from outside of the US.A CRE infection can kill you, so do not be embarrassed or reluctant to share.;
, When you are prescribed medications, make sure to take them exactly as prescribed. This is especially important for antibiotics. Do not stop taking them because you feel better — take the full course to ensure you eradicate the bacteria and reduce the chances of developing a resistance to your antibiotics.Ask questions if you are not sure how to take any medications.

, You should expect all physicians, nurses, and healthcare providers to wash their hands before and after touching your body in any way. This protects not only you, but also others. If they do not do this, remind them and insist on watching them wash their hands.Watch to make certain that all healthcare personnel are using sterile gloves and are disposing of them after use.

, When you are being treated at a healthcare facility, working at a healthcare facility, or visiting a healthcare facility, make certain you wash your hands often before eating, before and after using the bathroom, and after performing any personal hygiene activities.Wash your hands for at least 20 second with warm water and soap.

See a doctor.",How to Avoid Hypoglycemia1," The best way to prevent hypoglycemia to know what to look for. While hypoglycemia is often associated with diabetes, hypoglycemic symptoms can be triggered by missing meals, increasing your physical activity, or drinking too much alcohol. Symptoms can appear up to 24 hours following these activities. Symptoms include:


Hunger
Shakiness
Anxiety
Sweating
Dizziness
Lightheadedness
Fatigue
Physical weakness
Convulsions;
, If you can determine if you are functional or reactive, you can better avoid hypoglycemia. Functional hypoglycemia occurs if there is abnormal glucose regulation in your body; the source of this dysfunction may not be known. Reactive hypoglycemia occurs as a response to your diet or stress.Functional hypoglycemia can be controlled by medication whereas reactive hypoglycemia can be prevented by changes in diet or lifestyle.

, Some medicines can trigger hypoglycemia, including insulin injections, certain antidepressants, and malaria drugs.Research your medication for potential side effects and speak with your doctor to understand your risk.

, If you are at risk for diabetes or suspect you have a different hypoglycemic condition, you may ask your doctor for a glucose tolerance test (GTT). You may be asked to fast for 8 hours before a blood sample is drawn and tested. Urine tests can also be used to detect glucose-related conditions., For ten days, record everything you eat and drink (including medication) as well as what time of day you consume them. As you go about your day, record the time and severity of any hypoglycemic symptoms you may feel. If you notice that you are repeatedly suffering symptoms or crashes after consuming a particular food or drink, eliminate that item from your diet for a few days and see if you improve. If you suspect your medication is responsible, consult your doctor for advice but do not stop taking it until you are advised to do so., If you have more than one hypoglycemic episode a week, you may want to see a doctor for testing or medication. Furthermore, if you suddenly suffer from poor coordination, blurred vision, or slurred speech, you may be on the verge of a severe hypoglycemic episode. Seek emergency treatment at a hospital. Severe hypoglycemia can cause fainting and seizures as well as life-threatening damage to your heart and brain."

This means antibiotics won’t help since antibiotics don’t treat viruses.Only take antibiotics when you need them, like when you have a bacterial infection.
Again, always take the full course of antibiotics prescribed. A common trend that creates resistant bacteria is to take the medicine until you feel better and to ""save the rest"" for another time. This creates opportunity for the few bacteria that might still be in your body to mutate and become resistant to the same antibiotic. It's always best to take the full course, no matter when you feel better, to make sure the infection is completely cleared.

, Washing your hands before and after activities is one of the most effective ways to reduce the spreading of germs, including the Phantom Menace bacteria.Wash your hands before and after using the bathroom, cooking, or handling any food. Wash your hands before and after touching anything that has come into contact with anyone who may be sick.Wash your hands, especially after coughing, sneezing, or blowing your nose.

, To protect yourself, make sure to wash your hands properly. Use plenty of soap and water. Make sure the water is warm and that you don’t rush through it.Start by wetting your hands and using enough soap to cover your entire hand up to at least your wrists.
Rub your hands together, making sure to wash the back of your left hand with the palm of your right and vice versa. Make sure to spread your fingers and wash the webs between the fingers. Scrub for at least 20 seconds.
Interlock your fingers so that the backs of the fingers are against the palm of the opposite hand and rub. Grab your right thumb with your left hand and wash, using circular motions, then repeat using your right hand to grab your left thumb.
Rinse well with warm water. Then dry your hands thoroughly with either a single paper towel or a clean cotton towel. Don’t use a dirty, used, or soiled towel. Only use a towel that is reserved for your use.
Use the towel to turn off the water and to open any doors.

, If you are in a situation in which you are unable to properly wash your hands, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 62% alcohol., You should refrain from sharing objects with people that could possibly be infected.Do not share any personal care items, such as razors, towels, cosmetics, or handkerchiefs.
Do not touch any potentially infected objects. This includes kleenex, towels, clothing, bandages, and athletic equipment. If you have to touch them, only do so if you are wearing gloves.

, Wearing masks, or asking others to wear masks, can reduce the spread of bacteria. If someone near you has a cough, cold, is sneezing, or has an obvious skin infection with reddened skin with pus-filled areas, ask them to wear a mask or cover the infected area with a bandage. Stay away from close physical contact with this person.If you have a cough, cold, are sneezing, or have an infection, wear a mask and cover the infected area with a bandage. Do whatever you can to reduce the amount of bacteria that are spread.

, Sanitizing your home if someone is sick, or after you have had contact with a sick person, is extremely important. Clean surfaces in your home that may come into contact with contaminated materials with a 10% bleach solution for one to five minutes.Wash all clothing and bedding in as hot water as possible. Use bleach on bleach-safe materials and use an oxidizing agent such as Oxy-Clean on items that are not bleach-safe.
To make a bleach solution, mix one part bleach in nine parts water.

Understand antibiotic resistance.,
Learn how antibiotic resistance is spread.,
Know who is at risk.",How to Avoid Phantom Menace Bacteria3," Scientists have known for a very long time that bacteria can acquire resistance to antibiotics and that one of the forces pushing bacteria to acquire this antibiotic resistance was the overuse and misuse of antibiotics.Antibiotics have been and still are used widely in food-producing animals, such as poultry, beef, and pork.


To some degree, resistance to antibiotics is a natural phenomenon. In a population of bacteria, there are always a few that are naturally resistant. These can survive a treatment of antibiotics, especially if a person doesn’t take the antibiotics correctly or for as long as they should have. These surviving bacteria can multiply and grow. Any person infected with these bacteria can then pass it on to others., There are a number of ways that antibiotic-resistant bacteria can become a serious problem.Animals are treated with antibiotics to increase their size or for other reasons, such as illness. Their meat is then contaminated with the antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which can then spread to humans.
Animal-based fertilizer containing the antibiotic-resistant bacteria are used on crops. The bacteria survive and are spread through the foods.
Patients and caregivers at healthcare facilities such as nursing homes, hospitals, and other health centers can be particularly susceptible to these infections and to spreading these infections.

, Healthy people do not tend to be at risk for CRE. Those at highest risk for the bacteria are patients already in hospitals and nursing homes who are on ventilators, urinary or intravenous catheters, or who are immune compromised patients.To help minimize your risk, try to promote a healthy lifestyle.

Reduce stress.,
Exercise moderately.,
Reduce alcohol and caffeine consumption.,
Lose excess weight.,
Stop smoking.,
Keep glucose tablets on hand.",How to Avoid Hypoglycemia2," Stress-related hormones such as epinephrine play a significant role in the production and regulation of glucose.If you can identify your major stressors, you can take steps to reduce stress in your life and decrease your risk of hypoglycemia. There are a few common tactics for dealing with stress.


Write down what stresses you throughout the day. This will help you identify what is causing your stress as well as what you can do to deal with it in a healthy manner.
Get plenty of sleep. A full night’s rest can reduce the stress you feel the following day. Maintain a healthy and consistent sleeping schedule.
Exercise. Even taking a short walk every day will help you relax.
Talk it out. Discussing what bothers you with a close friend or family member can provide you with assistance and support. Your problems will not be your burden alone., Blood sugar levels can plummet after intense exercise, but this does not mean that you should stop entirely. Exercise has many other health benefits, and you can moderate your exercise with certain practices to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.


Eat a snack before and after you exercise. This will prevent your blood sugar levels from dropping too severely. Check your blood sugar during extended periods of exercise and have small snacks as a necessary, especially if your blood sugar is less than 100 mg/dl.Do not exercise late at night. Have your session be at least two hours before you go to bed.
Do not exercise more than once or twice a day.
If you take insulin injections, do not exercise when your insulin levels are at their highest.Even after exercise, when you are recovering, medication may cause your blood glucose to spike. Check your levels periodically after exercise., Alcohol and coffee can be difficult to eliminate because they are social drinks, but they are also major catalysts for hypoglycemia. As many as one-fifth of severe hypoglycemic episodes are caused by alcohol.If you are finding it difficult to eliminate alcohol and caffeine completely, only consume them in social settings and limit yourself to one drink.


Alcohol, especially on an empty stomach, can lead to hypoglycemia, and can have lasting effects even one to two days after consumption. Heavy drinking is particularly dangerous. Make sure you're not drinking on an empty stomach — have a small snack if necessary., Being overweight often leads to diabetes, and the first step to pre-diabetes is reactive hypoglycemia. If you can prevent hypoglycemia by losing weight and controlling your diet, you will decrease your chances of developing diabetes.


According to the Diabetes Prevention Program, even a modest decrease in weight — around 7% of total body weight — greatly decreases your risk of developing diabetes., Smoking significantly increases your odds of suffering severe hypoglycemia.Wean yourself off tobacco to improve your general health and increase your odds of avoiding hypoglycemia.

, Glucose tablets are available to boost your blood sugar levels in case of emergency. There are many over-the-counter options available. Ask your local pharmacist for recommendations. You can take three or four at a time depending on the dosage."
"
Schedule your meals at regular intervals.,
Reduce your intake of simple carbohydrates.,
Eat a limited amount of complex carbohydrates.,
Balance complex carbs with protein and fat.,
Keep non-perishable snacks on hand.",How to Avoid Hypoglycemia3," Infrequent or sporadic eating can induce hypoglycemia. It is recommended that you either eat six small meals a day or eat three big meals with small snacks in between.A good schedule will keep your glucose levels consistent while helping you monitor when and what you eat.

, These are foods that have a simple molecular structure that is broken down very quickly and turned into glucose in the body, causing your blood sugar to rise. Simple carbohydrates include table sugar, high fructose corn syrup and honey. Foods with simple carbs include fruit, milk, candy, soda and confections like cakes and cookies. These sugars cause high spikes in blood sugar that can result in rebound hypoglycemia. Try to avoid these as much as possible., These foods are made up of multiple chains of simple sugars so they don't break down as quickly as simple carbs. Complex carbs include potatoes, pasta, grains and breads. Opting for whole wheat and whole grain versions of breads and pastas will help reduce hypoglycemia, since these break down slowly. High fiber carbs can help regulate your blood sugar., Each meal should include one source of complex carbs, one source of fat, and one source of protein. Complex carbs will slowly release glucose over a period of time in your body, while the protein and fat will slow your body’s processing of glucose and keep blood sugar levels stable.Meal and snack options that fit these proportions include:


Meat or cheese sandwich on whole wheat bread
Peanut butter on whole grain crackers
Salad with raw vegetables, beans, and a dairy-free dressing
Hard-boiled egg with carrot sticks or celery
Lean meat or fish served with quinoa and a vegetable

, It will be easier for you to maintain healthy eating practices if you keep your home, office, purse, and car stocked with prepared snacks and foods. It is recommended to keep 15 grams of carbohydrates on you at all times in case of emergency.If you are unable to have a proper meal at your scheduled time or if you feel the onset of a hypoglycemic episode, these snacks can stave off hypoglycemia until you are able to eat. Examples of non-perishable snacks include:


One 4-ounce glass of juice
A small box of raisins
A granola bar
One piece of hard candy

Consider giving birth with a midwife.,
Look into the possibility of delivering your baby at a birth center.,
Find a supportive obstetrician.,
Get additional support.,
Ask about water birth.,
Get regular prenatal care.,
Eat well.,
Do Kegel exercises.,
Consider perineal massage.,
Rub hypericum ointment on scar tissue.,
Remind your care providers that you want to avoid an episiotomy.,
Avoid getting an epidural.,
Soak in warm water during labor.,
Choose an ideal delivery position.,
Ask for additional support for your perineum.,
Control your pushing.,
Manage your expectations.",How to Avoid an Episiotomy," Although most American women give birth under the care of obstetricians, there is information suggesting that midwives tend to perform episiotomies less often than obstetricians.Midwives can and do perform episiotomies in certain cases, for example, if there is an emergency that requires a rapid delivery, but do not usually perform them unnecessarily.


If you have a high-risk pregnancy or wind up with complications, you’ll have to be transferred to a specialist; therefore, if you choose a midwife as your provider, be sure to discuss how this process will work. Most midwives are affiliated with hospitals and obstetrical associations and can transfer you easily to the care of an obstetrician.
High-risk pregnancies should be managed and cared for by a trained obstetrician. A midwife does not have the training necessary to take care of high-risk pregnancies.
Consider a Certified Nurse Midwife (CNM), who is a midwife with graduate-level education and training.;
, Birth centers are non-hospital facilities, which are usually staffed by midwives.They typically do not perform episiotomies. This is probably due partly to the providers at birth centers – midwives as opposed to obstetricians – and partly to the fact that birth centers tend to promote natural childbirth with as few interventions as possible.


Midwives will typically use other methods to help relax the area, such as using warm compresses., If you decide to use an obstetrician and give birth in a hospital (whether out of medical necessity or personal preference), find one that supports your desire to avoid an episiotomy. Ask lots of questions about how many episiotomies a particular obstetrician performs, which circumstances he or she performs them under, and what his or her attitudes are toward other interventions.


In general, an episiotomy rate of 15% or less is a good sign; this suggests that a practitioner does not tend to perform the procedure routinely or unnecessarily.Be are that they are sometimes necessary, however, to prevent an even more severe tear of the perineum.

, Whether you choose a midwife or an obstetrician, and whether you have your baby at a birth center or a hospital, you can also enlist the support of a doula — a professional who specializes in helping women through labor and delivery.Although a doula does not provide medical care, they often help women get through childbirth with less pain and fewer interventions. Make sure your doula knows that avoiding an episiotomy is important to you, so that she can be your advocate.


You can also enlist the support of a doula before and after labor to provide physical and emotional support. These doulas are commonly referred to as antepartum and postpartum doulas.If you don’t want a doula or cannot afford one, this supportive role can be played by your partner or another trusted person. Make sure this person is as educated as possible in ways to help you deal with the pain and stress of labor — including breathing and massage techniques – and understands your desire to avoid an episiotomy.

, Some birth centers and hospitals offer the option of giving birth in water, usually in a warm tub or pool. If you have this option, consider it! Water birth lowers episiotomy rates considerably, and it also tends to minimize your pain and make labor shorter., Healthy pregnancies are more likely to lead to uncomplicated deliveries. See your midwife or obstetrician regularly, and follow his or her advice about keeping you and your baby safe and healthy.


Your doctor should perform tests throughout your pregnancy to make sure things are going well. Early tests include blood type (Rh Type) with antibody screen, hemoglobin and hematocrit, cervical examination for cervical cancer, rubella and varicella immunity, urine culture and protein, test for STDs, and thyroid function tests.
In the coming months your doctor should should evaluate your blood pressure and urine protein, weight, document fetal cardiac activity, assess fetal activity and presentation, measure of uterine size, and check for gestational diabetes with a glucose tolerance test.

, A balanced diet is crucial for a healthy pregnancy, and it may also help you avoid an episiotomy.This is because good nutrition contributes to healthy skin and tissue – including the skin and tissue of your perineum, which will need to stretch significantly during birth.


Stay hydrated! This will also contribute to the elasticity of your perineum.
Foods high in Vitamin E and C such as sunflower seeds, pecans, and lobster, as well as acidic fruits are especially important for your skin’s health and elasticity.,

Kegel exercises strengthen your perineal muscles and your pelvic floor. They can also increase circulation and decrease swelling. If you can, perform these exercises every day until delivery.To do a Kegel exercise, simply tighten the muscles you would use to stop the flow of urine. Hold for ten seconds, then release. Aim for 10–20 at a time, whenever you think about it.
Kegels are also great for pregnant women because they may also reduce the likelihood of urinary incontinence after childbirth.,

Some studies suggest that massaging your perineum will help you avoid tearing or needing an episiotomy; other studies suggest that this isn’t so.Talk to your midwife or obstetrician.

If you decide to try perineal massage, begin by finding a warm, comfortable place. Sit in a reclined position, with your legs apart and your knees bent.
Apply a lubricant like vitamin E oil or cocoa butter to your perineum, avoid lubricants such as petroleum jelly, baby oil, or mineral oil as these can cause vaginal infections.
Insert your thumbs into your vagina and pull toward the sides and press downward, stretching your perineum very gently. Massage your lower vagina and perineum for several minutes, but do not put pressure on the urethra (top part of the vagina), as this can cause swelling or infection.
You can repeat this daily from the 34th week of pregnancy until you deliver.Alternatively, you can have your partner massage you, using the same technique. Make sure he or she proceeds with care, though – it’s important to be gentle. Massaging too vigorously can lead to infection.

, If you have had an episiotomy or a tear with a previous delivery, consider applying hypericum ointment to the scar tissue regularly during the weeks before your due date. This may help you avoid tearing along the same line or needing another episiotomy.Hypericum ointment is homeopathic ointment made from the leafy herb known as St. John's wort. One of its many uses includes increasing collagen production, which is what makes skin elastic., Once you are in labor, things can happen quickly, and — especially in busy hospitals — the wishes of the laboring mother can be overlooked. Make sure to remind your care providers that avoiding an episiotomy is important to you.


If you can, have your partner, doula, or trusted friend there to advocate for your wishes. It can be difficult to be firm about your wishes when you are in pain.

, Studies show that women who received pain medication during labor and delivery have the highest rates of tears and episiotomies, and epidurals seem to lead to the most episiotomies. This may be because epidurals make many of the best birthing positions impossible, and it may also be related to the fact that epidurals eliminate your natural sensations, so that you will have to push when someone tells you to, not when your body feels ready.To help you deal with the pain of childbirth, you can also consider medical alternatives for pain management such as local anesthesia, which may be injected to numb a specific area (such as the vagina), or pain medications which can be injected intravenously into the arm, for example. These options will not completely get rid of the pain, but they can lessen it., Whether or not you plan to deliver your baby in the water, soaking can be beneficial during labor. Warm water is relaxing; it may minimize your pain and make you feel more comfortable. In addition, it can help your perineum relax and stretch.

, Kneeling, crouching on your hands and knees, or lying on your side are thought to be the best positions to help avoid an episiotomy. Do not spread your knees wider than your shoulders, and point them forward (not to the sides). These positions will help your perineum relax and stretch while easing your baby’s descent., Warm compresses can help your perineum stretch naturally and remain intact during delivery, as can gentle massage with olive oil or another lubricant.The compress should be placed gently against the perineum, and should be warm but not hot as this could increase blood flow to the area, which may cause more swelling., Some women feel the urge to push as hard as they can as soon as they are fully dilated, but it’s better to take delivery slowly in order to protect the perineum. Slow, controlled, careful pushing will give your perineum time to stretch. As the baby crowns, you can even stop pushing for a few contractions. Let your midwife or obstetrician know that you want to go slowly, and then, when you feel ready, push again. You will be much more likely to deliver with your perineum intact., Episiotomies are sometimes necessary, just as other interventions are. No obstetrician or midwife can guarantee that you will deliver intact. Understand that the most important thing is that you and your baby get through labor and delivery safely."

Look at a hand reflexology chart.,
Apply to the tops of the fingers for the head, brain, and sinuses.,
Apply between the first and second knuckles for your neck.,
Apply between the second and third knuckles of each finger for your eyes and ears.,
Apply to the upper portion of your palm for your upper chest.,
Extend a line from your middle finger down the center of your palm.,
Apply to the outside of your palm (toward your thumb).,
Apply to the inside area of your palms.,
Apply to the wrist.,
Locate the correct, corresponding area.,
Use thumb-walking techniques.,
Use a rotating motion.,
Apply pressure after rotating.,
Integrate the different techniques.,
Press firmly without causing any pain.,
Stimulate the zones on both hands.,
Relax and drink plenty of water after your session.",How to Apply Reflexology to the Hands," Though this Part will describe some of the points on the hands that reflexologists associate with different parts of the body, some of the points can be easier to visualize with an actual hand reflexology chart.;
, From the tip of each finger—including your thumb—to the first joint represents the head, brain, and sinuses.The center of the pads of your thumbs specifically represent the pituitary, pineal, and hypothalamus glands located in the center of the brain, which can make them beneficial for insomnia and other sleep issues., The section of all four fingers and your thumb between your first and second knuckles corresponds to your neck.Additionally, the zone for your throat is at the base of your thumbs, aligned with the webbing of your thumb., Your fingers between the second and third knuckles represent either your eyes or ears depending on the finger. Your index and middle fingers are associated with your eyes, whereas your ring fingers and pinkies are associated with your ears., The chest, breast, lung, and bronchial areas are located just below the knuckles of the four fingers on the palm sides of both hands., Just below the previous upper chest zone, picture four more zones descending down in line with your middle finger. Each of the four is about the size of a dime, and the fourth ends at the bottom of your palm. In descending order, these zones represent your:Solar plexus
Adrenal glands
Kidneys
Intestines

, Starting at the base of your thumb (the throat zone described above) and leading down to the bottom of your palm on the side closest to your thumb, you quickly descend through four thin zones. In descending order, these zones correspond to your:Thyroid gland
Pancreas
Bladder
Uterus/prostate
Note that the outside ridge of this same area represents your spine and spinal column. The spinal column is found along the side of the right and left thumb, reaching down to the wrist with the cervical spine located closest to the thumb, followed by the thoracic, lumbar, and sacral areas.

, Imagine a line running down the insides of your palms from your pinkies down to your wrists. There are three more zones here with each about the size of a nickel. The top zone on both hands applies to the arm and shoulder on the respective side of the body, and the bottom of the three zones on each hands corresponds to the respective side’s hip and thigh.The middle zone on the left hand applies to the heart and spleen while the middle zone on the right hand represents the liver and gall bladder since these organs themselves are located on particular sides of your body., Just beneath your palm on your wrist, you will find three more zones. The lymph system is located in line with your middle finger right where your palm ends and your wrist begins. Right next to this zone (in line with your pinkies), you will find the zones representing the testes/ovaries. Finally, beneath both of these zones in a long thin line, you will find the location corresponding to your sciatic nerve., Use a reflexology chart or Part One to find the zone that corresponds to the area of your body on which you want to work. Or you can simply work the entire hands, which reflexologists believe helps to promote overall wellness.


For instance, if you suffer from a sinus headache, then you would work on your fingers between the fingertips and the first knuckles since this zone represents the head and sinuses. This area may also help relieve symptoms of sinusitis, although no proven evidence exists.As another example, if you’re suffering from constipation, you would apply the techniques to the zones corresponding to your intestines, which is at the bottom of the palms straight down from your middle fingers., Place your fully extended thumb on the area you want to focus on. Slide the thumb back slowly while flexing the first thumb knuckle upward. Moving slowly and steadily move the thumb knuckle up and down, walking it over the reflex point., Rest your thumb on the area you wish to manipulate. Maintain a steady touch and rotate your thumb in a circle on the area while slowly increasing pressure., After performing a rotating motion, holding your thumb on the reflex point with medium pressure increases relaxation. Hold for a count of three., If you have chest congestion, for instance, you would isolate the correct zone on each hand (the top of the palm just below the last set of finger knuckles). Then you can use a thumb-walking technique across the zone. Finally, apply the rotating technique to smaller sections of the zone with a hold on the section before moving to the next.

, As you increase pressure on portions of the hands, you should apply as much pressure as you can without causing yourself (or the person on whom you’re applying reflexology) any pain. The firm pressure will ensure that you trigger the reflex, but the action should never cause pain or discomfort.

, Reflexologists believe that it is important to stimulate the corresponding zones on both hands when applying the techniques.For instance, do not work the fingertips (associated with the head) on just your left hand. Instead, work the fingertips on both hands.


Note that this isn’t the case for zones that are only represented on one hand—the heart of liver, for example.

, Much like a regular massage, reflexologists recommend that you drink lots of water after a hand reflexology session to help your body remove the lactic acid that builds up and is released during the session.As your body flushes out this lactic acid (the 24 to 48 hours after the session), it is also normal to experience increased urination and bowel movements, as well as sweating and changes to sleep patterns.


Lactic acid release is also responsible for the feeling of burning or tingling sensation in muscles that have recently been stimulated (such as by massage).You can also drink a sports drink containing electrolytes to help you hydrate.

Explain what immunization is.Before getting a vaccine or agreeing that vaccines are important, people must understand what a vaccine is and how it works.,
Illustrate that Immunization is safe.Much of the anxiety and confusion surrounding vaccination is premised on the belief that vaccines can lead to negative outcomes.,
Debunk the autism myth.,
Emphasize the consequences of not getting immunized.Children -- whose immune systems are not as strong as those of adults -- are at risk for developing illnesses that could be prevented by vaccines.",How to Educate Others on the Importance of Immunization1," Clarify the difference between three related terms: vaccine, vaccination, and immunization.A vaccine is the medical product (usually in the form of a shot) that protects against certain diseases. Vaccinations are created using dead or weakened disease-causing agents (parasites, bacteria, or viruses).
Vaccination is the process of receiving the vaccine. Once vaccinated, you’ll begin the immunization process that will allow your body to identify these diseases.
Immunization is the process that follows vaccination, in which the body learns to fight a disease using its immune system. Immunization can also happen naturally, without a vaccine, when a person is exposed to and recovers from a disease. A person immunized against a certain disease cannot contract it.;
, Assure people who you are educating about vaccines that vaccines have been proven safe in numerous trials and studies.


Federal Law Requires that everyone who gets a vaccine also receives a Vaccine Information Statement describing the benefits and risks of each vaccine. Let people know that they have the right to use these statements to make an informed decision.
Opponents of vaccination might draw attention to the “Vaccine Injury Court” (the Office of Special Masters) to establish that vaccines are unsafe. However, you should calmly explain that no medical procedure is ever entirely safe, and that the court exists to adjudicate those rare cases -- literally less than one in a million -- where vaccines do result in some harm., Multiple studies from both pubic and private medical agencies and organizations have established that vaccines do not cause autism.You could cite, for instance, the Institute of Medicine report that rejected any correlation between autism and vaccination, or the 2013 Center for Disease Control study that likewise showed vaccines do not cause autism.


These studies are available online at http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2004/Immunization-Safety-Review-Vaccines-and-Autism.aspx and http://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(13)00144-3/pdf?ext=.pdf, respectively.
Explain that the link between autism and vaccination originated with a British doctor, Andrew Wakefield, whose work was later debunked., These diseases could result in prolonged illness, disability, undernourishment, or death.Furthermore, if many people have not been vaccinated against a particular disease, the likelihood of an epidemic increases. The more people who are walking around without immunity to a disease, after all, the easier it will be for a virus or disease to spread. Immunization is therefore important to protect public health.


Use the importance of the HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccine to illustrate the consequences of not getting immunized. You might explain that most people get HPV at some point in their life. HPV can cause cancer of the cervix, anus, vulva, vagina, and throat. Without this vaccine, women are at much greater risk for these cancers. Young men are also starting to get this vaccine to limit the spread of the disease and the disease sequelae that follows, including cervical cancer other carcinomas.

Use pamphlets.Handing out pamphlets is an effective way to promote your message and educate other on the importance of vaccines.,
Use posters.While pamphlets usually have excellent visuals, the increased size of the images on posters can lend them greater impact.,
Show videos.Video can be a powerful educational tool, especially with those who process audiovisual information more efficiently than written information.,
Provide coloring books.If you’re trying to help children better understand the importance of immunization, there are coloring books available to help understand the basics of vaccination.",How to Educate Others on the Importance of Immunization2," While you should already be familiar with the most relevant facts about the importance of vaccinations, you might not have the time or authority to convince someone to see the importance of immunizations.


Handing someone a pamphlet saves time, allows people to take in information at their own pace, and verify the authenticity of what you’re saying by checking the sources cited within the pamphlet.
If you are a doctor or public health official, you could make pamphlets available for individuals to take in the front office or lobby of your facility.
If you are a friend of someone thinking about getting vaccinated, you could obtain pamphlets in order to help educate your friend about the importance of immunization.

, If you’re a doctor or public health official, you can hang posters with facts and images relating to the importance of vaccination in the lobby or waiting room of your facility.

Publish an article about the importance of vaccines.Popular articles in reputable newspapers, magazines, and online have the potential to reach more people than public service announcements and statements issued by medical organizations.,
Provide relevant materials.The information you provide should be tailored to the individual’s situation.,
Encourage questions.Armed with accurate and scientifically verifiable information, you should have no reason not to invite and answer questions.,
Provide follow-up materials.,
Recognize the limits of education.",How to Educate Others on the Importance of Immunization3," Write a thoughtful, accurate article about your experience with immunization and how it helped you or your family to demonstrate the importance of immunization. Talk to your local newspaper about the possibility of publishing it.


If your op-ed or article is not selected for publication, you could easily self-publish on your blog or social media page.
If you do not have time or ability to construct a full-length article, you could still educate people on the the importance of immunizations by writing a letter to your editor.

, Parents with babies should receive information that is unique from information provided for parents of teens.


Similarly, you should always provide information specific to certain diseases. If someone is considering vaccination against diphtheria, do not provide them with information about shingles vaccination.

, Immunization can be confusing, and people might have questions about what vaccines they need, when they need them, and what the manufacturing process behind vaccines is.If you cannot answer a question, be honest and admit that you don’t know. However, you should add that you’ll find out and get back to the person, or direct them to a medical professional or another reputable source that can answer their question.

, Instead of expecting people to take you at your word, you should always redirect them to other, reputable sources of information about immunization. There are a wide variety of public and private agencies and organizations that specialize in providing accurate information about the importance of immunization, including:The American Association of Family Physicians, which offers policy statements and recommendations about getting immunized. They are online at http://www.aafp.org/patient-care/public-health/immunizations/schedules.html.
Vaccines.gov, a website run by the Department of Health and Human Services that provides information on many vaccines and when to get immunized.
The Immunization Action Coalition, a nonprofit dedicated to improving public health through education on the importance of immunization. Check them out online at http://www.immunize.org.

, In many cases, more information or education that dispels anti-vaccination myths can push people -- especially those who are already suspicious about immunizations -- to more extreme positions.Go into any conversation with an understanding that some people are immune to education, and don’t blame yourself for failing to change their mind. Know when to give up the fight.

Throw away foods if you’re unsure of their ingredients. Food Allergy Research & Education (FARE) offers a long list of foods containing common allergens.;
, Many triggers are common ingredients in food and even some vitamins, so it’s important to identify products that may cause an allergic reaction.Read food and product labels to determine if your product contains a trigger food. Be aware that US law requires that American food manufacturers list the top eight allergenic foods in plain language on packaging. You may also want to look for common code names for allergens including:Casein, lactalbumin, lactose, rennet casein, whey, and tagatose for milk
Flour, einkorn, seitan, triticale, vital wheat gluten, durum for wheat
Albumin, globulin, livetin, lysozyme, surimi, and vitellin for egg
Edamame, miso, natto, shoyu, tamari, tempeh, tofu for soy
Glucosamine or surimi for shellfish
Peanut protein hydrolysate for peanuts
Fish gelatin, nuoc mam, roe, sashimi, surimi for fish

, Even if you remove many of your favorite foods because of an allergy, you can restock your pantry and enjoy alternative foods that do not contain any of your triggers. Using trigger-free foods and alternatives can minimize the risk of preparing a dish that will cause a reaction.


If you live in a home with others who consume your trigger foods, consider storing your food separately to minimize the risk of contamination. Keep in mind that cross-contamination can occur, so it is likely in your best interest to ensure that no allergy food triggers are in the environment.
Ask stores if they offer products for people with allergies. For example, many stores now have a section for wheat-free foods.
Use alternatives for common allergens. Some examples you can use instead of triggers are: rice or oat milk products for dairy, rice flours or corn-based products for wheat allergies, xanthan gum for eggs, roasted pumpkin or sunflower seeds for peanuts or tree nuts.Remember to read food labels to see if your triggers or common code names for them are listed. Avoid any food or product that isn’t labeled., Preparing your meals is a safe way to minimize the risk of eating trigger foods. Planning your meals may not only prevent allergic reactions, but also ensure you’re getting enough vitamins and nutrients to maintain your well-being.Write a meal plan each week. Pay special attention to meals that you don’t eat at home such like lunch. Pack a lunch or alternative meal if you like. If you’re going to a restaurant, you may want to check out the menu before you go to figure out what you could eat.
If your allergy is severe, you may need to take special precautions to make sure none of your foods are prepared with or near your trigger foods. For some people, just being in the same vicinity as a trigger food can cause a reaction.

, Having food allergies can make it difficult to eat at restaurants. Many places use products containing triggers and may prepare dishes on surfaces with allergens. Call ahead and ask questions about the menu and preparation to minimize your risk of an allergic reaction.Ask the manager, server, or chef if the restaurant can accommodate your allergy. You may want to explain your triggers.Inquire if the staff is trained about food allergies, if food for persons with allergies is prepared in a separate area with separate utensils, and if they offer any specialty products for people with allergies.Always be prepared if a restaurant doesn’t have your first choice., It’s common to accidentally expose yourself to trigger foods through cross-contamination. Keeping vigilant about what you buy and how you store and prepare it may prevent allergic reactions.Use different utensils and preparation surfaces to prevent cross-contamination in your home.Consider having your own appliances, like toasters or blenders.
Wash your hands with soap and water before preparing food. This can often clear your hands of any contaminants.

, If you find you’re your food allergies or symptoms are getting worse or you are having trouble coping with them, schedule an appointment with your doctor.They can run tests for you, speak to you about how to cope, or suggest a psychiatrist to help you.


Your doctor may suggest running additional allergy tests including blood or skin tests, an elimination diet, a food diary, or an oral food challenge to figure out what is making you sick.Your doctor may also test for other conditions related to food allergies such as: anxiety, depression, or exercise.Ask your doctor if there is any medication that may help you. Make sure to take any medication they suggest or prescribe.The best treatment is often avoidance if possible. If you cannot avoid the food, ensure that you have a plan in case you are exposed. Depending on the severity, you may need to carry an epinephrine pen at all times if an anaphylactic reaction may result from exposure.
Consider seeing a counselor if you are having a hard time coping with your food allergies.

, Ask your doctor to refer you to a certified dietitian if you are having a hard time with your diet. A dietitian can help you learn to recognize triggers, identify and prepare nutritious alternative foods, and develop a meal plan that promotes your health.


Find a dietitian or health professional that specializes food allergies. They can give you information on safe food choices, hidden triggers, and figuring out alternative meals when eating out.
If you can’t find a dietician or health professional that specializes in food allergies, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics lists registered dietitians in your area., Letting others know about your food allergies can be an important part of dealing with the condition. Being open about your triggers may prevent uncomfortable situations or questions, and it also may alert people to your condition in the event of an allergy attack.


Let friends, family members, co-workers, caregivers, and other important individuals know about your allergies. They may be able to help you in an emergency.Wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace, which can explain how to help you in an emergency., You will likely find that most people understand your food allergies and needs. Social pressure or stigmatizing from others may be a result of misinformation. Learning to ignore negative reactions can help you maintain a full and active life.You might feel embarrassed having to ask for special meals and considerations when you’re out. Explain your condition and don’t worry about how other people may react. Ignore any negative reactions, which may help you cope you’re your allergies.

Positive affirmations can help you become more confident and empowered when taking control of your health and preventing allergy side effects. Repeat the phrase, “What other people think about me doesn’t matter.” This may minimize your embarrassment or feelings of guilt.Reframe any negative energy you feel by taking a deep breath, repeat the manta and thinking of something positive, like being on the top of a beautiful mountain.Love and accept yourself. For example, say “I may have food allergies, but they don’t control. I can go out for dinner and enjoy my time with friends and acquaintances.”, Join a support group and attend events for individuals with food allergies. Not only can both provide you unconditional support from others with the same condition, but they may have idea for dealing with various aspects of the condition.There are many support groups who meet online. If getting to a physical location is tough, this may be an option.
Attend events or conferences about food allergies in your area. These may provide you contacts and information to help you with your specific allergies.For example, FARE offers the Food Allergy awareness week.Inform yourself by watching programs for people who have food allergies. For example, FARE and the Discovery Channel produced a recent documentary about food allergies.FARE offers a service to locate a food allergy support group in your local area., It may ease your mind to prepare yourself for possible allergy attacks from unintended exposure.Keep people you’re with informed about your allergy or carrying emergency medication.Know the signs of anaphylaxis and how to treat it. Every reaction can be different depending in your sensitivity to the allergen and the size of the exposure.
Ask your doctor to prescribe emergency epinephrine if you are prone to severe allergic reactions.Carry over-the-counter anti-histamines if you have mild allergic reactions.Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) is a very effective treatment. Understand that the side effects may include drowsiness, dizziness or extreme confusion.
Let servers at restaurants know about your allergies.Compose an action plan for attacks and place it in your purse or wallet. Include information on how to care for you and who to call in the event of an emergency."

Test your tolerance to specific products.,
Stick to small servings of dairy.,
Increase dairy consumption gradually.,
Consume dairy with meals.,
Get products that are lactose-reduced.,
Include the lactose enzyme in your meal.,
Try taking probiotics.",How to Deal With Lactose Intolerance1," Start by going dairy-free for several days. Then choose a day to attempt consuming one specific dairy product (for instance, eat cheese that day but no other dairy). Keep track of your symptoms. This way you can determine if there are certain products that do not upset your stomach. Very few people have such severe intolerance that they cannot eat dairy at all.


Swiss, cheddar, and other hard cheeses have lower lactose and might cause fewer symptoms than soft cheese like ricotta and brie.
Some people who are lactose intolerant can eat yogurt without a problem because of the bacteria cultures in it.Low-fat and fat-free ice cream, hard cheese, cottage cheese, and yogurt contain less lactose per serving than milk. Some people who cannot drink milk can tolerate these other products in moderation.;
, Do not overwhelm your body with lactose. Try to limit drinking milk to 4 ounces at a time (118 ml) or less. Drink low-fat or fat-free milk instead of whole milk.It’s likely that you can have some amount of dairy, and just have to discover your limit. Start with a very small serving of one dairy product, and if you do not have any symptoms, then try a larger serving the next day. With trial and error, you can determine what you can eat, and how much of it, without symptoms., There’s no “cure” for lactose intolerance, but you may be able to make symptoms tolerable or even non-existent. Eliminate dairy products from your diet, and then begin to introduce them slowly. You may be able to help your body acclimate to increasing levels of dairy., You’re less likely to get symptoms if you have dairy with other food. Taking dairy with meals makes it easier for your body to digest everything, and will likely cause fewer symptoms for you than just having dairy on its own., Because lactose intolerance is so prevalent, many grocery stores carry lactose-reduced or lactose-free products. These generally do not taste any different than regular dairy products.Lactose-free products shouldn’t cause you any stomach upset; whether or not you get symptoms from lactose-reduced products depends on your body and how much lactose is still in the product.


Lactaid is a brand that sells many different types of lactose-free dairy products, such as milk, ice cream, cottage cheese, and eggnog.

, Lactase is the enzyme that breaks down lactose in your body (most people are lactose intolerant because their body doesn’t have enough lactase). You can get tablets or drops from your drug store, usually over-the-counter, which contain lactase. These products come in different forms. Some you take as a tablet before eating lactose; others are liquids or powders that you add to dairy products.


SureLac and Lactaid are some examples, but there are more.Some brands of milk even contain the lactase enzyme to minimize the lactose in the milk; look for this on the label.
Using these products can be helpful if you’re unsure of the lactose content of a meal, like if you’re eating at a restaurant.These products don’t help everyone who is lactose intolerant. Some people are lactose intolerant for a different reason than lactase deficiency., In their natural state, probiotics are tiny organisms that live in your gut and help you digest food and keep your intestines healthy. You can also get probiotics in capsule form from your pharmacy (usually over-the-counter). Taking probiotics may help ease diarrhea and symptoms of lactose intolerance, and can be tried if other treatments don’t work.Probiotics are considered generally safe, but you should still check with your doctor before taking them to make sure they won’t interfere with any other health conditions or medications you take.

Read product labels.,
Replace milk with non-dairy options.,
Know what goes into your starches.,
Watch out for hidden dairy ingredients.,
Ask your doctor about the medications you take.",How to Deal With Lactose Intolerance2," Items that you might not expect to contain milk might actually have dairy, lactose, whey or other ingredients that can cause symptoms for the lactose intolerant. Be sure to read the Ingredients list on food items so you know what you’re consuming.


Avoid or limit anything that directly states “lactose” in the ingredients. Be sure to check products like margarine, salad dressing, non-dairy creamer, baked products and pastries, and shortening., There are many products on the market that you can use to substitute for milk. Soy milk, rice milk, and almond milk are the most common, and often come in plain and flavored varieties.You can usually also use non-dairy creamer (though be sure to check the label for lactose).


Stay away from other milk products like cream, buttermilk, malted milk, evaporated and condensed milk, and Kefir cultured milk.To avoid all lactose, also exclude the following from your diet: cheese (including ricotta), cottage cheese, ice cream, whipped cream, sherbert, butter, cream cheese, hot cocoa mix, sour cream, yogurt, pudding, custard, and whey., Breads and starches on their own don’t always contain lactose if they’re made fresh and without additives. However, avoid pre-made products like instant mashed potato mixes and frozen pre-made meals – or at least carefully read the ingredients.Baked goods (cookies, cakes, pies, etc.) and breads may or may not be made with milk, so use caution.

, Milk, cheese, and other products that contain lactose can sometimes show up in meals and snacks that you wouldn’t expect. Be on the lookout for items that might contain hidden lactose:Dips, for instance spinach and artichoke dip. These often contain cheese. Opt for salsa or hummus instead.
Creamed vegetables (creamed peas, creamed corn) and cream-based soups (white chowders, for instance).
Smoothies that contain yogurt
Vegetables and meats that are coated in batter, i.e. fried.
Cheese in things like pizza, burritos, casseroles, and in salads
Confections such as toffee, caramel, and butterscotch
Processed snacks like potato chips

, Even some medications contain lactose. The birth control pill might, as well as over-the-counter medicines to treat gas and acid reflux. If you have severe lactose intolerance and are taking these medications, talk to your doctor about possibly switching to another option."
"
Keep a food diary.,
Experiment with dairy deprivation.,
See your doctor to get tested.,
Explain lactose intolerance to others.,
Address myths and misunderstandings.",How to Deal With Lactose Intolerance3," Create a record of your dairy consumption and symptoms from day to day. Keep track of what dairy foods you eat (milk, yogurt, ice cream, cheese, cottage cheese), the serving size, what time you eat them, and what you eat with them. In another column, keep track of when you have symptoms, what the symptoms are, and how long they last. This can help you and your doctor make a diagnosis, and figure out which foods are most likely to give you symptoms.Use a notebook, journal, online tool like excel or Google Docs, or wall chart – whatever helps you stay organized. If you want to keep your symptoms private, use something hand-held that only you can access.

, If you think you may be lactose intolerant, try to avoid eating dairy for a couple days or even 1-2 weeks. Make note of whether or not your symptoms subside or go away. Inform your doctor if your symptoms improve when you don’t have dairy., Bloating, cramps, gas, diarrhea, or stomach noise after eating might be caused by lactose intolerance. However, you want to be sure you know what is causing your symptoms, and rule out any other possible reasons for your stomach upset. Make a doctor’s appointment to get tested, and discuss the possible cause of your lactose intolerance. There are a few different kinds of tests that your doctor can do:For a lactose tolerance test, you drink a liquid containing lots of lactose and have a blood test done two hours later.
For the hydrogen breath test you also drink a high-lactose liquid, and then your doctor measures how much hydrogen is in your breath at set intervals.
A stool acidity test simply checks a stool sample; it is used for infants or children who can’t do the other tests.

, It might feel stressful if you have to change your diet, and you might be worried about what others will think. Fortunately, many people eat specific diets and you can explain your condition to others however you want to. Be vague, offer a simple explanation, or – if you want – wow others with your scientific knowledge!


It’s okay to say simply, “Dairy upsets my stomach so I try to stay away from it,” or, “If I have too much milk, I feel sick.”
You can also be specific, if you want to educate others. Say something like, “I’m lactose intolerant because I don’t have enough of the enzyme in my body that breaks down the sugar in milk, lactose.”

, Some people might think that if you drink a sip of milk or can eat yogurt, you’re lying about being lactose intolerant. Many people simply don’t understand the condition. Explain that most people who are lactose intolerant can eat some dairy products and not others, or dairy in small amounts.


You can try to explain to people using an example, such as, “It probably wouldn’t affect you very much if you drink half a cup of coffee, but if you drink four espressos you might feel jittery, right? That’s how I am with dairy – a little is okay, a lot makes me feel sick.”
You can also explain that you’re not allergic to milk, so drinking it isn't unsafe. Explain that it’s the sugar in dairy that upsets your stomach, and there’s more milk sugar in some things (like whole milk) than others (like dairy and hard cheeses).

Talk to your doctor.,
Take allergy medication.,
Bring emergency prescription medications, if needed.,
Familiarize others with epinephrine injections.",How to Deal with Pet Allergies when Visiting Someone with a Pet1," Make sure to see your doctor regularly so that they can treat your allergies and keep tabs on your overall health. Without consulting your doctor, you won’t have the information you need to deal with allergies when you visit someone’s house.


Let your doctor know if you’ll be putting yourself in a situation where you might have a potential allergic reaction.
Tell your doctor about any allergy symptoms you are having, such as sneezing, runny or stuffy nose, facial pain (from nasal congestion), coughing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, wheezing, watery, red or itchy eyes, skin rash or hives.Keep annual appointments. To manage your health, you also need to make sure that you keep annual and semiannual appointments with your general practitioner or allergist.
Have periodic allergy testing done. Many doctors suggest allergy testing every two years. However, adults may go three to five years between tests.Ask your doctor about immunotherapy, or allergy shots. This treatment option will reduce your sensitivity to an allergy, such as pet dander.;
, One way to deal with pet allergies is to take or use allergy medications that prevent or reduce the symptoms of your allergy. Ultimately, allergy medication may make it a lot easier for you to function in an environment that contains pet allergens. Many of these medications are available over-the-counter and some are available by prescription only. Consider:


Antihistamines like Zyrtec, Clarinex, and Allegra.
Decongestants like Sudafed.
Antihistamine decongestant combinations like Claritin-D or Allegra-D.
Corticosteroid nasal sprays like Nasonex, Flonase, and Veramyst.
Consult with your physician before taking allergy medication.Avoid taking a combination of medications unless directed by physician and follow the instructions on the medication package.

, Ultimately, your allergy medication might not work. Thus, you may find yourself in an emergency having a severe allergic reaction to someone’s pet. To safeguard against this, make sure you bring any emergency medications you might need to treat yourself. Make sure that you carry:


An albuterol inhaler, if you have one. This is especially important for asthmatics.
An epinephrine injection, such as an EpiPen.
Any other medication your doctor recommends., In the event of a severe allergic reaction, you may need to have someone use an epinephrine injection on you.


Tell them they need to hold the EpiPen against your mid-outer-thigh.
Once positioned, they need to push it firmly until the pen clicks and the needle enters your skin.
Have them hold the pen for a few seconds.
Let them know that they should never inject the pen into any body part other than the thigh."

Stay outside, if you can.,
Avoid fabric couches, chairs, or carpeted rooms.,
Stay in well-ventilated areas.,
Wash your hands and change your clothing after exposure to pets.,
Be realistic.",How to Deal with Pet Allergies when Visiting Someone with a Pet2," You and your friend may want to consider structuring your visit to minimize potential allergic reactions. You can do this by holding your visit outside, where pet dander, hair, and dust do not accumulate as easily.


If you’re visiting for a casual talk, suggest you have coffee, tea, or wine on the porch or deck.
If you’re visiting for a meal, suggest you grill your food and eat outside.
If you and your child is visiting for a play date, suggest that the kids play outside., When visiting, make sure to stay away from fabric couches or chairs that might harbor dust, dander, or pet hair. In addition, stay out of carpeted rooms, if you can. This is important, as fabric and carpet will retain hair, dander, and dust even after being vacuumed.


Sit on leather or vinyl couches or arm chairs.
If given a choice, sit on a wooden chair or other furniture.
Hang out in rooms with tile or wood flooring., A great way to manage your visit is to make sure you spend the majority of time in an area with good air flow and a minimal accumulation of dust and dander. By doing this, you’ll minimize the chance of being overcome by allergens that may set off a bad allergic reaction.


Ask your guest to open the windows in advance of you coming. Before you visit, say something like “I’m worried about my allergies. Could you maybe open the windows?”
Try to sit in rooms where there are multiple air vents and/or doors., Washing your hands and changing clothing after exposure in a home with a pet can help you to manage your symptoms. Make sure to do this after coming into contact with pets.


For example, if one of the cats rubs up against your pant leg and gets hair on your pants, then you might want to change into a fresh pair, or at least use a lint roller.
If you pet or hold any of the pets, wash your hands right after.

, You should also realize that there may be some cases in which you won’t be able to visit a friend or family member at their home.


If you absolutely must attend, try to only stay for a limited amount of time – like under an hour.
If your allergy is extreme or your reaction is life-threatening, you should not visit.
If you know that the person you are visiting does not keep a clean home and won’t take any steps to safeguard your health, don’t visit.
If you’ve visited someone’s home and had a negative reaction, don’t repeat this mistake."
"
Let them know that you have allergies.,
Be polite.,
Request that the person doesn’t allow their pets to roam.,
Excuse yourself, if needed.",How to Deal with Pet Allergies when Visiting Someone with a Pet3," Initiate a conversation in which you inform them about your allergy. In this conversation, you’ll give them an idea about your allergies and their severity. This way, they’ll have the information they need to ensure you have a pleasant experience at their home.


You want to be clear you have genuine concerns about your health. Consider saying “I have allergies that make it hard for me to visit people with pets.”
Ask the person exactly what types of pets they have. This is important, as not all pets will aggravate your allergies.

, When initiating a conversation with someone about your allergies, you need to make sure you are polite. Do not make any demands about what they need to do to prepare for you. After all, you are their guest – you do not have to attend.


If they offer to clean their home or make special accommodations, make sure to thank them. Never say “You need to thoroughly clean your house or I can’t visit.” Instead, politely explain your needs.
You may want to consider acknowledging that you understand how your condition might inconvenience them.
Offer to relocate your meeting. For instance, instead of having coffee at their home, you can have coffee at a coffee shop.Most people who entertain frequently should be cognizant of pet allergens and the problems they create., Consider politely suggesting that your host removes their pets from public spaces in their home while you are visiting. While this won’t remove all the danger, it will lower the chance of you having a serious allergic reaction.


Say something like “Sometimes my allergies are okay if the pets aren’t in the room at the moment.”
Let them know that direct contact with a specific type of pet may aggravate your allergy.
Many pet owners have “pet free zones” that they entertain guests in. If they have one, they may let you know., Despite all of the steps you and your host have taken, you still may need to leave their home earlier than expected. If your symptoms are turning severe, politely excuse yourself.


If you're in the middle of the conversation, redirect it. Say, ""I think I'm having a bad allergic reaction.""
Instead of leaving right away, ask them if you could finish your conversation outside. Once outside, if possible, finish chatting with them.
Before you leave, thank them for having you over. Let them know they should not feel bad. Consider saying ""This is just one of the unpleasant side-effects of having allergies. How about if we make plans to see each other at my house (or another location) next time?""

Consider allergy shots.",How to Deal With Being Allergic to Cats," While not every cat is a good candidate for outside living, some thrive living outside. If you must have a cat around, one good option is an outdoor cat that you still feed and care for. Keeping the cat outside means less hair in the house, and your allergies will thank you.However, cats who live outside do have a shorter life expectancy. Vaccinations are especially important for outdoor cats.;
, Your bedroom is your castle. Defend it from allergens at all costs! If you can keep the cat out of your bedroom, you create an (mostly!) allergen-free zone at night. That gives your system a chance to recover overnight.If you're looking for a moat to defend your bedroom, consider a HEPA filter. You can set up a portable one in your room to keep the allergies down.
Another line of defense is to spread cheesecloth over the vents in your bedroom. That way, when air blows from another part of the house, you won't get as many allergens from it., Fabric, such as rugs, curtains, and cloth-covered furniture, trap all the hair, dust, and dander from your cat. They lay in wait for you to come nearby, and then they attack your system. If you limit fabrics, you give them fewer places to hide.The best options are hardwood floors, leather couches, and washable blinds. If you prefer fabric on your furniture, pick cotton.
If you must have the fluffy warmth of carpet beneath your feet, opt for the low-pile kind. It will trap less dander and allergens., Your cat can't help leaving allergens all over the house for you to find. But you can pick them up regularly. Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter so you don't release the allergens as you vacuum, and use a microfiber cloth to pick up dust without puffing much up into the air., You're probably thinking, ""Bathe my cat, are you crazy?"" Yes, most cats don't like water, but many will put up with being bathed, especially once they get used to it. Plus, it helps reduce how much dander you're exposed to. It's best to have someone else bathe the cat, such as your partner, if possible. Some groomers even take cats.Try to bathe your cat once a week. Also, it's best to have someone brush the cat regularly, such as once a day., No one likes cleaning the litter box, but if you have cat allergies, you have a legitimate excuse to get out of the task. Your allergies can be affected by cleaning the litter (and other items, like pet beds), so ask a partner to do it, if you can.If you must do the cleaning, don an allergy mask to shield yourself from dander and other allergens., After you pet a cat, whether it's one you own or not, take a trip to the sink. Try not to touch other parts of your body before your wash your hands thoroughly. If you rub your eyes, for instance, you're just transferring the allergens up there, causing a waterfall. Wash your hands in warm water and soap, scrubbing for 20 seconds., If you prefer not to take medications, you can use a saltwater rinse. You can either use a prepared nasal spray with a saline solution, or you can use something like a neti pot to flush your sinuses with saltwater. It can help rinse out the allergens., If you have allergies, you probably already know the drill. Taking a daily non-drowsy antihistamine can help reduce your symptoms. You can try cetirizine (Zyrtec), loratadine (Claritin), or fexofenadine (Allegra), to name a few.These drugs are available over the counter. If your allergies are particularly bad, your doctor may recommend a prescription antihistamine.

, On your worst allergy days, you can throw in a decongestant to the mix. Some common decongestants are pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) and phenylephrine (Contac-D). You can usually take these several times a day, such as every four hours, depending on the drug.These drugs are available over the counter.

, Steroids might sound scary, but nasal sprays with corticosteroids are generally mild. They help reduce inflammation, meaning your symptoms won't be as bad. Some examples are ciclesonide (Omnaris), mometasone furoate (Nasonex), and triamcinolone (Nasacort Allergy 24-Hour). Read the directions for how often you can use the drug, as it varies.Most of these treatments are available over the counter. However, like any drug, you should talk to your doctor before taking one of these treatments.

, If your allergies are particularly severe, you may develop asthma symptoms, which means you may start wheezing. Treatments include inhalers and injected medications. These medications are only available by prescription, so you'll need to swing by your doctor's office., Allergy shots are regular injections of small doses of allergens to help desensitize you to your allergies. They can be expensive, though, and are usually only used if other options don't work."

Avoid cold weather conditions.,
Don't swim in cold water.,
Be cautious with cold drinks and foods.,
Take over-the-counter (OTC) antihistamines.,
Consult with your doctor.,
Ask about prescription antihistamines.,
Consider other medications.",How to Deal with Cold Urticaria," If you've noticed that your skin develops an itchy rash when it's chilly, then the best precaution is to not expose yourself to cold weather conditions. This can be a challenge in northern climates, but making sure you're always dressed warmly during winter months can help a great deal. Layer your clothes and try to wear natural breathable fibers, such as cotton and wool. Always wear gloves and don't forget to cover your neck and face with a scarf.


Cold urticaria symptoms typically begin soon after skin is exposed to a sudden drop in air temperature — the majority of reactions are triggered by temperatures lower than 39°F.Damp (humid) and windy conditions seem to increase the risk and severity of cold urticaria.
Everybody with cold urticaria has different temperature thresholds, so some can get triggered by temperatures warmer than 39°F.;
, Swimming in cold water is the most common cause or trigger of cold urticaria, particularly during windy conditions.Typically the worst urticaria reactions occur with swimming in cold water because so much skin is exposed to the cold. Such a full-body reaction can lead to a massive release of histamine from skin cells, which leads to sudden hypotension (low blood pressure), dizziness, loss of consciousness and even drowning while in the water.If you have this condition, avoid swimming in natural bodies of water or unheated swimming pools.


As a general guideline, if water gives you goose bumps or causes you to shiver, then do not submerge yourself in it if you have (or think your have) cold urticaria.
The same information holds true for bathing at home. Avoid cold or even lukewarm showers and baths. Let the shower runs for a few minutes and make sure it's warm enough before jumping in.
Symptoms of cold urticaria usually appear between 5-30 minutes after cold exposure and they can last for up to 48 hours., Another activity that can trigger cold urticaria is holding and/or drinking cold beverages. Holding a cold drink (particularly one that contains ice) can trigger a very itchy rash and swelling in your hand, whereas drinking a cold liquid can cause similar symptoms to your lips, tongue, throat and esophagus.This can be dangerous because it can make breathing difficult and choking more likely. As an allergic reaction, cold urticaria causes the same symptoms as severe food allergies do.


Avoid iced, slushy and blended drinks, and don't offer to hold them for your friends or family unless you're wearing gloves.
Try to avoid ice cold foods, such as ice cream and protein shakes made with ice.
Be very cautious of taking drinks (or food) from the fridge / freezer with your bare hands. Use a towel or cloth before grabbing any cold items.
In most cases, it's not actually the coldness that directly causes the skin reaction — it's the rewarming phase of the skin that seems to trigger the itchy and burning rash.

, The main mechanism that causes allergic reactions, such as cold urticaria, is the release of histamines from mast cells located in skin, connective tissue and the linings of your mouth / throat.Histamine triggers dilation (relaxation) of blood vessels, which in term leads to inflammation and reduced blood pressure. Antihistamines are medications that block the symptom-producing release of histamine.


OTC antihistamine drugs that don't cause drowsiness include loratadine (Alavert, Claritin), cetirizine (Zyrtec) and levocetirizine (Xyzal).
For most people with cold urticaria, OTC antihistamines aren't strong enough to make much of an impact, either preventatively or as a treatment.

, If you notice your skin reacting to cold temperatures or water, then make an appointment with your family doctor or get a referral to a skin specialist (dermatologist). Cold urticaria is diagnosed by placing an ice cube on your skin for about 5 minutes.If you have the rare condition, a raised, red bump (hive) will form on your skin a few minutes after the ice cube is removed.


This process suggests that exposure to cold is required, but hive formation actually occurs as the skin temperature rises after the ice is removed.Those who don't have cold urticaria usually experience redness on their skin during the 5-minute exposure period, but it disappears soon after taking the ice away and doesn't develop into hives.
Sometimes cold urticaria is caused by an underlying condition that impacts your immune system, such as pneumonia, hepatitis or cancer.

, Although there is no cure for cold urticaria, medications such as prescription-strength non-drowsy antihistamines can certainly help. In particular, the newer H1 receptor blockers may be very effective.Research indicates that mega-dosing H1 receptor blocking antihistamines (up to 4x the standard dose) is much more effective in reducing symptoms in cold urticaria than standard-dose treatment.Talk to your doctor about the most appropriate dosage for you.


Prescription antihistamines used to treat cold urticaria include cyproheptadine (Periactin), fexofenadine (Allegra), desloratadine (Clarinex) and ketotifen (Zaditor).
Cyproheptadine also affects nerve impulses that can lead to cold urticaria symptoms.
Omalizumab (Xolair) is a strong antihistamine normally used to treat asthma, but it seems effective for cold urticaria also.

, Prescription antihistamines are the primary medications used to treat cold urticaria, but other types of drugs are sometimes used ""off-label"" for the condition. For example, doxepin (Silenor) is normally used to treat anxiety and depression, but it can also be helpful in reducing cold urticaria symptoms.Other drugs that can be helpful for treating cold urticaria include epinephrine and cetirizine, which has antihistamine-like effects.


Doxepin is a tricyclic antidepressant that can also effectively block histamine release from mast cells.
Epinephrine, also called adrenaline, is typically used to treat or combat anaphylaxis, cardiac arrest and severe asthma. It's given intravenously or by injection.
Oral corticosteroids and antibiotics also can be used as a part of the treatment.
Ask your doctor about epinephrine ""pens"" or auto-injectors (Epipen, Auvi-Q), which can be kept close by in case of severe symptoms of cold urticaria.

Evaluate your level of exposure.,
Monitor for symptoms of sub-acute farmer's lung.,
Check for acute farmer’s lung.,
Watch for repeated attacks.,
Make an appointment with your doctor.,
Schedule any necessary testing.,
Seek immediate attention for emergency symptoms.,
Take medication as prescribed.,
Avoid mold contact.,
Wear protective gear as necessary.,
Use mold inhibitors as allowed.",How to Diagnose Farmer's Lung," Farmer’s lung most often occurs in those exposed to mold spores that grow in hay, grain, and other crops, but can also impact those who work around farm animals, those who work in moldy and dusty buildings, and those that apply chemicals, paints, or solvents in an agricultural environment. Consider whether you regularly work with:Hay, corn, wheat, or other grains
Silage or silos where silage is stored
Farm animals with feathers, hair, or fur
Fish meal
Agricultural chemicals
Crop fields;
, Sub-acute farmer’s lung is more common than acute attacks, but is less intense and subsequently more difficult to recognize. Sub-acute farmer’s lung develops after continual exposure to small amounts of molding dust, with symptoms including:Coughing
Chills and a mild fever
Shortness of breath
Aching muscles and joint pain
Loss of appetite and potential weight loss

, Acute farmer’s lung occurs in about one out of every three farmer’s lung cases. The attack is generally intense and starts four to eight hours after an individual breathes in a large amount of moldy dust. Common symptoms of an acute attack include:Shortness of breath
An irritated, dry cough
A sudden feeling of sickness
Rapid onset fever and chills
Rapid breathing
Rapid heart rate

, Repeated acute attacks over a period of years can lead to chronic farmer’s lung. The chronic condition can last for months, leading to increased shortness of breath, frequent mild fevers, lethargy, and significant weight loss. It may also cause permanent lung damage that could permanently force you to distance yourself from the conditions causing the attack. If you or someone you know has had repeated farmer’s lung complications, seek medical attention immediately., Ultimately, a medical professional is the only one who can give a proper farmer’s lung diagnosis. Start by making an appointment with your family physician or general practitioner as soon as you notice symptoms.Let your doctor know what symptoms you’re experiencing, what type of exposure you think you may have had, and that you are concerned about farmer’s lung in particular. Otherwise they may consider your symptoms to be the result of another condition such as the flu or asthma.
If you or someone you know is having an acute attack that is causing a high fever or severe problems breathing, seek immediate medical help from an emergency room or urgent care facility.

, There is no one specific test to diagnose farmer’s lung. Depending upon your symptoms and your doctor’s request, you may have to submit to a blood test, a CT scan, a lung function test, an inhalation challenge test, a bronchoalveolar lavage test, or in extreme cases even an open lung biopsy.Your doctor may be able to prepare or conduct some tests, such as a blood test or an inhalation challenge test, in the office during your appointment. Other tests may require you to come back at a later date or see a specialist.
Be sure to follow through with any requested tests as quickly as possible. This allows your doctor to more accurately diagnose your condition and recommend proper treatment faster.

, Farmer’s lung can cause breathing obstructions. If you or someone you know experiences an acute or chronic farmer’s lung attack during which they are having difficulty breathing on their own, seek immediate medical attention. Do not wait for a doctor’s appointment. Instead, head immediately for an urgent care facility.

Let the doctor or attending nurse know upon arrival that the person experiencing the attack works in an agricultural environment and may have been exposed to moldy dust or other spores., A medical professional may prescribe a corticosteroid to help improve lung function following a farmer’s lung episode. Consult with your doctor or pharmacist regarding dosage and frequency of treatment, and take the medication as instructed for the full duration of treatment., The only true preventative treatment for farmer’s lung is to avoid exposure to the moldy conditions that caused the attack. Depending upon the nature of the attack, your doctor may recommend complete abstinence from the environment for a given period of time. After that, you may need to take additional precautions to prevent a future attack, including:Ensuring crops are fully dry prior to storage
Providing as much ventilation as possible in enclosed or dusty areas
Avoiding dusty work in enclosed or confined spaces
Mechanizing operations such as feeding when possible
Wearing a respirator when applying any agricultural chemicals or working with solvents
Having heating, air, and ventilation systems checked for mold in enclosed environments, When working in dusty or moldy environments, wear protective gear whenever necessary, including face masks or a respirator. Ask your employer to provide you with proper safety equipment as required by law in your area., Use mold inhibitors whenever possible to prevent dust from growing moldy. If this is not possible, consider wetting down grain or feed before moving or transferring it to prevent dust from kicking up. Remember to properly dry the grain after wetting it."

Notice any respiratory problems.,
Look for any digestive problems.,
Check for any skin exposure reactions.,
Monitor for other symptoms.",How to Diagnose Adult Onset Allergies1," If you have developed adult-onset allergies from an airborne allergen, you may notice symptoms related to the respiratory system. If the allergen is breathed in or is in the air, the symptoms can include sneezing or a runny nose.You may also experience eye problems, such as itchy or tearing eyes.
Your breathing may be affected. A cough is commonly a symptom of allergies that is overlooked. People may think they are getting a cold, but the cough is actually due to an allergy.
If you are wheezing, or have shortness of breath or a tightness in the chest, these are signs of a severe reaction. If breathing is compromised, call an ambulance or go to the emergency room immediately.;
, Some allergies can be triggered by ingesting certain substances. If the allergen is ingested, then the symptoms can also affect your digestive system. These symptoms can include vomiting, nausea, stomach upset, and diarrhea.If the reaction to an ingested allergen is severe, you may break out in hives

, You may also develop allergies to skin irritants. Skin exposure to an allergen can result in skin rashes and hives. You may also experience unusual skin itching., Other allergy symptoms may be missed because they are not commonly associated with allergies. One commonly missed symptom is fatigue. Fatigue may occur because allergy symptoms are keeping you awake or drains you so that you feel like you have no energy.Headaches from sinus pain may also be symptoms of adult-onset allergies.

"
"
Go see your physician.,
Get skin tests.,
Undergo blood tests.,
Keep an allergy diary.",How to Diagnose Adult Onset Allergies2," If you believe you have developed adult-onset allergies that can't be treated effectively with over-the-counter medications, you should go see your physician. When you see your physician, they will take a medical history and family history. Allergies tend to be common in some families. You physician will also determine if you are allergic to anything already since those with existing allergies tend to develop even more allergies.The physician will also do a physical exam and ask questions about your symptoms.

, The physician may recommend allergy testing. One kind of allergy testing may be done via skin tests. These tests can be done through a tiny prick or cut on the skin or by a very small injection just below the skin surface.A specialty physician called an allergist will most often conduct these tests for you.


Positive results are indicated by a wheal and flare reaction, which is a raised, red, itchy bump surrounded by a circular area of swelling and redness in the test area.
Most of the allergy tests are minimally painful, though the positive results will be itchy and swollen.
The risk of anaphylaxis, or a severe allergic reaction, is a risk during allergy testing. Your allergist or physician will be specially trained to manage this reaction, if it occurs.

, Another type of allergy test your doctor may suggest is a blood test. This type of test can be done to measure antibodies to allergens. Blood tests are sometimes ordered for a person who has a skin disorder that makes it difficult to skin test, for babies and very young children, or for people taking some types of medications if the doctor suspects that anaphylaxis may occur.With any allergy test, anaphylaxis is a possible risk and cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.

, There are a vast number of possible allergens that can be causing your symptoms. You can help your physician determine what you are allergic to by keeping an allergy diary. Keep track of where you are, what you are doing, and what is in your immediate vicinity when you experience your symptoms.Keeping track of where, when, and how bad your symptoms are can help narrow down the possibilities. Since one of the main treatment approaches to allergies is to avoid the allergen, keeping an allergy diary can be an effective method of both diagnosis and prevention.
For example, if you enter someone’s home who has cats and dogs, and you start to sneeze, itch, cough, or get watery eyes, chances are that cats and dogs can be at least part of the problem.
Check the pollen counts in your area when you start to have symptoms. Pollen counts are divided into the different sorts or classes of pollens. That may give you a better idea which pollens you may be allergic to.
If you begin to experience symptoms when you or someone else is dusting or vacuuming, you may have a dust allergy.
If there are certain plants that make you itch, those are potential allergens.

"
"
Avoid the allergens.,
Treat the allergies medically.,
Eliminate trigger foods.,
Use natural allergy treatments.",How to Diagnose Adult Onset Allergies3," One of the best treatments for allergies is always prevention. If you can avoid the allergen source, then you can eliminate your allergies. This is very often easier said than done, but it is an important first step.For example, if you are allergic to shellfish or nuts, you should avoid eating these foods. If you are allergic to cats, you should refrain from getting cats as a pet or limit your exposure to cats.

, Medical options for the treatment of allergies are medications, such as decongestants, antihistamines, and other medications that prevent the release of histamine and other substances involved in the allergic response.If your allergies are not too severe and seem to be respiratory, try treating them with an over-the-counter antihistamine, like diphenhydramine (Benadryl), cetirizine (Zyrtec), and loratadine (Alavert, Claritin). If your allergies improve, then continue with this treatment.
Antihistamines can cause a person to be drowsy. Make sure you know how these medications affect you before driving or operating heavy machinery. Look for non-drowsy versions of these medications to take during the daytime.
Immunotherapy can be useful in preventing allergies. These can take the form of allergy shots, which is part of a process known as desensitization. During this, you essentially train the immune system to tone down the allergic response. Depending on what you are allergic to, your physician may recommend another form of immunotherapy, such as tablets or drops that you put under your tongue.

, If you think you are allergic to a type of food, like dairy or gluten, then you will want to eliminate those foods from your diet. This will take several weeks. Work with your doctor on this to make sure you still get all the necessary nutrients. Start out by cutting the suspected foods out of your diet. Notice if your symptoms get better when you eliminate the food. Record everything you eat in a food an symptom diary.After a few weeks, slowly reintroduce the trigger food. Note any symptoms that you experience after eating the food.
This can help you identify any foods you need to permanently cut or limit in your diet.

, There are a few different ways you can treat your allergies naturally. You can try implementing dietary changes to increase the nutritional quality of your foods and emphasize nutrient rich foods. You should also avoid foods associated with increasing sensitivity to allergens, including alcohol, caffeine, dairy products, food colorings, red meat, sugar, and wheat products. There are also a number of natural treatments that you can try for your allergies. These natural approaches are dietary, herbal, homeopathic, and supplemental.If you are uncertain which herbs to take and dosage than a naturopathic physician should be consulted to evaluate total body health, allergies and interactions between existing medication.
Supplements can include the use of vitamins to boost and support your immune system. You can try supplements, such as quercetin and other bioflavonoids, that act as natural antihistamines.
Herbs can be used to specifically to treat the symptoms. For example, dong guai is a natural antihistamine. You can take homeopathic medications that depend on your specific symptoms.

Try Carob powder.,
Use Cupuaçu.,
Include chocolate milk.",How to Deal With Being Allergic to Chocolate1," Many dieticians and chefs claim that Carob tastes similar to chocolate. It has fewer calories than chocolate, contains no caffeine and has some vitamins. It is sold in pods and as a powder. Unfortunately, it cannot be eaten as a chocolate bar, but Carob powder can be substituted for chocolate or cocoa powder in equal quantities;
, This seed pod from Brazil is being used to make chocolate bars that contain no cocoa. When dried, ground and roasted, it behaves just like cocoa powder. Like Carob, Cupuaçu powder can be substituted for chocolate or cocoa powder in equal quantities.

, Some chocolate milks contain no chocolate. While somewhat disconcerting, this chocolate-free chocolate milk can supply your fix without actually eating chocolate.

Go nuts!,
Use dried fruit.,
Use candy.",How to Deal With Being Allergic to Chocolate2," When a recipe calls for chocolate, ground nuts can replace the flavour chocolate would've provided. Unsalted cashews, almonds, walnuts, peanuts, et cetera can fill the deep void left by chocolate depravity. When measuring, go for equal weights (100g chocolate = 100g almonds).

, Dried fruits such as raisins, cranberries, et cetera can be used instead of chocolate flavour. These also supply some vitamins that chocolate just can`t do. When measuring, go for equal weights (100g chocolate = 100g almonds).

, In recipes where the dish is not cooked, candy can provide the sweetness of chocolate without adding any death-inducing chocolate. While not as healthy as our above options, it can satisfy one's sweet tooth (or teeth) safely.

Stay calm.,
Rinse.,
Eat something else.,
Brush your teeth.,
Monitor.,
Recover.",How to Deal with a Non‐Lethal Allergic Reaction to Tree Nuts," Once you realize you have an allergic reaction, and from past experience you know it is not serious, take deep breaths. Inform a responsible adult that you are suffering from an allergic reaction, and that you wish to delay or not use your Epipen. Do not shout or run around needlessly. Stressing about your allergic reaction and increasing your heart rate may cause your body to overproduce chemicals such as adrenaline, and this could aggravate your condition.
, Spit out any allergy-causing food and clean your mouth with water, another liquid, or gum. Swish the liquid around in your mouth and spit it out. If you use gum, be sure to replace it often so that the food particles stuck in it do not cause you to have a reaction again., Once your mouth is clean of the food that made you sick, eat some safe food, such as fruit or vegetables. This is to help you forget the taste and texture of the food that caused the allergic reaction. Do not eat too much on your already upset stomach or you may vomit., If you still have an itching sensation in your mouth and throat, brush your teeth. Use lots of toothpaste and rinse your toothbrush often. This will help distract you from the itchy feeling, and you are getting rid of any last allergy-causing foods., The initial itchy feeling should lessen after twenty minutes and be gone in an hour. If it's getting worse after that tie, use your EpiPen or other medication. Try not to go to sleep for at least four hours in case the symptoms return. Make sure you have a responsible adult to watch your symptoms, because an outside perspective is better at noticing changes., You will probably feel sick and nauseous the next couple of days. Eat clean and safe food, like fruits, vegetables, and bread. Find out what made you sick and be sure to avoid it in the future! If in doubt, contact the hospital to find out for sure if it is gone."

It may be difficult to recognize these symptoms if you've never had a reaction before, but learning the signs to look out for will help you take the right steps that could save your life. The following symptoms are considered mild and don't require emergency medical attention. Mild symptoms, however, can progress into a more serious reaction, so monitor your condition for at least an hour after these symptoms show.Sneezing and mild coughing
Watery, itchy, and red eyes
A runny nose
Itching or redness on the skin; often this will progress into hives. Hives are red, itchy swollen areas on the skin - they can vary in size from small bumps to large welts measuring several inches (centimeters) in diameter.;
, For mild reactions with symptoms that don't progress, an antihistamine is typically the only treatment you'll need. There are a variety for you to choose from, and it would be wise to keep several in your home at all times in the event of allergies. Always take these medications as labels indicate.


Benadryl. This is most often recommended for reactions involving hives because it works fast. It can be taken with or without food and you should drink a full glass of water with each dose. Do not exceed 300mg within a 24-hour period or you risk overdose. Note that Benadryl usually causes drowsiness, so use caution if driving or operating machinery. If you experience drowsiness, stop these activities.Claritin. This is typically used to treat seasonal allergies and hay fever, though it can be effective against hives. It can be taken with or without food. It usually does not cause drowsiness, but it is still a possible side effect, so monitor your condition before driving or operating machinery. Typically Claritin should only be taken once a day.Zyrtec. Typical dosage is 5-10mg per day, with or without food. A potential side effect is confusion or impaired alertness, so use caution if driving while on Zyrtec.Allegra. This usually has to be taken on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal. You should also only drink water when taking Allegra, as fruit juices can interact with the drug. Like other antihistamines, it can cause drowsiness.There are also prescription-strength versions of these medications.
Talk with your doctor about which medication would be best for you. Some people have allergies or sensitivities to certain ingredients, so you'll want to make sure the medication is safe for you to take.

, Hydrocortisone helps reduce the swelling and itching associated with hives. There are a number of brand and generic creams containing hydrocortisone that are easily available at drug stores. Check all medication labels to ensure that any anti-itch cream you are looking at contains hydrocortisone.There are also prescription-strength varieties of hydrocortisone cream. If an OTC cream doesn't soothe your symptoms, ask your doctor about getting a prescription for a stronger dose.
You can also apply a cold towel to hives if you don't have access to hydrocortisone cream.

, Allergic reactions can start anywhere from 5 minutes to an hour after you came in contact with the allergen.Mild symptoms could possibly progress into a more serious reaction. If at any point you experience shortness of breath, itching in your mouth and throat, or trouble breathing, call Emergency Services immediately. If swelling obstructs your airway, you could asphyxiate within minutes., When your allergic reaction passes, schedule an appointment with an allergist. The allergist will test you to find out what triggered your allergic reaction and can prescribe medication or give you allergy shots to help manage your symptoms.

, Allergies can be so severe that they are life threatening because of their effect on breathing and blood circulation. The condition is called anaphylaxis and is considered by the Red Cross to be a ""treat first, then call"" emergency, due to the potential speed and severity of the reaction.

If you have multiple helpers at the scene, have someone else call emergency services while you treat for possible anaphylaxis, as described below. If not, and you see signs of a serious symptoms (see below), don't delay treatment., Depending on your allergy, your reaction may start with mild symptoms and gradually grow more serious, or symptoms start almost immediately. If you experience any of the following symptoms, you are having anaphylaxis that requires immediate treatment.Serious symptoms include swelling of the lips, tongue, or throat, shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing, drop in blood pressure, weak pulse, trouble swallowing, chest pains, nausea and vomiting, dizziness, and loss of consciousness.

, EpiPen is a device that injects epinephrine and is used to treat anaphylaxis. Take the EpiPen and hold it in the middle tightly with the orange tip pointing down.
Remove the safety cap on top, which is usually blue.
Place the orange tip against your outer thigh. You don't have to remove your pants, the needle will pierce your clothes.
Firmly press the orange tip against your leg. This will release a needle that injects the dose of epinephrine.
Hold the injector in place for 10 seconds to ensure that the full dose enters your body.
Remove the EpiPen and keep it with you so medical staff will know how large of a dose you received.
Massage the the injection site for 10 seconds to circulate the medication.
If your EpiPen is expired, you can still use it. The potency may be reduced significantly.

, Call your local emergency number immediately and be sure to tell the operator that you are having an allergic reaction. Don't risk driving yourself to the emergency room- the paramedics will have epinephrine on hand to stop the reaction.After you administer the epinephrine, you still need to seek medical help. The epinephrine will wear off after 10 to 20 minutes, and the allergic reaction can start again. Either go to the emergency room or call 911 to get further medical assistance.

, After receiving medical help and your allergic reaction passes, schedule an appointment with an allergist. He will test you to find out what triggered your allergic reaction and can prescribe medication, an EpiPen, or allergy shots to help manage your symptoms.

, You can ask your primary care doctor for a referral. If you live in the United States, you can search the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology list for a board-certified allergist.

, Sometimes the cause of your reaction will be obvious. If, for example, you ate a peanut and 10 minutes later your experienced anaphylaxis, there is a pretty clear culprit. If, however, you just went for a walk outside and experienced an allergic reaction, there are a multitude of allergens you may have encountered that triggered your attack. To help your allergist, write down everything you remember about the events leading to your reaction- what did you eat? Touch? Where were you? Did you take any medicine? These questions will all help your allergist determine the cause of your allergy., After talking with you and getting your history, the allergist will probably perform a skin test to determine what is causing your allergy. During a skin test, a drop of several potential allergens is placed on the skin, sometimes with a slight prick of the skin. After about 20 minutes, if you are allergic to a substance, a red, itchy bump will appear. This signifies to the allergist that this substance is causing your allergy, and he will treat you accordingly., Sometimes the allergist will also order an allergy blood test. This may be because you are on medication that could corrupt a skin test, you have a skin condition, or the allergist may just want confirmation of the allergy with another test. Blood tests are usually done in a lab and take several days to produce results., Even if your reaction was not severe, you should ask your allergist for a prescription for an EpiPen. Your symptoms may be worse the next time you have an attack, and having an EpiPen around could easily save your life.

, After your visit to the allergist, you will probably be aware of what substance or substances cause allergic reactions. With this knowledge, you should do all you can to avoid your allergen. Sometimes this is simple, like if you are allergic to a certain food. Other times, like if your family pet is causing allergies, this isn't so easy. Since in theory anything can cause an allergy, there is no one rule on how to avoid triggers. But there are a few prominent allergy types that have standard avoidance procedures.

, If you are allergic to a specific food, check all food labels to ensure that your allergen isn't in a food you're buying. Sometimes common ingredients aren't listed on labels, so talk with your allergist or even a dietician if you are at all unsure of something. Always inform staff at a restaurant of your allergy to avoid cross-contamination., If you are allergic to dust, remove carpeting, especially where you sleep. Clean your house regularly with a vacuum, and wear a dust mask while doing so. Use mite-proof sheets and pillow covers and wash all of your bedding regularly with hot water., If you have an animal allergy, you don't have to get rid of your family pets. You will, however, have to restrict their movements. Keep animals out of your sleeping area and any rooms you spend a lot of time in. It would also help to remove carpeting to avoid dander buildup. Also bathe your animals once a week to remove as much excess hair as possible., If you have an insect allergy, don't walk in grass barefoot and wear long sleeves and pants when working outside. Also cover any food that is outside to avoid attracting insects., Make sure every doctor you visit is aware of your allergy. Ask about alternatives for medications you are allergic to. Also be sure to wear an emergency medical bracelet to let any emergency medical staff know that you are allergic to certain drugs., You should take your EpiPen with you every time you go somewhere your allergen could be present. Having it handy could save your life if you experience a reaction away from home.

, Your allergist may recommend one or more medications to treat your allergy symptoms. These can range from OTC antihistamines to prescription corticosteroids. Whatever medications your allergist recommends, be sure to take them on schedule as he prescribes. This will help control your allergy symptoms and lessen your chances of a severe reaction., Some allergens can be treated with allergy shots, or immunotherapy. The process entails gradually desensitizing your body to the allergen by injecting small doses of it. Usually shots are given every week for a few months, and then gradually scaled back. Shots are typically given for allergens like dust, pollen, and insect venom. Ask your allergist if this is an option for you."

Do not scratch your rash.,
Choose loose-fitting clothing.,
Refrain from conducting activities that irritate skin.",How to Clear Skin of an Allergic Reaction1," While your skin is likely itchy, scratching only further irritates it, and can increase the duration of the reaction and even cause it to spread further. Do not itch or touch the affected area.Note that if scratching is particularly tempting, try wearing gloves or mittens while at home. If this is uncomfortable for you, clipping your nails can also help. Anything to delay the instant gratification of scratching deters you from indulging in the behavior.;
, Tight clothes can rub against a skin rash, further irritating the area. Wear loose-fitting clothing or, if possible, clothing that does not cover the affected area at all, such as shorts or t-shirts.


Moisture and heat of any kind can sometimes irritate a skin rash, so make sure the clothing is lightweight and made from a material that dries quickly, such as cotton.
If your symptoms are severe, a damp dressing may help. Find a soft cotton garment like a long-sleeve t-shirt or long underwear, soak it in cool water, wring it out, and then put it on. Wear a loose-fitting garment over the dressing., During the duration of the rash, activities that lead to unnecessary skin contact and sweating should be avoided.


Most contact sports - like football, rugby, and hockey - should be avoided altogether as it's hard to avoid touching and further irritating the skin.
Exercises like aerobics, running, and weightlifting can be fine. However, sweating can be harmful for a skin rash so if you choose to participate find fast-drying workout clothing that does not have too much contact with the affected area.

Read all food labels carefully.,
Discuss milk allergies with allergic children.,
Try soy milk.,
Consider almond milk.,
Try coconut milk.,
Find other methods to get the necessary vitamins and minerals.,
Use milk-free formula for infants.,
Learn the difference between milk allergies and lactose intolerance.,
Recognize the symptoms of milk allergies.,
Watch for anaphylaxis.,
Understand what foods are made from milk.,
Talk to your doctor.,
Undergo allergy testing.",How to Cope with a Milk Allergy," If you are allergic to milk, you should not drink it under any circumstance. But this means that you need to be diligent in avoiding products made with milk as well.This includes butter, buttermilk, casein, cheese, cottage cheese, cream, custard, half-and-half, sour cream, whey, and yogurt.;
, Some foods, even those marked dairy free, are made with milk or milk products. It is important that you read all labels on food products extremely carefully if you have a milk allergy.Avoid products with a “D” on them or ""dairy"" following the circled K or U for kosher. This means they contain dairy.
Make sure you read all the ingredients on food labels because sometimes products that contain milk products can still be marked dairy free. However, in the United States, all products that contain milk in them are required by law to list milk on the label.
Don’t rely on looking for advisory statements like “may contain milk” because these are voluntary and not required by federal labeling laws.Additionally, some products are exempt from these labeling laws – like foods that aren’t regulated by the FDA, cosmetics, prescription and over-the-counter medications, and pet food. Carefully inspect these products before you allow a child with a milk allergy to touch or ingest it.
Many processed meats contain milk as well.

, Milk allergies often emerge in childhood/infancy, which means that discussing this with your child is a crucial part of preventing reactions. Even if your child is very young, you need to stress the importance of avoiding milk and milk products to them.Start by explaining to your child that there are some foods that can make them very sick. You can use terms like “safe food” and “unsafe food.”
Teach them what foods are “unsafe foods.” Show them what gallons of milk and tubs of butter look like.
Tell your child that they should only eat things given to them by a trusted adult and that they should not share food or take food from other children at school. They should also be taught to find an adult for help if they start feeling sick.
This includes letting your child’s teachers and friends’ parents know about their milk allergy so that they don’t inadvertently serve your child something with milk proteins in it.

, If you can't stand to be away from milk because you love cereal in the morning, then try soy milk instead of milk from cows. Using alternatives will allow you to keep your cereal without the symptoms.Soy milk is comparable to cow’s milk as far as protein content goes. It is also lower in fat content than some of the other milk alternatives.
Some people warn against drinking too much soy milk, though, because of the various ingredients like phytoestrogen, phytic acid, and synthetic vitamin A included in the soy milk., This kind of milk alternative is fortified with calcium and B12 vitamins, so it’s a great supplement for those who have to avoid milk products. You can buy sweetened or unsweetened variations, but just be wary of too much added sugar in your diet if you choose the sweetened type of almond milk.It’s also a good source of vitamin D.

, Coconut milk is a great substitute for animal milk. It has a slightly sweet taste and can contains added calcium that your body needs. Coconut milk is typically lower in protein than other kinds of milk alternatives and has higher levels of saturated fats.This kind of milk is a little bit thinner than other kinds, so you’ll use less of it when cooking than a recipe usually calls for.

, Milk and other dairy products are an important source of many nutrients that people, especially children, need – like calcium, protein, vitamin D, etc.Try vitamin supplements to help regulate your diet.
Also try to consume more broccoli, spinach, and soy products as this will also help you maintain a well-balanced diet.

, Infants who are formula-fed will need to be given a milk-free formula, such as a casein-hydrolysate formula.Check the label carefully to ensure that it is milk-free and check with your child’s pediatrician if you are not sure., A milk allergy is a condition that affects your immune system. When you are allergic to milk (usually to specific proteins found in milk), your body views these substances as foreign invaders that need to be fought off.Lactose intolerance is a condition that affects your digestive system. It occurs when someone is unable to properly digest the proteins found in milk and other dairy products.

, If you are allergic to milk, your body will let you know through a variety of symptoms. These symptoms will probably get increasingly more severe as time goes on if you keep consuming milk. Some symptoms of milk allergies include:Wheezing
Coughing
Hoarseness
Tight Throat
Stomachache
Hives
Swelling
Vomiting
Diarrhea
Itchy or swollen eyes

, Consuming milk when you have a milk allergy can also lead to anaphylaxis, which is a medical emergency. Someone who has this type of reaction needs an emergency injection of epinephrine immediately and you will also need to call 911 (or emergency services in your country) right away. Symptoms of anaphylaxis include:Difficulty breathing due to constriction of airways and throat swelling
Facial flushing
Itching
Shock from drop in blood pressure

, If you know what items have milk in them, you’ll be better able to avoid it. Obviously, many products contain milk and milk proteins. If you fail to be cautious with the food you eat, then you could suffer from increasingly bad symptoms as a result of your milk allergy.You should also stay away from yogurt, shakes, cheese, cream, whey, and any other milk product.

, If you suspect that you or your child are allergic to milk, talk to your doctor immediately no matter how mild the symptoms. These symptoms may worsen over time, so it is important to catch the allergy in the beginning before your symptoms become too severe.Your doctor can counsel you about whether or not you are allergic, what to do if you are allergic, and how to get the proper testing to confirm that you are allergic to milk.

, Once your doctor recommends you to an allergist, you will probably get either a skin-prick test or a blood test to determine if you have a milk allergy. Both tests look for traces of immunoglobulin E antibodies, which are a sign that you do, in fact, have a milk allergy.A skin-prick test is just what the name sounds like. Your skin is pricked by a little probe containing some milk extract and the doctor waits to see if your skin reacts to it – usually within 15-20 minutes.

Wash your skin right away with cool water and soap.,
Use lotions or ointments.,
Try hydrocortisone cream.,
Use natural treatments.,
Try an oatmeal bath.,
Use cool water.",How to Clear Skin of an Allergic Reaction2," If your outbreak was caused by external contact with an allergen, clearing that allergen from your skin right away can help lessen the severity of the reaction.Avoid soap products that contain sodium laurel sulfate as this chemical often irritates an allergic reaction.Unscented, gentle cleansers such as Dove, Aveeno, Cetaphil, or Shur-clens are good options.

, Many lotions and ointments are available over-the-counter at supermarkets or drug stores that can provide immediate relief for symptoms like itching and burning. Try some of the following:


Calamine Lotion, which should be applied as needed unless otherwise directed. However, be careful not to leave calamine lotion on the skin too long as this can irritate the rash more.Aloe Vera should be applied two or three times a day until the area begins to heal., Hydrocortisone cream, sold at most drug stores and supermarkets, is available without a prescription and can provide temporary relief of skin rashes caused by allergens.


Low-strength (.5 or 1%) hydrocortisone creams are typically applied one to four times a day until symptoms begin to clear up.
Hydrocortisone cream comes in the form of an ointment, lotion, foam, liquid, gel, spray, and moist towelette. Choose whichever form you're most comfortable using, and follow the instructions on the label.Ointments tend to be more soothing to irritated skin. Lotions can sting and are best for covering larger areas.



, For some, over-the-counter lotions and creams further irritate their skin. If that's the case for you, you may want to invest in some natural remedies.


Clay can provide a cooling sensation and thus decrease the need to itch a rash. Use virgin, untreated clay. Mix the clay in a bowl or cup of water until it has a creamy consistency, dab it on itchy or irritated areas, let it dry, and then peel it off. If peeling the clay is causing any further irritation, try re-wetting the clay and gently removing with a soft, wet towel.
Apple Cider Vinegar has anti-fungal and anti-bacterial properties that relieve itching. Dab a few drops on a cotton ball or washcloth and apply to the affected area.
Peppermint or peppermint leaves can provide an instant cooling sensation that relieves irritated skin. Crush up some peppermint leaves and rub them directly on the skin.
Basil leaves contain anti-itch compounds called camphor and thymol. Rubbing fresh basil leaves on the skin can relieve some symptoms., Oatmeal's anti-inflammatory properties allow it to soothe itchy, irritated skin.An oatmeal bath can help reduce or relieve symptoms. Fill a bath with lukewarm or cold water and then add half a cup of oatmeal to it. Soak for 15 to 20 minutes.


It's best to use colloidal oatmeal, which is oatmeal ground into a finer powder. It dissolves easily and leaves less mess to clean up afterwards. If unavailable, you can grind regular oatmeal into a powder using a mixer. The oats can also be placed in a muslin bag or cheesecloth and hung in the water.Some people find adding a few teaspoons of extra virgin olive oil to their bath helps, as it is a natural moisturizer. If you choose olive oil, be careful when getting in and out of the tub as it will make the area slippery., Sometimes the simplest solutions can be the best. Wet a soft towel or washcloth with cool water and apply to the rash 2-3 times per day for 15-30 minutes.The cool water can lessen the sensation of itching and may reduce swelling as well.

"
"
Watch for a more serious reaction.,
Ask a doctor about topical corticosteroid cream.,
Try cortisone pills or shots.,
Take an allergy test.",How to Clear Skin of an Allergic Reaction3," If you are having a reaction that goes beyond mere skin irritation, you should go to a doctor right away. Some indications that you may need medical intervention include:


The rash covers a large portion of your body
The rash gets worse, rather than better, with time and home treatments
The rash lasts longer than 1-2 weeks
You show signs of infection, including increased redness or pain, swelling, and drainage of pus

, Corticosteroids are a group of medications that help treat a variety of ailments. Derived from the natural corticoid hormone found in the adrenal glands, corticosteroids have an anti-inflammatory effect on the body and this makes them excellent at combating allergic responses. Corticosteroid creams, generally used to treat skin rashes, are a variety of topical steroid creams applied directly on the affected skin. Ask your doctor which corticosteroid cream might be right for you.Only apply the cream to the area affected by the skin rash, and only as often as and where your doctor instructs you to apply it. Once or twice a day is usually all that is necessary. Apply the cream sparingly and ask your doctor approximately how much you should use. When side effects do occur, which they rarely do, it is generally from incorrect use.
Many people are wary of corticosteroid creams because of the steroid factor, but this fear is mostly unfounded. Topical steroids are very safe when used correctly, and as they are not intended for longterm use the kind of dependency associated with other kinds of steroid use is uncommon., In rare cases, if your skin doesn’t respond to corticosteroid creams, your doctor might give you a pill or cortisone injection to help reduce the reaction.If your doctor prescribes an oral corticosteroid, you should take as directed.


If you take blood thinners or dietary supplements that have a blood-thinning effect, your doctor might recommend avoiding such medications before the injection.When you receive your injection, you may have to change into a hospital gown depending on where the irritated skin is located. The area around the injection site is cleaned and an antiseptic spray may be used to numb the needle. You will likely feel pressure when the needle is inserted and the medication is then released.Some people report redness or a feeling of warmth of the chest or face after the injection. The doctor will likely want you to protect the area around the injection site for a day or two, apply ice as needed to relieve pain, and watch for signs of infection such as pain, redness, and swelling., If your allergic reactions are frequent or severe, a doctor might want to perform an allergy test. This may identify what substance is causing the allergic reaction, making it easier to avoid the substance and subsequent outbreaks in the future. There are three types of allergy tests: the skin prick test, skin patch testing, and the intradermal test.


The skin prick test involves placing a small amount of allergen on the skin, most often the forearm, upper back, or neck. The skin is pricked so the allergen goes under the surface, and your health care provider watches for signs of a reaction. Results are usually seen within 15 to 20 minutes and multiple allergens can be tested at the same time.
Skin patch testing consists of an application of various allergens to an area of skin (usually your back). The areas are covered with bandages, then reactions are evaluated a couple of days after application.The intradermal skin test involves injecting a small amount of the potential allergen to the skin. Your health care provider then watches for signs of a reaction. This test is more often used to find signs of serious allergens, such as bee venom or penicillin."
"
Identify what caused the reaction.,
Identify common household items that cause skin irritation.,
Use moisturizers or protective barriers.",How to Clear Skin of an Allergic Reaction4," As stated, an allergy test can help identify the allergen but this might not be necessary. Review your activity leading up to the reaction and see if anything obvious stands out. Poison ivy and oak, for example, are common irritants, and if you've been camping or hiking recently they may to blame. If you used any new skin products, hair products, nail products, or lotions there's a good chance these caused the reaction.


Ask your doctor for a list of products that commonly contain the substance that you should avoid.

, Most of us are too busy in our day-to-day lives to examine every ingredient on the mass of cleaning supplies and personal care products in our homes. Many chemicals used in common household items serve as skin irritants. Take stock of what's in your kitchen and bathroom cupboards, paying close attention to products that frequently cause allergic reactions. If one product stands out as particularly chemical-heavy, it might be best to toss it and opt for a more natural version. These products include:


Soaps, especially dish soaps
Household cleaners, like window cleaner and bathroom cleaners
Fabric dryer sheets and laundry detergents
Clothing, especially rough fabrics like wool
Latex
Fragrances, like perfumes and skin sprays
Facial creams
Nickel, which can be found in jewelry, watchbands, and zippers
Sunscreen

, Depending on your work situation, it might not be possible to avoid or even identify all potential irritants. Therefore, to avoid another allergic reaction, using skin moisturizers and protective barriers can help.


Use moisturizers, such as all natural lotions that include ingredients such as glycerin, hyaluronic acid, and propylene glycol. Such components are known to produce longer lasting moisturizers. Ideally, a good moisturizer can help skin stay strong and healthy, which helps fight off allergic reactions.Petroleum jelly, found in most supermarkets, can provide a protective layer over skin, lessening the exposure to irritants. It's also a good idea to put petroleum jelly over cracked, dry skin overnight to help it heal. Any open wounds or sores can increase the likelihood of skin being affected by an allergen.
Wearing a pair of thick rubber gloves when working with chemicals or cleaners can lessen the likelihood of direct skin contact and, therefore, an allergic reaction. Rubber gloves are a good investment for any household, and be sure to slip a pair on when cleaning your kitchen or bathroom.
If you do come into contact with a known or suspected allergen, time is important. The quicker you get the substance out of your system, the better. Thoroughly wash the exposed area with soap and warm water directly after exposure.

Steam clean carpets and furniture.,
Remove dust with a damp mop or rag.,
Vacuum with a HEPA filter or double-layered microfilter bag.,
Wash your bedding weekly with hot water.,
Exercise caution with chemicals.",How to Clean Dust Mites1," Dry vacuuming will not pick up dust mites from your carpets. Whenever possible, steam clean the carpets in your home. The heat from the steam will kill the dust mites, making steam cleaning a highly effective method.Steam clean your carpets and furniture at least 3 times per year.;
, Making sure your house is as dust-free as possible will help you keep dust mite populations at bay. Dry mopping or cleaning with a dry rag will only stir up dust and other allergens. Instead use a wet mop or rag to remove dust from your home.Dust and mop your home at least once per week.

, Try using a vacuum that has a HEPA filter. You can also use a vacuum with a double-layered microfilter bag. These types of filters trap particles that might otherwise pass through a vacuum cleaner’s exhaust.Vacuum your home weekly, or more often in high traffic areas.

, Once a week wash all of your bedding in water that is at least 130 degrees Fahrenheit or 55 degrees Celsius. The hot water will kill any dust mites that might be living on your bedding.If you have wool or feathered bedding that cannot be washed, replace it with synthetic items that are machine washable.

, Ascaricides are a type of chemical that is sometimes used to kill dust mites. Many experts, however, argue chemicals are not effective enough to justify the expense and hassle of using them."

Buy locally-farmed raw honey.,
Take small daily doses.,
Start early.",How to Control Allergies With Local Honey1," Favor honey made by bees who, in their travels, collect traces of pollen found in your area.Choose raw honey over processed, since processed honey is less likely to contain pollen after being heated, pasteurized, and filtered.If there are no bee farms in your immediate area, sample raw honey from elsewhere.


Visit local farmers markets or natural food stores to find locally sourced honey.Alternately, search online for the nearest bee farm.If you shop outside your area and know exactly which pollen triggers your allergies, research the farm’s location to make sure the same type of plant grows there.
If you don’t know which pollen you’re allergic to, search for the bee farm that is nearest to home to better ensure a similar environment to your own.;
, Strengthen your body’s tolerance to allergens by ingesting a little bit of honey each day. Condition yourself with a limited intake of 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of honey per day. Avoid taking more than this, since you may end up ingesting more pollen than your body can handle at present.Either consume a tablespoon by itself, or apply the honey directly to other foods, like toast.Do not use your daily dose to cook or bake. Heat may destroy the pollen in the honey, thus rendering it ineffective.
Adding honey to a hot beverage, such as tea, should be fine, since the beverage’s temperature is unlikely to be high enough to destroy the pollen.

, Expect your body to require some time to strengthen its tolerance against allergens. Do not wait for the pollen season to start before beginning your treatment. Begin as early as possible so your body has the most amount of time to adjust to daily exposure."

Keep the humidity level in your house below 50%.,
Let the sun shine in.,
Replace wall-to-wall carpets.,
Put dust-proof covers on your mattress and pillows.,
Avoid upholstered furniture.,
Opt for washable curtains.,
Choose rugs you can easily clean.",How to Clean Dust Mites2," Dust mites thrive in places with humidity levels higher than 50%. You can help keep dust mite populations at bay by making sure you monitor your home’s humidity level.Try installing a humidity monitoring device in your home, such as a hygrometer.
Consider using a dehumidifier or running the air conditioner to help control humidity levels.

, Sunlight can help keep dust mite populations at bay. Keep your curtains and windows open. You can also hang bedding or place furniture outside to expose it to sunlight., Carpet is a breeding ground for dust mites. If possible, replace wall-to-wall carpets with bare floors. For example, you can remove the carpet from your child’s bedroom and replace it with linoleum, tile, or wood., Using protective covers on your mattress and pillows can help you limit your contact with dust mites. Choose covers that are allergen proof. Make sure you launder the covers frequently., You can help control dust mites in your home by removing upholstered furniture. Instead of upholstered furniture, opt for furniture made from wood, plastic, leather, or vinyl. These materials can be easily and frequently wiped down to prevent the accumulation of dust.

, Heavy draperies can be difficult to clean and can harbor dust mite populations. Choose curtains made from washable materials, like cotton, and make sure you launder them at least several times each year.

, Go for smaller rugs that can be easily laundered. For example, choose several small rugs made of cotton or a synthetic material that can be thrown in a washing machine. Avoid large area rugs that are difficult to clean.

Take your honey “with a grain of salt.” Be aware that studies on this subject are inconclusive.,
Expect low to zero amounts of offending pollen in your honey.,
Expect more than just honey in your jar.,
Anticipate possible allergic reactions.,
Only give honey to children older than 12 months.",How to Control Allergies With Local Honey2," Some have indicated that people do experience lighter allergy symptoms thanks to honey. Others have found little to no difference in symptoms between those who use honey and those who don’t.Keep your usual allergy medication on hand in case your honey proves to be ineffective.

, Consider it highly likely that you are allergic to weeds, grasses, and/or trees. Understand that bees chiefly pollinate flowers, and are therefore unlikely to come into contact with other kinds. Even if you are in the minority of people who are allergic to flowers, be aware that bees do not intentionally bring pollen back to their hive, and so their honey may not contain enough pollen to make a substantial impact on your immune system., When buying raw honey, understand that it has not been pasteurized, heated, or filtered. Raw honey may contain bacteria and mold, as well as bee venom and body parts.Do not consume raw honey if you are allergic to bee stings., Be aware that, in addition to other possible allergens like bee venom and body parts, raw honey may possibly contain concentrated amounts of the very pollen that you are allergic to. Understand that there is no way to control or distribute the amount of pollen in raw honey. If you are extremely susceptible to allergic reactions from even small traces of pollen, avoid using raw honey as a remedy.Discontinue use if you experience swelling, itching, or hives on your skin, in your mouth, or in your throat., Never give honey (whether it’s raw or processed) to infants. Beware of toxins that may cause botulism in babies, which can be life-threatening. Seek immediate emergency care if your child shows the following symptoms after ingesting honey:Constipation, lack of appetite, and weakened muscles evidenced by loss of appetite, listlessness, feeble crying, pronounced floppiness, and a lack of strong facial expressions.

Control your daily intake.,
Buy local products.,
Test your tolerance.,
Work your way up.",How to Control Allergies With Local Honey3," Understand that bee pollen only makes up a fraction of a percent of an average sample of raw honey.Ensure that you are consuming a more sufficient amount of bee pollen each day by taking bee pollen directly instead. At the same time, eliminate the risk of dosing yourself with more than you intended, which may happen with raw honey.Although the amount of bee pollen in honey may not be effective in combating allergy symptoms, thyme honey has proven to be effective against them thanks to other ingredients.Combining processed thyme honey with local bee pollen may allow you to fight symptoms in general while building a stronger immunity to specific pollens.
Do not consume bee pollen if you know that you are allergic to bee stings or if you have suffered anaphylactic shock in the past.
Consult your doctor about using bee pollen if you are pregnant, nursing, or using blood thinners.

, Visit a natural food store or farmer's market to find bee pollen from a local source. Make sure that you are going to be consuming pollen that is found in your area, thus containing those pollens that you are allergic to. Failing a local source, purchase a bee pollen that features a wide array of colors. This indicates a wider variety of pollen types, increasing the chances that it includes the one you need.Bee pollen is available as a liquid, pill, or powder; however, best results are often found with bee pollen that hasn’t been processed., Before you begin taking daily doses, test your current sensitivity to the pollen’s ingredients. Place a very small dab of liquid, powder, or granules on the tip of your tongue and then close your mouth. Hold it there for two minutes. As long as you experience no allergy symptoms, swallow the measure. Wait another 24 hours before beginning your daily regime, just in case any delayed reactions manifest.Discontinue use if you suffer an allergic reaction to such a little amount.

, Start off with small daily doses of a half-teaspoon or even less. Pay close attention to your body to spot allergic reactions if and when they occur. As long as you are clear, slowly increase your intake over a four-week schedule, with the aim of consuming 1 to 3 tablespoons (14.8 to 44.4 ml) each day afterward.Be careful not to rush the process. If a larger amount causes allergy symptoms, cut back to an amount that proved safe and stick with that for a while before attempting another increase.

Choose hypoallergenic or anti-allergenic comforters and blankets.,
Make sure you have the right pillow.,
Pay attention to pore size.",How to Choose Non Allergenic Bedding1," This can be very important to allergy free sleep. There are some fibers and fillings that make great homes for mold, dust mites, and many are difficult to clean. Choose a hypoallergenic fiber fill that is machine washable. Pure wool or silk make excellent choices.


While hypoallergenic material decreases your risk of an allergic reaction, anti-allergy material is aimed at preventing or minimizing your allergic reaction.
You can still have a down comforter but look for a brand that cleans their down with a special process designed to remove allergens. Comforters made of fine threads of cotton, or polyester with a nylon membrane can be very useful, too.
Buy bedding that can withstand frequent washing. Bedding should be washed weekly in hot water with laundry detergent that does not contain fragrances or dyes to ensure removal of allergens. The instructions with your purchase should outline how frequently they can be washed.;
, A pillow is important to comfortably rest your head, but can also leave you waking up with a stuffy nose and watery eyes. Make sure that you choose a pillow that you can put a dust mite encasing on. Natural latex, wool, or silk fills are naturally resistant to dust mites, mold and bacteria but are not typically washable. A natural memory-foam pillow will be naturally resistant to dust mites but can be susceptible to mold and or mildew., The average pore size refers to the size of the openings in the fabric. This can be a good indicator of how likely it is to allow allergens in or keep them out. The smaller the pore size the size, the more allergens will be kept at bay. Membrane bedding offers the best protection for severe allergy sufferers. Many times bedding comes with an inner, non-porous layer that prevents any allergens from getting through. This is also breathable and waterproof bedding and makes a great purchase for chronic allergy sufferers.
Membrane free bedding will block most allergens while at the same time remaining a very breathable material. This will not have the non-porous layer so you will want to pay attention to the pore size to know what types of allergens you are susceptible to. Pet dander is typically 2.5-10 microns, mold spores 10-30 microns, and dust mites 250-300 microns.

Determine whether or not you need to replace your mattress.,
Pay attention to what's on the inside.,
Purchase dust mite encasings for your mattress.",How to Choose Non Allergenic Bedding2," A good-quality dust mite-resistant mattress cover might be sufficient, but if not, or if you're planning to purchase a new mattress for other reasons, consider a latex mattress which is so impervious to dust mites that you probably won't need a dust mite-resistant mattress cover. Latex mattresses are also resistant to mildew, mold, and bacteria. Mattresses made from organic wool are also considered by some to be a good choice because organic wool is naturally resistant to fire and mold, in addition to dust mites.Avoid chemicals as much as possible when selecting allergy-free bedding items. Try to avoid flame retardants, pesticides, and synthetic fibers that are usually found in conventional mattresses.

, Coil and spring mattresses are the worst choice for an allergy sufferer. These inside spaces create fertile ground for allergen inducing creatures like dust mites to live and reproduce. Also avoid fluffy pillow top mattresses as these create fertile ground for allergens to be stored and reproduce. Instead choose memory foam or latex mattresses.

, The encasings, which resemble standard zippered pillow and mattress covers, will trap any dust mites inside.Look for brands made of fabric with a pore size of less than 100 microns, which is the average size of a dust mite.To be an effective barrier against dust mites, the encasings should have an average pore size of 6 microns or smaller. The dust mites themselves are typically no smaller than 100 microns, but their feces can be much smaller.

Simplify your space.,
Keep pets out of your bedroom.,
Invest in a good filter.",How to Choose Non Allergenic Bedding3," Various allergens can be reduced in your bedding by taking measures in your bedroom. Extra things like throw pillows, stuffed animals, and a bevy of other decorative accents to your bedding can just give allergens more places to live and to seep into your bedding. Get rid of these extras to cut down on allergens., Many people love sleeping with their pets, but having them in your bed can just exasperate the presence of allergens that they likely carry. If you find yourself waking up suffering from allergy symptoms every morning, it may not be your bed but your furry friends. , A lot of allergens that end up in your bedding are airborne. Purchasing a HEPA air purifier and a HEPA vacuum cleaner can greatly reduce how often these pop up.


A filter can do a lot of work but make sure to clean your room regularly. A steam cleaning can kill many allergens and regularly disinfecting surfaces using non-trigger creating chemicals can also help greatly.

Avoid the ragweed species you know you’re allergic to.,
Check a pollen tracker.,
Protect yourself, especially during high-pollen periods.,
Change your clothes after being outside.,
Use dryers.,
Install a HEPA filter.,
Consider moving.",How to Deal with Ragweed Allergy1," There are 50 different species of ragweed. If you have a ragweed allergy, you may be allergic to one or several ragweed species. In order to best deal with your ragweed allergy, find out which specific species you’re allergic to, and take extra caution to identify and avoid those types of ragweed.You might be able to identify the specific ragweed pollen you’re allergic to by talking to a doctor or by having firsthand exposure to different sorts of pollen, then remembering later that you had an allergic reaction to it.
Common ragweed species include sage, mugworts, rabbit brush, burweed march elder, marigolds, zinnias, sunflowers, and groundsel bush.Ragweed plants tend to grow in rural areas and spaces of urban decay. It is found in all regions of the US, but they are most common in the east and Midwest.
If you don’t know which ragweed plants you’re allergic to, simply avoid all ragweed plants.;
, Pollen trackers will help you know when your locale will experience high-pollen periods. You can use an online service, such as the National Allergy Forecast, or you may be able to see one on the local news. Pollen counts vary from season to season. They also fluctuate based on the time of day. Ragweed pollen counts are highest during late summer and early fall in the morning, just after dawn. Ragweed usually blooms around the beginning of August, but you might experience ragweed allergy as early as July. The seasonal ragweed pollen peak is around September. The season can last until October.
Low temperatures (below 50 degrees Fahrenheit or 10 degrees Celsius) and rain can limit the impact of ragweed pollen during allergy season.The time of day can also affect your allergy. Pollen levels are high between 10 AM and 4 PM.

, Keep your windows and doors tightly closed during ragweed allergy season. When you go outside, wear long sleeves and glasses (sunglasses or prescription eyeglasses). Avoid yard work like mowing the grass and raking the yard that could kick up ragweed pollen.Spend time in an area with central air. Central air conditioning allows you to minimize your exposure to outside air. If you have a window air conditioner, set it to “recirculate” or close the vent., If you do find yourself outside for some reason during ragweed allergy season, be sure to remove your clothes as soon as possible once you’ve returned home. Place the potentially pollen-coated clothes in your laundry bin. This will keep you from tracking ragweed pollen all over your home, thereby preventing future allergic reactions.You may even want to shower and wash your hair after you come in. This will make sure that the pollen does not transfer to your new clothing.
If you have a pet that goes outside, they should be given regular baths to keep you from being negatively affected by pollen that has become attached to the pet’s coat.

, Instead of drying your clothes on the line in your backyard, use your dryer. This will prevent you from getting ragweed pollen on your clothes as they dry outside.If you don’t have dryer unit of your own, visit your local laundromat.

, A high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter can help block allergens and pollen from being circulated in your home. These filters can be bought at many grocery stores and hardware stores. They are easily installed in your air vents. They must be changed every three months.

While most HEPA filters are screens that you install in your air vents, you can also purchase a machine that will actively filter your air for you, removing pollen and other allergens from your home.

, If you live in a high-pollen area, ragweed allergies can seriously impact your day-to-day activities. Consult your family about making a move to a ragweed-free area, or an area with less ragweed pollen.In the United States, the worst places for ragweed allergies are in the rural parts of the east (including the Carolinas, Mississippi, and Tennessee) and the Midwest (including Michigan and Kansas). Try moving to New England, Florida, Alaska, or a west-coast state instead.If you don’t want to move, pass the late summer and early fall in an area outside the high-pollen areas that afflict you.

Consult a doctor.,
Get an immunotherapy treatment.,
Take antihistamines.,
Try a pump-bottle nasal steroid spray.,
Try a pressurized nasal spray can.",How to Deal with Ragweed Allergy2," Only your doctor is capable of identifying potential treatments for your ragweed allergy. Using knowledge of your specific medical history, your doctor will be able to prescribe medications or recommend lifestyle changes that might help you deal with your ragweed allergy. You may even want to ask your doctor for a referral to an allergist, who can provide special attention to your ragweed allergy.


Your doctor or allergist will confirm your allergy using a skin test. The skin test involves pricking the skin to apply the ragweed allergen under your skin, then waiting about 15 minutes to see if you exhibit an allergic reaction.
If the skin turns red, swollen, and itchy, your doctor will realize that you have a ragweed allergy. If the doctor is unsure, they might draw a blood sample to examine the blood for antibodies.

, Immunotherapy treatments are medical interventions designed to prevent or treat a disease by encouraging an immune system reaction. In the case of ragweed allergy, there are two treatments that could help you.You could get an allergy shot. Allergy shots for ragweed can help you build resistance against the allergy.
Alternately, you might be able to get prescription medication that could help you manage your allergy. Ragweed allergy medications are typically in the form of tablets and need to be taken 12 weeks prior to the beginning of the ragweed season.
If provided medication, your doctor will inform you of how to use it. Always follow your doctor’s directions when taking medication.

, Histamine is the biological compound produced by your body prior to an allergic reaction. It causes sneezing, a stuffy or runny nose, and watery eyes. Antihistamines are a class of drugs that repress your body’s histamine production, stopping your ragweed allergy dead in its tracks. If your doctor believe that you would be a good candidate for antihistamines based on your medical history, they will write a prescription for you.You might also have success combating your ragweed allergy by using over-the-counter antihistamines like Claritin (loratadine) or Zyrtec (cetirizine).The most popular antihistamines based on their cost, safety, and efficacy are loratadine, fexofenadine, and cetirizine.Antihistamines are typically offered as pills or tablets. Take only as prescribed.

, Prescription nasal steroid sprays can suppress the immune system’s overreaction to the ragweed pollen and help you live a life free of ragweed allergy symptoms. To use a nasal steroid spray, blow your nose to clear it of mucus.Typically, your nasal spray will come in a pump bottle. In this case, remove the cap and shake the bottle.
Prime the bottle by spraying once or twice into the air to ensure the bottle is spraying. Then, tilt your head forward and slowly breathe out.
Put the bottle’s tube up one nostril. Press the thumb of the hand you’re not holding the bottle with against the nostril opposite the one receiving the spray.
Support the spray bottle with your thumb and use your middle and index fingers to squeeze down on the spray pump while breathing in deeply., Like their pump bottle counterparts, pressurized nasal sprays suppress the immune system to limit your allergic reaction. Shake the canister before use and ensure the canister fits in the holder. Keep your head upright and exhale slowly.Place the delivery end in one nostril. Hold the spray between your thumb and index finger of the hand that corresponds to the nostril that will receive the spray.
For instance, if you’ll spray the medicine in your right nostril, you should spray the medicine into your nostril with your right hand. Close your opposite nostril with the index finger of your opposite hand. Squeeze the bottle and breathe in simultaneously.
The number of times you’ll need to pump the nasal spray depends on the strength of your medicine. Consult your doctor’s prescription for more specific directions.

Treat your nasal problems.,
Take care of your itchy throat.,
Reduce your eye irritation.",How to Deal with Ragweed Allergy3," Sneezing, runny noses, and stuffiness are some of the most common ragweed symptoms.If you’re experiencing any of these problems, you could try any number of over-the-counter decongestants to minimize these symptoms.Always consult your doctor before taking over-the-counter drugs for allergies. Exercise extra caution if you have high blood pressure, glaucoma, prostate problems, or a heart condition.
Side effects of decongestants include nervousness, elevated blood pressure, arrhythmia, and insomnia.
Men with an enlarged prostrate might have difficulty urinating when using decongestants.
Some over-the-counter drugs are not meant to be taken long term. Always read the label for the proper dosage information.

, A sore, itchy, or otherwise irritated throat often accompanies ragweed allergy.One way to deal with this is to get over-the-counter medicines like guaifenesin or a liquid cough syrup like Benylin, Delsym, or Robitussin. These liquid cough syrups suppress the urge to cough using the active ingredient dextromethorphan. Additionally, throat lozenges can help relieve your irritated throat.Lozenges are available in many flavors, including cherry, grape, and mint. Find one that you like.

, Look for eye drops that contain the ingredients tetrahydrozoline and naphazoline. These ingredients combat inflammation in the eye’s blood vessels. Brand-name versions of these drugs include Clear Eyes and Visine. There are also antihistamine eye drops like Zaditor and Alaway that suppress allergic reactions in your eyes, but these need to be applied with greater frequency than eye drops containing tetrahydrozoline and naphazoline.Specific use for eye drops typically requires leaning your head back, holding the eye drop bottle above your eye, then gently squeezing one drop into each eye at regular intervals.
Use eye drops only as directed.

Slide the plastic covering off of the top valve on your tank.,
Line up the regulator with the top valve on the tank.,
Tighten the regulator around the nozzle.,
Attach the tubing to the nozzle on the bottom of your regulator.",How to Use an Oxygen Tank1," There may be a plastic sheath that fits around the top nozzle on your oxygen tank. Before you can attach the regulator to the tank, you'll have to remove it. Usually, you can simply slide the piece off or you may have to peel it away from the nozzle., The regulator will look like a cylindrical component with a gauge on it that reads the oxygen pressure. Inside of the regulator, there are two pins that will line up with the top nozzle on your tank. Position the regulator over the top valve of the tank and line up the pins to fit into the holes in your regulator., Twist the lever clockwise on the tank to tighten it around the valve. As you twist the lever, you should begin to feel it tightening around the oxygen tank. Continue twisting until the regulator is tight and the lever doesn't turn anymore., Find the small nozzle on the bottom of your regulator. This nozzle is where the air travels and you'll have to attach plastic tubing to it. Line the tubing up with the nozzle and firmly press up so that the tubing fits snugly around the regulator nozzle."
"
Unscrew the top valve one full turn.,
Watch the needle on the gauge go up.,
Adjust the level of oxygen coming through the tank.,
Insert the prongs on your cannula into your nostrils.,
Replace your nasal cannula every 2-4 weeks.,
Turn the tank off when you're not using it.",How to Use an Oxygen Tank2," A tool should have come with your oxygen tank that can fit over the top valve on the gas tank itself. Position the wrench over the valve and turn it counter clockwise to open up the airflow from the tank to the regulator., When you unscrew the valve on the top of the tank, you should see the needle move, signifying that there's air coming through your tank. You should also hear and feel oxygen coming through the tube that you connected to the regulator., Your doctor should have informed you of the number that you should keep your regulator at. Follow their instructions and adjust the level of oxygen by turning the dial on the side of the regulator up or down. On the dial, you should see numbers. Move the dial until the number lines up with what your doctor told you.Never change the level of oxygen unless instructed by your doctor.

, The cannula is the small tubing that fits inside of both your nostrils. Put the parts where the air is coming out into your nose and stick the rest of the tubing up and over your ears. This will keep it in place as you walk around. Sometimes your oxygen tank will come with a full oxygen mask.

If you have a facemask, place the mask over your mouth and nose and put the straps on the mask behind your ears.

, Using the same cannula for over a month will make you more prone to infections. For the same reason, you should also change your cannula after you've been sick. Your tubing will also need to be replaced every 3-6 months., Turn the valve clockwise on the top of your tank to turn off the airflow. This will prevent you from wasting oxygen whenever the tank isn't in use.Consult with your doctor to determine how often you should be using it and when you should turn it off."
"
Change the oxygen tank when it goes under 200 psi.,
Don't go near any open flames.,
Call your doctor if you are traveling.",How to Use an Oxygen Tank3," Look at the gauge on the regulator and keep an eye out for when the needle starts to drop into the lower numbers. This means that your tank is starting to run out of oxygen and needs to be replaced. Make sure to replace the canister before the needle dips under 200 psi., Oxygen tanks are incredibly flammable and can explode if the tank's air is exposed to an open flame. Do not smoke cigarettes, go near fires, or cook while attached to your oxygen tank.An electrical razor can create sparks, so don't use one when you're attached to oxygen.

, Contact your doctor and inform them that you're traveling so that they can give you special instructions for your trip. Also, you may need to get another prescription for oxygen if you're taking a longer trip.If you plan on flying, contact the airliner before the day of your flight and let them know that you use an oxygen tank.

Recognize the possible symptoms of ozone pollution impacting your health.,
Be aware of the less obvious yet serious impacts.,
Be aware of which members of your family might be more sensitive to ozone pollution.,
Keep informed.",How to Understand the Impacts of Ozone Pollution on Human Health," If you or your family are experiencing the following symptoms on a smoggy or polluted day, it might be the result of ozone pollution:


It is more difficult to breathe deeply and vigorously
Shortness of breath and pain when taking a deep breath
Coughing and sore or scratchy throat.;
, These effects may lead to increased school absences, visits to doctors and emergency rooms, and hospital admissions. These can include:


Inflamed and damaged lung lining
Lungs are more susceptible to infection
Aggravates lung diseases such as asthma, emphysema, and chronic bronchitis.
Increased frequency of asthma attacks
Continues to damage the lungs even when the symptoms have disappeared.
Research also indicates that ozone exposure may increase the risk of premature death from heart or lung disease.

, Some people are more sensitive to ozone than others. Sensitive groups include:


Children
People with lung disease, such as asthma, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis; and older adults
Even healthy adults who are active outdoors can experience ozone’s harmful effects.

, To protect your health and that of your family and community, there are some key things that you can do. Listen for information about smog alerts and follow instructions. And if you are in the United States, read what to do on an Ozone Air Quality Action Day.

"
Record your symptoms.,
Consult with your doctor.,
Consider your overall health.,
Follow your doctor’s pre-op eating instructions.,
Avoid certain medications.,
Ask a friend to drive you home.,
Learn about biopsies performed with needles.,
Inquire about thoracoscopic biopsy.,
Learn about open lung biopsies.",How to Undergo a Lung Biopsy," If you think you may have a problem with your lungs, you should write down what symptoms you are experiencing. Keep a journal over a period of several days or weeks so that you can show your doctor a detailed account of what you’ve been feeling lately.

This will help your doctor make an informed decision about whether or not you need a lung biopsy.
Keep track of things like difficulty breathing, localized pain, shortness of breath, fever/chills, and coughing up blood.
There are also online symptom trackers and apps for your phone that you can use to record your symptoms and show to your doctor later.;
, Talk to your doctor about any concerns you might have about your overall health, or your lungs specifically. Bring your symptom records and discuss them with your doctor.Your doctor may ask you to do some preliminary tests before deciding that a biopsy is necessary. This could include chest X-rays, CT scans, an MRI, chest ultrasound, bronchography, chest fluoroscopy, or a positron emission tomography (PET) scan.

, As with any medical procedure, there are some risks involved with a biopsy, especially if you undergo a surgical biopsy with anesthesia. Your doctor will help you decide if having a biopsy is the right decision for you.Possible risks include air leaks, blood loss, infection, or injury to the lung.
People with chronic illnesses (like diabetes) or repressed immune systems may be at a higher risk for complications.

, Your doctor will probably ask you to refrain from eating or drinking in the six hours prior to the procedure. Make sure you follow these instructions to the letter.If you are diabetic, not eating for six hours could complicate your insulin schedule. Make sure you discuss this with your doctor ahead of time.

, In general, you should be able to maintain your regular medication schedule before the procedure; however, be sure to avoid any blood thinners or insulin medications, except as expressly permitted by your doctor.Tell your doctor about all of the medications you are taking beforehand – this includes prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, herbal supplements, and vitamins.

, After the biopsy, it’s likely that you may feel a little lightheaded or woozy, so it would be a good idea to ask a trusted friend or family member to drive you home after the procedure. This is especially true if you have a surgical or thoracoscopic biopsy.It might be unsafe for you to drive under these circumstances, so it’s better to be safe than sorry. And some medical facilities may not allow you to leave until you have a person who has agreed to drive you.

, Many lung biopsies are done by sticking a long, thin needle into the lung tissue from the skin outside. The doctor must carefully insert the needle between the ribs and into the lung tissue, then extract a tiny portion of the tissue for analysis.This is one of the easier biopsy methods to recover from, as it is less invasive than surgical biopsies and often does not require anesthesia.

, In this type of lung biopsy, an endoscope tune is inserted into the chest cavity (in close proximity to the lung) through the chest wall. This includes a small camera that the doctor can use to direct the biopsy. A biopsy tool may then be inserted in the endoscope in order to retrieve some lung tissue.During this process, it is also possible for the doctor to remove small nodules or tissue lesions.
This procedure is also sometimes called a video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) biopsy.

, For this type of procedure, you’ll need to be given a general anesthetic. Once you are anesthetized, the doctor will make a small incision in the chest skin and surgically remove a piece of the lung tissue.If you have an open biopsy, you will be required to stay in the hospital for a short recover period.

Be aware there is no cure.,
Undergo oxygen therapy.,
Take medication.,
Get tested for TB.,
Get vaccinated.,
Undergo surgery.",How to Treat Silicosis1," Silicosis cannot be cured. The condition causes damage to your lungs that cannot be reversed. Treatment aims to alleviate symptoms and improve overall quality of life. The treatment also will try to slow the progression of the disease.As you age, the damage to your lungs will worsen. However, with proper treatment, this can be slow and take a long time.;
, If your breathing is significantly affected because of the silicosis, you may be given oxygen therapy. This may be short-term or long-term. You may be put on a mechanical ventilator or given a small portable oxygen machine.Your lung function and the severity of the damage to your lungs will dictate whether or not you receive short-term or long-term oxygen treatment.

, There are different medications you may be given depending on your symptoms. One common medication is a bronchodilator, which helps to increase your airways so you can take in more air and breathe easier.Sometimes, silicosis leads to chest infections. If this occurs, you will be given antibiotics to help treat the infection.
If you are coughing up a lot of phlegm, your doctor may give you medication to help, like steroids.

, When you have silicosis, you are at a higher risk for Tuberculosis. Contracting TB can cause many complications for you, impede your ability to breathe, and increase lung damage. You should have regular TB tests to screen you for TB.Talk to your doctor about how often you should schedule TB tests.

, Silicosis makes you more vulnerable to respiratory diseases. To help reduce your risk of contracting one of these diseases, you should get yearly flu and pneumococcal vaccinations.Since pertussis (whooping cough) is on the rise in some areas, stay protected with a ""Tdap"" vaccine every 10 years (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis)., In extreme cases, you may need a lung transplant. This is only occurs if the lung damage is severe and your condition is progressing rapidly or aggressively. This procedure is very rare for silicosis, and your doctor and care team will only suggest this after every other treatment option has been exhausted."

Use elderberry tea or syrup.,
Try Echinacea.,
Add garlic to your food.,
Sip on some ginger tea.,
Take a multivitamin.,
Ask your doctor about Mucomyst.",How to Treat Pneumonia Naturally1," Elderberry is often used to treat respiratory infections, so it might be helpful for pneumonia.You can take elderberry as a tea or as a syrup. Make sure that you follow the manufacturer’s instructions for use.


To make a cup of elderberry tea, you will need about three to five grams of dried elderberry flowers. Place the dried elderberry in a mug and then pour boiling water over it. Steep the tea for about 10 to 15 minutes and then strain the tea. You can drink up to three cups of elderberry tea per day.If you purchase an elderberry syrup, then make sure that you read and follow the manufacturer’s instructions. A typical dose is four tablespoons taken three times per day.;
, Echinacea is often used for colds because it has both antibacterial and antiviral properties.Keep in mind that you should not use Echinacea for more than seven days at a time.


Try taking 300 mg of powdered Echinacea three times daily for about one week. Do not take Echinacea for more than 10 days., Garlic has antimicrobial and immune-boosting properties, so it may also help with pneumonia.Fresh garlic is best, so try adding a few cloves of minced garlic to your chicken soup and other foods.


You can also try making a garlic tea if you like the taste of garlic. Mince a few cloves of garlic and place the garlic in a mug, then pour eight ounces of boiling water over the mug and steep for about 10 to 15 minutes before drinking the tea.

, Ginger is a warming herb, so it may help to loosen up mucus and speed your recovery. Ginger also has antiviral properties.Try making a ginger tea by peeling and chopping a one inch piece of fresh ginger. Then, add the ginger to a mug and pour boiling water over the ginger. Let the ginger steep for about 10 to 15 minutes and then sip the tea slowly.


You can drink a few cups of ginger tea every day until you are fully recovered. Ginger is also safe for pregnant women and children when taken as a tea.

, Taking a daily multivitamin can provide you with some extra nutritional insurance while you recover from pneumonia. Try to find a supplement that provides at least 100% of your recommended daily allowance of vitamins and minerals. A higher percentage of some vitamins may be appropriate, as you are recovering from an illness and may need more of a boost.


Be careful with fat-soluble vitamins, such as vitamins A, D, E, and K, as they are stored in fat and may remain in your body for a long time, making it possible to overdose. This is not common, as it takes time and very high doses for the vitamin to reach toxic levels, but you should be aware.
If your multivitamin contains minerals like zinc, make sure you take no more than 200 mg daily to avoid toxicity.

, Your doctor can prescribe n-acetyl cysteine for you to use in a nebulizer. N-acetyl cysteine is a natural antioxidant that can help to break up mucus; however, Mucomyst requires a prescription, so you will have to talk to your doctor."

Try to change your breathing pattern.,
Soothe irritated muscles by drinking cold water.,
Eat a spoonful of something sweet.,
Try something sour.,
Compress your chest.,
Eat slowly.,
Consume less alcohol and carbonated drinks.,
Avoid hot and spicy foods or drinks.,
Reduce stress.,
Get medical attention if your hiccups last for more than 2 days or interfere with your ability to eat and sleep.,
Tell your doctor if you are on any medications that might be causing your hiccups.,
Know what to expect at the doctor’s office.,
Discuss treatment options with your doctor.",How to Treat Hiccups," This may help your diaphragm to relax and stop spasming.Hold your breath for several seconds. It doesn’t need to be long, just enough to start a new breathing rhythm. Do not hold so long it that it starts to get uncomfortable or you feel dizzy. Children with hiccups can try this method.
Breathe into a paper bag. This will make you concentrate on breathing slowly and deeply, helping your diaphragm to stop spasming.
It is unclear whether scaring someone or startling them will actually cure the hiccups, but if it makes you gasp and change your breathing, it might.
Smelling salts may also help cause breathing pattern changes.;
, This is particularly likely to be helpful if you got the hiccups from eating too quickly. This method will also work for children. If you have an infant with the hiccups try either breast feeding or bottle feeding the baby.
When you feel your throat tightening as a hiccup comes on, drink small sips of water. The water will soothe your muscles and force you to change your breathing patterns as you swallow. It might not work on the first sip, so keep drinking until it does.
Some people say you have to drink upside down from the wrong side of the cup. While this isn’t scientifically proven, it will probably cause you (and everyone around you) to laugh, which will change your breathing pattern.
Gargle with cold water. This will also force you to change your breathing rhythm. But be careful not to choke if you hiccup in the middle. This is only appropriate for adults and children old enough to gargle without choking.

, This will activate your salivary glands and cause you to change your breathing rhythm as you swallow.Use honey or sugar. But don’t give an infant honey or sugar. Infants may also get hiccups, and like hiccups in older people, they are usually harmless and will go away on their own., This will also stimulate your salivary glands and make you swallow.Bite into a lemon or take a spoonful of vinegar.
Tickling the roof of your mouth or pulling on your tongue may have a similar effect. Don't try this on an infant., This technique hasn’t been medically tested, but it may help when you change your posture and force your diaphragm into a different position.Curl forward to compress your chest.
Or alternatively, fold your knees up into the fetal position.
Hold this position for a few minutes to see if it helps. If it doesn’t, straighten up and breathe deeply.
A child can try changing his or her position, but don't try to compress the chest of a hiccuping infant.

, Eating too fast can cause you to swallow air and disrupt your breathing patterns. Take smaller bites and chew your food well before you swallow.
Wash your food down with sips of water to prevent it from getting stuck in your throat and causing hiccups.
Don’t over eat.

, Drinking too much of either may give you hiccups.


Intoxication may cause hiccups.
Carbonated beverages make you swallow air and may irritate the muscles of your throat, causing hiccups.

, The temperature change and the spices may irritate your throat causing hiccups.If you really enjoy spicy foods, be sure to drink lots of water with it to help prevent or stop hiccups.

, Frequent short bouts of hiccups can be a reaction to stress or emotional excitement. If you are prone to hiccups, try some common methods to reduce stress.Get at least 8 hours of sleep
Exercise daily
Try meditation

, If you have hiccups that don’t go away, it could be a sign of another underlying condition. Your doctor will check you for several types of conditions:Damage or irritation affecting the nerves that go to your diaphragm. Possible causes include something irritating your eardrum, a tumor, cyst, or goiter in your neck, and throat irritation or infection.
A nervous system disorder affecting your brain. This could make your body unable to control the hiccup reflex. Possible conditions include encephalitis, meningitis, multiple sclerosis, stroke, trauma, and tumors.
Metabolic disorders such as diabetes, kidney failure, or an electrolyte imbalance.
Respiratory problems such as asthma, pneumonia, or pleurisy.
Gastrointestinal disorders like gastro-esophageal reflux or inflammatory bowel syndrome.
Alcoholism.
A psychological stressor such as shock, fear, or grief.

, This includes:


Anesthesia
Corticosteroids to reduce inflammation
Sedatives to prevent seizures (benzodiazepines) or prevent anxiety (barbiturates)
Pain medications (opioids like morphine)
High blood pressure medications (methyldopa)
Chemotherapy medications used to treat cancer

, Your doctor will probably do various tests to try to identify if you have an underlying health condition that is causing the hiccups. Your doctor will likely:Test your balance, reflexes, and senses.
Conduct a blood test to look for an infection, diabetes, and monitor your kidney function.
Order chest x-rays, CT scans, or an MRI to check that there are no conditions that may be interfering with the nerves going to your diaphragm.
Do an endoscopy to thread a tiny camera down your throat and look at the inside of your esophagus or airway.

, If your doctor identifies an underlying condition, then he or she will treat you for that. If nothing is identified, there are still a few other options.Medications against hiccups such as chlorpromazine, haloperidol, baclofen, metoclopramide, and gabapentin. However, it is unclear how effective these medications are.An injection of an anesthetic to calm the phrenic nerveSurgically inserting a small device that stimulates the vagus nerveAlternative medicine techniques like hypnosis or acupuncture may also bring relief"

Decide what kind of absinthe you want to make.,
Prepare your ingredients and the place where you'll be preparing the absinthe.,
Add the ingredients and the alcohol to mason jars or similar glass vessels that can be sealed.

,
Store the bottle in a dark warm room for 2 weeks to 2 months to let the Artemisia absinthium and other herbs infuse adequately into the alcohol.,
Take your mixture and strain all of the herbs from it with a cheesecloth, coffee filter, or similar material.,
Use much less wormwood, preferable petite (to minimize bitterness).,
It's easier to make a separate batch of ""flavor absinthe"" instead of putting the herbs directly into the distilled absinthe.,
The mixing process is of utmost importance.,
Bottle, and, since you probably don't know how to age it, enjoy.

,
Enjoy using your preferable absinthe ritual.

",How to Make Absinthe," Absinthe is always made with what is referred to as ""The Holy Trinity"" which consists of wormwood, anise, and fennel, but authentic wormwood can be chosen that does not contain thujone. Absinthe that does not contain thujone should be much safer than absinthe that contains thujone. Choose a final absinthe color. Color is imbued to the absinthe during the herbal maceration. Green absinthe is made using green herbs such as mint and petite wormwood. The chlorophyll from these herbs is extracted into the absinthe. Red absinthe can be made by excluding the green herbs and using red herbs such as paprika which gives it a more spiced flavor as well. The oils from the anise and fennel seeds will contribute to the louche effect (the cloudiness produced when water is added to absinthe).;
, Use about 1/3 cup or less of herbal ingredients per 750ml alcohol base. Wash your hands, the surface you'll be working on and your herbs. Chop, crumble, or grind the herbal ingredients. The wormwood can be chopped or crumbled (if not ground). A mortar and pestle can be used for grinding herbs such as anise seeds. The herbal constituents will be more efficiently extracted from herbs that have been ground up or finely chopped.

,, This process is called maceration, and the duration will directly influence the flavor. Too long, and the flavors will be muddy and bitter; too short, and there won't be enough flavor.

, The resulting liquid will most likely be brown and bitter. In order to make 'real' absinthe, a distillation process is necessary to boil away the bitterness. The distillate will be clear and have much less flavor. Once you have this ""absinthe blanche"", you can make it your own with a second maceration process. This second maceration will give the absinthe its true flavor and color.

, Since this will not be distilled, it will add strong flavors and natural color. Be creative, add flavors you enjoy. Macerate to taste, not two months. Too much maceration will bitter your batch.

, This way, you can even make an ""anise"" alcohol, ""fennel"" alcohol, and ""mint"" alcohol, and mix them independently to personal preference. This way, you can alter the recipe in 'real time' as you taste it. Otherwise, you have to wait another week or so for the maceration.

, You will mix your distillate with your flavoring, at the same time diluting the mixture with either vodka or water. Mix it up, taste a little, and then mix whatever is necessary. Too much alcohol (distillate) and the concoction will burn like a strong liquor. Too much flavor (macerate) and the drink will be too bitter as the flavor sticks to the tongue. You can also sweeten the absinthe at this time, with anything from sugar to sweet-n-low to corn syrup.,,"

Eliminate your exposure to silica.,
Stop smoking.,
Stay away from lung irritants.,
Treat respiratory difficulties.,
Join a support group.",How to Treat Silicosis2," One thing your doctor will ask you to do is to stay away from silica and quartz dust. This may mean you have to quit your job or stop certain activities, like sandblasting or working with ceramics or glass.Continued exposure to silica dust can worsen your condition and make it progress faster.Your doctor may refer you to a counselor to help you make the transition between jobs if you are having difficulty.

, If you smoke, you should work with your doctor to develop a plan to quit smoking. Smoking causes further damage to the lungs, which can worsen your symptoms. Smoking can also speed up the progression of the disease.You should limit the amount of time you spend around second-hand smoke also. That can irritate your lungs and worsen your symptoms.

, One important treatment for silicosis is keeping your lungs as clean as possible. This means you should stay away from all lung irritants. This includes any respiratory allergens you have, such as strong fragrances, pet dander, or plant debris.You should also stay away from indoor and outdoor pollution. Monitor for air quality alerts and stay inside when the air quality is low.
Try to limit your exposure to dust particles.

, For coughing, breathing difficulties, and phlegm, your doctor may suggest that you try a few at-home treatments. You may benefit from inhaling steam or increasing your fluid intake.Place water in a pot and bring it to boil. Let it cool for a few minutes after taking it off the heat. Then, place a towel over your head and hold your head at least six inches from the water. The steam should help you breathe easier. You can also talk to your doctor about whether adding essential oils or herbs will help.
Increased fluid intake can help produce more phlegm and improve your cough.

, Living with a chronic lung disease can be a challenge. However, you are not alone. You, your family, and caregivers may want to try joining a lung disease support group. You can do this online through organizations such as the Lung Association, or you can look for a group in your area.Ask your doctor or local hospital about any support groups in your area.
Search online for groups, message board, mailing lists, or forums for those living with silicosis or lung disease.

Decide if you are at risk.,
Identify the symptoms.,
Visit your doctor.",How to Treat Silicosis3," Silicosis is a long-term lung disease that is developed when someone inhales silica or quartz dust over a long period of time. People’s occupations lead to silicosis. If you work with stone, clay, rock, or sand, perform stone cutting and sandblasting, or work in a mine, quarry, or foundry, you are at a high risk for silicosis.People who have occupations in stone masonry, construction, demolition, paving, pottery, ceramics, or glass making are at risk.

, Symptoms often take decades to develop. Most of the time, it occurs after breathing in silica dust for 10 to 20 years. The main symptom is trouble breathing, especially after physical exertion. You may also experience shortness of breath when you are resting.


A severe cough also occurs with silicosis. It may be dry or produce phlegm. You may also experience chest pain.
Fatigue, lethargy, and general weakness is also a sign.
Some people lose weight and have a decreased appetite.

, If you at-risk or are experiencing any symptoms, you should make an appointment with your doctor. Don’t put off going to the doctor. The symptoms won’t get better, and the earlier silicosis is diagnosed, the better your doctor can help you manage the symptoms.


Your doctor will give you a series of tests. You will first have a chest x-ray, and then more than likely a CT scan of your chest. Afterwards, you may have to have a breathing test to evaluate your lung function.

Keep in mind that drinking an herbal tea before bed may increase the chances that you will need to get up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom. This can disrupt your sleep.;
, If you decide to use herbs as a tea, boil water and add either one teaspoon of loose herb (or one tea bag for options that come packaged) to a cup of boiled water and let it steep for five minutes. Strain if necessary and add honey and/or lemon to taste.


For herbal teas, reputable companies include Alvita and Traditional Medicinals. For loose-leaf teas, try Mountain Rose Herbs or Gaia Herbs.

, If you prefer to take herbal sleep aids as a supplement, follow manufacturer’s instructions. Many herbal sleep aids are combinations of one or more herbs.


Try to ensure you buy quality supplements by buying only organic supplements, checking expiration dates for freshness, looking for verifiable contact information for the company, and looking for “seals of approval” from the Natural Products Association (NPA), Consumer Labs, or the US Pharmacopeia (USP). You also want to make sure the manufacturer follows Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP).

, Valerian root is a mild sedative and allows you to fall asleep faster and better.These sedative properties are thanks to a chemical compound called valepotriate.Valerian should not be used with children under three years old and may interact with prescription medicines such as antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications.Valerian tea is an acquired taste, so add a bit of honey and/or lemon to suit your tastes.

Talk to a qualified healthcare professional to determine a safe dose for children., Chamomile increases calm and reduces anxiety.German chamomile is more commonly found than Roman chamomile, but you can use either one. Chamomile contains a flavonoid called apigenin, which is responsible for its relaxing properties.Chamomile is safe for children, but dilute the tea with warm water (use ½ cup of tea and add ½ cup of water).
Chamomile can interact with a number of medications, including blood thinners, anti-seizure medications, birth control, and antidepressants.Talk to a knowledgeable healthcare professional before use.

Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol before bed.,
Turn your bedroom into a perfect environment for sleep.,
Find a relaxing routine before bed.,
Get up if you’re having trouble falling asleep.,
Maintain a consistent sleep schedule.,
Avoid late-day naps.,
Do not eat for at least two hours before you go to sleep.,
Exercise daily (and early).,
Cut back on nighttime fluids.",How to Make an Herbal Sleep Aid2," Both caffeine and nicotine are stimulants that will interfere with sleep, so you should avoid them too close to going to bed. Though alcohol is a depressant, it still leads to more waking at night and a lower quality of sleep., A cool, dark, and quiet location are all key to falling asleep and staying asleep.This also means avoiding watching TV in bed or sitting in bed with other electronic devices such as phones, tablets, and laptops.If dead silence hinders more than helps your sleep—or even if you want to mask outdoor noises—you can use a white noise machine that creates a low, consistent sound which won’t interfere with sleep.
Light has just as much impact on falling asleep as it does waking up. If possible, try to set up your room so it’s dark enough to fall asleep while still letting in the morning sun to help you wake the following morning., Stressful or exciting activities increase alertness, making it more difficult for you to fall asleep. Establish a relaxing routine before bed, such as reading while drinking a soothing cup of herbal tea. You may also find a hot bath a nice pre-bedtime relaxation techniqueYou may also find deep-breathing exercises beneficial, such as those found at How to Breathe Deeply.

, Frustration over an inability to fall asleep just compounds the issue. If you can’t fall asleep after twenty minutes, then try getting up and doing something relaxing to help make you sleepy, such as reading or listening to tranquil music.Do not turn on the TV or another electronic device as staring at a bright screen will only wake you up more.
Try not to stare at the clock as you try to sleep either. This is another way to simply frustrate yourself over being unable to sleep., Avoid the temptation to stay up late and sleep in too late on the weekends. The best way to sleep well consistently is to standardize your body’s internal clock by going to bed at the same time each night, sleeping a solid seven to eight hours, and waking at the same time each morning.Note that the amount of nightly sleep should be closer to nine or ten hours for school-aged children., Late-afternoon napping can also interfere with your ability to sleep well at night.If your tiredness from sleeping poorly at night catches up with you in the form of an afternoon nap, then you might be perpetuating the cycle. Push through the late-day sleepiness for several days in a row to sleep better at night instead.

, Eat your last meal of the day two or more hours before you go to sleep. Additionally, if you do any evening snacking, make it something light.Eating heavy foods before bed keeps your digestive system working, causing you to stay awake well into night.


Indigestion is also a common cause of insomnia. Avoid foods likely to cause heartburn in the evening.

, Nothing can tire you out like a solid exercise routine. However, working out releases a stress hormone associated with alertness, so exercising too late in the evening can actually contribute to keeping you awake.If your schedule necessitates getting your gym time at night, then try to do it at least three hours before you go to bed., If you find your sleep disturbed by regular trips to the bathroom at night, then you may be drinking too many fluids too close to bedtime.Try to balance intake in the evening so that you neither wake up due to thirst not due to a trip to the bathroom.

Gather your supplies.,
Select a diuretic essential oil.,
Mix the ingredients together carefully.,
Prepare some cloth wraps.,

Take a hot shower.,
Massage the ingredients into your skin.,
Secure the paste with your cloth wraps.,
Be aware of health concerns associated with body wraps.,
Drink water while wearing the wrap.,
Stick to light activities.,
Remove the wrap after about an hour.",How to Make a Green Tea Body Wrap," You can find most supplies for a green tea body wrap at a health food store. You may be able to find some of the supplies at your local supermarket. You will need the following:You will need a cup of bentonite powder. You can buy this online or possibly at a health food shop.
You will also need two cups of brewed green tea. You should be able to find green tea at most supermarkets. You can also matcha powder, as it may give your mixture a slightly thicker texture.;
, A diuretic essential oil may help improve issues with water retention. You can find essential oils online or at a local health food store. The following essential oils have diuretic properties:Cypress
Fennel
Geranium
Grapefruit
Juniper Berry
Rosemary

, You will need to mix 1 cup of bentonite powder, 2 cups of green tea, and 2 drops of your chosen essential oil. Do not use a metal spoon for mixing the ingredients. Metal can react with the bentonite and draw traces of metal into your mixture.Mix everything together until it forms a thick paste.
If you want a different texture, try adding a little bit more green tea or bentonite powder. If you want a more watery texture, add more green tea. If you want a more solid texture, add more bentonite powder.
Avoid adding extra essential oils, however. One to two drops should be safe and efficient. If you use essential oils frequently, however, 3 or 4 drops may be safe for you., You will need some kind of wrapping to secure the green tea mixture in place. You can use medical bandages, which you can buy at a drug store. You can also cut up an old cotton sheet.Cut the bandages or sheets into small strips so they're easy to handle.
You should also get some plastic wrap. You will wrap this over the cloth wraps to hold everything in place.

, Some people who have used body wraps advocate drinking water prior to use. This may help keep the body hydrated while the body wrap is in place. Before applying the paste to your skin, drink an 8-ounce glass of water., A hot shower may help open your pores. Therefore, it's not a bad idea to take a warm shower just before applying the body wrap.Massage the area where you're applying the wrap with warm water. This may open your pores more in that particular area, possibly making the wrap more effective.

, Where you apply your paste depends on how you're using the wrap. If you want to target cellulite on your thighs, for example, apply the paste there. If you're looking to reduce stomach fat, try adding the paste to your stomach. Gently massage the paste into the skin where you're applying the body wrap.You want your mixture to be warm when you add it to your skin. If the mixture has cooled down since you prepared it, you may want to briefly reheat it in the microwave or over the stove before applying it to your skin. Just make sure it's cool enough that it won't burn your skin.

, Place your cloth wraps over where you applied the mixture. Place enough cloth warps on your body to fully cover the green tea mixture. Then, wrap some plastic wrap around the cloth wraps to secure them in place. You may have to use tape to hold the plastic wrap in place.If may be easier to dip the cloth wraps in the mixture and then apply them to your chosen area. You can do this instead of massaging in the mixture first. You may find the wraps stay on easier this way.

, The Food and Drug Administration says body wraps can actually be dangerous. Wraps, especially when left on for more than a few hours, can cause dehydration. Avoid leaving the wrap on for too long and seek medical help if you notice any signs of dehydration.Signs of mild dehydration include sleepiness, a dry and sticky mouth, increased thirst, decreased urination, a headache, and dizziness.
Severe dehydration is marked by irritability, confusion, extreme thirst, fever, rapid heartbeat, and fever.
If you notice any sings of dehydration, seek medical help immediately. Do not use a body wrap again in the future if your body reacts poorly to it.

, You want to make sure you stay hydrated while wearing your body wrap. Some people believe this boosts the wrap's effectiveness as well.Keep a glass of water or a water bottle by your side the whole time you're wearing the wrap. Periodically take sips.
If you leave the house wearing the wrap, take a water bottle with you. You can also stop at any water fountains you see.

, You do not want to overexert yourself while wearing the wrap. Exercise, especially strenuous exercise, should be avoided while wearing the body wrap. Body wraps cause you to lose water weight, so you can potentially dehydrate if you do too much physical activity while wearing the wrap.It may be best to simply sit and relax while wearing the wrap. You can watch television or a movie to keep yourself entertained.

, This is about how long it should take for the wrap to work. Carefully remove the wrap and discard it after an hour.Take a shower after wearing the body wrap. Make sure to rinse off any remaining green tea mixture completely.

Measure your herbs.,
Add boiling water to the herbs in a pot or jar.,
Steep your herbs covered.,
Strain your tea and enjoy.",How to Infuse Herbs1," The most basic proportions are one tablespoon dried or two tablespoons fresh herbs per cup of water. However, the guidelines may vary according to the herb and your taste.Be sure to take the recommended dosages into account when deciding how much of each herb to use in your infusion. Going by weight, the amount can vary from a half gram to five grams per eight ounces of water.
You can also vary the amount according to taste, which may require some experimenting. For instance, if you have a very strong or pungent herb like cayenne pepper or cloves, you will want to use a much smaller amount than you would for other herbs.;
, Be sure to measure the water by ounces or cups to get the appropriate amount and proportion for your infusion.You can use a glass jar, ceramic teapot, or french press. The only requirements are that it is heat-resistant and has a tightly fitting lid.

, Put the lid on your container, and let it sit for 4-8 hours. You can steep it for less time if you’re in a hurry, but most herbs will achieve their maximum benefit after four.Hardier plant parts, such as bark and roots, should be steeped longer than flowers and leaves. Give them the full eight hours.
Consider preparing your infusions just before bed so that they’re ready to drink first thing in the morning.
Letting your herbs steep for much longer than you would for a tea maximizes their nutritional value. For instance, a cup of normal nettle tea provides only about 5-10mg of calcium whereas the same amount of a nettle infusion that has been steeped for four hours contains 200mg of calcium.Plant parts that require simmering instead of steeping to produce tea, such as bark, hard seeds, or mushrooms, are referred to as “decoctions,” not infusions., Use a fine mesh strainer to remove the steeped herbs and plant matter from the liquid. You should have a clear, colorful infusion that’s ready to drink throughout the day.You can reheat it if you’d like to drink it hot. Otherwise, it’s also fine to drink at room temperature or iced.
If it’s too bitter, add a sweetener like honey, stevia, or agave syrup. You can also try mixing it with milk, juice, or sparkling water for a kick.
Refrigerate any leftovers, and drink within 48 hours.

Heal your mind with crystals.",How to Heal With Crystals," Crystal healing is believed to date back as far as 6,000 years ago, to the time of Sumerians in Mesopotamia. It is also believed that ancient Egyptians were some of the first to practice crystal healing.Today, crystal healing is predominantly based on traditional concepts in Asian cultures where some of the people believed in life-energy (chi or qi). Chakras, a part of modern crystal healing, also date back to traditional Asian cultures through Buddhism and Hinduism. These are said to connect the physical and supernatural elements of the body.;
, Crystal healing is believed to be a natural form of medicine that receives its powers through different stones, which are assigned various properties. During a typical session, a healer may lay stones on the body in different areas, or may suggest that you wear certain stones to ward off sickness or absorb positive energy.Because each stone has a different power, it is believed that using these stones and crystals can restore balance and stability to the body's energy system, allowing natural healing processes to take place.

, There are so many different crystals, so it would be difficult to memorize them all, but there are only seven chakras, and it can be helpful to learn them so you are aware of the imbalances you may be experiencing in your body.


Crown Chakra: Located at the top of your head, this chakra helps connect you to your spiritual self. It promotes imagination, inspiration, and positive thought.
Brow/Third Eye Chakra: Located just above the eyebrows, this chakra balances the glands in the endocrine system and so it affects vision, intuition, psychic abilities, concentration, self knowledge, and insight.
Throat Chakra: Located in the throat, this chakra helps you to connect to the world around you, affecting communication, self-expression, and sound.
Heart Chakra: Located in the center of the chest, this chakra deals with emotions and so it helps create compassion, love, understanding, sharing, and forgiveness.
Solar Plexus Chakra: Located between the naval and base of the rib cage, this chakra creates confidence, humour, personal power, authority, laughter and warmth, and also helps shape your identity and personality.
Sacral/Navel Chakra: Located between the naval and pubic pone, this chakra promotes physical force, vitality, and strength and also generates new ideas, creativity, passion, endurance, and sexual energy.
Base Chakra: Located at the base of the spine, this chakra promotes physical survival, vitality, stability, patience, and courage.

, While it is a traditional practice, many modern doctors and scientists do not support crystal healing as an adequate form of medicine, because there are no peer reviewed articles proving its capabilities. Often times when undergoing crystal therapy, participants experience positive feelings because of the placebo effect.


While it is okay to try out crystal healing, if you or someone you know is suffering from a dangerous or serious illness, you should consider visiting a doctor instead of a crystal therapist. Crystal therapy is an effective form of therapeutic medicine if you are looking to calm your mind and possibly alleviate depression.

, To practice crystal healing on others, many crystal therapy clinics require certification or a license through a university or school that practices natural medicinal techniques. Crystal therapy is not unlike massage or bodywork therapy, in that the therapists ultimately help their patients experience relaxation and stress relief., A crystal therapist may take several different approaches to promote healing in the body. A common healing technique used by crystal therapists is to have their patient lie on a table and then the therapist will place certain crystals on specific parts of the body in hopes that healing and positive energy will flow to that part of the body.


Crystal therapists use crystals believed to help or promote certain things, but they also use chakra systems as points on the body in which to lay the crystals.
Therapists will usually place crystals on the part of the body that is suffering from a certain ailment, and will use a crystal that is supposed to cure or alleviate that symptom. If you are suffering from a headache a therapist may put a crystal that alleviates tension on or around your forehead.
Because there are a number of different types of crystals to be used on the body, it would be difficult to memorize them, so consult a therapist or visit a website like Crystal Well-being that lists the crystals and what they can be used for. Curing certain ailments with crystals is listed in part three.

, This form of crystal healing relies more on stabilizing the chakra systems, or energy points, in the body. There are seven chakras in the body, starting from the crown of your head and moving towards the base of your spine. You can wear chakra jewelry, purchased through a crystal therapy clinic or website, or you can wear crystal jewelry, targeting a specific ailment.

, Another way a crystal therapist may desire to heal someone is by using a pendulum with a crystal on the end, and gently swinging it over the body, moving from head to toe until all the swings are neutralized. This method is aimed at removing energy imbalances from the body.


A therapist will generally start at the feet of their patient and gently swing a pendulum, until they create a steady swing that is evenly balanced on both sides. Then, they will slowly move up the body, maintaining the same swing. Whenever the swing becomes unbalanced, a therapist will stay at that part of the body until the pendulum becomes neutralized again.

, These layouts are different patterns that are used when placing the stones around your body to promote a certain type of healing or rejuvenation. There are many different healing layouts, some specifically created for ailments while others are in place to improve emotional stability. You can often discover these different layouts online or by visiting a clinic.

, In order for crystal therapy to work, you must believe that the negative energies are flowing out of your body and positive energies are flowing into it. If you are doing therapy yourself or visiting a crystal therapist, allow yourself to lie down and relax, taking deep breaths and trying to rid your mind of distracting thoughts. Then, you may begin to experience positive feelings or relaxation.


Crystal therapy depends much upon the patient's belief in it. If you try to practice crystal therapy with little confidence, you may only continue to experience negative energy and emotions. Know also that crystal therapy may not be instantaneous -- it may take a while to calm your mind and from the energies to begin flowing through the crystals.

, Crystals can help cure or prevent many things, but a common ailment that crystals are used for are headaches. Depending on the type of headache will determine the type of crystal used to alleviate that headache.


Tension headaches: amethyst, amber, lapis lazuli, or turquoise can be placed on or around the head to help relieve symptoms.
Stress headaches: Citrine or moonstone can be used to balance the solar plexus of the body, which may experience an imbalance due to stress or unsuitable food. You can place this stone on or around your head or in the solar plexus area of your body. You can also wear it on a chain with the corresponding chakra jewelry,

, Crystals can also be used to calm the nerves, ease restlessness, or prevent nightmares while sleeping which may cause some sleepless nights. Again, there are different crystals for different symptoms you might be experiencing.


Sleeplessness due to tension or worrying: chrysoprase, rose quartz, citrine, or amethyst can be placed by the bed or under your pillow to calm and sooth you as you fall asleep.
Overeating causing sleeplessness: If you have had a day where you ate just a little too much and it's making it difficult to sleep, place moonstone or iron pyrite on your stomach before settling into bed.
Nightmares: If nightmares or negative dreams are keeping your from gaining a good night's rest, use a protective stone like tourmaline or a smoky quartz and place it at the foot of the bed. Labradorite is thought to chase away unwelcome thoughts or feelings, so it can also be used at the foot of your bed.

, Crystals with strong, bright colors can help increase energy or give you boosts throughout the day. Red garnet, golden amber, or golden-yellow topaz are most helpful in promoting an increase in energy.


For motivational energy, the energy that requires you to get up and do something productive, use crystals with deeper tones like tiger's eye, dark citrine, and jasper.
For a quick boost of energy, place citrine on the solar plexus, and hold a clear quartz crystal in each hand while also pointing upwards.

, Different crystals can be used to improve the balance of the Brow/Third Eye Chakra. If you are having trouble focusing, or need help in recalling something from memory you can place a crystal on your forehead, near the chakra center.


Quartz or carnelian can help improve mental clarity and clear extraneous thought. Amethyst can also promote mental clarity by helping you focus on realistic goals.
Fluorite and sodalite can aid in studying as they help balance the brain hemispheres and aid in communication to give you a better understanding of concepts and ideas.
Citrine and amber can help stimulate memory, while lapis lazuli amplifies thought.

, One of the major uses of crystals is to provide peace and tranquility to your body and mind. These stones aren't used in a one time setting, but should be worn on a necklace or kept near you at all times to prevent negative energies from affecting you. If you are experiencing uncommon distress, depression, or other mental ailments, you can place the crystals in a healing layout.


Green jade can be used to calm the nervous system, thus focusing the mind. In certain cultures, green is traditionally known as the healing color.
Rose quartz, opal, or blue lace agate can be used to cleanse your emotions and create emotional stability. Amethyst can also be used for emotional stability as well, helping to balance your hormones to prevent emotional highs or lows.
Amber can be used to balance underlying emotions or endocrine imbalance as well as neutralizing a negative state of mind.

Harvest in the fall for most medicinal purposes.,
Wait until spring for culinary purposes.,
Avoid chemically-treated areas.,
Check the laws before harvesting.,
Wait for rainy weather.,
Favor the largest.,
Loosen the soil around the base.,
Remove the roots and soil.,
Scrub and rinse them clean.,
Halve the thickest roots.,
Dry them.,
Seal and store them.",How to Harvest Dandelions," Most of the medicinal benefits of dandelions come from their insoluble fibers. Expect these to be highest during the fall. However, one exception to this rule is:


Dandelions can be used to increase bile production in your liver. Their taraxacin levels are responsible for this, rather than their insoluble fibers. Taraxacin levels are highest in spring, which means you should harvest them then for this exclusive purpose.;
, First, if you’re interested in eating the dandelion flowers, you’ll obviously need to wait for them to blossom before you can harvest. But even if you’re more interested in using their roots to flavor your dishes, hold off until spring. Wait for winter’s cold weather to turn the fibers into fructose, which will make them chewier and less bitter than a fall harvest would taste., Whether you’re harvesting from your own yard or elsewhere, only do so if the area hasn’t been treated with herbicides or other harmful chemicals. Also avoid areas that are prone to runoff from chemically-treated grounds. Additionally, steer clear of areas close to roadways or anywhere else that experiences high levels of air pollution, since dandelions can retain chemicals from car exhaust and other fumes., If you are foraging anywhere other than your own property, make sure you aren’t breaking any rules by doing so. Don’t harvest on private property. With public land, double-check with your local, state, or federal government to find out if there are any rules prohibiting you from removing vegetation or otherwise disturbing the environment., If possible, hold off until after heavy rains, especially if you want the roots. Expect dandelions’ roots to extend deeper into the earth than most other flowers of similar size. Wait for rains to loosen the earth to make extraction of these deeper roots much easier., Again, this is particularly important if you’re after the roots. Keep in mind that the largest flowers will have the longest roots. Additionally, leave the smallest be in order to preserve the environment and leave food sources for insects and birds.This is especially important for future harvests. Leaving food sources for pollinating insects like bees will help keep the area full of more dandelions.

, Use a garden fork to dig around the base and work the earth loose. Avoid making direct contact with the stem and roots. Keep them intact so none of the sap spills out., Once the soil is loose enough, gently lift the flower by its stem to extract the roots. Then give it a light shake to get rid of some of the soil clinging to the roots. Use your fingers to gently work the rest loose and/or rinse it under softly running water.

, If you weren’t able to get rid of all the excess soil when you first harvested the dandelions, do so now. Use your fingers to rub it off. Rinse the roots under a gentle stream of water to wash the soil away., To preserve roots, you need to dry them, which will take longer for thicker roots. To speed the process up, slice the thickest ones in half. If necessary, quarter them so they’re approximately the same thickness as your thinnest roots., If you have a food dehydrator, set the temperature to 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius). Place the roots inside and let them dry until they turn brittle. If you don’t have a dehydrator:Lay them out on a screen or hang them individually with strings or clothespins in an area with strong air circulation. Let them air-dry until they turn brittle. This may take anywhere between 3 to 14 days, or even longer, depending on your climate.

, Once they’ve completely dried, place your roots in a jar or some other airtight container. Seal them tightly and store them in a dry, cool environment. If sealed and stored properly, roots should last up to one year."
"
Get the right proportion.,
Create a tea bag.,
Add cold water to a sealable jar.,
Steep covered.,
Enjoy within three days.",How to Infuse Herbs2," The general guideline for cold infusions is one ounce of herbs for every 32 ounces of water.Be sure to adhere to the dosages recommended for each herb and adjust the ratio according to your taste.

, Tie the herbs up in a piece of muslin or cheesecloth using a piece of string. You want the herbs to fit loosely in the bag so that water can circulate freely through them., Measure the correct amount of water for your recipe. Pour the liquid into an appropriately sized glass container with a tightly fitting lid, such as a Mason jar.

, Add the tea bag, and seal the lid with the string in it so that your herbs stay at the top of the jar. That way, water can circulate through the herbs while their beneficial nutrients are released downwards into the water. Let it rest for at least two days.Dampen dry herbs before you place them in the water.
Some people like to aid the steeping process by making “sun tea.” That is, they leave the jar outside or in a windowsill where the sun will reach it.

, Open the lid, and remove the tea bag, squeezing out whatever water and nutrients remain in it. Drink your infusion hot, cold, or at room temperature throughout the day. Store extras for a maximum of three days in the refrigerator.You can tell if an infusion has gone bad if it’s taste and/or smell has turned sour or seems off. If the infusion is laced with bubbles, that’s also a sign that it should not be drunk.
Leftovers that are no longer fit to consume can be still used to feed plants or as a nourishing hair rinse.

"
"
Select a virgin cold-pressed oil.,
Sterilize a glass jar.,
Measure out an appropriate amount of dried herbs.,
Infuse the oil on the stovetop.,
Use cold infusion with oil.",How to Infuse Herbs3," You can infuse almost any oil, but it’s best to get one that’s made from fresh ingredients and comes from the first pressing. Furthermore, you want to choose an oil with properties that are suited to your desired ends.If you would like to use the infusion for cooking, choose an oil that’s flavorful and heat-resistant, like olive oil, sunflower oil, or liquid coconut oil.
If you are using the oil for topical application, like bath or skin products, consider using jojoba, almond, grape seed, apricot, or flax seed oil.
When you buy an oil, be sure to get the one with the latest expiration date available. You want it to last for as long as possible.

, Wash your jar and lid with dish soap in hot water. Put the wet jar on an oven tray, and dry it in an oven that’s preheated to 350 degrees F (175 C) for 15 minutes.The jar you use for your oil should be entirely dry and have a tight-fitting lid.
It’s best to use one with dark glass since light can degrade the quality of your oil.
You’ll need two jars for this process, one to steep the oil in and one to store it in.

, Start with a proportion of about 1 to 10, in terms of the weight of dried herbs versus that of the oil.You should always use dried herbs for oil infusions. Fresh herbs can encourage mold and bacterial growth.
You can always adjust the proportions in future batches according to your taste.

, This is a fast method for making infused cooking oils that you'll be using immediately. However, oils infused quickly over heat need to be refrigerated and won’t keep as long as cold infusions, so they’re not ideal for use in cosmetic or other topical applications.Put your dried herbs in the bottom of your sterilized jar, and pour the oil over the top. Fill a saucepan about a quarter full of water, and put the sealed jar into the center so that it’s surrounded by water. Simmer the water uncovered over low heat for 4-6 hours.
After you infuse your oil, let it cool and then strain it into a freshly sterilized jar using a mesh strainer or cheesecloth.
Be sure to label the jar with the date you made the infusion. Keep the oil in the refrigerator. Use it within a month.

, This method, which lets oil steep slowly at room temperature, takes time but is very energy efficient. This form of infused oil is more stable than herbed oil made over a stovetop, so it will keep longer. Cold infusion is a good way to create oils for culinary, cosmetic, or therapeutic uses.Start by filling your sterilized jar about half full of herbs and pour oil over the top to fill the remainder. Gently stir the mixture using a dry spoon to ensure the herbs are coated and the infusion is well-mixed. Place a square of wax paper over the top of the jar, and secure the lid.
Let it steep in a warm place away from direct sunlight for 4-6 weeks, gently rolling your jar back and forth every few days to make sure the herbs continue to mix with the oil.
Strain the herbs out of the oil using a cheesecloth, and store it in a freshly sterilized jar. Label the jar with the date, and store it in a dark, cool place. Use the oil within a year.

Sterilize a glass jar with a tight-fitting lid.,
Add dried herbs and honey to your jar.,
Let it steep for at least a week.,
Strain and store your honey.",How to Infuse Herbs4," Wash it in hot, soapy water. After rinsing the jar, place it wet on a baking tray and dry it for 15 minutes in an oven preheated to 350 degrees F (175 C).You’ll need two jars for this process, one for letting the honey steep and one for storing it in.

, The proportion should be roughly 1 part herbs for every 10-12 parts of honey. Place the dried herbs in the bottom of the jar, and pour the honey over the top. Screw the lid tightly.Some of the herbs that go particularly well with honey include elderflower, rose, mint, sweet basil, lavender, thyme, sage, star anise, and rosemary.
Honey is a good medium for infusions because it has healing properties in itself. Use raw honey if you’d like to take advantage of its antibacterial qualities.

, Keep your sealed jar in a warm place away from direct sunlight. After a week of steeping, taste your honey every few days until it is flavored to your liking. You can let it rest for up to four weeks.If you want the process to go faster, steep your honey in a hot water bath. Place the sealed jar in a large bowl so that it’s completely submerged in water. Add freshly boiled water several times to the bowl over the course of two days., Once your honey is infused to your liking, strain out the herbs using a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth. Store the strained honey in a freshly sterilized jar.Keep your herbed honey in a cool, dark place. It should last as long as the shelf life of your honey."

Research herbs and dosages.,
Determine which part(s) of the plant to use.,
Obtain herbs from a reputable supplier.",How to Infuse Herbs5," Be sure to properly identify and research each and every plant before you use them to find the right dosage and ensure that it isn’t toxic.Some of the most common herbs used in infusions include burdock root, comfrey leaf, nettle leaf, red clover, linden flowers, raspberry leaf, and oatstraw.For a more extensive catalog of nourishing herbs that are appropriate for infusions, see Superfoods for Superhealth’s list by usage: http://www.superfoods-for-superhealth.com/herbal-tea-alchemy.html

Each herb has different associated uses and properties. If you’re looking for an infusion that provides a specific medicinal or health benefit, do an online search for it; for instance, “herbal infusions for calcium” or “herbal infusions for menopause.”If you plan on making a lot of infusions, consider getting a reference book written by a herbalist, such as Rosemary Gladstar’s Herbal Recipes for Vibrant Health, Bartram’s Encyclopedia of Herbal Medicine, or Michael Castleman’s The Healing Herbs.

, As you look up each plant, you should also note which parts of a plant (such as the roots, seeds, leaves, flowers) should be used for herbal infusions so that you’re not adding toxic, distasteful, or superfluous parts.For instance, red clover leaves shouldn't be used for red clover infusions, as they offer barely any flavor or benefits. You only want to use the flowers. Whereas with a plant like comfrey, you should only use the leaves.

, Reputable suppliers will specialize in herbs and provide plant descriptions and information about the uses of each plant. They will also identify each herb with its botanical or scientific name.Any herbs you buy should be labeled with their scientific names, since there are often many different species associated with a given common name. For instance, “Marigold” can refer to a nourishing herb or an annual bedding flower. You want the one that’s called “Calendula officinalis.”
Many suppliers offer dried herbs that are especially prepared for the purpose of infusions. Purchasing them in bulk will cut your costs and your prep time.
If you grow your own, be sure to harvest each herb separately and create a fail-proof labeling system to identify each."

Clean the herbs.,
Cut the herbs.,
Dry the herbs.,
Store your herbs.",How to Infuse Herbs6," Gently wash your herbs using water. Remove any dirt, debris, and/or insects clinging to the plants.If you want less manual labor, you can encourage insects to leave the plants of their own volition by putting the freshly harvested plants in a shady place for a couple hours before cleaning them.

, Use a sharp knife to slice your herbs without bruising them. You’ll want to cut away and separate the parts (such as the roots or stems) that you don’t want to use for your infusion.Cutting herbs into small pieces will increase their surface area, which enhances their absorption in infusions. However, if you plan on storing them for a long time, you may want to keep them in the largest units possible since that will help maintain their potency.

, To optimize their nutrition, dry herbs slowly and out of direct sunlight. Spread them in a single layer on a tray, and let them dry for two days in a dark, dry space, ideally with a temperature around 75 degrees F (24 C).You can also make infusions using fresh herbs, but they generally will not be as potent in taste or nutrition.

, Dried herbs should be kept in airtight containers (like a glass jar with a screw-top lid) in a cool, dry place out of direct sunlight. Be sure to clearly label each container with the common and botanical name of the herb as well as the date of purchase or harvest.Storing them correctly will help preserve the potency of your herbs for longer. Well-stored herbs will never “go bad,” but they will greatly diminish in nutrition and flavor, so it’s best not keep them for longer than a year.

Eat fresh purslane.,
Get purslane supplements.,
Get nutrients from purslane.,
Eat a balanced diet.",How to Increase Your Energy Levels Using Purslane1," Typically, whole foods provide more balanced health benefits than supplements. If at all possible, use purslane in its natural form. For example, you can substitute common purslane, which is found on every populated continent of the world, for lettuce in a salad. A local farmer’s market, a neighborhood produce shop, or a grocery that specializes in health food should carry purslane.You can find a variety of recipe ideas by searching for purslane on an online food and cooking resource like epicurious.;
, Several brands, such as Natural Plantation and Terraternal, make purslane supplements. When selecting a brand, read the label to make sure that the supplements meet your doctor’s recommendations for dosage


Purslane supplements may deliver a variety of benefits, but more research on their use is necessary to definitively say. It is best to discuss with your doctor whether or not the supplements are right for you.For example, it is recommended that you take melatonin supplements only for short-term periods of a few months, so your doctor may want to similarly limit your use of purslane supplements.If you eat a balanced diet, but cannot get the full dose of specific vitamins or minerals that your doctor recommends, nutritional supplements may be advisable. Pregnant women and people over the age of 50, especially, may be advised to use nutritional supplements., Purslane provides omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, magnesium, potassium, and iron. The immune system requires daily doses of these vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fatty acids to keep it strong., Purslane provides things like omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, magnesium, potassium, and iron that your immune system needs to stay strong.Still, its important to eat a variety of nutrient-rich foods to help your body maintain its immune system and keep you healthy and energetic.


Plan a balanced diet in order to make sure that you have all of the nutrients that you need. You can find recommended guidelines for a balanced diet through public health agencies such as the World Health Organization."

Improve your melatonin intake.,
Talk to your doctor about a sleep plan that’s right for you.,
Maintain your sleep cycle.",How to Increase Your Energy Levels Using Purslane2," Purslane delivers high amounts of melatonin, an antioxidant that helps regulate your sleep cycle. Eating more purslane, then, can be a significant boost for helping you improve your sleep routines and treating some sleeping disorders.Melatonin has additional benefits, such as:


Alleviating headachesTreating side effects of cancer medication, Purslane may help to regulate your sleep cycle, but it’s important to discuss with a physician how much sleep you need in the first place. This is especially true if you find yourself feeling chronically fatigued. Since being tired all the time can be a sign of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) or many major health issues, you’ll need to let your doctor know if you’re exhausted before attempting to correct things with purslane., Purslane can help you get enough melatonin to regulate your sleep schedule, but it cannot overcome bad sleep habits. Maintain a regular schedule, get regular exercise, and expose yourself to natural light in order to maintain a healthy sleep cycle."

Keep your immune system strong.,
Wash your hands with soap containing purslane.,
Use purslane to clean foods.",How to Increase Your Energy Levels Using Purslane3," You will lose energy if you are fighting off illnesses. A balanced diet and good sleep will help you remain healthy, but you should also limit opportunities for bacteria to enter your system.

, A hand sanitizer that contains purslane oil acts as a hand sanitizer and lotion all in one. It is easy to contract a cold or the flu by touching a surface that a sick person recently used. Frequent hand washing lowers your chances of transferring germs from your hands to your face.


Frequently washing can dry your hands and lead to cracked skin that makes you more susceptible to infections. Using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, as health officials recommend in many cases, can worsen this problem.Soap with purslane oil, by moisturizing your hands, can counteract this problem.

, Produce is often contaminated from dirt, animal waste, air pollutants, chemical pesticides, and bacteria that can be harmful to your health. You should not use conventional soaps on your food as the food can absorb the chemical. You can, however, wash fresh produce with a product like Natural Plantation’s Purslane Fruit & Vegetable Wash before preparing them for dinner.

Keep your environment allergen-free.,
Avoid irritants such as cigarette smoke, air fresheners, room deodorizers and perfumes.,
Changes in the weather can cause your child to have an increase in the frequency and severity of asthma attacks.",How to Control Asthma in Children1,"


Dust in the carpet can be a huge problem for children who have asthma. Make sure to keep your carpet clean or install hardwood floors to help solve this problem. Hardwoods can be an added cost, but the expense will be well worth it in the long run.






Another common allergen that can become a problem for your child is pollen. This one is hard to avoid, but you can help your child by limiting outside time during heavy pollen seasons. Keep windows shut when pollen count is high.






Be sure to change air filters often. Regardless of the asthma trigger, maintaining pure air in the home is one of the most effective ways to reduce airborne triggers. Consider purchasing a HEPA filter that helps purifier air and maintain higher air quality in the home. Always make sure heating ducts and air conditioner vents are well cleaned and properly ventilated.





;
,


If you smoke, don’t smoke in the house or around your child. Cigarette smoke is a very strong trigger for an asthma attack. Even if a child does not have asthma, parents should avoid smoking as second hand smoke is a known carcinogen. Children who are exposed to second hand smoke are more likely to develop asthma later on.






Most parents know that second hand smoke is dangerous to their child’s lungs, however, many parents are unaware that common household items and toiletries can also have the same damaging effect. The chemicals used to create the scents in those common items can irritate the lungs, especially in children.


, While there is not much you can do to control the weather, knowing which season causes asthma in your child can help you to keep her condition better under control. If your child tends to have more asthma problems during the winter because of the cold air, try to limit the time your child spends outside during the cool winter months. The same thing applies for other seasons.

Follow your child’s asthma symptoms carefully.,
Develop signals to help identify the severity of asthma symptoms.,
Learn to adjust your child’s medication according to her changing needs.,
Seek emergency care for your child if necessary.",How to Control Asthma in Children2,"


Keep track of the times when your child experiences extreme shortness of breath or coughing and wheezing.

Keep an eye on exactly when these symptoms occur and the extent to which they interfere with your child’s day-to-day activities such as playing with friends, attending school or sleeping.

Keep track of how many times per day your child needs to use an inhaler to ease the symptoms of asthma.


, Sometimes coming up with a scale of one to ten or a color system can help your child to communicate easier about the severity of the asthma symptoms.


During an attack, ask your child to rate her symptoms on a scale of one to ten, with ten being the worst, regarding how bad the symptoms are at the moment.






You can also make a color chart similar to a traffic light to help your child tell you how bad her symptoms are, with red being the worst.


, Many times, your child will be prescribed long-term medications to help manage asthma and reduce the incidence of attacks. There are also medications that are meant to provide your child with relief from asthma symptoms quickly in the event of an attack. Become familiar with the uses of the different types of medications and know when to use them.

, If you use your action plan correctly, you should be able to easily identify the asthma attacks that can’t be managed by parents at home.


If your child has trouble speaking to you or if your child’s nostrils are very wide when breathing in, it may be time to seek emergency medical care.

If you are ever in doubt, always err on the side of caution. A child with an obstructed airway needs to receive medical attention as soon as possible.


"
"
Watch closely what your child is eating and drinking.,
Control the way that your child exercises.",How to Control Asthma in Children3," This is very important because certain food products can trigger asthma attacks in sensitive individuals.


Give your child more organic vegetables and fruits because these do not contain harmful chemicals.






You should also try to give your child more plant proteins.

Give your child calcium in other ways besides milk because milk can trigger allergies in susceptible children.






Provide your child with plenty of water to drink instead of sugary substances.






An effective way for parents to identify possible foods that may be triggering an asthma attack in their child is to eliminate suspicious foods one at a time. Try eliminating wheat or sugar to see if your child’s condition improves. If you eliminate a food and your child’s condition improves, then you know to avoid giving that food to your child, as it is likely an asthma trigger.







, If your child tends to experience asthma symptoms when exercising or playing, learn some effective ways to help your child control exercise-induced symptoms.


Have your child warm up slowly before playing. It can also be a good idea to take a break from the action when your child is playing. Give your child a quick break to relax for a few minutes and be sure to provide a drink of water.

Help your child do physical activity that minimizes the symptoms. Some sports like golf can be better for your child than rigorous, non-stop activities such as soccer. This is because there are periods of rest in-between the action, which may be necessary to allow children with asthma to catch their breath. Just remember that you should never make regular sports off limits to your child if he wants to play, because this will make your child feel different from everyone else. If your child loves to play baseball, encourage him to play and try to find a way to help reduce asthma symptoms while your child is playing.

Recognize early symptoms of an asthma attack.,
Recognize the onset of an asthma attack.,
Know the symptoms of asthma in a child.,
Evaluate the specific situation.",How to Treat Asthma Attacks1," People with chronic asthma may wheeze occasionally and require the use of their asthma medication to control symptoms. An attack is different in that it results in more severe symptoms which last longer and require immediate attention. Early symptoms that an attack may be imminent include: Itchy neck
Feeling irritable or short-tempered
Feeling nervous or edgy
Fatigue
Dark circles under the eyes;
, An asthma attack can deteriorate into a life-threatening situation that requires immediate medical attention. Know how to identify an asthma attack so that you can begin treatment as soon as possible. Although signs and symptoms of an asthma attack vary depending on the person, the most common symptoms include:Wheezing or whistling while breathing. Most often the wheezing is heard when a person is breathing out (exhaling) but can sometimes also be heard when they are breathing in (inhaling).Coughing. Some sufferers may cough in an attempt to clear the airway and get more oxygen into their lungs. This may be especially aggravated at night.Shortness of breath. People suffering from asthma attacks will complain of being short of breath. They may be breathing in short shallow breaths that appear to be faster than normal.Chest tightness. Attacks are often accompanied by a feeling that chest feels tight or that there is pain on the left or right side.Low peak expiratory flow (PEF) readings. If the person uses a peak flow meter, a small device that measures the maximum speed of expiration in order to monitor a person's ability to exhale air, and the measurements range from 50% to 79% of your personal best, this is indicative of an asthma flare-up.

, Children will often have the same symptoms as adults with asthma, such as wheezing or whistling when breathing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness or pain.


Fast breathing is common in an asthma attack in children.
Children may show 'retractions' where you can see their neck pulling, belly breathing, or their ribs when they breathe.
In some children a chronic cough can be the only symptom of an asthma attack.In other cases, symptoms of asthma in children are limited to coughing that is made worse with viral infections or when they are sleeping., Assess what is happening to determine if emergency medical attention is needed and what treatment should be done at the scene. Individuals who are having mild symptoms may be able to use their medication which should work immediately. Those individuals in greater distress should be seen by emergency medical personnel. In the case of a severe asthma attack, call or have someone nearby call emergency medical services before proceeding to treat the attack. Know how to distinguish which situation you have on your hands:People with asthma who need their medication but may not require immediate medical attention will:

be wheezing slightly but not appear in distress
may be coughing to clear their airway and get more air
have some shortness of breath but able to talk and walk
do not appear to be anxious or in distress
will be able to tell you they have asthma and where their medication is located


People who are in significant distress and will require immediate medical attention:

may appear pale or even have a bluish color to their lips or fingers
have the same symptoms as above but intensified and more severe
strain their chest muscles to breathe
experience severe shortness of breath, which results in short panting breaths
wheeze audibly with inspiration or expiration
have increased anxiety about the situation
possibly be confused or less responsive than normal
have trouble walking or talking because of shortness of breath
demonstrate persistent symptoms

Read about the kinds of herbs you plan to grow.,
Find a container with good drainage.,
Fill your container with soil-less medium.,
Moisten the soil.,
Plant your seeds.,
Keep your newly planted seeds moist.,
Cover the containers with plastic wrap.,
Make sure your seeds get enough sun.,
Transplant your seedlings.",How to Grow Great Herbs1," Some herbs do better if you transplant them, rather than starting them from seeds.Reading up on the kinds of herbs you want to plant will also help you to figure out how much sun, space and water your plants will need, as well as when the best time to plant them is. It’s also a good idea to find out the best type of dirt to start your seeds in. Growing great herbs starts with knowing your stuff!;
, Clay pots work really well, of course, but there’s no need to go out and buy them. Plastic containers like old yogurt, sour cream, or lunch meat containers with a few holes punched in the bottom also work really well. Egg containers are great too—just punch a single hole in the bottom of each compartment.Wash your container before you use it. Water with 10% chlorine bleach (but no more!) works, as does a small amount of dish soap. Rinse well and allow containers to dry., Do not use potting soil to start seeds. Find out what kind of dirt or soil-less medium works best for each kind of herb. Often, a fine-mix compost works best for herb seeds.You should use only about two to three inches of soil in each container.

, It should be wet throughout. Let the soil sit for 20 to 30 minutes before planting your seeds., It’s very important that you plant your seeds at the correct depth. To find out how deeply to plant your seeds, you can check the seed packet they came in or look it up on the internet or in a good gardening book. Make sure that you follow seed-depth instructions! You’ll also want to check how much sun your seeds will need in order to germinate., Make sure that the soil doesn’t get too dried out—this will kill your seeds. But it’s also important not to overwater. If your soil is muddy, you’ve watered too much and your seeds could drown.


Try bottom watering for great seedlings. Fill a baking tray with water and place your seed containers on top. When the soil at the top of the containers is moist, remove them from the try. Repeat as necessary. Bottom watering helps to prevent overwatering, and also encourages your seedlings to grow deeper roots., This will help to keep your soil moist and the air inside the container humid. Uncover the containers every other day to ensure that they don’t grow mildew. Once your seedlings show a few leaves, stop covering them., Even though your seeds are underground, they still need plenty of light in order to grow into great herbs—up to 16 hours a day! You may need to light them artificially if you don’t get enough sun from your windows., They are ready to be transplanted when they have several sets of leaves and are two to three inches tall.This will probably take about five to ten weeks.You’ll have to take care in order to transplant successfully:


If you’re planting outside, wait until all danger of frost outside has passed. Frost will kill your seedlings.
Try “hardening” your plants before planting them outside by leaving them outdoors in the shade for a little bit longer each day. In the beginning, only leave them in the shade for two hours or so and work them up to twenty-four hours. Hardening will help your plants to survive better if there’s a long stretch of time with little to no sun.Take the lower leaves very gently off of your seedlings before transplanting. You will need to plant your seedlings just deeper than where its bottom leaves were.The best way to transplant your seedlings will depend on whether you want to plant them indoors or outdoors.

Have an action plan in place.,
Avoid your asthma attack triggers.,
Get the inhaler prescribed by your physician.,
Use a MDI.,
Use a DPI.,
Recognize an asthma emergency.,
Rest while awaiting emergency personnel.",How to Treat Asthma Attacks2," Once you are diagnosed with asthma, create an asthma action plan with your allergist or physician. This plan is basically a step-by-step process of what to do when you face an acute attack. The plan should be written down and include emergency phone numbers as well as those of family and friends who can meet you at the hospital if needed.When you get the diagnosis, consult with your doctor to identify your particular symptoms of worsening asthma and what you should do when they flare up (e.g. take medication, go to the emergency room, etc).Make sure you know how to use your rescue inhalers.
Write this plan down and keep it with you at all times.

, In general, note that prevention of symptoms is the best way to manage and treat asthma. If you know what situations trigger your asthma attacks (such as being around furry animals or extremely hot or cold weather), then try to avoid these when possible., There are two different type of rescue medications that you may have been prescribed your doctor, a Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI) or a Dry Powder Inhaler (DPI).


MDIs the are most common inhalers. They deliver asthma medication through a small aerosol canister equipped with a chemical propellant that pushes the medication into the lungs. An MDI can be used alone or with a breathing chamber (""spacer"") that separates your mouth from the inhaler, and which can allow you to breathe normally to receive the medication and help the medication get into the lungs more efficiently.
A DPI inhaler means of delivering dry powder asthma rescue medication without propellant. Brand names of DPI medications include Flovent, Serevent, or Advair. A DPI requires you to breathe in quickly and deeply, which makes them difficult to use during an asthma attack. This makes them less popular than the standard MDIs.Whichever you have been prescribed, make sure you are always carrying it with you.

, Note that when suffering an asthma attack, you only want to use an MDI filled with the rescue medication, bronchodilators (such as albuterol) , and not corticosteroids or long-acting beta-2 agonist bronchodilators. Shake the inhaler for five seconds to mix the medication in the canister. Before using the inhaler, push out as much air in the lungs as you can.
Lift your chin and seal your lips around the air chamber or the end of the inhaler.
Using an air chamber, you would breathe normally and slowly to get the medication. Using the inhaler, start to breathe in and press the inhaler once.
Keep breathing in until you can’t get in any more air.
Hold your breath for 10 seconds and repeat at least one time, but often more, allowing at least one minute between uses. Always follow the instructions on your asthma plan.

, DPIs vary consistently from manufacturer to manufacturer, so care should be taken in reading the instructions before using.


Breathe out as much air as possible.
Seal your lips around the DPI and breathe in strongly until your lungs are full.
Hold your breath for 10 seconds.
Remove the DPI from your mouth and exhale slowly.
If more than one dose is prescribed, repeat after one minute has passed.

, If your asthma symptoms worsen even after taking your medication, you may need to get emergency medical assistance. If you can call emergency services, you should do so. However, if your breathing is too labored and you cannot speak clearly, you may need someone to call for you, such as a friend or family member nearby or a passersby.A good action plan will include the local number for emergency services. In addition, your doctor will have helped you identify when your symptoms are becoming more severe and when you are entering an emergency situation so that you'll know when to get help. Call your local emergency number if your attack is not significantly relieved by your rescue inhaler in several minutes.

, Sit and rest while emergency personnel are coming to your aid. Some asthmatics find sitting in the ""tripod"" position—leaning forward with their hands on their knees—to be helpful because it can relieve pressure on the diaphragm.


Try to stay calm. Becoming anxious can increase your symptoms.
Ask someone in the vicinity to sit with you to help you stay calm until emergency help arrives.

"
"
Help the individual find a comfortable position.,
Calmly ask ""Do you have asthma?"",
Remove all known triggers in the immediate area.,
Inform the person that you are looking for his inhaler.,
Prepare the person to receive medication from the inhaler.,
Call emergency services.",How to Treat Asthma Attacks3," Most people with asthma will be more comfortable sitting and not standing or lying down. Keep the person upright to assist with lung expansion and ease of breathing. Let the person lean slightly forward onto you or a chair for support. Some asthmatics may sit in a ""tripod"" position by leaning forward with their hands on their knees to relieve pressure on their diaphragm.


Asthma is exacerbated by anxiety but it is not triggered by anxiety. This means that during an attack the individual will respond more rapidly when he is calm. Anxiety releases cortisol in the body which constricts the bronchioles, the passages by which air passes through the nose and/or mouth to the air sacs of the lungs.It's important that you stay calm and reassuring as this can assist the person in maintaining calm.

, Even if the person cannot verbally answer due to wheezing or coughing, he may nod or gesture towards his inhaler or an instruction card.


Ask the person if he has a written asthma emergency action plan. Many individuals who are prepared for asthma attacks will carry a written emergency plan with them. If the person has one, take it out and help him follow the plan., Asthma is often exacerbated by specific triggers or allergens. Ask the individual if something in the immediate area might be triggering an attack and if the person communicates a response, try to remove the trigger or remove the person from the trigger if it is environmental (like pollen or weather-related).Animals
Smoke
Pollen
High humidity or cold weather

, Do this to keep the person calm and reassure him that you are working with him, not against him.


Women may keep their inhaler in their handbags and men in a pocket.
Some asthmatics, especially children or the elderly, may have a clear plastic tube called a spacer that attaches to the inhaler. A spacer delivers the medicine into the mouth with less force, making it easier to inhale.
Children and elderly people who suffer frequent asthma attacks may also carry nebulizers, which deliver asthma medication through a mouthpiece or mask. They are easy to use, because the patient breathes normally and are thus ideal for the young and old, but are somewhat bulkier than the MDIs and require electricity to work.
If the person does not have an inhaler, call emergency medical services, especially if the asthmatic is young or elderly. People suffering from asthma attacks without inhalers are serious risk of asphyxiating.

, If the person has his head resting downward, temporarily lift his upper body back.


If there is a spacer for the MDI, attach it to the inhaler after shaking. Remove the cap from the mouthpiece.
Help the person tilt his head back if necessary.
Have the asthmatic exhale as much as possible before using the inhaler.
Allow the person to administer his own medication. Inhaler dosages must be appropriately timed, so allow the asthmatic control of this process. Help the person support the inhaler or spacer against his lips if necessary.
Most asthmatics will pause for a minute or two between puffs.

, Monitor the asthmatic until paramedics arrive.


Even if the asthmatic seems to get better after using their inhaler, it is best if a paramedic or healthcare professional can assess the person. If the person does not want to go to the hospital, he can make that decision after being informed of his health status.
Continue to help the person with their inhaler if necessary; even if the asthma attack does not decrease in severity the medication will help keep it from worsening by relaxing the airways.

"
"
Call emergency services.,
Run a hot shower.,
Practice breathing exercises.,
Find a drink with caffeine.,
Make use of common household drugs.",How to Treat Asthma Attacks4," If you or another person do not have an inhaler, it is important to call your local emergency phone number. There are also other steps you can take while awaiting emergency services. However, you should always ask emergency services what they advise while you're on the phone with them.

, If at home, running a hot shower or bath can transform the bathroom into a good recovery zone due to the steam., Many people get anxious and panic when they suffer an asthma attack and this can increase breathing. However, panicking usually aggravates the asthma attack because it restricts the amount of oxygen that the lungs get. Try to do slow, conscious breathing. Breathe in through your nose for a count of four and then out for a count of six.Try pursing your lips as you exhale. This can help slow your exhales and keep the airways open for a longer time.

, Caffeine's chemical structure is similar to common asthma medications, and a small amount of coffee or soda can help relax the airways and reduce respiratory problems.The drug in question here is called theophylline, which can help prevent and treat wheezing, shortness of breath and chest tightness.There may not be enough theophylline present in coffee or tea to counteract the asthma attack, but it is one alternative option.

, Certain drugs may help relieve the effects of an asthma attack in the case of emergency, although they should never be taken in lieu of getting emergency assistance.


Administer a fast-acting antihistamine (allergy medicine) if you or the asthmatic thinks an allergen has triggered the reaction. This may be the case if you are outside on a day with a high pollen index. Antihistamines include: Allegra, Benadryl, Dimetane, Claritin, Alavert, Tavist, Chlor-Trimeton, and Zyrtec, to name a few. Echinacea, ginger, chamomile, and saffron are all natural antihistamines. If you can find any teas that contain these ingredients, this might help relieve some symptoms, although the effect of antihistamines in general is likely to be minimal. Be careful when using natural herbs or supplements as some people are allergic to the ingredients. Use a over-the-counter pseudoephedrine like .Sudafed. Sudafed is a nasal decongestant, but it could help during an asthma attack when an inhaler is not present because it can help open the bronchioles. It's best to break the pill down with a mortar and pestle and dissolve in warm water or tea before administering to limit the risk of choking. Note as well that while it does work, it can take up to 15 to 30 minutes to be effective. Keep in mind as well that pseudoephedrine can increase the heart rate and blood pressure."

Choose a sunny spot for your herbs.,
Set up artificial lighting if you don’t have a naturally sunny spot in your home.,
Gather your supplies.,
Prepare your container.,
Dig holes in the soil big enough to put your plants in.,
Transplant your plant.,
Water your plants only enough to keep the soil moist.,
Keep the climate comfortable for the best herbs.",How to Grow Great Herbs2," Most herbs can grow just fine indoors, but it’s important to make sure that they get enough sun. If you want to use natural light, you need at least one large, south-facing window that lets in at least four to six hours of unobstructed light every day. For the best herbs, you’ll need to make sure that you rotate your indoor plants daily to ensure that one side doesn’t get all the sun while the other side withers., Great herbs require plenty of light, and modern technology allows for indoor plants to get plenty of sun-like light indoors. You’ll most likely want to use fluorescent light or LED light, but there are lots of options.


Standard fluorescent tubes (T12 or T8) are cheap and easy to find. They don’t emit heat, so you can place them close to your herbs (no closer than 12 inches). However, they tend to be dimmer at the ends, so the best indoor herbs are lit with multiple tubes. For the best herbs, purchase tubes that are color formatted especially for indoor gardens.
The high-efficiency T5 fluorescent tube is better for great herbs. They spread more light over a wider area than standard tubes. You can even buy fixtures with adjustable stands, which will allow you to move your light up as your herbs grow taller.
Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) are another option, though they do not spread light as far or as efficiently as standard and T5 fluorescents do.
LED (Light Emitting Diodes) are a rapidly changing new technology, and can be excellent for growing great herbs. “White” or “natural” LEDs are better for plant growth than red or blue LEDs. The downside of LEDs is that they are relatively expensive.
If you’re growing your herbs on a large scale, High-Intensity Discharge (HID) grow lights are best., You’ll need large clay or plastic pots (at least eight inches in diameter in order each plant to get as big as it can).You’ll also need a good growing medium; for the best herbs, don’t use potting soil.


Great herbs don’t need fertilizer. Fertilizer makes plants put all of their energy into growing faster and they lose much of their flavor—much like steroids do to humans., Fill it with soil or growing medium. Mix water into the soil with your hands until it feels moist throughout. It’s a good idea to place a plate or tray under your pots, in case of leakage. If you don’t want to use your own, you can find plates of this kind in the potting aisle of any gardening store., You’ll need to dig the hole deep enough that you can place the plant and all of its soil and roots into the hole without any roots being exposed to the air., Get the plant out of its container by turning the container over very carefully and tapping on the bottom. Pull very gently on the base of the plant’s stem until it comes out of the container. Place the plant in the hole you dug and brush dirt into any spaces left in the hole; you can add more dirt to the container if you need to. Immediately after transplanting, water your plant.Watering your plant a couple of hours before transplanting it will make your plant happy, and it will also make the soil easier to move into the new container.Never pull a plant out of its container by the stem. This stresses the plant out and also kills its root system.

, Your soil should never get dry all the way through, but it shouldn’t be constantly waterlogged, either. Mud in a pot is a bad sign., You can do this by keeping an oscillating fan in the room with your plants and turning it on, on low, for a few hours every day. Misting your plants regularly with a spray bottle will also help maintain a plant-friendly level of humidity in the air around your garden."

Find the perfect spot for your herbs.,
Prepare the soil.,
Prepare your beds for transplanting.,
Transplant your plants.,
Water your garden after transplanting.",How to Grow Great Herbs3," Herbs are always happier in the ground than in pots—as long as they get enough sunshine and have enough space to grow. So you’ll need to find a spot that is sunny and roomy.


Most herbs are happiest with full, day-long sunlight. But if you live in a place where the summer heat is regularly above 90 degrees, you might to better to find a spot that’s sunny for at least four hours in the morning or evening and shady when the day is at its hottest. Make sure you check how much sun each type of herb you plant needs in order to be happy. Different types of herbs need different amounts of sun.Make sure that you know how big your plants will get and how much space they need to reach their full potential. You can usually find this information on your seed packets or on the tags that came in your potted herbs. Count how many plants you have and multiply it by the amount of space each one needs in order to figure out how big your garden needs to be., Dig 10 to 12 inches into the dirt you’ve plotted out for your garden, then use a gardening fork to turn over the dirt. This step is very important, because the dirt in your yard is hard and doesn’t allow water to drain or plants to stretch out their roots. When you’re done, mix a layer of compost into your soil. Then, level off the ground in your garden plot with a rake.The best herbs grow in a neutral to slightly acidic soil. If you’re not sure that your soil is good for an herb garden, you can use a soil test kit to test it. If it turns out that your soil is bad for an herb garden, don’t fret! You can always set up raised beds and fill them with better soil., Dig holes that are deep enough for your plant’s entire root system to be completely underground. Make sure that you leave plenty of space in between holes for your plants to grow. Great herbs never have to fight each other for resources., Remove a plant from its container by turning the container over carefully and tapping on the bottom. Then you can pull the plant out gently by the base of the stem. Gently place your plant into its hole so that the base of the plant is even with the ground. Then fill in the rest of the hole with dirt and press down the top layer of soil.


Water your plants a couple of hours before you transplant them to reduce shock and make the soil in the container more manageable.
For the best herbs, transplant when the day is overcast or in the evening. This reduces shock for your plants.Never yank a plant out of its container by the stem. This can kill its root system and damage the plant.

, This will help mix the soil from your container with the soil from your garden to prevent transplant shock. It will also lessen the stress of the move for the plant—just like a cold drink at the end of a hard day does for humans.


To grow the best herbs, only water your garden when the top layer of soil loses moistness. Don’t wait until your herbs begin to wilt to water them. Keep track of the weather forecast—don’t water your plants right before it rains!"
"
Fertilize your herbs rarely, if ever.,
Water your herbs only when they become dry.,
Harvest your herbs often.,
Use your herbs right after you harvest them.,
Remember that most herbs are annual plants.",How to Grow Great Herbs4," Great herbs don’t need fertilizer. Fertilizing your herbs makes them grow faster, but all that growing takes away from the plant’s flavor and can even turn them bitter. If your plants need a little bit of help, try fish emulsion or bone matter—and only rarely.If you do use a fertilizer (rather than fish emulsion or bone matter), avoid eating the plant for at least 6 weeks.

, Too much water will kill an herb faster than too little water. Once established, most herbs prefer to be a bit on the dry side which makes them great for a beginner gardener. Only water when the soil on top is dry to the touch. Check the soil regularly to see if it needs water., For the best herbs, start trimming your herbs as soon as they are mature so that the trimming will not kill them. The more you use them the bushier they become and the more useful they are. To harvest, cut close to a leaf intersection—the spot where the branch splits off to form leaves. This signals to the plant that it needs to grow more leaves.Harvest the leaves of your herb before the plant flowers. If your herbs are outdoors, harvest them in the morning, after the dew has dried off and before the day gets too hot.
Avoid washing herb leaves, as this strips away some of their flavor. A light rinsing to remove any dirt is enough, as long as you’re not using pesticides.
Harvest herb flowers before they are fully open.
Harvest herb seeds when the seed pods change color.
Dig up herb roots in late summer or the beginning of autumn., Great herbs are at their best immediately after you pick them because they are still alive. The longer you wait to eat them, the less flavorful they will be.

, Annual plants are plants that only live for one season—they need to be re-planted annually. This means that much your herb garden is not likely to live through the winter. When your herbs start to die in the fall, this is nature—not a failure on your part!"

Stop smoking.",How to Control Asthma," One of the most common symptoms of asthma is wheezing. It is a musical, high-pitched, whistling sound made when airflow is blocked in the lungs. Sometimes, the only symptom of asthma is coughing. The cough is usually non-productive, chronic, and mostly at night.You may also notice shortness of breath/difficulty breathing or chest tightness and pain.


If you experience anxiety and hyperventilation (rapid breathing), it's usually associated with asthma attacks. It is not usually caused by a heart problem.;
, If you notice an increase in episodes, severity, or symptoms at night you should talk with your doctor. Also, if you're limiting your normal activities, missing a lot of work or school, or feel like you're not reaching your personal best on a regular basis you should see your doctor. A visit is also a good idea if your asthma medications don’t seem to work anymore or you're using quick-relief inhalers more than twice per week.You should also see your doctor at least once a year for new prescriptions for your medication.

, Asthma can create a serious, life-threatening condition very quickly, so you should seek immediate assistance if you have the following symptoms:


Severe difficulty breathing
Lips, fingers, or fingernails turning blue
Feeling as though you are about to pass out
Not being able to walk or talk in full sentences

, Your doctor will perform tests on your lungs to see how they're functioning (known as Spirometry). Your lungs will be tested before and after taking certain medications. The improvement in your lung function after these medications will determine how the asthma is diagnosed.Asthma may be classified as intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent, or severe persistent.Intermittent: symptoms happen less than once a week, brief episodes, night symptoms don't happen more than twice a month.

Mild persistent: symptoms more than once a week but less than once a day, episodes may affect activity and sleep, and night symptoms happen more than twice a month.

Moderate persistent: daily symptoms, episodes that may affect activity and sleep, night symptoms more than once a week, and daily use of an inhaled short-acting beta-agonist.

Severe persistent: daily symptoms, frequent episodes, frequent night symptoms, and limitation of physical activities.

, The goal of asthma treatment is to control the symptoms and maintain lung function over time using quick-relief medicines and long-term control medicines, if needed. Quick-relief medicines are very useful for helping to open airways during a severe asthma attack, but don't affect airway inflammation. Long-term relief medicines reduce inflammation of the lungs and are used to decrease the frequency and severity of asthma attacks, but they are not useful during an acute asthma attack.Long-term medicines also maintain lung function over time; uncontrolled asthma can lead to irreversible lung changes. The following are usually the treatments used for each classification of asthma:Asthma may be classified as intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent, or severe persistent.Intermittent: Inhaled short-acting beta-agonist as needed. No long-term control medicine needed.

Mild persistent: Inhaled short-acting beta-agonist as needed. Low-dose inhaled corticosteroid. Other treatment options include cromolyn or leukotriene modifier.

Moderate persistent: Inhaled short-acting beta-agonist as needed. Low to medium-dose inhaled corticosteroid plus inhaled long-acting beta-agonist.

Severe persistent: Inhaled short-acting beta-agonist as needed. High-dose inhaled corticosteroid plus inhaled long-acting beta-agonist plus 1 more of the following, if needed: Theophylline, Leukotriene modifier, Oral long-acting beta-agonist, Oral corticosteroid.

, If you find yourself having an asthma attack, using an inhaler can help you inhale fast-acting medication that will open your airways. Inhalers work best with spacers. Spacers are pressurized canisters that make it easier to dispense the medication into your airways. Spacers work particularly well for kids or people that have trouble breathing but anyone can benefit from a spacer.Spacers help the medicine get deep into the lungs, rather than into the back of the throat, which is especially important for inhaled corticosteroids. To use the inhaler:


Assemble the inhaler by opening and attaching the medicine container at the medicine port of the inhaler. Shake the inhaler well before use. This makes sure that the medicine in the bottle is properly mixed.
Exhale completely so that your lungs feel empty of air.
Put the mouthpiece in your mouth and secure it with your lips, forming a sealed connection. This way you won’t waste any medicine.
Press the medicine bottle and simultaneously inhale through your mouth while holding your breath for 2 seconds so that the medicine can be absorbed in the airway. Repeat this process as prescribed by your doctor.
If you are using a spacer, be sure to read the instructions that accompany the device. Using the spacer may change how you use your inhaler.

, Certain medications come in powdered form which require you to use a different type of inhaler. If you have an asthma attack and need to use your DPI, you'll need to breathe in deeply and quickly.You may not feel or taste the medication as you breathe in and this is normal. To use:


Load the prescribed dose of medication by following the instructions that come with the inhaler.
Breathe out normally, holding the inhaler away from your mouth. Hold your chin up.
Put the mouthpiece between your lips. Breathe in quickly and deeply through the inhaler. Remove the mouthpiece and hold your breath for a count of 10.
Breathe out slowly but not through the inhaler. Moisture from your breath can make the powder stick inside the inhaler.Be sure to close the inhaler and store it in a dry place when you're finished using it.

, Nebulizers work by administering asthma medications as a fine mist through a mouthpiece or mask. This can make it a good choice for children, the elderly, or those that have trouble using inhalers. If you get dizzy while using a nebulizer, pause for five minutes and then continue the treatment.To use a nebulizer:


Wash your hands. Set the nebulizer on a sturdy platform and plug it in an electric socket. Attach the mouthpiece/mask and the nebulizer cup to the tubing. Attach the tubing through a port of the nebulizer.
Put the prescribed medication in your nebulizer cup and position the nebulizer upright so that the air flows more effectively.
Turn on the machine and breathe the aerosol slowly. Simultaneously hold your breath for two seconds to let the medicine absorb. Continue until the nebulizer cup is empty., Asthma triggers can be categorized as irritants, allergens, and other triggers. Irritants include smoke, smog, chemical fumes, and strong odors. You should know what kind of weather bothers your asthma and try to limit outdoor activity during these times. There are also other things you can do to decrease the effects of irritants within your immediate environment. These include:Asking for nonsmoking rental cars and hotel rooms
Sitting in the nonsmoking section when dining out
Avoiding fireplaces and wood stoves
Refraining from burning incense indoors
Checking air quality reports
Using home air conditioning instead of opening windows
Setting car air conditioning to recirculate
Using scent-free products
Avoiding the use of ammonia and bleach while cleaning
Using exhaust fans while cooking
Wearing a protective mask while doing tasks such as sanding, dusting, mowing, and sweeping

, Allergens are substances that cause allergic reactions. Common outdoor allergens include pollens from grass, trees, and weeds. Common indoor allergens include dust mites, cockroaches, mold, and pets.While it may not always be possible to avoid allergens, you can talk to your doctor about allergy treatments or medications. You can also try to decrease the effects of allergens on asthma by:Avoiding yard work, if possible
Tracking the pollen report, if available
Covering mattresses and pillows with hypoallergenic covers
Using HEPA air filters
Replacing carpet with wood or tile floors
Removing garbage from the home daily
Using bait stations or traps to control roaches (or calling an exterminator)
Cleaning damp areas weekly to prevent mold growth
Avoiding the use of vaporizers and humidifiers
Avoiding pets with fur or feathers

, Asthma often goes hand-in-hand with food allergies, especially to food additives. Some food additives include sulfites, metabisulfites, and sulfur dioxide. These are commonly found in wine, beer, and dried fruit. Check food labels and avoid food with these additives.


Talk to your doctor about avoiding, diagnosing, and managing food allergies. Some food allergies are quite severe and necessitate the use of an EpiPen for unexpected exposure.

, Colds, flu, and sinus infections are some upper respiratory illnesses that can irritate your airways and cause asthma attacks. To fight these illnesses, frequently wash your hands and get a flu shot every year.If you think you have the flu or another illness that is causing your asthma to flare up, contact your doctor.


Note that some aspirin and anti-inflammatory medicines like ibuprofen and naproxen are responsible for some asthma flare-ups.
Check labels on over-the-counter and prescription medications to avoid these substances.

, Emotions such as crying, laughing, or joy have been known to trigger asthma events. Practice slow breathing to relax and prevent asthma attacks.


Try exercising to manage stress. Don't avoid exercise if you have asthma. If you do have exercise-induced asthma, take a dose of a quick-relief inhaler 15 minutes before you start to exercise.
Be aware that overly intense exercise (or implementing a new exercise regimen too suddenly) can cause asthma to flare.

, The first place you start should always be following the asthma plan that your doctor comes up with for you. Every case is different and your doctor will be able to give you specifics for you particular case and lifestyle.


Ask your doctor for a written asthma action plan. This can take the guess-work out during an attack and can be shared with others if you need assistance.

, Your doctor can prescribe a peak flow meter which measures how fast you can push air out of the lungs. Decreases in peak flow meter results can signal an upcoming asthma attack, so it's important to keep track of your personal best when using a peak flow meter.To use the meter:


Move the marker to 0, or to the lowest number on the scale. Stand up. If you can’t stand, sit up straight in a chair. Be sure you’re in the same position each time you do this test.
Take as deep a breath as you can. Put the mouthpiece of the meter between your teeth and close your lips tightly around it. Be sure your tongue does not block the opening.
Blow into the mouthpiece once, as hard and as fast as you can. Then take the meter out of your mouth. Check where the marker has moved to on the numbered scale and write this number down.
Move the marker back to 0. Repeat the test two more times, circling the highest of the three numbers. This is your peak flow number., It's important to recognize when you need to slow down and rest. Overexertion or fatigue can lead to asthma attacks. Know when too much activity is too much, so you can rest and catch your breath before an asthma attack happens. Establish a regular sleep schedule with at least 8 hours of sleep each night., Drinking water will keep mucus moving in your lungs and prevent it from clogging up your airways, which can lead to shortness of breath.Try to drink a small glass of water at least once every 2 hours while you're awake. , Excess weight can increase the severity of asthma attacks. Gaining even as little as 5 pounds in a year can lead to decreased control of asthma, worse quality of life, and greater use of corticosteroid medicines.The key to reaching a healthy weight is a nutritious diet and exercise.Cut back on fatty foods, sugar, and excess carbohydrates. For more information on how to create a healthy diet for yourself, learn how to eat healthy.

, Stress can cause you to have an asthma attack because your body can respond by restricting your airways. Try reducing your stress levels through yoga, deep breathing exercises, biofeedback, guided imagery, and meditation. These are all ways to relax and de-stress.Biofeedback trains you to control your breathing, muscle tension, heart rate, and blood pressure. It is very effective in treating conditions brought on by severe stress.Guided imagery is a form of focused relaxation that helps create harmony between the mind and body., While strenuous exercise when your lungs are weak could lead to an asthma attack, moderate exercise can actually strengthen your lungs. Start with light or moderate exercises, like walking, and work your way into a more challenging workout regimen. Exercise most days of the week for a total of at least 30 minutes.Talk with your doctor to tailor an exercise routine that fits the limitations of your asthma.Try aerobic activity in the form of one of the following: jogging, swimming, bicycling, or walking. Do strength training with weights or resistance to build muscle.

, Smoking irritates the mucous linings of the airways which stimulates them to produce more mucus than normal. It also greatly increases your risk of other lung problems and cancer. If you have asthma, you should quit smoking to give your sensitive lungs a chance to recover.Avoid being around smoke in general. Second hand smoke can also wreak havoc on the linings of your airways so try to avoid being around cigarette smoke as much as possible.

Consult with your primary care physician.,
Get seen by an allergist.,
Consider seeing a pulmonologist.",How to Choose an Asthma Specialist1," If your asthma is mild you may simply need to see your primary care physician to have it treated. Your primary care doctor will be able to assess your condition and give you treatment for mild conditions.


Common signs of asthma include struggling to catch your breath, wheezing, coughing, or having tightness in your chest at night or after exercise.Good primary care physicians will be able to assess your condition and then decide whether they have the expertise to treat it or if you should be referred to a specialist.
If you are concerned that your primary care physician does not have the expertise to treat your condition effectively, you should ask them for a referral to a specialist to get a second opinion.;
, An allergist is a pediatrician or an internist, which is a doctor who specializes in internal medicine, who has undergone specialized training about allergies and immunology. You should choose to see an allergist if you know, or are suspicious, that your asthma is connected to allergic reactions.If you have any of these symptoms, you should probably be referred to an allergist:Asthma is decreasing the quality of your life
Your asthma medication is no longer controlling your condition.

, A pulmonologist is a doctor that has specialized in treating diseases of the lungs and respiratory system. They have completed several years of additional training after their residency to be considered a pulmonologist. Most often, you will consult with a pulmonologist if you have been admitted to the hospital because of your asthma or if you have an especially complicated, serious, or confounding condition.Seeing a specialist, whether you see an allergist or pulmonologist and especially if you have severe asthma, will increase the likelihood of getting better asthma care and improve outcomes from treatment."

Drink with moderation.,
Be aware that alcohol can weaken the immune system.,
Know that alcohol can dehydrate you.,
Check your medication for compatibility with alcohol.,
Don’t treat your cold with alcohol if you’re an asthmatic patient.",How to Use Alcohol to Treat a Cold3," Drinking alcohol to treat a cold cannot replace modern medicine or rest. Drinking too much alcohol can cause liver damage in the long run and can also make cold symptoms, such as congestion, sore throats, and coughing, much worse. These remedies are best used occasionally., Drinking too much alcohol can weaken your immune system, making it easier for you to get sick. When you are already sick, your immune system is weaker than normal. This means that drinking alcohol while sick may make it even more difficult for you to recover., When you are sick, you need to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids; this helps improve sore throats and congestion. Certain fluids, such as alcohol and caffeine, can dehydrate you instead, making things like congestion, sore throats, and coughing worse., Many medicines used to treat colds react negatively with alcohol. Combined with alcohol, they could cause dizziness, drowsiness, fainting, headaches, nausea, and vomiting. Check the user instructions you got with your medicine before drinking, and check the warning label. Common cold-related medicines that should not be taken with alcohol include:aspirin
acetaminophen (Tylenol)
ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil)
naproxen (Aleve)
cough syrups (Robitussin Cough, Robitussin A-C)
azithromycin (Azomax, Zithromax), Asthma can be triggered in known asthmatic patients after catching the common cold. A study found that certain additives in alcohol can worsen this respiratory condition as well. Try other common cold treatment options that are alcohol-free in order to ensure your safety.

As an exception, pure ethanol may have some therapeutic effects in treating asthma."

Get a referral from a doctor you trust.,
Verify the specialist's qualifications.,
Ask the doctor questions.,
Assess whether treatment is working.",How to Choose an Asthma Specialist2," If you need to see an asthma specialist you should ask your primary care physician for a referral. They should understand the severity of your condition, and thus what kind of doctor you need to see, and what doctors in your area are good at treating asthma.


If you live in an area that has few doctors, your primary care physician may suggest that you travel to see a doctor elsewhere that will be able to treat your condition. However, keep in mind that an internist is also qualified to treat asthma, and it might be easier to find an internist in your area than other types of specialists.Discuss the referral with your primary care physician to make sure that they understand any restrictions you have about traveling or location and what you want out of a specialist.
Getting a referral from your primary care physician may be especially important in terms of getting your treatment and visit covered by your insurance company. Many medical insurance companies require that patients go through their primary care physician first and get a referral for any specialized treatment., Do some research about a specialist you are considering getting treated by. Make sure that they have proper specialized training and experience with treating asthma. You want a specialist that is committed to treating your specific ailment.The easiest way to do research on a doctor is by doing a search for their name on the internet. In most cases, they will have a website that will list their qualifications and educational background. However, keep in mind that this information is self-reported. You can also call 1-866-ASK-ABMS to verify a physician’s Board Certification status. Or, you can check The Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB), for additional history and other information such as disciplinary issues and practice locations.In some cases you will be able to find information about doctors on the websites of your local medical societies.

, When you go to your first appointment you should ask the doctor a variety of questions about your condition and their experience in treating that condition. When asking questions you can get specific answers, as well as a general sense of the doctor's personality and bedside manner.Some things to ask the specialist include questions about billing and insurance coverage, where they have hospital privileges, and if they have any experience with alternative therapies in addition to western medicine.
When meeting the doctor you can ask them any questions about their qualifications that you were unable to find on the internet, such as whether they are board certified in their specialty.

, If you go to a specialist and you do not see any improvement in your condition after treatment, let your doctor know. It is important to tell them what seems to be helping and what is not helping so that they can adjust your treatment as needed. Try to be patient since it may take a while to find what works best for you.


Work with your doctor by tracking your symptoms and reporting on any side effects or changes for the better or worse.

Stay clean.,
Get some sleep.,
Eat well.,
Keep warm.,
Exercise.",How to Avoid Catching a Cold This Winter," Basic hygiene techniques can help you to avoid the office cold so remember to wash your hands or use an alcohol based hygiene gel after you may have touched something that could be carrying infection. The most important area to keep clean is probably your computer keyboard. Germs love keyboards and yours may be harbouring up to five times as many as the office toilet! Invest in some antibacterial wipes and clean you keyboard before you start work in the morning, this is particularly important if you share keyboards with others.;
, Everyone is more susceptible to viruses when they are run-down so getting your beauty sleep could be even more important during the colder months. Seven or eight hours a night is ideal and should keep you on form but quality of sleep is crucial too, so try to avoid falling to sleep with background distractions like the TV on, and take time to wind down before you drop off.

, Be sure to eat well at this time of year as optimum levels of vitamins and minerals, like zinc, vitamin C and vitamin D can really help your body to fend off infection. Other helpful foods include anti-viral garlic, immune boosting echinacea and probiotic foods and drinks.

, Some scientists think that cold viruses can sit dormant inside peoples noses until triggered by cold weather so it won’t hurt to keep wrapped up this winter and maybe hide your nose behind a warm scarf in colder weather.

, Another great immunity booster is regular exercise so don’t get complacent about your fitness just because it’s colder.

Visit your doctor.,
Take any prescribed medicine.,
Develop an asthma action plan.,
Diagnose asthma early.,
Use a peak flow meter.",How to Limit Long Term Health Effects of Asthma1," One way to limit the effects of asthma is to make regular visits to your doctor. Going to see your doctor helps you get the proper medical care needed to treat and manage your asthma. Getting the proper treatment helps reduce the negative effects of asthma that may lead to damage.Regular visits with your doctor help you stay current with medications and treatments, and helps your doctor detect any developing problems early.
This also limits asthma-related emergencies.;
, Taking the medicine prescribed by your doctor helps you control your asthma. This helps you reduce any negative effects and improve your all around health. The kind of asthma that you have influences the type of medicine that you take.There are two types of medicines. Quick relief helps when you have an asthma attack. Long term medications aim to reduce the frequency and severity of your asthma attacks.
Taking your long term medication is important. Some people only take quick relief medication when they have an attack, but if you are not taking your prescribed long term medication, your lungs or airways may still be inflamed. This means you may be contributing to long term damage to your lungs and air passages.

, Another way to protect yourself and limit the long-term effects of asthma is to develop an asthma action plan. An asthma action plan helps develop management techniques to control your asthma. They also help you know what to do if you face an asthma attack or other complications due to asthma.Asthma action plans identify triggers and outline management techniques to deal with triggers, like avoiding places with smoke or using certain types of pillows and bedding. The plan also outlines your long term and quick relief medication.
An asthma action plan helps you learn to recognize the early symptoms of asthma, which can help you prevent an asthma attack from occurring. This can limit or prevent any damage to your lungs or airways.

, Some children live with asthma for years and don’t realize anything is wrong. It is important to diagnose the condition as early as possible to avoid any long lasting damage to the lungs. Even if someone isn’t having an asthma attack or problems breathing, their lungs or airways may still be inflamed, which left untreated can cause permanent damage, such as permanently changing the shape of airways, causing irreversible scarring, and permanently reduced lung function.If you are concerned that your child might have asthma, ask your doctor about running a lung function test on your child. It is non-invasive and can help distinguish asthma from other conditions that can present with similar symptoms.
Having annual physical examinations and paying attention to any respiratory symptoms can help you alert your doctor to any problems.

, You can use a peak flow meter at home to track any changes in your asthma symptoms. Peak flow meters are most helpful if you have moderate to severe asthma. Using a peak flow meter can help you detect early any worsening of asthma symptoms before they get too bad or irreversible.You and your health care provider can discuss when you should use a peak flow meter and how often. Your health care provider can use your peak flow readings to adjust your medication or action plan if needed.

Limit exposure to stress.,
Use progressive muscle relaxation.,
Reframe negative thoughts.,
Repeat mantras to yourself.,
Use deep breathing.,
Delegate responsibility.,
Ask for support from loved ones.,
Destress and maintain your health with exercise.,
Follow a healthy diet.,
Get plenty of rest.,
Shift into bedtime mode.",How to Avoid Asthma Attacks when Stressed," Stress is one of the most common triggers for asthma attacks. Reducing how much stress you have in your life can prevent attacks or limit symptoms.Avoid situations you know are stressful as much as you possibly can. If you cannot, excuse yourself from any stressful situation. For example, “I’m very sorry, I need to step out to use the restroom.” Use this opportunity to help relieve tension and get a grasp on any early signs of an attack.;
, Relaxation exercises are an incredible way to reduce stress. In turn, they can also help you avoid an asthma attack. One type of relaxation exercise is to release muscle tension through your body. Do the following muscle tension exercise any time you feel stress:Tighten and contract each muscle group in your body for five seconds. Then allow each group to slowly ease into deep relaxation. After 10 seconds, tighten the next group of muscles, working up towards your head.Repeat the progression until you finish with your head and neck muscles.

, Your outlook can also affect your asthma. Having negative thoughts can make stress worse. This may lead to an asthma attack.Reframing negative thoughts or feelings may limit your stress and may help you avoid an asthma attack.Recognize that reframing is a relaxation technique that turns negative feelings into positive ones.For example, you may have missed a deadline because of an emergency. Instead of feeling doom and gloom, reframe the situation and say to yourself, “Ok, I missed the deadline but I’m almost done anyway. I’ll call Dan and let him know what happened and that I’ll finish it by 10am.”
Visualize peaceful scenes as another way to reframe your thoughts. For example, picture yourself in a favorite destination instead of where you currently are.

, Repeating mantras is a powerful way to relax. It offers a form of meditation that can also help you refocus your energy away from stress. If you’re feeling stressed, take a few minutes to repeat a positive mantra to yourself. This may help prevent a stress-related asthma attack.Recognize that even five to 10 minutes of mantra repetition can reduce your stress.Practice in a quiet and comfortable place where no one can interrupt you.Sit upright, still, and close your eyes. Breathe easily without controlling your breath. Then repeat your mantra. For example, “let go” or “I love and am loved” may help quickly calm you., Deep breathing exercises are another way to limit your stress.Practicing deep breathing when you feel stressed can relax you and relieve psychological stress. It can also help you avoid a stress-related asthma attack.Recognize that deep breathing can helps distribute oxygen to your body, reduce your heart rate, normalize your pulse, and relax you. All of these can control asthma and prevent attacks.Inhale and exhale naturally through your nose. Breathe to a specific count. For example, inhale for a count of 6 and then exhale for the same number.Sit upright with your shoulders back as you breathe slowly and evenly by pulling in your belly to expand your lungs and rib cage. This optimizes your deep breathing exercises.

, Many people are stressed from having too many responsibilities. Delegating responsibility to others can decrease stress. This can also help you avoid stress-related asthma attacks. Some ways to delegate responsibility in your professional and personal life include: Writing detailed lists to manage jobs more effectively
Training individuals to do a job or specific parts of it
Assigning responsibility for tasks to a specific individuals
Rotating unpopular or unpleasant tasks and duties

, The support of family and friends is very important and one of the most important ways to reduce stress. Reach out to loved for help any time you feel stressed. Not only can this relax you, but it may also prevent an asthma attack.Remember that your loved ones want to help you. Saying, “Maxine, could you please help me with the dinner? I’m so stressed and having problems with my asthma. I’m worried I’ll have another attack with everything there is to do.”

, Regular exercise is healthy for any person. But if you’re stressed, it can help you not only reduce your stress, but also may help you avoid an asthma attack. In addition, exercise can help you control your weight, too much of which can make asthma worse.Talk to your doctor before you start exercising. They will let you know if you are healthy enough for exercise. The doctor will let you know what types of exercise may be best for your asthma.
Get about 30 minutes of physical activity five or six days a week.Do activities such as walking, running, biking, or swimming. Recognize that other activities, including yoga or Pilates, also calm you and can strengthen your heart and lungs., Just as exercise can help manage your asthma, so can eating healthy foods. Follow nutritional guidelines for a balanced diet of three meals and two snacks per day. This can not only control your weight and manage your asthma symptoms, but may also reduce stress.Eat different of foods from the five food groups. Get extra fruits and vegetables, which may reduce lung swelling and irritation that can lead to asthma attacks.Avoid foods that can trigger asthma symptoms. Items containing sulfites, such as wine and shrimp may make your symptoms worse. Limiting sugar, caffeine, and alcohol can also reduce stress., Good sleep habits are very important. They can not only reduce stress, but also promote your overall wellbeing. In turn, this may help prevent stress-related asthma attacks.Aim to get seven to nine hours of sleep every night to help relax you and ward off stress.Develop a sleep routine by going to bed and getting up at the same time every day, including on the weekends.Set your room temperature between 60 – 75°F (15.6 – 23.9°C). Keep a window open or turn on a fan. This can cool and ventilate your room for optimal sleeping conditions.Remove any electronic devices and work from your bedroom. These can stimulate your brain and stress you., After a long day of activities, your body requires some time to come down. Winding down at least an hour before your fixed bedtime can help you relax and fall asleep.Follow a bedtime routine. This can help you relax and reduce anxiety that can cause insomnia or an asthma attack. Some things to do as a part of your routine include reading a book, snuggling with a loved one or pet, taking a warm bath, drinking warm milk or herbal tea."

Exercise.,
Maintain a healthy weight.,
Reduce stress.",How to Limit Long Term Health Effects of Asthma2," When you have asthma, you want to keep your lungs strong. Intense physical activity can trigger an asthma attack, but moderate exercise can help strengthen your lungs. Physical activity also has a variety of other health benefits, like fighting obesity, lowering cholesterol and high blood pressure, maintaining muscle tone, and improving mobility and flexibility.Good cardio exercises for asthma include walking, swimming, bike riding, and even short jogs. You may also consider trying yoga, weight lifting, or strength training.
Always talk to your doctor before beginning an exercise program when you have asthma. You and your doctor can determine the correct type of exercise for you based on your asthma.

, Maintaining a healthy weight is pivotal in limiting long term health effects of asthma. Because asthma may lead to reduced physical activity, those with asthma are more likely to be obese than those without it. More weight puts more pressure on the body and lungs when moving, making it harder to breathe. Being at a healthy weight can help improve your lung function and decrease your need to use asthma medications.In addition to exercise, eat a healthy, balanced diet. This includes eating a nutritious diet full of all five food groups: vegetables, fruits, low-fat dairy, lean meat and protein, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats.
Fill half your plate with vegetables or snack on fruits. Choose lean meats, such as skinless chicken breast or fish. Get healthy fats from avocados and nuts. Choose complex carbohydrates, such as oats, quinoa, or brown rice.
Limit the amount of fatty foods, sugar, and simple, refined carbohydrates. Choose healthy snacks over processed foods or packaged junk food.

, Stress can cause asthma attacks to happen more frequently and more severely. Stress causes shortness of breath and restricts your airways, which can trigger asthma.This can lead to negative long-term health effects since stress can cause an asthma attack at any age. You should learn to manage your stress so you can avoid unnecessary complications due to your asthma.


Everyone relieves stress in different ways. However, there are some common stress-relieving exercises you can do to help you with this. Try yoga, deep breathing exercises, guided imagery, or meditation. You can also try to go for a walk, engage in a hobby, or listen to soothing music.

Request an allergy test.,
Identify and avoid your asthma triggers.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Boost your immune system.,
Get vaccinated.",How to Limit Long Term Health Effects of Asthma3," An allergy test may be helpful if your asthma or your child’s asthma seems to be the result of allergens. Skin and blood testing can help your doctor identify specific allergens that may be triggering asthma symptoms. These allergens may include things like molds, dust mites, and animal dander.Ask your doctor about performing an allergy test on you or your child to identify allergens.

, Learning to identify and avoid your asthma triggers can help you avoid asthma attacks. Everyone has different asthma triggers, so you will have to figure out what your specific triggers are. Keep in mind that these triggers are not always obvious, so you might want to keep track of them in the form of a written log. Pay attention to where and when asthma symptoms occur. Pay attention to what environmental factors are in the air when your asthma begins. Some common triggers include:Tobacco smoke, including secondhand smoke, and smoke from outside burning
Dust mites
Air pollution
Cockroaches
Pets
Mold
Fragrances
Physical exercise
Certain respiratory conditions
High humidity or cold, dry air

, Drinking water can help minimize asthma symptoms and reduce the likelihood of having an asthma attack. Drinking water helps you keep the mucus in your lungs from getting sticky, which can clog up airways.Drink one glass of water every two hours while you are awake.

, Colds and flu symptoms can trigger your asthma symptoms. The swelling and mucus associated with cold-related asthma can put additional damage on your lungs. To help avoid unnecessary asthma, try to boost your immune system and stay healthy during cold and flu season.Wash your hands often, especially after you have been around someone who has cold or flu symptoms. Wear a mask if you have to be around sick people.
Boost your immune system by eating a healthy balanced diet for of vitamins and minerals, exercising, and getting plenty of sleep.

, Getting sick can significantly increase the likelihood that you will have severe asthma symptoms or an asthma attack. To help prevent this, you should get your yearly vaccinations. This can help protect your against certain health threats.For example, you should talk to your doctor about getting a flu vaccine or a vaccine for pneumonia.

Recognize flu symptoms.,
Distinguish between the flu and a cold.,
Distinguish between the flu and “stomach flu.” What’s commonly called “stomach flu” is actually not influenza at all, but a type of viral gastroenteritis.,
Know when to seek emergency medical treatment.",How to Treat the Flu1," Before you can effectively treat the flu, make sure that's what you actually have. Flu symptoms are similar to everyday cold symptoms, but they are more severe and occur more rapidly. They may last two to three weeks.The following are common symptoms of the flu:Cough, often severe.
Sore throat.
Fever above 100F (38C).
Headaches and/or body aches.
Runny or stuffy nose.
Chills and sweats.
Fatigue or weakness.
Shortness of breath.
Loss of appetite.
Nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea (more common in young children).;
, While the flu shows some similar symptoms to the common cold, cold symptoms develop more slowly and follow a predictable pattern of escalation and retreat.Symptoms of the common cold usually last less than a week or two and include:Mild cough.
Low-grade or no fever.
Slight aches or headache.
Congestion.
Runny or stuffy nose.
Itchy or sore throat.
Sneezing.
Watery eyes.
Mild or no fatigue.

, The flu affects your respiratory system, while “stomach flu” affects your intestines and is usually a less serious illness. Common symptoms of viral gastroenteritis include:Watery diarrhea.
Abdominal cramping and pain.
Bloating.
Nausea and/or vomiting.
Mild or occasional headaches and/or body aches.
Low-grade fever.
Symptoms of viral gastroenteritis usually only last a day or two but can last as long as 10 days.

, In extreme cases, the flu can cause severe dehydration or symptoms severe enough to require hospitalization. Seek immediate medical treatment if you or your child is experiencing the following symptoms:Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.
Chest pain or pressure.
Severe, persistent vomiting.
Dizziness or confusion.
Blueish skin tone or purplish lips.
Seizures.
Signs of dehydration (e.g., dry mucous membranes, lethargy, sunken eyes, decreased urination or very dark urine).
Severe headache or neck pain or stiffness.
Flu-like symptoms that improve, then return with more severity.

Incorporate raw garlic into food.,
Eat it raw.,
Take garlic extract.",How to Use Garlic as a Cold and Flu Remedy1," There are many forms of garlic available, such as garlic seasoning, garlic powder, and garlic salt. However, it is best taken in its natural form to release alliin that helps fight infections. Add two to four grams of fresh, minced garlic cloves to spice up your meals.


Sprinkle chopped garlic over spaghetti, mince some over baked chicken, or top roasted asparagus with it.
Each clove is approximately one gram.You can also cook garlic in olive oil, but to gain the most benefits of alliin, it is better to eat it raw. If you do want to use cooked garlic, lightly brown it over low heat so as not to destroy its active compounds.;
, If you don’t mind the bitterness, you can also eat the garlic cloves raw. To make it more edible, crush the garlic into a spoonful of honey or olive oil. When taken on a daily basis, this helps strengthen your immune system to reduce the likelihood of you catching and speeds up recovery.


Too much garlic may cause bad breath and low blood pressure, so limit your intake to two to four cloves of garlic a day., Usually available in liquid or capsule form, aged garlic extract can be added as a dietary supplement to your daily or weekly routine. Freeze-dried garlic is also available as tablets and capsules. On average, take ¼ tsp of liquid aged garlic extract once daily to get the daily recommended amount of alliin for adults. Garlic supplements can be taken on a daily basis.


Garlic supplements are not considered a complete treatment for colds and may be taken together with medication recommended by your doctor.
The suggested serving of garlic extract contains the same amount of alliin as two 200mg capsules of garlic supplements, which are taken three times daily.
Some supplements contain dairy or gluten that can cause allergic reactions in some people. If you are allergic to these substances, consult your doctor for a recommended dosage or prescription for your individual needs."

Wash your hands frequently.,
Avoid touching your face.,
Stay well away from people who are visibly ill. Avoidance of sick people is also a very good strategy to prevent getting the common cold, although it's not always obvious who's sick.,
Don't share items with sick friends or family.,
Keep household surfaces clean.,
Eat a nutritious diet.,
Drink plenty of fluids.,
Make sure you sleep well.,
Stop smoking.,
Get regular exercise.,
Stay warm and dry.,
Consider taking vitamin C. Vitamin C is probably the most studied supplement in terms of preventing the common cold and the results have been mixed and somewhat controversial.,
Look into vitamin D. Vitamin D acts much like a hormone and is important for immune function.,
Try taking echinacea.,
Experiment with zinc supplements.",How to Avoid Colds," Washing your hands often throughout the day is probably the single most effective measure to prevent the spread of the common cold and germs in general.The cold virus usually spreads via mucus and saliva from people's noses and mouths, which gets on to their hands and everything they touch. Wash with warm water and regular soap.


Wash your hands after touching people, working on a computer, shopping, going to the gym and/or spending time in public places.
Wash your hands after sneezing, coughing, after using the bathroom and before eating.
Carry some alcohol-based hand sanitizer and/or wipes with you to clean your hands when you're out of the house.
You can also wipe down surfaces before touching them, such as grocery cart handles.;
, The cold virus reproduces in your upper respiratory system, so it needs to get into your nose, mouth or eyes to infect you. As such, in addition to washing your hands, avoid touching or rubbing your face, especially your nose, mouth and eye areas.Try to avoid eating with your hands. If you have to scratch your face, do so through a clean tissue.


Most people habitually touch their faces due to a nervous habit, which increases their risk of contracting the common cold and other viral/bacterial infections.
Keep your hands on your lap or at your sides instead of leaning your face on them to reduce transmission of the virus.
Don't put your fingers in your mouth in attempts to clean your teeth or remove food. Use dental floss, a toothbrush or toothpicks instead.

, Start by keeping your distance from people who are repeatedly coughing, sneezing and/or sniffing. You'll likely need to keep at least six feet from them, but maybe up to 15 feet if they are really sneezing or coughing powerfully.Be strategic in where you sit on public transit, at school and at restaurants. Choose seats away from the congestion of people if you can.
Children catch the common cold more often than adults, so watch for kids who have obvious symptoms and then avoid them.
If your own friends or family are sick with a cold, explain to them why you're avoiding contact so they don't get upset about it.

, If someone in your family or social circle has visible signs of the common cold, don't share drinking glasses or utensils with them.Use your own glass, plates and cutlery when at the table or restaurants. In the bathroom, don't share towels, especially hand towels.


Alternatively, use disposable cups if you or a family member comes down with the common cold.
Consider using paper towels in the kitchen and bathroom for drying your hands because germs such as viruses can live for several hours on regular towels made of cloth.

, Don't just stop at washing your hands — also clean various household surfaces, such as countertops, sinks, door knobs, drawer pulls, computer keyboards, light switches, telephones and remote controls.These household surfaces commonly harbor viruses and bacteria and can be a source of transmission for the common cold and other infections.


Wipe household surfaces frequently with soap and water or an alcohol-based disinfectant solution.
If your kid has a cold, make sure to wash his toys at least every day.

, If a cold virus gets into your body it doesn't mean you'll automatically get sick because your immune system is designed to kill viruses, bacteria and other invaders. As such, keep your immune system strong by eating nutritious food, particularly fresh fruit and vegetables, with each meal.Fruits and veggies are rich in antioxidants, vitamins and other compounds that stimulate immunity.


If you find it difficult or unappealing to eat fresh (raw) produce throughout the day, then consider juicing them into a deliciously healthy beverage.
Federal guidelines recommend getting five to nine servings of fruit and veggies each day. Orange, yellow-orange and deep green colored produce tend to be the most potent for protecting against the common cold and other viral infections.
Avoid fried, fatty, processed and sugary foods. Snack on fruit instead of candy, cookies or chocolates.

, Drinking lots of fluid throughout the day is important for protecting against viral and bacterial infections because the mucus membranes lining your nose, sinuses, mouth, throat and lungs need water to remain moist and protective. This first line of defense against germs is called the mucociliary clearance system and it depends on good hydration to function well.Aim for at least eight 8-ounce glasses of purified water each day — maybe more if it's hot and you're sweating.


Most of your intake should be based on water, but you can add in some natural fruit juice, low-fat milk and herbal teas also.
Don't drink soda pop (especially colas) and other sweetened drinks because they tend to depress your immune function for a few hours or more.
Avoid alcoholic and caffeinated drinks because they can dehydrate you and reduce your immune function temporarily.
Chicken noodle soup does actually help prevent or combat a cold because it's a good source of nutrition and hydration, and it acts as a decongestant., Good quality sleeps are essentially for strong immunity because it's during sleep that your immune system recharges. Research suggests that people who get eight or more hours of sleep per night are less likely to come down with a cold compared to those who sleep for fewer than seven hours.As such, make your bed comfortable and your bedroom quiet, dark and a comfortably cool temperature in order to encourage good sleeps.


Don't read or watch scary or stressful material just before going to bed. Focus on calming activities, such as warm baths, relaxing music and going for slow walks.
Don't drink caffeinated beverages at least six hours before heading to bed. Switch to decaf coffee in the evenings.

, Cigarette smoke contains numerous toxins and harmful compounds, which increases the risk of infections by damaging the respiratory tract and decreasing immune response.In particular, smoking dries out mucus membranes, irritates the passageways and destroys the little hairs inside your nose, which all increase the likelihood of catching a cold. As such, stop smoking as soon as possible.


Even exposure to passive (secondhand) cigarette smoke can make you more vulnerable to the common cold.If you can't stop smoking ""cold turkey"" then consider using nicotine gum or skin patches short term to wean yourself off the habit.

, Although there isn't evidence from research to show that regular exercise can directly prevent colds, physical exercise does stimulate the immune system and makes it more able to fight infectious diseases in general.Aim for about 30–45 minutes of light exercise daily, such as walking or cycling, at least 3x per week.


Hard physical exercise can actually drain your energy levels and make your immune system temporarily weaker, so don't push yourself too hard.
Start with walking or cycling to condition your heart to regular exercise, then progress to stair climbing, jogging and swimming for a better workout.

, Although getting physically cold or chilled is not the direct cause of the common cold (it's a viral infection), it can reduce your immune system's function because your body needs to spend it's energy on maintaining an internal temperature of around 98°F (36.7°C) or so.Therefore, keeping yourself warm allows your body to expend energy on the immune system if needed.


Wear clothes in layers when it's cold out and always cover your head with a hat — a high proportion of your body heat escapes through your head.
Don't go outside with wet hair or damp clothing when it's cold out. Getting a chill can divert energy away from your immune system.
Don't forget to cover your hands and feet, as they are also significant sources of heat loss.

, Although many people swear by the vitamin, most scientific studies claim that it doesn't prevent colds, but it can reduce the duration and severity of the illness.However, critics of many studies claim not enough was given to people to make a difference.


For dosage, start with at least 1,000mg daily and build up to 3,000mg over the course of a week or so to make a significant impact on the common cold.
Some people take 1,000mg of vitamin C per hour for a handful of hours when they feel they're at risk or in the early stages of the illness, but medical recommendations are typically much lower. This is mega dosing and most likely will not result in any substantial benefit, as your body eliminates excess through urine.
Don't take more than 1,000mg at a time, especially if you're not accustomed to it, because it can trigger a short bout of stomach upset and/or diarrhea.
Vitamin C typically comes in capsules or tablets. Some tablets are meant to be dissolved in water.

, Humans make vitamin D3 in their skin when exposed to certain frequencies of summer sunshine, but many people are deficient in the vitamin because they avoid the sun, work indoors or live in northerly climates. Although the research is inconclusive for the common cold, vitamin D supplements (in the form of D3 drops) can make a significant impact on reducing the risk of developing an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI).The common cold is a type of URTI, so vitamin D is certainly worth a try as a preventative strategy.
Typical preventative dosages are between 2,000–5,000 IUs of vitamin D3 per day.
Instead of supplementing, you can spend more time outdoors during summer months, as vitamin D is stored in our bodies for many months if it's not immediately needed.
Wearing sunscreen can reduce the amount of vitamin D your skin makes but it is extremely important in preventing skin cancer. The amount of vitamin D you need depends on many factors, including skin type, time of year, and where you live.For most people, short exposure to sunlight (around 15 minutes or so) should be sufficient — if you get red or sunburned skin, then this is an indication that you have overdone it.

, Echinacea flowers have been used medicinally for many hundreds of years, particularly to treat and prevent respiratory infections. Modern research on the effectiveness of echinacea preventing or shortening the common cold is mixed, but it seems that in some people it can significantly reduce the severity and duration of symptoms when taken during the early stages.The type of echinacea plant and the preparation used makes a big difference in terms of effectiveness. Consult with a herbalist or Chinese medicine practitioner for advice.
Consider growing the plant yourself and then drying the flowers and using them to make a herbal tea — maybe 3 cups daily as a preventative measure.
Store-bought echinacea comes in capsules, tea bags and tinctures (liquids).

, Much like vitamin C, the cold-fighting reputation of zinc is also controversial and research on the mineral is mixed.However, zinc is important for immune function, particularly the health of mucus membranes in the respiratory tract. It seems that taking zinc supplements is most effective within 24 hours of the onset of cold symptoms.


Zinc typically comes in capsules, tablets, lozenges and nasal sprays. Over-doing it with zinc nasal sprays can cause permanent damage to your sense of smell, so be careful.
For the common cold, doses range from about 5–25mg of zinc (gluconate or acetate) in the form of lozenges or capsules every one to three hours for up to a day."

Clear mucus from your nose often.,
Use a heating pad.,
Relieve fever symptoms with a cool cloth.,
Gargle with salt water.,
Try an herbal remedy.,
Try a eucalyptus steam treatment.,
Take oscillococcinum.",How to Treat the Flu2," Sometimes it's possible to keep working or going to school with a cold, but when you have the flu, it's important to rest. Take a few days off to give your body time to recover.Since the flu is contagious, staying home is as considerate as it is necessary for your recovery.
You may experience congestion with the flu. Elevating your head with an extra pillow or sleeping in a recliner can make it easier to breathe at night.

, Having a fever causes dehydration, so it's important to drink more fluids than you normally would to combat the illness.Drink hot fluids like tea or warm water with lemon. These soothe your throat and clear your sinuses while hydrating you.
Avoid caffeinated drinks, alcohol, and soda. Choose fluids that will restore your body's nutrients and minerals, not deplete them.
Drink hot soup. You may experience nausea and a lack of appetite during the flu illness. Drinking hot soup or broth is a good way to get food into your system without upsetting your stomach.Studies have shown that chicken soup can actually mitigate inflammation in your respiratory tract, so if you’re feeling well enough, eating a bowl or two could really help.If you have also been vomiting, you may have an electrolyte imbalance. Use an oral rehydration solution such as Ceralyte or a sports drink containing electrolytes to replenish your body., Vitamin C is crucial for supporting your body’s immune health. Studies suggest that a “megadose” of vitamin C can help relieve cold and flu symptoms.Take 1000mg per hour for the first six hours as soon as symptoms appear. Then take 1000mg three times daily. Do not continue to take extremely high doses of vitamin C after you feel better, as vitamin C toxicity is rare but can happen.Orange juice is a good source of natural vitamin C but cannot provide a megadose.Talk to your child's doctor before giving high doses of vitamin C to your child.

, When you're congested, it's important to clear your breathing passage of mucus often, to prevent getting a sinus or ear infection. Clear mucus in the following ways:


Blow your nose. It's simple, but effective: blow your nose as often as it clogs to keep your breathing passage free.
Use a neti pot. Neti pots are a natural method for clearing your nasal passages.
Take a hot bath. The steam from the water helps loosen the mucus.
A humidifier or vaporizer in your room may make breathing easier.Use nasal saline sprays. You can also make your own nasal saline sprays or drops.

, The application of heat helps relieve the aches and pains that come with flu sickness. Use an electric heating pad or fill up a hot water bottle and lay it on your chest or back, wherever you feel pain. Just be sure not to have it too hot that it burns your skin or to leave it on too long. Never go to sleep with a heating pad or hot water bottle on your body.

, You can relieve the discomfort of fever symptoms by placing a cool, damp washcloth on your skin wherever you feel feverish.It can also help soothe sinus congestion when applied to the forehead and around the eyes.


A reusable gel pad can be found at most drug stores and can also help you feel cooler.
To cool a child down with a fever over 102F or a child that is very uncomfortable with a fever, apply cooled damp towels to the forehead to bring down the body temperature.

, A simple salt water solution can relieve the sore throat associated with the flu. Mix together one tsp of salt with one cup of warm water.


Gargle for a minute or so. Then spit the water out. Do not swallow the saltwater gargle.

, There is only limited scientific evidence for most herbal treatments for the flu. However, you may find some relief from one of these remedies. You should consult with your doctor before taking any herbal remedies if you take any medications, have any chronic medical conditions, or are treating a child.Take 300mg of Echinacea three times daily. Echinacea may help shorten the duration of your symptoms. Pregnant and breastfeeding women, people taking immunosuppressant drugs, and people who allergic to ragweed should not use echinacea.
Take 200mg of American ginseng daily. American ginseng (which is not the same as Siberian or Asian ginseng) may help make flu symptoms milder.Take 4 tablespoons per day of Sambucol, an elderberry extract. Sambucol has performed well in shortening the duration of the flu. You can also brew an elderberry tea by steeping 3-5g of dried elderflower in 8 ounces of boiling water for 10 to 15 minutes. Strain and drink three times daily., A eucalyptus steam treatment can help soothe a cough or congestion. Add 5 to 10 drops of eucalyptus oil to two cups of boiling water. Allow to boil for one minute, then remove from the heat.Move the pot to a stable surface, such as a table or countertop.
Cover your head with a clean towel and place your head over the pot. Keep your face at least 12 inches away from the water to avoid burns.
Inhale the steam for 10 to 15 minutes.
You can use peppermint or spearmint oil instead of the eucalyptus if you prefer. The active ingredient in mint, menthol, is an excellent decongestant.
Do not consume any essential oil internally. Many are toxic when ingested.

, This natural alternative to flu medicine is derived from duck offal, and is a popular treatment in Europe.Studies are not conclusive about oscillococcinum’s effectiveness. Some people may experience negative side effects such as headache from the supplement."

Buy over-the-counter medicine to treat symptoms.,
Give children the correct dosage.,
Take prescription medication.,
Understand that antibiotics will not treat the flu.",How to Treat the Flu3," The most common flu symptoms can be effectively treated with medication you can pick up at your local drugstore. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to recommend a medication that is right for you especially if you have medical issues such as high blood pressure, liver, or kidney problems, take other medications, or are pregnant.Flu aches and pains can be treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and aspirin, or a fever and pain reducer like Tylenol (acetaminophen). Be sure to check the package for the recommended dosage. Aspirin should not be given to children under 18.
Take antihistamines and decongestants to treat congestion.Take expectorants and cough suppressants to treat a cough. If your cough is dry and hacking, a cough suppressant that contains dextromethorphan is the best choice. However, if the cough is bringing up mucus, an expectorant containing guaifenesin is a better option to make the cough more productive.Be careful to avoid acetaminophen overdose. Many medications contain the same active ingredients, so read labels carefully.Follow the dosing directions on the packaging and do not exceed the recommended dose., Use children’s acetaminophen or ibuprofen for children. Follow the directions on the packaging for the correct dose. You can alternate between acetaminophen and ibuprofen if your child’s fever does not respond to only one, but make sure you keep track of when you give each medication.


You can also consult the guidelines at MedlinePlus, which is run by the US National Library of Medicine. They have guidelines for ibuprofen and acetaminophen.
Do not give ibuprofen to children who have been vomiting or are dehydrated.Never give a child younger than 18 aspirin. It increases the risk of developing Reye syndrome., If you decide to go to the doctor to get help treating your illness, you may be prescribed one of the following medications, depending on what strains of the flu are circulating. These medications can help reduce symptoms and shorten the illness if they're taken within 48 hours:Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is taken orally. Tamiflu is the only flu medication approved by the FDA for use in children younger than 1.Zanamivir (Relenza) is inhaled. It can be taken by people aged 7 years or older.It should not be used in people who have asthma or certain other lung problems.
Peramivir (Rapivab) is administered via IV. It can be used by people 18 or older.Amantadine (Symmetrel) and rimantadine (Flumadine) were used to treat influenza A, but many strains of flu (including H1N1) are now resistant to them and these medications are not commonly prescribed., Influenza is a viral illness. If you need them, your doctor will prescribe antiviral medications such as Tamiflu. Do not take antibiotics for the flu.Occasionally, you may have a bacterial infection alongside the flu, in which case your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic. Take medicines as prescribed.
Taking antibiotics when you don’t need them can cause the bacteria that are not killed to become resistant to drug treatment, which makes them much harder to kill with medication. Never take antibiotics unless you have been prescribed them."

Gather your ingredients.,
Place the ingredients in a sauce pan.,
Strain the mixture.,
Buy elderberry syrup.,
Take syrup daily.",How to Treat Colds With Elderberry1," You will need 1 cup (340 g) fresh or ½ cup (170 g) dried Elderberries and 3 cups (.7 liters) of water. To improve the taste, you can add 1 cup of honey (237 mL), one cinnamon stick, and three cloves. You can harvest the elderberries yourself or purchase them online from a health food store.If you are harvesting the berries yourself, only use blue or black berries. The red berries are poisonous.
You can find Elderberries in moist areas by rivers, roads, and in forests.;
, Put the berries, spices, and water in a saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil and then reduce to low heat. Let the mixture simmer for 30 minutes.Remove the saucepan from the heat and use the back of a spoon or a potato masher to smash the berries.

, Pour the mixture through a mesh strainer into a small bowl. Press as much liquid as you can from the berries using the back of your spoon. Allow the liquid to cool for a few minutes and then add honey to the juice if you wish. Store the syrup in a container with a lid.


Allow the syrup to cool and then you can store it in the refrigerator. It will last for two or three months., If you do not want to make your own syrup, you can buy the syrup. Elderberry syrup is called Sambucol. Sambucol typically contains 38% elderberry extract for adults and 19% extract for children. If you buy the syrup, the amount of elderberry extract should be standardized (look for syrups with a seal of approval from United States Pharmacopeial Convention or NSF International). When you make your own syrup, you will not know how strong the syrup is. Standardized extracts may be more effective.

, If you have the cold or a flu, take 4 tablespoons of syrup a day for three days. This could shorten the length of your cold by three days. You can also use the syrup on pancakes and waffles when you do not have a cold. This may help prevent colds.Start taking the syrup as soon as you have symptoms. Treatment may be more effective if you start when you first get sick.

Select the soup base.,
Prepare the chicken.,
Add vegetables.,
Make vegetable broth instead.,
Make broth with bouillon cube.,
Finish the broth.,
Add garlic.,
Eat the soup daily.",How to Use Garlic as a Cold and Flu Remedy2," A great way to incorporate garlic into your diet is to make a soup that has a lot of garlic in it. Depending on your personal preference, you can use either a vegetable or chicken-based broth. It is always better to make your own soup broth with fresh, natural ingredients.


If you’re using a commercial stock base or a bouillon cube, be sure to opt for low-sodium broth. You should also double-check the nutrition label for the sodium content of the broth or bouillon cube. Ideally, this amount should be less than 140 mg per serving., You can make a natural chicken broth using lean chicken. This helps you control the amount of sodium that goes into your broth. Use chicken leg quarters because they have a higher ratio of meat to bone. Remove any visible skin or fat from the meat. Then, measure approximately two to three cups of water in a large cooker and add the chicken pieces.Using this small amount of water will give you a richer broth.

, To the chicken and water, add a chopped medium onion, a tomato, two to three celery stalks, two to three carrots, and any other vegetables for flavor. You can also add herbs such as parsley or thyme for seasoning. Do not add salt.


If you’re using a slow cooker, cover and let it cook on low-medium heat for six to eight hours, or on high for four hours. If you are using a stove or burner, heat until it boils, then let it simmer on low heat for one hour., For a natural vegetable broth, use a variety of vegetables such as onions, parsnips, carrots, celery, leeks, mushrooms, and tomatoes. Lightly brown the vegetables in olive oil or canola oil, then add two to three cups of water. Bring the broth to a boil, then reduce heat to low-medium and let it simmer for 1 1/2 hours.You can add whatever vegetables you like. The flavor of the final product will depend on what vegetables you add to the mixture.

, If you’re using a bouillon cube or soup base, measure approximately two cups of water and pour it into a pan or bowl. Boil the water using either a stove or microwave. Add the soup base cube and stir until it dissolves.


You can skip the next step if you use a bouillon cube to make the broth. Just pour a portion of the warm broth into a cup or soup bowl.

, Once you cook the chicken broth, you need to remove the chicken and bones. Pull them out of the broth with tongs and set the chicken aside to eat later. Next, pour the remaining soup mixture through a strainer into large bowl to remove the vegetables from the broth. Pour a portion of the broth into a cup or soup bowl.


If you made vegetable broth, just strain the vegetables and pour the mixture into a large bowl.

, Using a garlic press, crush two whole medium cloves of garlic into the broth. Make sure to do this while the broth is still warm. Prolonged exposure to heat destroys the active compounds in garlic. It is recommended that you use fresh cloves to gain the most benefits of alliin, the active ingredient in garlic. This compound is released by mincing or chewing garlic.


Some studies suggest that powdered garlic may not be as effective.Once you add the garlic, stir it into the broth and drink immediately.
If you want something a little more substantial that broth, you can add a few cooked whole-grain noodles or brown rice to the soup to give it some texture and consistency.

, This soup is useful for the prevention against viruses during cold and flu season. You can eat a portion of the soup one to two times daily. Drinking this warm soup when afflicted with a cold produces an anti-inflammatory effect and increases movement of nasal fluids, which clears the nasal passages and eases congestion.

Get plenty of rest.,
Boost your immunity.,
Drink more fluids.,
Take a steamy bath or shower.,
Go to the doctor.,
Watch for side effects.",How to Use Garlic as a Cold and Flu Remedy3," Your body needs rest in order to heal faster. When you are sick, call in sick if you can. Get comfortable in bed or on the couch and don't push yourself too much. Try to take plenty of naps during the day, since having a cold can make you feel run down. If you have trouble breathing while sleeping, elevate your head on a pillow to decongest your sinuses.


If you are home sick, it is the perfect time to drink the garlic soup. Have someone make it for you or, if you feel well enough, make it yourself. It will help you feel better and relieve your symptoms.

, There are other ways to help boost your immunity to speed up recovery from colds, such as taking more Vitamin C. This is found in many vegetables and fruits. Good sources of vitamin C include citrus fruits, strawberries, sweet peppers, spinach, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and tomatoes.Try adding these vegetables to your broth to increase the immunity boost of the garlic soup. Add spinach, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and tomatoes to your broth when you cook it to get the extra Vitamin C.

, Drink at least eight ounces of non-caffeinated, non-alcoholic beverages every two hours to stimulate the nasal passage and aid the thinning of mucus. This will help the garlic work better with your system, since the garlic helps break up congestion., Steam helps moisturize your nasal passages so they feel less irritated. The relaxing effect will also help ease your cold symptoms. Draw yourself a hot bath or start each day during the duration of your cold with a nice hot shower so you benefit from plenty of steam.


For a quick steam treatment, you can heat up a pot of water just shy of boiling. When it starts producing quite a lot of steam, remove the pot from the heat. Put a towel behind your head and hold your face over the pot for about five minutes, letting the steam bathe your face. Don't get too close or the steam may burn you.
Add a few drops of essential oil to the water to further decongest your sinuses and get the benefits of aromatherapy. Try peppermint, tea tree, or eucalyptus oil.

, Garlic is meant to be used as preventive care rather than a treatment. If you are experiencing severe symptoms of a cold or flu such as high fever, ear or nasal infection, nasal discharge, cough with green phlegm, or breathlessness due to asthma or another respiratory problem, you should go to a doctor immediately. You should also see a doctor if you have been previously diagnosed with any respiratory disease.Do not take garlic if you are taking blood-thinning medications, medicines to lower blood pressure, or certain over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication for headaches, allergies, and colds. The combination of these medicines with garlic may cause dizziness and bleeding.
Garlic may possibly reduce the effectiveness of other medications and herbs. If you are already taking any medication or using remedies for another condition, be sure to ask for your doctor’s advice before using garlic.

, If you experience side effects such as bloating, fatigue, loss of appetite, muscle aches, vertigo, allergies such as an asthmatic reaction, skin rashes and skin lesions, stop using garlic and see your doctor immediately. These are the signs of serious conditions that need to be treated by a professional.

Get vaccinated before flu season.,
Talk to your doctor before getting the vaccine if you have certain conditions.,
Choose between the flu shot and the nasal spray vaccine.,
Take the flu seriously.,
Practice good hygiene.,
Keep your body in good general health.",How to Treat the Flu4," In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) monitor global health trends and statistics to develop a vaccine for the strains of flu virus that seem most dangerous that year.Flu vaccines are offered at doctor's offices, health clinics and even drug stores. They don't guarantee a season free of flu sickness, but they protect against many different strains of the virus and reduce your chances of getting the flu by about 60%.The flu vaccine is available via injection or nasal spray.In the US, most cases of flu occur between October and May, peaking in January or February.You may have mild symptoms, such as soreness, headache, or low-grade fever after getting the vaccine. The vaccine does not cause the flu., In general, all people over the age of 6 months should get a flu vaccine unless they have contraindications.If you have any of the following, you should talk with your doctor before getting vaccinated:A severe allergy to chicken eggs or gelatin
A history of severe reactions to a flu vaccination
A moderate or severe illness with fever (you can get the vaccine once your fever has resolved)
A history of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS)
A chronic condition like lung disease, heart disease, kidney or liver disorders, etc (only for nasal spray vaccine)
Asthma (only for nasal spray vaccine)

, The flu vaccine is available as an injection and as a nasal spray. Most people can choose either, but you should take into account things such as your age and health conditions when deciding.Also, keep in mind that flu vaccines are made new each year, so their effectiveness will vary. The nasal vaccine may be especially susceptible to this. Talk to your doctor to find out which vaccine is best for you.
The flu shot is approved for children 6 months and up, as well as pregnant women and people with most chronic medical conditions.
People who are younger than 65 should not get a high-dose flu shot.People younger than 18 or older than 64 should not get the intradermal flu shot, which is injected into the skin instead of into the muscle.Children younger than 6 months cannot get a flu shot.
The nasal spray vaccine is approved for people between the ages of 2 and 49.Children younger than 2 and adults over age 50 cannot use the nasal spray vaccine. Children aged 2 to 17 on a long-term aspirin regimen cannot use the nasal spray vaccine. Children ages 2 to 4 with asthma should not use the nasal spray vaccine.
Pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems should not get the nasal spray vaccine. Caretakers for people whose immune systems are extremely compromised should not get the nasal spray vaccine, or stay away from those persons for seven days after vaccination.
You should not take the nasal spray vaccine if you have taken antiviral drugs for the flu within the past 48 hours.

, The flu is highly contagious, and it can cause serious medical complications. Thanks to vaccination, death rates from flu have been falling steadily for decades, from 40 people per 100,000 in the 1940s to 0.56 per 100,000 in the 1990s. Still, it’s important to seek medical treatment if you display the symptoms of flu, and do your best to avoid contagious situations.


The 2009 H1N1 pandemic caused more than 2,000 deaths worldwide. The CDC believes that another such pandemic is possible, particularly if people do not get adequately vaccinated., Washing your hands frequently, especially after returning from a public outing, is a good way to keep yourself from catching the flu. Carry antibacterial hand wipes to use when you find yourself in a place without a sink and soap.Use an alcohol-based hand rub or soap.
Avoid touching your face, especially your nose, mouth, and eyes.
Cover your nose and mouth when you sneeze or cough. Use a tissue if you have one. If you don’t, sneeze or cough into your elbow -- you’re less likely to spread germs this way., Eating well, getting your body's daily recommended dose of vitamins and nutrients, and keeping in shape with exercise is a good defense against the flu. If it does strike, your body will be well-equipped to deal with the illness.


Getting enough vitamin D may play a role in preventing the flu. Studies suggest that a daily supplement of 1200 IUs per day can help prevent influenza A.Good sources include sunshine, fatty fish such as salmon, and vitamin A and D enriched milk."

Allow the flowers to steep in the water for 10 – 15 minutes. Pour the mixture over a strainer to remove the flowers from the mixture.You can sweeten the tea with honey or add some spices such as cinnamon and cloves if you like.
If you do not have any dried elderberry, you can use 2 tablespoons of syrup to make the tea.If you do not want to make your own tea, you can purchase elderberry tea bags that you can steep in water.

, If you are sick, drink the tea three times a day. Start drinking the tea as soon as your symptoms start. Again, the strength of homemade tea is unknown, but it should be just as effective as the syrup. Your symptoms should go away faster.
Avoid drinking the tea for more than five days.

, If you do not want to drink a syrup or tea, you can take elderberry pills or lozenges. Read the package instructions before taking them. The pills and lozenges work best if you take them as soon as your symptoms start.Lozenges that contain 175 mg of elderberry extract can help reduce flu symptoms.The amount of elderberry extract will vary depending on the brand that you buy. Read the package to see how much elderberry extract your pills and lozenges actually contain, and make sure they have a USP or NSF seal of approval to confirm that the ingredients have been verified.

, Berries must be cooked before they are ingested because raw berries contain a chemical similar to cyanide.Uncooked elderberries can cause cyanide poisoning, vomiting, diarrhea, cramps, and nausea. Do not drink any elderberry juice that was made from crushed stems, leaves, or uncooked berries. You should be fine as long as you boil or cook the elderberry before use.If you experience any of these symptoms, seek medical care and stop taking the elderberry.

, Before giving any herbal remedies to your child, first talk to the pediatrician., Elderberry stimulates your immune system, which may cause a flare up. Consult your healthcare provider before taking elderberry., If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, speak to your doctor before taking elderberry. There is not much information about the effects of using elderberry when you are pregnant or lactating. It is unclear whether it is safe or harmful. Because of this, it is recommended that you not take elderberry."

Take your temperature if you have a thermometer.,
Try to feel the skin of the person in question.,
Check for signs of dehydration.,
Check for muscle aches.,
Look for especially bad signs of a fever.,
When in doubt, see a doctor.",How to Tell if You Have a Fever1," If your temperature is 103°F (39.4°C) or lower, try to treat the fever at home, seeing whether it responds to at-home care.If it's 104°F or higher, call emergency services or go straight to the emergency room; you may need immediate medical attention.;
, If you're trying to self-diagnose fever, it's going to be hard to tell whether your temperature is at 98.7°F or at 101.2°F. You're probably better off trying to look for other symptoms of a fever (see below).


If you're trying to diagnose fever in someone else, try feeling the temperature of your own skin and then quickly checking the temperature of the person in question's skin. This should give you a good comparison for whether the person is feverish. If your skin is much cooler than the other person's skin, they may be feverish.
How accurate is this measure of diagnosing fever? One study found that people who try to diagnose fever by touch ""seriously overestimate"" the incidence of fever, sometimes by as much as 40%., A fever happens when your body sets its internal temperature higher to in order to ward off harmful infections, viruses, or other maladies.It's a natural defense mechanism. One significant result of this switching on of the body's heat switch is that patients can get or feel dehydrated.


Signsthat you may be dehydrated include:

Dry mouth
Thirst
Headache and fatigue
Dry skin
Constipation


Dehydration can be made even worse if it is accompanied by vomiting or diarrhea.If you've experienced any one of these, especially, be sure to drink plenty of fluids to compensate for their loss.

, In many cases, muscle aches are associated with dehydration, but they can be especially aggravating in a patient with the fever. Note: If your fever presents with back of muscle stiffness, call a doctor right away, as your condition may be related to bacterial meningitis, which can potentially cause brain damage., If your fever is at or above 104°F (40°C), you could experience some of the following in addition to hot flashes, dehydration, headaches, muscle aches, and general weakness. If you do experience any of the following, or have cause to believe that your fever is above 104°F, see a doctor immediately:


Hallucination
Confusion or irritability
Convulsions or seizures

, If you are dealing with a child who potentially has a fever, and whose temperature clocks in at higher than 103°F (39.4°C), see a doctor. In most cases, treating mild or moderate fevers at home is completely acceptable; in few cases, the underlying reason for the fever may demand serious medical attention.

Drink a small amount of water.,
Suck on ice cubes or popsicles.,
Consume other clear liquids.,
Drink ginger tea.,
Move to eating bland food.",How to Stop Vomiting when You Have the Stomach Flu1," Vomiting can cause dehydration; because of this, you need to replace the fluid you have lost with water. Keep in mind that you should only take small sips of water because if you gulp down a big glass and expand your irritated stomach, you could end up vomiting again.Take small sips of water every 15 minutes after you have vomited. Do this for three or four hours to hydrate yourself.;
, There are three benefits to sucking on ice cubes--one is that you can slowly begin to rehydrate and the other is that ice cubes will help numb your gagging reflex. On top of those two benefits, ice cubes and popsicles will also help you wash away the nasty taste left in your mouth after vomiting.

, Wait several hours after vomiting before you start drinking liquids other than water. Once you have waited several hours you will need to drink fluid with electrolytes, which are the minerals within your body that balance your metabolic processes. Vomiting leads to a decreased level of electrolytes--drinking electrolyte-rich drinks will help you to restore your metabolic processes.


After you have vomited, wait several hours before drinking any clear fluids. When several hours have passed, sip on clear liquids every 15 minutes for three or four hours. Clear liquids include apple juice, sports drinks like Vitamin Water or Gatorade, weak tea, and clear broth.

, Time and again, ginger tea has been proven to decrease the sensation of vomiting. Ginger has a soothing effect on the stomach, which will decrease your nauseous and chance of vomiting. You can buy ginger tea in your local grocery store.

, Once you have worked your way through water, ice cubes, and clear liquids and continue to feel less nauseous, you can try to eat some simple foods that are easy on the stomach. Only eat food if you have not vomited for at least four hours. Crackers and biscuits can be great vomit stoppers. Other simple foods you can try include:


Bananas, rice, applesauce, and plain toast. Your can remember these simple foods with the acronym BRAT.

Recognize the initial signs.,
Watch for additional symptoms.,
Understand the risk factors.,
Avoid serious consequences and complications.,
See a doctor immediately.,
Control the brain swelling.,
Maintain electrolytes and prevent internal bleeding.",How to Tell if You Have Reye's Syndrome," People with Reye's syndrome tend to become ill very suddenly. Signs typically appear about three to five days after the onset of viral infections such as influenza, chickenpox or the common cold, but, the signs may occur as late as three weeks after a viral infection.The symptoms are quite different from the flu or common cold, which are upper respiratory infections — the initial signs of Reye's syndrome can mimic food poisoning and the stomach flu. The initial signs of Reye's syndrome include:


Continuous vomiting (lasting for many hours)
Irritable behavior
Unusual sleepiness or lethargy
Moderate-to-severe diarrhea and rapid breathing (for little kids, or those younger than two years old)Dropping blood sugar levels with higher levels of blood acidity.
Swelling of the liver and brain;
, After the initial onset of signs, it usually takes a day or two for the more serious symptoms to develop and noticeable changes in mental status to occur. As Reye's syndrome progresses and gets more serious, additional symptoms often include:


Tiredness
Aggressive/irrational behavior
Confusion/disorientation
Weakness or paralysis in the limbs
Seizures, loss of consciousness and comaIf you see this pattern of signs or symptoms in your child or yourself, you need to get to a hospital or clinic for emergency treatment quickly.
Changes in mental status can include aggressiveness, agitation, amnesia, hallucinations (seeing and hearing things) and progressively reduced consciousness until the person lapses into a coma.

, The cause of Reye's syndrome is unknown, but it occurs almost exclusively in children younger than 18 years (particularly between four to 12 years) and is most common in the late fall and winter months.Most children diagnosed with the syndrome have a history of recent viral infection (influenza, chickenpox, common cold, rotavirus), which they are either still dealing with or just getting over. In addition to the association with certain viral infections, many affected children have a history of being given aspirin to control their fevers.


Since parents have been educated about the potential dangers of aspirin use for children, the incidence of Reye's syndrome has dropped off significantly. More specifically, there are only a few documented cases of Reye's syndrome in the United States per year now, although back in 1980, there were about 500 cases.People with fatty acid oxidation disorders (unable to break down fats because an enzyme is missing or malfunctioning) and other metabolic disorders appear to be at higher risk for Reye's syndrome.Exposure to insecticides, herbicides and paint thinners may also increase the risk of developing Reye's syndrome.

, Although most people (primarily children and teenagers) who develop Reye's syndrome survive, varying degrees of permanent brain damage are relatively common in survivors.The brain inflammation associated with Reye's is what causes the seizures, loss of consciousness (coma) and eventual permanent brain damage. The key to avoiding serious consequences and complications is getting the correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment quickly — within a few days of the onset of any symptoms. Left untreated, Reye's syndrome is sometimes fatal, but almost always destructive to the brain.


Brain damage can cause intellectual/developmental disability, behavioral problems, deafness, arm / leg paralysis and/or a long-term coma.
Since the 1980s, the risk of death from Reye's syndrome has decreased from 50% to less than 20% as a result of early diagnosis and aggressive therapy., If you've recognized some signs and symptoms of Reye's syndrome, contact your doctor immediately to be seen or go directly to the emergency room. Quick action is crucial, as fatality rates are less than 2% among patients in the early stages of Reye's, but greater than 80% among patients in the late stages.A pediatrician or neurologist (brain specialist) might be more experienced recognizing and treating Reye's. There's no specific test for Reye's syndrome, although blood and urine tests can determine high risks for it (metabolic disorder, low blood glucose, high liver enzymes, fighting an infection).Sometimes more-invasive diagnostic tests are needed to see if the brain and/or liver are inflamed:


A spinal tap (lumbar puncture) can help diagnose inflammation in the brain and rule out other causes, such as meningitis or encephalitis. During a spinal tap, a little bit of cerebrospinal fluid is removed and analyzed.
A liver biopsy involves inserting a long needle into the liver and taking a small tissue sample to see if there is inflammation and/or fat accumulation — common with Reye's syndrome.
A computerized tomography (CT) scan or MRI can also identify abnormal changes in the brain and liver.

, There is no cure or specific treatment for Reye's syndrome, but management of it centers around protecting the brain from irreversible damage by reducing swelling within the head.Medications called osmotic diuretics are usually given to people with Reye's, which decrease the pressure within the head and increase overall fluid loss through stimulating urination.Medications that lower ammonia levels are also used because it's known to increase brain swelling. In extreme cases, the pressure within the head has to be relieved by a decompressive craniectomy, which is an operation that involves cutting into the skull and draining the excess fluid.


Patients with Reye's syndrome are usually admitted to an intensive-care unit (ICU) within a hospital and monitored for escalating neurological and metabolic problems.
Once in the hospital, it's difficult to predict which patients get entirely better and which suffer brain damage. However, those patients who develop seizures due to brain swelling have the highest risk of brain damage (about a 30% chance)., Once the brain swelling is under control, doctors must also make sure that electrolytes (electrically charged minerals) in the blood are maintained because reducing fluid in the body with diuretics can deplete electrolytes.Electrolytes are needed to control the movement of fluid between cells and allow for electrical signals to travel within nerves. Intravenous fluids consisting of glucose (for energy) and an electrolyte solution are usually given through an intravenous (IV) line while in the hospital.


Medications are also needed to prevent internal bleeding due to liver dysfunction and abnormalities. As such, vitamin K and extra plasma and platelets are usually given to patients with advanced Reye's syndrome.Medications may also used to prevent or treat seizures.
Other concerns for people with Reye's include reversing any metabolic issues, preventing lung, kidney, or gastrointestinal complications and anticipating and preventing cardiac arrest (heart stoppage).

Breaking the fever before the body has had time to attack the foreign body may prolong the illness or mask other symptoms associated with the fever., An over the counter pain medication, such as an NSAID, could help treat some of the discomfort associated with fever. Often, low doses of NSAIDs produce good results.


Aspirin is for adults only. Aspirin given to children has been linked to a dangerous condition called Reye's Syndrome.It is therefore advisable only to administer aspirin as an adult.
Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil) are acceptable substitutes for all ages. If your temperature remains high even after the recommended dose, don't take more; instead, consult a doctor.

, Stick mostly to water if experiencing a fever. Sodas and teas, in moderation, may help calm the stomach. Try to eat soups or other liquid broths in addition to more solid foods.

Avoid unwanted smells, tastes, and sights.,
Steer clear of carbonated, acidic, and caffeinated drinks.,
Avoid spicy and oily food.,
Avoid riding in cars.,
Do not smoke.,
Avoid certain nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.",How to Stop Vomiting when You Have the Stomach Flu2," If the strong smell of car fresheners makes you feel nauseated even when you are not sick, then you should definitely avoid them when you are. The things you see, smell and taste are also stimuli for vomiting, so knowing what makes you feel queasy really matters.For example, some people feel queasy when they see blood, even if it is just movie blood. Other people feel nauseous when they eat blue cheese, or gag when they smell garbage. Whatever your triggers are, stay away from them.

, All three of these liquids can stimulate the gag reflex and may even irritate the lining of your gastrointestinal tract. You will want to avoid them for at least a day after you have vomited.


Carbonated beverages include all sodas and beer.
Acidic drinks include orange juice, grapefruit juice, and other drinks made with citrus.
Caffeinated drinks include coffee, black tea, and energy drinks.

, These types of food are clinically known to promote vomiting. Since your stomach needs to work double time to digest it, you will most likely vomit as a result. Wait at least 48 hours after vomiting before eating any sort of oily or mildly spicy foods., If you have motion sickness, then vehicles are off limits. When you have the stomach flu, you already have a tendency to vomit. Riding in a vehicle will only increase your chance of vomiting. This is because rapidly changing direction (like sitting in the back of a car making a U-turn) stimulates receptors in the vestibular labyrinth of the inner ear. From the inner ear, impulses are transmitted via the brainstem into the cerebellum, which houses the vomiting center, causing you to become physically ill.


If there is absolutely no way you can avoid riding in a car, ask the driver to take turns slowly and drive carefully so that no sharp movements are made. This can lessen your chance of getting sick.

, You probably already know that smoking is bad for your health. However, it is even worse for you if you are trying to stop vomiting. When you smoke a cigarette, you are inhaling nicotine. Nicotine causes the lower esophageal sphincter (the lower opening of your esophagus) to relax, which makes it much more likely that stomach acid will irritate the esophagus, causing you to vomit.

, Anti-inflammatory drugs are gastric irritants. These drugs inhibit the body’s production of prostaglandin, the natural chemicals that serve as messengers to promote inflammation. However, certain prostaglandins also serve to protect the lining of the stomach, and so using these drugs inhibits this protective effect, leading to irritation and vomiting.


These drugs include aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen.

"
"
Think of positive thoughts.,
Watch a movie or read a great book.,
Get some fresh air.,
Stay in an upright position.",How to Stop Vomiting when You Have the Stomach Flu3," Vomiting starts in the brain--your mind’s perception of nausea can lead to you becoming ill. Because of this, you need to divert your attention from the thought of vomiting by imagining scenic places or other images that can relax you. When you begin to feel nauseous, picture something that will distract you or calm you down. Listening to music that will make you feel calm and happy can also help you enhance your positive thoughts.For example, when you begin to feel nauseous, picture Christmas morning. Imagine all of your family around you, the glowing tree, the log on the fire, etc.

, Like thinking positive thoughts, engaging in an activity that will grab your full attention will help you to keep from vomiting. When your mind is engaged, it is less likely that you will feel nauseous, so you won’t vomit.


Watch movies that won’t remind you that you’re sick. For instance, if you feel sort of queasy when you see blood, don’t rent a horror film or that new vampire flick. Stick with comedies, dramas, romances, etc.

, Even if you feel too weak to go outside, you should still open a window to let fresh all into your room. Fresh air can do a nauseous person wonders. If you can, go sit in a chair outside. Let the breeze calm you down and look around at your surroundings. Focusing on something beautiful while breathing in fresh air can keep you from vomiting.

, Elevate the head of the bed by 45 to 90 degrees by propping yourself up on pillows. At the same time, elevate your feet at an angle higher than your body (again using pillows). This upright position can harness the power of gravity and help you to keep from vomiting. Keeping your feet higher than your center will also help improve blood circulation.

Get plenty of rest.,
Drink more fluids.Fluids prevent dehydration and keep your throat moist, making it a less appealing place for germs to gather.,
Keep the air moist.,
Bring out the chicken soup.Evidence suggests that chicken soup has anti-inflammatory properties, which may reduce nasal swelling and minimize your symptoms.,
Try zinc supplements.The jury is out when it comes to the benefits of zinc, but there are studies that suggest that a small dose of zinc supplement, when taken every two hours at the start of a cold, can shorten the duration of a cold and reduce the severity of symptoms.,
Use lemons.,
Consume some ginger.,
Reach for the garlic.,
Try Echinacea or goldenseal.Like many home remedies, there is mixed evidence about whether or not these two herbs have a positive effect on shortening the length of a cold.,
Bring a little spice into your life.,
Use saline nasal drops and sprays.These over-the-counter remedies relieve congestion and irrigate the nose, flushing out mucus as well as virus particles and bacteria.,
Try an over-the-counter cold medication.An over-the-counter decongestant dries up the mucus on your nose, which can both ease your symptoms and limit the amount of contact the virus has with your nasal lining.,
Opt for an antihistamine.If your nose is runny instead of stuffy, an antihistamine may offer you greater relief while doing more to minimize your cold symptoms.,
Take a walk.Light exercise can actually help boost your immune function.,
Increase your vitamin C intake.While vitamin C has long been promoted as a cold remedy, there is little scientific evidence to suggest its effectiveness.,
Have a little honey.Honey is thought to boost the immune system.,
Eat yogurt.",How to Stop a Cold when You Feel It Coming On," Aim for eight hours of sleep the first night after the cold starts coming on. A full night's rest improves immune function, making it easier for your body to fight off the invading virus.If you cannot get a full night's sleep, take a 20 to 30 minute nap in the middle of the day to force your body into rest-mode.
If possible, skip work or school at the onset of your cold in order to get more rest.Staying home can also prevent the virus from spreading to other people.;
, Fluids can also break up congestion and ease symptoms.


You should drink at least eight to ten 8-oz (250-ml) glasses of water each day, especially when you notice a cold coming on.
Water, caffeine-free teas, sports drinks, pure fruit juices, clear broth, and ginger ale are all acceptable and beneficial for colds.
Limit drinks with caffeine or alcohol in them, as these are diuretics that can cause dehydration.
Green tea and peppermint tea are both thought to contain properties that can help boost your body's defenses while expelling germs from the body., Dryness can help cold viruses linger and thrive, so filling the air with moisture can cut down on the length of your cold.Adding moisture can also ease your symptoms by preventing your nasal passages from feeling dry and sore.


Run a humidifier in the room you spend most of your time in or take a hot shower to create plenty of steam.
Warm moisture can be especially helpful.

, Consuming healthy calories is also essential early on so that your body has enough energy to fight the virus.


Make sure to drink the broth as well. The hot liquid contains a vast amount of the soup's nutrition and will also help keep you hydrated.

,


Possible negative side effects include upset stomach, nausea, abdominal pain, and mouth irritation. People who take intranasal zinc have also been known to permanently lose their sense of smell.At most, zinc may only trim a day off the duration of your cold.
Zinc supplements are available in liquid drop form, tablet form, lozenge form, and as intranasal spray.

, Lemon juice contains high levels of vitamin C, and the acidic nature of the juice can also help soothe your early symptoms and reduce the amount of phlegm.By reducing the amount of phlegm, you may be able to prevent the virus from settling in and causing a long-lasting infection.
Squeeze a lemon wedge into your tea or sip on lemonade.
You can also enjoy tea that combines lemon and honey for an even stronger benefit.

, Some researchers believe that ginger promotes healthy sweating, which can help boost your immune system at the start of a cold. By stimulating perspiration, ginger can cleanse your system and help lower your body temperature.Sweat contains dermcidin, a germ-fighting agent that may provide protection against invading microorganisms. The ability to protect your body from these invaders is strongest when you sweat a little, which ginger can help promote.
Steep a few slices of fresh ginger in hot water for several minutes to create an herbal tea. You could also consume foods containing ginger.

, Garlic contains allicin, a compound thought to boost the immune system and relieve cold symptoms. Some studies indicate that garlic may even help fight viruses and prevent future colds from happening to you.You can prepare a garlic ""tea"" by crushing one or two cloves of garlic and letting the garlic steep in hot water for several minutes.
You can also increase your garlic intake by consuming foods prepared with garlic. Add a little garlic to your chicken soup or help yourself to a slice of garlic toast.

, But studies seem to indicate that Echinacea and goldenseal are most effective when used as soon as you feel a cold coming on.


Take a liquid tincture of Echinacea or goldenseal since it seems to be more effective than the capsule form of these herbs.
If you are taking any medications, check with your doctor to verify that it is safe to take these herbal supplements. Herbs can negatively interfere with some medications.

, Have a bowl of chili or add a dash of hot sauce to your next meal. Spicy foods temporarily open the sinus passages, which can relieve congestion and keep the mucus flowing.Note that this is most effective when your early symptoms start in your nose rather than your throat. By keeping your sinus passages as clear as possible, you can help prevent infection from setting in and encourage the expulsion of the cold virus.

, Manually flushing out germs can promote a speedy recovery.


Squeeze the bulb syringe to fill it with saline fluid and place the tip in your nostril about 1/4 to 1/2 inch (6 to 12 mm) deep. Slowly release the bulb to empty the saline into your nose.
If you cannot get to the store to buy saline nasal solution, make your own by combining 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) salt with 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) baking soda and 8 oz (250 ml) warm water. Use it in conjunction with a Neti pot for best results and make sure you always use water that has been filtered, distilled, or boiled for at least a minute.
Make sure to rinse the syringe after each application and let it air dry. Doing so can prevent re-exposure to the same germs.

,


While decongestants often help soothe your symptoms, they may or may not help shorten the length of your cold. By easing your symptoms, however, you improve your odds of staying well-rested, which can increase your body's overall ability to fight off the virus faster.
Note that decongestants can increase heart rate. They may also cause anxiety and insomnia in some individuals. If you are taking prescription medication for any condition, consult a pharmacist prior to purchasing medication to ensure no interactions will affect you negatively.

,


Antihistamines are generally considered allergy medicines but they stop sneezing and reduce drainage more effectively than a decongestant does. By drying up the mucus, an antihistamine limits the amount of time the virus comes into contact with the lining of your nose. This may cut down on the length of your cold as a result.
As with other treatments, the sooner you start taking the medication, the stronger the effect will be.
Note that antihistamines tend to make people drowsy. Those that also contain a decongestant tend to minimize this drowsiness, however. You can look for non-drowsy antihistamines. Avoid using antihistamines if you are driving or work with heavy machinery.

, Since your symptoms are mildest at the onset of your cold, take the time to squeeze in some light exercise — like brisk walking, in two to three 10-minute stretches.


Yoga and other gentle exercises can be performed instead of walking. These options may even be better if the weather outside is too nasty for a walk.
Take precautions if the weather is chilly or rainy. Bundle up in order to keep yourself dry and warm.
Taking a walk outside on a sunny day can also grant you the opportunity to absorb some vitamin D from the sun, thereby giving your immune system another added boost.

, Vitamin C does boost the immune system, however, and some research suggests that it may shorten the duration of symptoms if taken at the beginning of a cold.


Vitamin C can be taken in supplement form or it can be consumed naturally through food and drink. Most fruits contain high doses of vitamin C. This is especially true of citrus fruits.

, It also has antibacterial and antimicrobial properties, which can offer further help in speeding up your body's healing response.


Take a spoonful of honey when you notice your first symptoms in order to give your immune system a quick jolt.
Honey is especially soothing if your first symptoms begin in your throat.
You can mix honey into your tea, coffee, or water as well.

, Acidophilus and other active cultures in yogurt can put healthy bacteria back into your body, thereby strengthening your immune system. These beneficial bacteria can help stimulate the production of various immune system substances that help your body fight diseases.Yogurt is especially effective at returning healthy bacteria to your gastrointestinal tract, where much of your immune function actually occurs.

Let the fever run its course.,
Take ibuprofen or acetaminophen for any discomfort.,
Rest as much as possible.,
Hydrate your body by drinking water.,
Bathe yourself in lukewarm water.,
Monitor the fever closely.,
Take infants (under 3 months) to a doctor if a fever over 100.4 °F persists.,
Keep your child hydrated.,
Wipe your child’s skin with a wet washcloth.,
Administer ibuprofen if your child feels discomfort.,
Keep track of how long the fever has lasted and its peak temperature.,
Note any severe symptoms.,
Call your doctor.,
Prevent future fevers.",How to Treat a Fever," A fever itself is not necessarily unhealthy. It's not an illness; it's a physiological response to something else. Your body will often react to sickness or infection with a fever; it is a defensive response by your immune system as it tries to rid the body of pyrogens (fever-producing substances).Acting too quickly to treat your fever can, counterintuitively, harm your body by undercutting one of its defensive measures.
Rather than treating your fever immediately, continue to take your temperature and monitor your symptoms. The fever will probably subside in time.;
, Having a fever can sometimes cause headaches, as well as joint and muscle pain. If your fever symptoms are uncomfortable, you can alleviate them with ibuprofen (Motrin) or acetaminophen (Tylenol).Avoid giving aspirin for a fever, especially if you are dealing with a sick child.Aspirin can have harmful side effects for anyone under the age of 18.
Aspirin is generally more likely than ibuprofen or acetaminophen to cause gastrointestinal side effects.
Never give aspirin to a child. It can cause a potentially life-threatening condition called Reyes Syndrome.

, This is the best forms of fever treatment; further exertion will likely cause the fever—and the infection or illness that caused the fever in the first place—to worsen.


Wear light clothing to keep your body cool. You should avoid raising your body temperature any higher than it already is, especially if it is summer or you live in a warm climate.
Sleep when you can, under only a sheet or light blanket. Often the discomfort of a fever makes it difficult to sleep at night. Any sleep will help your body; take naps during the day, and sleep when you can at night.

, Along with resting, you must hydrate your body when it is feverish.Fevers often cause the body to sweat, which expels fluids from the body. To compensate for these lost fluids, drink plenty of water.


Although children may prefer to drink soda or juice, these fluids are not as helpful in staying hydrated. However, if your feverish child will only drink soda or juice, it’s better than nothing.
Coffee and tea are also not as effective as water.

, Immersing your body in lukewarm water will cool off your skin and may alleviate discomfort from the fever.Don't submerge yourself for too long; you want to give your body a chance to release heat through evaporation.
Do not take an ice bath; the water temperature should be around 85 °F.
If you are caring for a feverish child, try sponging them or wiping their skin with a damp sponge or a wet washcloth.

, As is the case with a fevered adult, a fever usually indicates that your child’s body is raising its own temperature to fight off a sickness or infection. However, because children’s bodies are smaller and often have weaker immune systems, there are certain precautions to take when you are dealing with a feverish child.


Continue to take your child’s temperature (at least every couple of hours), either rectally, orally, or in their ear or armpit.If your child is under 36 months old, the rectal temperature is the means of measurement recommended by doctors.

, Although in children and adults, a low-grade fever is nothing to worry about, it can be harmful to infants.


If you have a baby 3–6 months of age with a temperature of 100.4 °F or higher, take him or her see a doctor, even if the child has no other observable symptoms.Once your child is older than 6 months, you don’t need to be concerned unless her fever reaches 103 °F., Just like for fevers in adults, you need to make sure your child consumes plenty of fluids—primarily water—to replenish the fluids that they lose through sweat.Although children may prefer to drink soda or juice, these fluids are not as helpful in staying hydrated. However, if your feverish child will only drink soda or juice, it’s better than nothing.

, The washcloth (or sponge) should be lukewarm, not ice-cold.Ice cold water will cause your child to shiver, which will combat your intent by raising their temperature.


Do not give your child an ice bath or insist that they take a cold shower.

, Ibuprofen is safe for children of any age, and should reduce the aches and chills that are often associated with fevers.Acetaminophen may also be useful for symptoms of a fever.
Remember to dose a child's dose of ibuprofen or acetaminophen by their weight.
Avoid giving aspirin for a fever.Aspirin can have harmful side effects for anyone under the age of 18.

, Normally, a fever will break and subside after a day or two. If the fever has lasted more than three days, you may need medical attention.If your peak temperature rises over 102 °F, the fever has become severe., Although a fever is typically a sign of the body trying to get rid of a virus or infection, severe and painful symptoms can indicate complicated medical problems. These should not be dealt with using fever-remedy methods. Contact your doctor immediately if you have a fever and experience:


Confusion or trouble staying awake.
Severe lower abdominal pain.
Blisters or rashes on your skin.

, Severe, long-lasting fevers should not be treated from home; your doctor may want to put you on an IV to keep you hydrated or prescribe another treatment. If you have a severe fever, your doctor may even send you to the emergency room.


Even if the fever has not reached 102 °F and has not lasted multiple days, you should still call you doctor if you are experiencing unexpected symptoms., The best way to avoid having a serious fever again in the future is to avoid the illness or infection that lead to the fever in the first place.You can do this by:


Staying up to date on your immunizations.
Avoid contact with ill people, and wash your hands.

Apply a soothing moisturizer to the outside of your nostrils.,
Buy tissue with lotion.If you're willing to pay a slightly higher price, splurging on high quality facial tissue can go a long way toward soothing your nose.,
Soak your nose with a moist washcloth.,
Reduce your nose blowing.,
Use gentle nose-blowing technique.Instead of taking a deep breath and blowing as hard as you can, blow gently to reduce chafing.,
Seek medical treatment for allergies.A doctor will be able to prescribe allergy medications that can control your reaction.",How to Soothe a Sore and Irritated Nose After Frequent Blowing1," Petroleum jellies like Vaseline and ointments like Neosporin work best. Place a small amount of the product on a Q-tip, then apply it around the entrance of each nostril. The extra moisture will not only relieve dryness, but will also create a barrier against irritation from a runny nose.If you don't have something like Vaseline or Neosporin handy, you can use your regular facial lotion. It won't lock in moisture as effectively, but it should still provide some relief.;
, Look for products that have been treated with lotion. They do less damage as you're blowing your nose, and counteract the irritation with their soothing lotion. Less chafing during nose-blowing means less irritation in the long run.

, If your nose is badly chafed or even bleeding, add warm moisture quickly to relieve the pain. Run a clean washcloth under hot water, then gently press it into the nostrils. Tilt your head back and leave the washcloth in place until it cools back down to room temperature. Breathe through your mouth during this time.


Apply petroleum jelly or Neosporin to your nose immediately after soaking your nose with a washcloth.
Either dispose of the washcloth or wash it immediately.

, A runny or congested nose can feel terrible, and you may be tempted to blow your nose constantly. Though it may be hard, fight that urge. Especially if you're home alone and there's nobody to judge you, blow your nose only when necessary. If a little mucus runs out of your nose, gently dab it away instead of honking on a dry tissue and irritating your nose.

, Blow softly through one nostril, then the other. Continue alternating nostrils until you feel your nose is clear enough.


Always loosen the mucus with a decongesting technique before blowing your nose.

, Whether you get allergy shots or take Flonase nasal spray when your nose starts running, treating the underlying allergy will help soothe your nose.


Note that oral decongestants tend to make your mucous even dryer, increasing irritation.

"
"
Loosen your nasal secretions.,
Sit in a steamy room.,
Apply a warm compress to the bridge of the nose.Take a moist washcloth and place it in the microwave until it's warm, but not burning hot.,
Irrigate your nose with saline spray.This just means you'll flush your nasal passage with a saline spray.,
Try using a neti pot.,
Drink warm tea throughout the day.,
Exercise, if your health allows it.If you are bedridden with a cold or flu, you should absolutely get some rest.,
Eat something very spicy.,
Invest in a humidifier.,
Massage your sinus area.Massaging the areas that affect your sinus may open up your nasal passages and make it easier to blow your nose.",How to Soothe a Sore and Irritated Nose After Frequent Blowing2," There are many methods you can use to liquefy and loosen the secretions blocking up your nose. By setting aside a little time for these techniques, you can improve the efficiency of each nose blowing. Over time, you'll have to blow your nose less frequently, decreasing the chafing on your nose. Try these decongestant techniques throughout the day, and always blow your nose immediately afterward.

, If you belong to a gym with a sauna, that's the perfect place to both loosen nasal congestion and relax after a long day. But if you don't have access to a sauna, you can improvise in your bathroom. Turn on the hot water in the shower, and close the door to keep all the steam in. Stay in the bathroom for three to five minutes or until you feel the secretions are loose and moist. Gently blow your nose before leaving the steamed room.


To save water, you can just blow your nose when you get out of the shower.

, Microwaving time will vary depending on your machine, so start with 30 seconds and add 15 seconds at a time. The washcloth should be hot, but tolerable. Place the cloth across your nose and allow to sit until the heat is gone. The heat should loosen secretions, even when applied from outside the nasal cavity.


Repeat the process if necessary before blowing your nose.

, You can buy a nasal saline spray at any grocery store or pharmacy. Spray the bottle twice into each nostril, adding liquid to the secretions and liquefying them. If you don't want to buy a saline spray, you can make a simple one at home:


Mix eight ounces of warm water with 1/2 teaspoon of salt.
Buy a suction bulb from the grocery store or pharmacy. Use it to irrigate your nostrils with your homemade saline rinse.

, A neti pot looks like a miniature tea pot. It clears out blocked sinus passages in the nose by flooding warm water through one nostril and out the other. Heat the water to at least 120 °F (49 °C) to kill anything potentially harmful in the water. Allow the water to cool to a comfortable temperature before using the neti pot. Tilt your head, and pour water into your right nostril. If you keep your head tilted, it will drain out your left nostril.


Consider skipping the neti pot if you live in an area with inadequate water treatment. There have been some reports of rare amoebic infections from parasites in tap water., The throat and nose are closely connected, so drinking warm liquids will also warm up the nasal passage. Just like inhaling steam, this will allow secretions to flow more freely. Any type of tea you prefer is fine, but you may choose to drink a healing herbal tea if you have a cold. Check your grocery store or health store for cold or flu teas. Peppermint and clove teas can soothe a sore throat while freeing up your nose., But if your excessive nose blowing is caused by allergies, exercising is a good option. When your heart rate rises enough to make you break a sweat, it has a beneficial side effect of clearing your nasal secretions. Even 15 minutes of exercise can help, as long as you avoid the allergen. For example, if you're allergic to pollen, don't go running outdoors.

, Think about the last time you ate something uncomfortably spicy. Do you remember how your nose started running?That's the ideal state for nose blowing, so power your way through hot salsa, peppers, hot wings — anything to get your nose running. Blow your nose immediately while the secretions are still moist and fluid.

, You can buy a humidifier at the drugstore to keep the air moist as you sleep. Choose a humidifier with a cool mist setting, as a warm mist might make congestion worse. Set the machine to the ideal humidity level — between 45 and 50%.A tabletop version holds one to four gallons of water, and should be changed daily. Clean the water container completely by hand every three days.
The filter, preferably a HEPA, should be changed at the discretion of the manufacturer.

, For a little extra punch, use rosemary, peppermint, or lavender oil, but make sure not to get it in your eyes. You can rinse your face with a warm compress afterward. Using your index and middle fingers, apply gentle pressure in a circular motion to:


The forehead (frontal sinus)
The bridge of the nose and temples (orbital sinus)
Under the eyes (maxillary sinus)

Consult your doctor or an aromatherapist before pursuing aromatherapy treatment for asthma.,
Discover the benefits from different essential oils and decide which combination of aromatherapy oils you want to try.,
Use a twice-daily chest rub of aromatherapy oils in between asthma attacks to help soothe the respiratory system..,
Make a steam with lavender by adding 10 drops of essential oil to each quart of a very hot bath or bowl full of steaming water.,
Try using lavender in a humidifier or diffuser in your home if the steam method is too intense.

,
Massage aromatherapy oils on your feet.

",How to Use Aromatherapy for Asthma," You should never substitute aromatherapy for medical treatment.;
, Each essential oil can be used diluted on its own, or you can combine several according to your needs.


Use marjoram, rose or frankincense, which opens up the chest and allows the body to breathe fully and deeply. These herbs have anti-inflammatory and expectorant effects. Many people report feeling uplifted after experiencing frankincense in particular.
Relaxants like lavender and geranium can lessen the spasms that accompany an asthma attack. Both are known to have a comforting and calming effect.
Try using salvia sclarea as an anti-inflammatory.
Peppermint and ginger are known decongestants and contain antihistamines.
Chamazulene, found in German chamomile, stops the release of histamines in the body that cause irritation in the lungs and can bring on an asthma attack.

,


Combine 10 drops of aromatherapy oil with about 20 milliliters of another oil, such as sunflower oil or soy oil, to make the chest rub.
Since most asthma sufferers have scent sensitivities, take a small sniff of your blend first to determine if it will cause an adverse reaction.

, Then create a tent over the bowl or bath so you can breathe it in.


Steam can open your airways and lavender has a calming effect. The steam method can be used during an asthma attack and has been known to completely stop an attack or at least make it less severe.
You can steam up to 3 times per day. Make sure to avoid burns to the face by hot steam and keep your eyes closed to avoid eye injuries.

Stay healthy.",How to Stop the Spread of a Pandemic Flu Virus1," Use a disposable tissue and flush it down the toilet or throw it in a trash can immediately (don't put it down on any surface). Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer right afterwards. If you don't have anything to cough or sneeze into, cough or sneeze into the inside of your elbow rather than your hand. Change your clothing (if you were wearing long sleeves) or wash your arm as soon as you can. Carry tissues with you and offer them to others.;
, Wash your hands throughout the day, especially after touching other people or any surface that others have touched. Carry alcohol-based sanitizer with you. Offer it to others. Avoid touching your face unless your hands are just cleaned.

, In cafeteria settings, it's not uncommon for people to casually share utensils or take a sip from someone else's drink. This should be completely avoided if there is any risk of a flu pandemic.

, If used correctly, face masks and respirators may help prevent some exposure to flu viruses. However, face masks should be used along with other preventive measures, such as frequent hand washing.

, Get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids, and eat nutritious food. The healthier you are, the better your immune system will be at defending your body against a virus.

Know what to expect.,
Stock up.,
Plan ahead.,
Talk to your employer.,
Stay updated.",How to Stop the Spread of a Pandemic Flu Virus2,"


A vaccine for pandemic flu may not be available for 4-6 months after a pandemic starts, and even then, it may only be available in limited amounts.
People will have little or no immunity to pandemic flu since it is a new virus to humans. With seasonal flu, people have some immunity built up from previous exposure to the viruses.
Symptoms of pandemic flu may be more severe than seasonal flu. More people are likely to die from pandemic flu than from seasonal flu.

, Store nonperishable foods, bottled water, over-the-counter drugs, health supplies, and other necessities. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recommends having a 2-week supply. (These supplies can be useful in other types of emergencies, such as power outages.) Have basic, over-the-counter health supplies such as a thermometer, facemasks, tissues, soap, hand sanitizers, medicine to relieve fever, and cold medicine.

, Plan for what you will do in the following cases:


Schools dismissed: Consider childcare needs. Plan home learning activities and exercises. Have materials, such as books, on hand. Also plan recreational activities that your children can do at home.
You or family member becomes sick and requires care: Make plans for how to care for people with special needs in case the services they rely on are not available. Plan to stay home for at least 10 days when you are sick with pandemic flu. Staying home will keep you from giving it to others. Make sure others in your household also stay home when they are sick. During a severe pandemic, stay home if someone in your household is sick with pandemic flu.
Transportation networks disrupted. Think about how you can rely less on public transportation during a pandemic. For example, store food and other essential supplies so you can make fewer trips to the store. Prepare backup plans for taking care of loved ones who are far away. Consider other ways to get to work, or, if you can, work at home.

, Ask your employer about how business will continue during a pandemic. You can Develop a Risk Management Plan that accounts for the possibility of a flu pandemic. Find out if you can work from home, or if your employer will consider virtualizing the workforce. Plan for the possible reduction or loss of income if you are unable to work or your place of employment is closed. Check with your employer or union about leave policies.

Eat some chicken soup or drink a hot beverage.,
Try saline spray.,
Use menthol in a gel form.,
Use saltwater to gargle.,
Raise the head of the bed with wedge pillows.,
Use a humidifier.,
Hide the light.,
Maintain a comfortable room temperature.,
Try essential oils.",How to Sleep With a Cold," Decongestants help clear out your airways, making it easier to sleep. As an added bonus, nasal sprays work only on your nose, so they won't make you jittery or keep you awake like some oral medications can.Avoid oral drugs like Benadryl and pseudoephedrine after 6:00 p.m. until you know how they affect you. For instance, pseudoephedrine can make you jittery, keeping you up.However, if you know Benadryl makes you sleepy, feel free to take it at night to encourage deep sleeping.
Antihistamines like Benadryl are not always that effective against colds, though they can help if you have allergies in addition to a cold. Some experts suggest that antihistamines like brompheniramine and chlorpheniramine are more effective against colds.You should only use nasal spray decongestants for a couple of days, as overuse can increase inflammation of your mucous membranes. Once you know what nasal decongestants make you sleepy or at least don't keep you awake, you can switch to a pill.;
, Nasal strips open up your nasal passage ways, which lets you breathe easier during the night., Simple acetaminophen is effective at reducing your temperature if you have a slight fever and relieving pain from a sore throat or blocked sinuses. This increased comfort will help you rest easier.When taking acetaminophen, check any cold medication you are also taking to see if it also contains this pain reliever. Taking too much acetaminophen can cause liver damage, and you may not realize you are already taking some if you are not reading the labels.You may be tempted to take Tylenol PM while you have a cold. However, Tylenol PM contains diphenhydramine, which is Benadryl.As noted above, you shouldn't take Benadryl at night until you know how it affects you. Also, if you do take Tylenol PM, make sure you aren't double-dosing by taking Tylenol PM along with another medication with diphenhydramine or an antihistamine in it.

, If you have a dry cough, which can sometimes accompany a cold, you can use a cough syrup with a cough suppressant such as dextromethorphan.If you have a wet cough, meaning you are producing mucus when you cough, talk to your doctor, especially if it's keeping you up.Cold medicines and cough syrups like Nyquil combine some of the above ingredients. For instance, Vick's Cold and Flu Nighttime Relief Liquid has a cough suppressant, acetaminophen, and an antihistamine.Therefore, read labels so you aren't taking the same medicine twice. Also, make sure you know how this medication affects you before you take it at bedtime so it won't keep you up.

, Not only will the hot water relax your muscles, but also the hot steam breaks up congestion, allowing your sinuses to drain. In turn, you won't sniffle as much through the night., The steam from food has a similar effect to the shower, providing some relief from congestion. In fact, your mother may have been correct in making you chicken soup for supper when you were sick, as some studies have shown it can be more effective at clearing out your nasal passages than hot water alone.Additionally, drinking fluids and eating soups keeps you hydrated, which helps with congestion.Avoid caffeinated drinks before bed, as they can keep you awake.
Drinking certain teas, like chamomile, can also help you relax, encouraging you to drift off to sleep easier., Saltwater can clear out your sinuses. You can either use a neti pot to pour saltwater into your nose or use a saline nasal spray from the pharmacy to spray the water into your nose.If creating the saline solution yourself, be sure to use sterilized or distilled water to help prevent infection. You can also boil it yourself., While rubbing mentholated gel on your chest does not necessarily open up airways, it can make you feel like your breathing easier due to the cooling effect., Saltwater can relieve throat pain for a short period of time, letting you drift off more quickly. Simply dissolve 1/4-1/8 teaspoon of salt into water, and gargle with it for 30 seconds to a minute. Be sure not to swallow the water., Create a slight incline with the pillows, raising the top half off your body about half a foot. Because this position reduces blood flow to your head, your nasal passages will be less inflamed, letting you breathe better.It can also help relieve sinus pressure., Humidifiers can ease congestion when you have a cold. Humidity in your house should be between 30 and 50 percent. If it's drier, you can run a humidifier in your bedroom to help raise the humidity.To measure the humidity in your home, purchase a hygrometer from a hardware store. Some humidifiers come with this feature, so you can also measure the humidity that way.Keep your humidifier clean for the most benefits. Use distilled water, and make sure to change the water out often, as well as put in a new filter periodically. Also, be sure to clean out the humidifier twice a week. Dirty humidifiers can increase bacteria in the air., That is, make sure all light sources are snuffed out, from using dark curtains for the windows to covering your alarm clock. Light tells your brain to wake up, so extinguishing these sources can help you sleep., Make sure your room is not too hot or cold, as that can make your restless or wake you up. Some experts recommend between 65 degrees and 72 degrees for sleeping.When you have a cold, you might lean more towards the warmer side but don't make your room too hot., Essential oils like lavender and chamomile can relax you. Add a few drops to a spray bottle with water and spray your pillow before bedtime."

Sing more quietly.,
Reduce physical effort by staying still when you sing.,
Stay hydrated.,
Change the notes.,
Keep it short.,
Rest, hydrate, and steam afterwards.",How to Sing With a Cold1," Once you are at your performance, there are several things you can do to protect your voice. The first is to sing more quietly than you might normally.Singing more quietly may help preserve your voice for the the duration of the performance, and avoid strain.
If you are singing with a microphone, ask to turn up the PA system so your voice will be more amplified. This will make you easier to hear and hopefully reduce the temptation to strain your voice to achieve your normal volume.;
, Depending on the type of singing you're doing, the performance can be a very physical process. Try to reduce physical effort to conserve energy.If you are a rock singer, for example, you may be accustomed to jumping around, dancing, and so on, as part of your performance. Try to keep these activities to a minimum and focus on making it through the performance.

, Right before and during your performance, drink lots of water.Drink a tall glass before you play, and take a bottle or two on stage with you. This can help keep your energy levels up and your vocal cords lubricated.

, It's a good idea to go in to the performance with a ""plan b"" for some of the notes you would normally sing. High notes in particular may simply be outside your range right now.Think about whether you could sing those notes an octave lower, or sing a different note in the same key that won't sound too far off the mark. You just won't be able to cover the same range you normally would, so it's better to have an alternative in mind than to strain for notes you can't reach.

, If possible, keep the performance short. If you have control over this, reduce the number of songs you'll be singing, dropping out the particularly difficult ones.Planning to do an encore? Consider just doing one more song, instead of the two or three you had planned.
In an audition or chorale performance, you may not have much control over this, but if you do, make the most of it.

, After the performance is over, drink water, use your humidifier, and get plenty of rest. Your vocal cords will now need time to recover from the ordeal of the performance."
"
Consider the symptoms.,
Contemplate how your performance will be affected.,
Think about the possibility of vocal cord damage.,
Weigh the importance of the performance.",How to Sing With a Cold2," The excess mucous and inflammation that result from a cold will make singing uncomfortable.So, if it isn't important to to sing, it may not be worth it.


Colds can also cause headaches and sinus pressure.You can alleviate these somewhat with medication, but singing is still not likely to be a lot of fun.
Performing when your body is ill denies it the rest it needs to recover. You may be prolonging your illness by deciding to sing., Regardless of whether you feel personally up to singing, another important question to consider is whether your cold will ruin your performance. Sometimes a bad performance is worse than none.


When you have a cold, excess mucous can drip onto your vocal cords. This can distort or muffle your singing, as the vibrations produced by your vocal cords will be affected.A cold can also cause a sore throat, or pharyngitis. The pharynx is essentially the resonating system for your voice, and inflammation can make it difficult to stretch the tissue as necessary to produce the desired sounds.
In rare instances, the inflammation from a cold can move down into the larynx, causing laryngitis. Laryngitis can result in a temporary alteration or loss of one's voice. If this occurs, there is usually no point in trying to sing., Although rare, it is possible for singing with a cold to harm the vocal cords. This is especially true among singers who lack formal training.Prolonged singing when your voice is strained (as it can be with a cold) can produce vocal nodules, or callouses on the vocal cords.If this occurs, you will need a prolonged vocal rest (or, in an extreme case, surgery) to regain your singing ability. This isn't common, but it's a possibility to consider.
If you are experiencing severe vocal cord swelling or hemorrhage, do not sing under any circumstances.Seek immediate medical attention.

, Ultimately, in deciding whether or not to sing, you'll need to make your own decision about whether these discomforts and risks outweigh the importance of the performance.


If it's a very important performance and you think you can carry it off, it might be worth going ahead.Sometimes cancelling a performance is the professional choice. Losing your voice or fainting on stage are probably worse than not performing at all."

Get plenty of sleep.,
Drink lots of water.,
Drink warm tea.,
Humidify your environment.,
Take vitamin C. Vitamin C is a natural immune system booster.,
Eat plenty of garlic.,
Consider medication.,
Rest your voice.,
Warm up, if desired.",How to Sing With a Cold3," If you decide to go ahead with the performance, there are things you can do to minimize the effects of the cold. Getting enough sleep is important for anyone recovering from a cold.


For singers, inadequate sleep sometimes causes notes to come out a little flat.Sleeping with an extra pillow can help the excess mucous drain better, rather than accumulating in your throat.

, Drinking plenty of water is important for anyone trying to get over a cold. For a singer, it's especially important, as staying hydrated is important for your vocal quality. If you're feeling really dried out, as much as a gallon per day is appropriateDrink water at room temperature. Drinking very cold water can make it harder for the muscles in your throat to function as they should,so definitely don't add ice!, Prepare warm (not scalding hot) herbal tea with lemon and honey. The honey will coat your throat, preventing damage to your voice.Licorice and slippery elm tea, along with honey, are particularly soothing to an inflamed throat., Humidifying the air can also help your vocal cords, as you will be breathing in moisture. Run a humidifier while you sleep during the nights prior to the performance.If you don't have a humidifier, close yourself in the bathroom with the shower running. The warm steam from your shower will have the same effect.

, Take plenty in the days leading up to your performance.Vitamin C is found in fruits like oranges and pineapples, and can also be taken as a vitamin supplement.

, Many singers also believe that eating garlic can help combat a cold.Indeed, garlic is a great immune system booster, rich in sulfuric compounds that can kill bacteria and other infections, and is also a great source of potassium.Garlic is found in many foods and can also can be taken a supplement, but some singers believe that eating cloves of raw garlic is most helpful.Doctors agree! Raw garlic is most beneficial for the immune system., Some cold medications may dry out your throat, making the situation worse rather than better.Choose the medicine that's right for you.


Decongestants help eliminate excess mucous, but also dry out your nose and throat. They can leave your vocal cords feeling rough or tired very quickly once you start singing. If you use decongestants, make sure to drink a lot of water!Numbing sprays and lozenges can provide immediate relief for a sore throat, but they also make it harder to tell if you might be straining your vocal cords, making damage more likely.Many medications contain alcohol. While this can make you feel better, it can also dry you out and even lead to more mucous production. It is best to stay away from such medications (and alcohol in general) before singing., In the days before your performance, use your voice as little as possible.This will help your voice recover.

, Some singers who will be performing with a cold choose to rest their voices as long as possible, especially if they have a cough. Others choose to do some light warmups, such as the following:Early on in the day, warm up your voice without singing. Try some light humming. Or, just practice talking in different pitches, using resonant words like ""yeah"" or ""myah.""If your voice cracks or starts to feel strained, stop and resume your vocal rest.

Buy the right kind.,
Take propolis.,
Use andrographis.,
Try herbal decongestants.,
Reduce the duration with herbs.,
Try omega 3 fatty acids.,
Try spirulina.",How to Use Supplements to Treat the Flu1," When buying supplements, look for reputable manufacturers. These bottles will have seal of approval on them from an accreditation service, such as Consumer Labs, the Natural Products Association (NPA), LabDoor, and the United States Pharmacopeia (USP). These independent organizations have labs that test supplements to ensure they contain what the label says they contain.Bear in mind that supplementation is not a regulated industry, so it is important to buy pure products and check for interactions against current prescribed medication. Interaction checks can be completed by local healthcare provider as well as pharmacists at drug stores.
You should also remember that most supplements are not backed by scientific research — most evidence is anecdotal, or based on a personal account, rather than the rigorous testing that drugs and medication go through.
Avoid supplements with added sugar, additives, or preservatives. You don’t need additives or preservatives if you are using a supplement before its expiration date.;
, Propolis is a natural resin made by bees that has antiviral capabilities. When you have the flu, take one to two teaspoons of propolis daily. You can get this in liquid form at your local health store or pharmacy.If you want to help prevent the flu, start taking propolis at the start of flu season and continue until it is over.
Do not use propolis if you are allergic to black poplars, bee stings, or other bee products or if you are pregnant or nursing. Ask your doctor before taking it if you have asthma or chronic digestive disorders.
If your child has the flu and you wish to give him propolis, speak with your doctor or a practitioner of homeopathy.

, Andrographis is an herb that is thought to lessen and shorten the symptoms of the flu. It is generally taken as a capsule, which can be found at pharmacies. The general dose can range from 500 to 3,000 mg depending on your need, so ask your doctor which amount is right for you.Do not take if you are pregnant or breastfeeding., Since congestion is one of the symptoms of the flu, you may need a supplement to help with this symptom. Eucalyptus and peppermint are both great herbs that can help with cough and decongestion.They can be found in many cold medicines and lozenges. You can use them both as herbs and oil supplements to help your symptoms, though neither oil should be ingested. These can be found at your local pharmacy or health food store.
Try peppermint tea as well. The dried form of the herb is extremely soothing when you have the flu.

, Echinacea has been shown to decrease the length of the flu by up to one and a half days. Elderberry, another herbal remedy, has been shown to help reduce the flu by up to three days. These can be found in capsule, liquid, or herb form. They are also available as oils, which should not be ingested unless specifically instructed by your doctor.You may be able to find echinacea or elderberry tea at health stores.
Do not use echinacea or elderberry if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
Look for them at your local pharmacy or health food store.

, Omega-3 fatty acids are used by the body to make anti-inflammatory substances. They can be found naturally in fish, oats, and nuts, but supplements help you get your daily recommended amount. Look for purified, mercury-free fish oil capsules that contain at least one gram of EPA and DHA, two different forms of omega 3s, at your local pharmacy or health food store.Take one to two grams every day while you are sick. You can also take this amount to help prevent further sickness and as a preventative method before you get sick
Be cautious when taking omega 3 fatty acids if you are taking blood thinners. Ask your doctor for advice before you do.
Be aware that large doses of omega 3's can cause increased bleeding, decreased control of blood sugars in diabetics, and increased depression., Spirulina is a blue green algae that has proven in a laboratory context to destroy the influenza virus. It has not been tested in such a way in people, but it may be effective in treating your flu symptoms. It can be found at pharmacies and health food stores. You can take it as a powder, as a capsule, or as flakes. The recommended daily dosage is four to six 500 mg capsules per day.Since the recommended dose varies a great deal, ask your doctor the right dose for your particular case."

Try arginine.,
Get more vitamin D. Vitamin D supplements have been shown to decrease the likelihood of contracting the flu.,
Take probiotics.,
Get more vitamin E. Vitamin E may be useful in protecting against and preventing infection from the influenza virus.,
Take additional immune supportive supplements.",How to Use Supplements to Treat the Flu2," Arginine is a semi-essential amino acid, which is a building block for proteins that can be synthesized by the body but is also required by it to function. Arginine may help decrease the risk of upper respiratory infections (URIs), so start taking this supplement before the flu season begins. The supplement is available in pharmacies and the recommended daily dosage of arginine is two to three grams.You can get arginine naturally in walnuts, eggs, milk, meats (turkey breast and pork loin), and peanuts, so eat more of these as well to increase your intake of arginine.
Talk to your doctor before taking arginine when you have the flu to make sure it will not interact with any medication you’re on.
Do not take arginine if you have a history of liver or kidney disease, if you’ve had a stroke, if you have sickle cell disease, if you are taking blood thinners, or if you are taking medications for high blood pressure or diabetes. Do not use arginine if you are pregnant or nursing.

, Vitamin D is naturally available in salmon, mackerel, sardines, milk, eggs, cheese, and cod liver oil. However, if you want to boost your immune system with vitamin D, find a supplement, such as vitamin D3, to increase your levels. These are available at your pharmacy or health food store.


Often times people in colder climates are deficient in Vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency can cause increased risk for many chronic disease including cancer, autoimmune diseases, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and osteoarthritis.General supplementation should be guided by physician as this is a fat-soluble vitamin (meaning it stays in your system and excess amounts are not flushed out with your urine) and toxicity can occur.If you are vegan, you can try vitamin D2, which is not derived from animals., Probiotics are good bacteria that help fight infections in your body. To this end, they can help you prevent the influenza virus by boosting your immune system. You can get probiotics naturally from yogurt or take them as supplements, which can be found at most pharmacies, grocery stores, or health food stores.Do not take probiotics if you are taking immune-suppressing medications or if you have a disease that affects your immune system unless specifically told to by your doctor.

, You can get some vitamin E from foods, such as leafy green vegetable and nuts, but supplements help get enough to build your resistance. The supplements are available at most major stores.The recommended daily dosage is no more than 15 mg, or 22.4 IU, but you should speak with your doctor before using vitamin E, as it is fat-soluble.


For children under the age of 14, the recommended daily dosage is 7 mg, or 10.4IU, of Vitamin E.
Do not use supplemental vitamin E if you are pregnant or nursing. , Zinc and vitamin C both help run, support, and improve your immune system. Take 30 mg of zinc every other day and between 75 and 125 mg of vitamin C every day. These can be found at most major stores that sell supplements.Do not take more than 50 mg of zinc per day. Too much zinc actually increases your risk of contracting the flu.
Vitamin C is also an anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and an antiviral agent. It’s safe for children and adults.

Notice the symptoms.,
Diagnose the flu.,
Treat the flu medically.",How to Use Supplements to Treat the Flu3," There are certain symptoms you can look if you think you have the flu. You may have some or all of the known symptoms of the flu, but they can vary per case. These symptoms should be watched for closely in those at higher risk of death or complications, such as the very young, the very old, those with HIV/AIDS or other immune suppression diseases, and those with cancer. The common symptoms of the flu to look out for are:Chills or fever
Cough and sore throat
A stuffy or runny nose
Body aches
Headaches
Fatigue
Vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children than adults

, If you think you have the flu, see your doctor. He will do a physical exam and check your symptoms. Lab tests are usually not necessary. You may not need to see your doctor if you are generally in good health. However, if you are at high risk, use home treatments for one to two weeks without getting better, or experience severe symptoms, see your doctor immediately.Talk to your doctor about getting vaccinated before flu season. Vaccinations can make a significant difference in how the flu affects you, and you may not get it at all.

, Medical treatment is usually rest and fluids accompanied by some kind of medication that depends on your symptoms. You may be prescribed medications such as amantadine (Symmetrel), rimantadine (Flumadine), zanamavir (Relenza), or oseltamivir (Tamiflu). Other common medications include fever reducers such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen, over the counter nasal decongestants, drowsy and non-drowsy antihistamines, and cough syrup.Do not use nasal decongestant sprays (such as Afrin) for more than five to seven days. After prolonged use, they can make your symptoms worse and actually cause congestion.

"
"
Get a decongestant.,
Try saline nasal drops.,
Suck on some zinc lozenges.",How to Relieve Head Congestion1," A decongestant usually contains a cocktail of drugs to treat the multiple symptoms associated with congestion. In most cases, they are combined with an analgesic such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or aspirin to relieve headaches and sinus pain. These can be purchased over-the-counter at a drug store.Many decongestants such as phenylephrine and pseudoephedrine narrow the blood vessels to clear out nasal congestion. This also increases blood pressure. Therefore, proceed with caution if you already have high blood pressure.
This product can be found in tablets, capsules, liquids, and syrups.
Make sure to read the label carefully or talk to a doctor before taking a decongestant because serious side effects can occur in babies, pregnant women, and people with allergies. Take the correct dosage and do not abuse the medication.;
, Saline nasal drops are effective, safe, and non-irritating. Saline (salt water) helps to liquefy mucous secretions that block the sinuses and reduce the chance that the mucus will crust along the sinus cavity. Nasal drops (or sprays) will moisten the mucous membranes of the nasal sinuses and can be purchased over-the-counter at a drug store.It is recommended to take saline drops after the use of a decongestant.
Taking saline nasal drops will help you avoid the “rebound effect” often associated with obsessively taking a decongestant nasal spray.

, Taken as a lozenge or syrup, zinc has shown to reduce the length of a cold by up to one full day if taken during the onset of symptoms. Zinc lozenges and syrups can be purchased over-the-counter at a drug store.Zinc prevents the rhinovirus from multiplying and prevents it from lodging in the mucous membranes of the throat and nose. The rhinovirus is the source of most common colds.
Despite these initial findings, there is still not enough evidence that zinc has the impact on reducing head congestion as previously advertised. Zinc will boost the immune system against the virus but will have little influence on congestion.
Side effects usually include nausea, bad aftertaste, and the possibility of the loss of smell.

"
"
Drink liquids.,
Eat to fight congestion.,
Take vitamin C. Vitamin C is an antioxidant that counteracts histamine.,
Get enough of your dietary polyphenols.",How to Relieve Head Congestion2," It is important to stay hydrated when you have a cold. Try to drink more liquids than you regularly drink during the day. You can be creative with your drinks to avoid dehydration and fight congestion.Drink water, juice, or a clear broth. You can add lemon or honey to help soothe your throat and loosen congestion. Sipping on warm liquids, such as chicken soup or warm apple juice, could increase mucus flow and relieve blockage.
A saltwater gargle can help relieve a sore or scratchy throat associated with congestion. Add about a quarter to one-half teaspoon of salt into an eight-ounce glass. Make sure the salt is dissolved before gargling.
Try some aromatic or herbal tea to relax your body, soothe your throat, and provide temporary relief to head congestion.

, Some foods have sinus-healing properties. These foods are more likely to help ease your suffering from head congestion than they are going to cure it, but relief from congestion in any form will enable you to function better throughout the day.Pineapples consist of bromelain, a mixture of enzymes that digest protein, which have been used for centuries in South America to reduce inflammation from sinus surgery.Garlic releases the enzyme allicin, which destroys bacteria and viruses, when you crush or chop it. Wait ten minutes after you crush or chop garlic before cooking it.
Omega-3 fatty acids found in fish, nuts, eggs, and flaxseed have anti-inflammatory properties that can help alleviate allergy-related conditions.

, Histamine causes inflammation, runny noses, sneezing, and other symptoms related to head congestion.Citrus fruits are high in vitamin C. Eat lots of oranges, grapefruits, and strawberries to utilize the full effect of antioxidants.
Vegetables such as tomatoes, red and green bell peppers, kale, spinach, broccoli, and brussels sprouts also have lots of vitamin C. Make sure to choose red and green vegetables.

, Dietary polyphenols can effectively block the secretion of mucus while maintaining normal nasal ciliary motion. Polyphenols are the most abundant antioxidant in the human diet.Polyphenols are the main active ingredients in ginger (gingerol); red wine, tea, onions, dark leafy vegetables, and fruits (quercetin); green tea extract (EGCG); and curry extract (curcumin).

Increase humidity.,
Stick a nasal adhesive strip to your nose.,
Relax with acupressure.,
Manage your stress.",How to Relieve Head Congestion3," Moist air will loosen mucus and help you breathe better by easing the symptoms caused by congestion. Buy a good humidifier that will keep your house between thirty and fifty percent humid.Maintain your humidifier regularly or it could become a health hazard. Monitor and clean your humidifier so that it does not become a haven for mold and the humidity level does not go too high or low. In both cases, you will cause more problems than you solve.
In addition, consider getting a hot bath, inhaling steam, or putting a hot cup of water under your nose to help loosen mucus.

, At night, place a nasal adhesive strip on your nose to help you breathe better. These little strips are specially engineered to help manage nighttime congestion for a better night’s rest.A spring-like band that is flexible, nasal strips are made to fit right above the flare of your nostrils and stay there because of the adhesive.
Nasal adhesive strips are designed to help open inflamed sinus passages. They are effective against colds, allergies, and congestion.

, Acupressure is a type of self-massage that stimulates the muscles to relax. Done daily, acupressure can show improvement along with minimizing a recurrence of allergy and sinusitis symptoms.Specifically, apply deep firm pressure to self-massage the point between your thumb and index finger. This will relieve stress on your large intestine.
For the gallbladder, massage the back of your head at the cross between where the ear bone and neck meet.
These two points have been identified as places that can be stimulated to help open up your sinuses and reduce your symptoms.

, Engaging in activities to reduce your stress will help with the management of your allergies and sinusitis, which cause congestion. Stress negatively impacts your immune system, compromising your ability to deal with conditions that cause congestion..High levels of stress cause the quality and quantity of sleep to decrease resulting in dysregulation that intensifies the symptoms associated with allergies and sinusitis.
Try socializing with family, friends, and colleagues, listening to peaceful music, or finding some alone or quiet time to rest your mind and body.

Visit your doctor.,
Take ibuprofen or acetaminophen (Tylenol).Both types of over-the-counter medicine help to reduce fever and reduce body aches.,
Do not give children aspirin.,
Ask your doctor about antiviral medication for the flu.,
Take antibiotics to treat bacterial infection.If your doctor suspects that a bacterial infection is causing your symptoms, she will prescribe antibiotics.",How to Reduce Fever and Body Ache1," If you have signs of fever and body aches together, the first thing you should do is contact your doctor. She will be able to diagnose the cause and recommend a course of treatment. When muscle aches are accompanied by fever, the treatment is often something that requires professional intervention.Tick or insect bites can cause a variety of conditions, including Lyme disease, that must be treated by a doctor.
A recent medication change may trigger flu-like symptoms. Never adjust your own medications without consulting your doctor.
Metabolic disease often presents as lower extremity pain that increases with exercise. It must be treated by a doctor.;
, Ibuprofen prevents temperature increase and reduces the levels of ""prostaglandin"" hormones that cause the feeling of pain and cause inflammation. Acetaminophen reduces pain in the central nervous system and relieves fever, but does not reduce inflammation.Alternating between them may be more effective at reducing fever and body aches than choosing one or the other.Do not double the dose. Follow the directions on the packages.
Alternating medicines can help prevent negative side effects from taking too much of one drug.
Chronic use of NSAIDs can lead to Gastrointestinal Bleeding including gastritis and ulcer disease. This is because NSAIDs destroy the protective lining in the stomach.

, Though safe for adults, aspirin use in children may lead to Reye's syndrome — a serious disease of the brain and liver that is more common after a bout of the flu or the chicken pox.This condition can be potentially fatal. If you suspect your child has it, you should seek emergency medical attention. Symptoms occur shortly after the child takes the aspirin, and include:Lethargy
Mental confusion
Seizures
Nausea and vomiting

, Viral infections are usually spread through close contact and careless hygiene. Though viral infections like the flu will run their course on their own, you may choose to ask your doctor for antiviral medication to shorten their duration.Symptoms include muscle soreness and generalized fatigue along with a temperature of 100°F or higher. Some patients can also have upper respiratory symptoms such as headache, runny nose, chills, sinus pain and sore throat.


Getting an annual flu vaccine significantly reduces your chance of getting the flu.
Your doctor may decide to prescribe oseltamivir if you have not had symptoms for greater than 48 hours. A common dosage for this medication is 75 mg twice daily within 48 hours of the onset of your symptoms.

, Antibiotics are not effective against viral infections. However, they can kill bacteria in the body and/or stop them from continuing to reproduce. This allows the body's natural defenses to fight off the remaining infection.


The kind of antibiotic you take depends on the specific bacterial infection you have.
The doctor will order a lab analysis of a blood sample to determine which bacteria is causing your symptoms.

"
"
Rest and take it easy.Studies have shown that sleep deprivation can suppress immune function, and that rest can boost it.Your body will have to fight off the infection that is causing your fever and body aches.,
Use lukewarm water to decrease the fever.Try taking a bath in lukewarm water or putting cool towels on your body to cool your body down.,
Hydrate your body well.,
Eat foods high in antioxidants.,
Wear wet socks.,
Stop smoking.",How to Reduce Fever and Body Ache2," Even if you're taking medication to relieve symptoms, your body needs to rest and remain strong to fight the infection.

, Note that you should not do this if you are experiencing chills. Cooling your body will promote shivering, and this actually increases your body temperature.


Do not take a bath in cool or cold water. This could drop your body temperature too fast. Take a bath in lukewarm water.

, When you have a high body temperature from fever, your body loses water more quickly.Dehydration can get even worse if fever is combined with vomiting or diarrhea. The body relies heavily on water to complete its basic functions, so staying hydrated will promote faster healing. Drink cool fluids to both hydrate and cool down your body.


Sports drinks like Gatorade and Power Aid are good drinks to consume if you are having GI distress. These drinks can help to replenish electrolyte losses.Clear Liquids such as broths or soups are also good to drink when you are having vomiting and diarrhea. Remember that you are losing fluid with these conditions, so you should try to replenish and hydrate yourself as much as possible.
Drinking green tea will help boost your immune system. It may make diarrhea worse, so if you have diarrhea with fever and body ache, don't use green tea., Foods that contain antioxidants can help boost your immune system and make it easier for your body to fight the infection that is causing your symptoms. Foods to eat include:Blueberries, cherries, tomatoes, and other deep-colored fruits (yes, tomatoes are fruits!)
Vegetables such as squash and bell peppers
Avoid junk and highly processed foods, such as doughnuts, white bread, fries, and sweets.

, This technique will help reduce your body temperature. Wet a pair of thin cotton socks with lukewarm water and wring them out. Put them on your feet and cover them with a pair of thick socks. (This will help your feet stay warm.) Wear these when you go to bed.Your body will send blood and lymphatic fluid circulating in your body as you sleep and will stimulate your immune system.
You can do this for 5-6 nights at a time. Then, take a break of 2 nights before continuing.

, Smoking makes the symptoms of viral infections such as cold and flu worse.It also hampers your immune system, which makes it harder for your body to recover.

Rest overused muscles.The most common cause of muscle aches without fever is simple overexertion.,
Treat local muscle injury or trauma with the RICE method.Broken bones and torn ligaments need emergency care, but muscle strain or pain can be treated on your own.,
Take measures to prevent strain from office work.Though it seems strange, the sedentary lifestyle of office work can cause painful muscle aches.,
Discuss your medications with your healthcare provider.,
Increase your electrolyte intake to treat electrolyte imbalance.,
Follow professional medical instruction to treat a variety of muscle disorders.,
Seek emergency medical attention if necessary.",How to Reduce Fever and Body Ache3," You may have spent too long at the gym or pushed yourself too hard during your run. As a result, your muscles may feel sore due to lactic acid buildup in the muscles.The soreness will resolve on its own if you rest the affected muscles and allow them to heal. Just lay off the exercise until you feel better.


To prevent this type of muscle ache, exercise regularly so your body isn't shocked by exertion. Gradually work your way up to serious activity instead of rushing into it. Always stretch properly before and after workouts.
Increase your electrolyte consumption during the recovery period. Muscle soreness can be caused by a deficiency of electrolytes like potassium or calcium.
Drink sports drinks like Gatorade or Powerade to replenish the electrolytes you lost through exercise.

, This type of muscle ache is often the result of trauma from a sports or exercise injury. Symptoms usually include pain and/or swelling of the injured area. You may have trouble moving the limb freely until the injury heals. These injuries are treated with the RICE method: Rest, Ice, Compress, and Elevate.


Rest the affected muscle as much as possible.
Apply ice to the area to reduce swelling. The ice also numbs the nerve endings in the area, temporarily relieving pain. Apply ice packs for 15-20 minutes at a time.
Compression both reduces swelling and helps stabilize the limb. This can be especially helpful if you injured your leg and are having trouble walking. Simply wrap the injured area snugly in an elastic bandage or trainer's tape.
Elevating the affected area over your heart makes it harder to pump blood to it. This reduces swelling by relying on the force of gravity.

, Sitting in one place for long periods of time can cause lower back pain, poor circulation to extremities, and increased abdominal girth. Starting a computer screen for hours a day can also result in headaches and eyestrain.


To treat this type of muscle ache, take over the counter pain medications like Tylenol or aspirin.
Break up your workday by stepping away from the desk from time to time and relieving the strain on your back and neck.
Rest your eyes by taking a break every twenty minutes. Look at an object twenty feet away for twenty seconds.
Regular exercise and increased water intake can also help.

, The medication you're taking to treat a completely unrelated condition may cause body aches. This pain may begin after you start taking the drug or after dosage has been increased. Furthermore, some recreational drugs can cause a condition called Rhabdomyolysis. This is a serious condition that has been associated with statin use as well as crush injuries of the muscles. This condition requires immediate attention in the ER by a trained physician. See your doctor immediately if your muscle pain is combined with dark urine and you take one of the following medications or drugs:Antipsychotics
Statins
Amphetamines
Cocaine
Antidepressants such as SSRI
Anticholinergic

,""Electrolyte"" is the name given to certain minerals in your body that carry an electric charge.Examples include potassium, calcium, and magnesium. These minerals affect hydration and muscle function, among other important body functions. A deficiency can result in tension and soreness in the muscles.


You lose a lot of electrolytes when you sweat, but there are many products on the market that can replenish your balance, including dietary supplements.
Sports drinks like Gatorade and Powerade are examples. Water, unfortunately, is not a natural source of electrolytes.
If the pain does not diminish with home care, speak to your doctor about further possible treatment.

, There are many types of muscle disorders that present as a chronic, general pain. If you have this type of pain and cannot pinpoint a cause, talk to your healthcare provider. Provide him with a detailed medical history, family history, list of medications, and symptoms. He will determine what tests to run to pinpoint the root of your generalized pain. Examples of muscle disorders might include:


Dermatomyositis or polymyositis:these inflammatory muscle diseases affect women more than men. Symptoms include muscle loss or weakness with aches and difficulty swallowing. Treatment includes steroids and immunomodulators. Doctors will do blood work to determine if you have one of these conditions. There are specific autoantibodies involved in some of these disease. For example, with polymyositis doctors will look for antinuclear antibodies, Anti-Ro, and Anti-La Antibodies as a marker for diagnosis.
Fibromyalgia:this condition may result from genetics, trauma, or anxiety or depression. It presents as a dull, constant pain felt throughout the body, often localized in the upper back and shoulder area. Other symptoms include headache, jaw pain, fatigue, and memory impairment or slow cognition. For the diagnosis of fibromyalgia you have to have 11 point tenderness, which is tenderness over certain characteristic soft tissue locations. Treatment includes stress management techniques, such as yoga and meditation, and may include pain medication. Sometime patients are also referred to a psychiatrist for treatment of depression and then subsequently started on an SSRI., You may be tempted to wait for muscle pain to resolve while resting at home. However, some symptoms need immediate medical attention. Seek emergency attention if you experience the following:Severe pain or pain that increases or does not resolve with medications
Extreme muscle weakness or numbness
High fever or chills
Trouble breathing or dizziness
Chest pain or vision changes
Muscle pain with dark urine
Decreased circulation or cold, pale or bluish extremity
Any other symptoms you are unsure of
Blood in the urine

The average healthy body temperature is 98.6ºF (37ºC) when measured orally (by mouth), but it's normal for this to vary by 1ºF (0.6ºC) in either direction. The temperature reading that is considered a fever depends on your age and which type of thermometer you use:Mouth: 100.4ºF (38ºC) or higher for adults, 99.5ºF (37.5ºC) for children
Ear or Rectum (bottom): 101ºF (38.3ºC) or higher for adults, 100.4ºF (38ºC) for children
Armpit: 99.4ºF (37.4ºC) or higher.This is a less accurate method of measurement.;
, With a cold, the symptoms you experience are less severe. While you may experience things like a runny nose, sore throat, and other ailments, you will not feel completely run down. With the flu, symptoms will be more severe and you will likely struggle with simple tasks.During the first couple days of the flu, symptoms can include aches, chills, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, and a flushed face.If the flu causes a high fever (103ºF / 39.4ºC or higher), you may experience hallucinations, confusion, dehydration, irritability, or convulsions., The main symptoms of a cold are often congestion-related, such as coughing, sneezing, and a runny nose.When you have the flu, these symptoms typically appear only after the fever has run its course, after two to four days. Nasal mucus from the flu also tends to be clear and watery, not thick.Remember to consider the severity as well. If symptoms of congestion are debilitating, they may be caused by a fever. They will also not be your only symptoms. You will notice other things, such as exhaustion and general aches and pains, if you have a fever.

, General discomfort centered in your chest is common when you have the flu (and accompanying fever). It is less common when you have a cold, and tends to be more mild and related to coughing and sneezing., If you have a cold, you're generally still able to engage in daily tasks. While you may feel tired, you will be able to get out of bed, shower, run errands, and so on. With the flu, however, you will feel completely exhausted. You will feel a need to lie down during the day., Colds tend to come on gradually. You will start sniffling for a few days and then symptoms will become more severe. The flu, however, can rapidly cause a fever. You may go to bed feeling fine and wake up very sick., Have you noticed any changes in appetite? With a cold, you will still want food. Your eating habits will only change slightly, if at all. With the flu, however, you may notice you're uninterested in food altogether. You may have no desire to eat while symptoms persist., Both the cold and the flu are contagious diseases. Think about any sick people you've been exposed to and whether they had a cold or the flu.Cold symptoms are most contagious during the earliest stages of infection, when the disease is less severe. If you were recently around someone who was experiencing mild sniffling or sneezing, you may have a cold.
Flu symptoms typically appear two or three days after you were exposed to the virus, but it can take anywhere from one to seven days., Colds may be common, but that doesn't mean you should ignore them. If possible, rest at home for a couple days or until you feel better. If you cannot miss school or work, go to bed early so you can sleep as much as you need — potentially up to 12 hours., If you think you have a cold, go for an over-the-counter pain reliever such as acetaminophen. You can also treat specific symptoms with remedies such as nasal sprays, decongestants, or cough syrups. Always check to make sure medications do not interfere with your existing medications and follow package instructions closely.Do not take decongestants for more than five days in a row.Consult a doctor before giving medicine to young children.
Do not take aspirin if you are 18 years old or younger, due to the risk of Reye's syndrome., Drinking plenty of fluids will help you recover faster. If you have sinus pain or a dry nose, it may also help to run a humidifier or inhale steam., Most colds go away after three or four restful days.If you feel worse after that time, or if you develop any new symptoms, see a doctor. Some more serious problems are easily mistaken for a cold, so don't hesitate to get a checkup.


Seek medical attention right away if you feel short of breath, cough up blood or colored mucus (including yellow), or if deep breaths cause chest pain.Call a doctor if your sore throat lasts more than a week, or if it is accompanied by other throat symptoms such as pain while swallowing, swollen glands, white patches, or rash.Take your temperature regularly. If you have a fever, you may have the flu after all. If your symptoms don't match the flu or a cold, see a doctor immediately.

, If you have certain health conditions, any symptoms of a cold should be evaluated. Even if you don't think you have a fever, see a doctor if you have any of the following conditions:Asthma
Diabetes
Kidney or liver disease
Lowered immunity
A history of strokes or transient ischaemic attacks

, Most people with mild flu symptoms start to feel better after three or four days of bed rest, and recover completely within a week or two. Take it easy and cancel your plans — your health and the health of those around you are more important.

, Drinking plenty of liquids is a basic but important treatment. Cut out smoking and alcohol while you still have symptoms., If you are an adult and have a fever no higher than 103ºF (39.4ºC) when measured by mouth, you can treat it at home.Take an over-the-counter fever reducer such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen to lower this. You do not need to eliminate the fever entirely; even a small drop in temperature can make you feel better.Anyone aged 18 or younger should avoid aspirin, which can cause a rare but potentially fatal illness called Reye's syndrome. The chance is higher during a viral infection like the flu., If you have congestion or a sore throat, you can take over the counter cold medication to make yourself feel better.These just treat the symptoms, not the underlying cause, so it will work even when you have the flu.


Always check the active ingredients before you take multiple medications. Do not take two drugs that list the same active ingredient, such as acetaminophen, as a double dose may be dangerous. Many over the counter cold treatments combine multiple drugs and do not necessarily list them on the front of the container., A high fever may require prescription anti-viral medications to prevent more serious problems such as pneumonia.The ""danger point"" depends on your age:Infants under 3 months: call a doctor immediately for a temperature of 100.4ºF (38ºC) or higher.
Children 3 months to 5 years: call a doctor immediately for a temperature of 102ºF (38.9ºC).
Adults and children age 5 or older: if an oral temperature of 104ºF (40ºC) lasts for more than 4 hours, call a doctor.
Adults 65 and older: this group is at higher risk of serious complications from the flu, and in some cases may not have a high temperature despite a bad infection.When in doubt, call a doctor.

, Seek medical attention right away if you experience any of the following:Any fever lasting more than three days.
Inability to drink fluids without vomiting.

Meningitis symptoms such as sensitivity to bright light, a stiff neck, or a severe headache.
Any unusual symptoms, especially major mood changes, seizures, skin rash, or severe throat swelling.
Any symptoms that don't start to improve within 3 to 5 days.

, The flu is more likely to cause pneumonia, bronchitis, and other complications in certain groups of people. Taking prescription anti-viral medication within 48 hours of symptoms appearing lowers this risk, and speeds up recovery.The following people should always see a doctor as soon as they develop flu symptoms:Anyone with a chronic or long-term medical problem, including asthma, other lung diseases, diabetes, kidney or liver disease, or a blood disorder.
Anyone with a history of strokes or transient ischaemic attacks.
Anyone with a weakened immune system, for instance due to AIDS or chemotherapy.
Women more than 3 months pregnant.
Anyone living in a long-term care facility.
Children under 2 and adults over 65.

Get the influenza vaccine.,
Take steps to protect yourself by practicing safe habits.,
Help your body ward off the flu.",How to Protect Yourself from Seasonal Flu," Each year, the CDC, World Health Organization and other public-health groups study the newest strains of influenza and quickly develop effective vaccines to protect people. CDC officials consider the flu shot to be the most effective barrier against becoming infected. The vaccine contains inactive viruses from the 3 strains researchers believe will be most prevalent during the flu season. The CDC encourages everyone to get immunized, particularly people in high-risk groups. If you fall into one of these categories, strongly consider getting the latest influenza vaccine.


Senior citizens aged 65 and older.
People with compromised immune systems, like diabetes, asthma, HIV/AIDS and cardiopulmonary disease.
Young children.
Pregnant women.
Health-care workers.;
, By taking certain measures, you can greatly reduce your exposure to influenza. Some of the steps doctors suggest include:


Wash your hands frequently. Use soap and warm water and wash for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
Avoid coming in close contact with people who are sick or using items they have used. The flu virus can live on hard surfaces for up to 2 hours. If you have to touch an item a sick person touched, wash your hands afterward.
Don't touch your eyes, mouth or nose during flu season. Germs enter your body at these sites.
Open doors with your forearms instead of your hands. Press elevator buttons with your knuckles instead of your fingertips.

, By getting enough rest, eating a balanced diet and drinking enough water, you'll help build your body's natural defenses to influenza and other viruses.


Sleep: A 2009 study showed that people who got less than 7 hours of sleep each night were 3 times more likely to catch a cold or the flu than people who got more than 8 hours per night. Ample sleep enables the body to fully recharge the immune system.
Drink: Proper hydration helps flush unwanted particles from your system and also keeps nasal passages moist, making them more resistant to viruses. Experts recommend 4 to 8 glasses of water per day.
Eat: A balanced diet provides a balanced attack against invading germs. Vitamin C is a natural immune-system booster found in oranges, broccoli and other fruits and vegetables. Vitamin D also has protective properties, but scientists aren't able to isolate precisely what they are. Several studies have shown that people with Vitamin D deficiency tend to suffer more infections.
Exercise: Experts suggest that moderate exercise, 3 or 4 times a week, helps increase the body's ability to fight infection.

Add raw garlic to your diet.",How to Prevent the Flu," Washing your hands is the easiest preventative measure you can do to avoid the flu. Scrub germs off your hands with warm water and soap as often as possible. Warm water and soap work perfectly fine if you wash your hands frequently throughout the dayHand sanitizers are not as effective as simple soap and water, but you should use them if soap and water is not available.Wash your hands before and after you eat, before and after preparing food, after touching garbage, after shaking hands with or otherwise touching another person, and after you come home from being out in a public location. You should also wash your hands after sneezing (even if you sneeze into your arm or elbow), touching an animal, changing diapers, or helping children use a toilet.;
, The fastest way to get the flu virus and other germs into your body is by transferring them from your hands to your eyes, nose, or mouth. As such, you should avoid touching these areas as much as possible (unless you have just washed your hands)during flu season.Nail biting can be especially conducive to contracting the flu. Viruses and other germs can hide out beneath your nails even after you wash your hands., You might not be able to completely cut off contact with people who have the flu, but limiting your contact with them as much as possible can greatly improve your odds of staying healthy.


Even if someone is sick with another illness and not the flu, it's still a good idea to stay away. If you catch another bug, your immune system will weaken, making it more difficult for your body to fight the flu if you become exposed to it.

, The flu virus can hang around on surfaces, so it can be helpful to disinfect surfaces in your home or office that may host germs. This is particularly true if someone in your home or office has had the flu recently. If you work in a place with a large number of people, sanitizing shared surfaces (such as doorknobs and handrails) can help cut down on contact with germs. This might seem easy at home but harder out in public. Carry around disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizer to use when you're on the go.

, Pregnant women, young children, those with chronic medical conditions that affect their respiratory systems, and the elderly are particularly encouraged to get a flu shot.Flu viruses are continuing to morph and change, but the seasonal flu vaccine is formulated to prevent whichever strains are likely to be most active during a given season.


The ideal time to get your flu vaccine is as soon as it becomes available in early to mid fall. However, getting the shot later in the season can also be helpful.
If you do not care for shots or have a fear of needles, you may be able to get the flu vaccine in the form of a nasal spray.

, You should sleep for about seven to nine hours each night for optimal health.The more well-rested you are, the more effective your immune system becomes.Sleep deprivationcan cause your body to produce more cytokines.These proteins are responsible for producing symptoms during the flu or during a cold., Both physical and mental stress can take a toll on your body and weaken your immune system. Research has found that lower stress levels can actually keep you healthier longer. Consider taking a few minutes every day to clear your head, meditate, or do yoga. Meditation can help calm anxiety and fear.Address job-related stress with your boss; remember that your health is very important, and you should ask for help if you need it.

, If you have a smoking habit, now would be a good time to quit it. Smoking decreases your respiratory abilities, dehydrates your body, and makes your immune system weaker.Smoking also destroys the cilia inside your noses. These hair-like fibers are your body's first defense against invading germs, and having fewer of them makes it easier for the flu virus to penetrate your body’s defenses.

, Exercise could truly be the fountain of youth (and health). Regular exercise has been shown to help fight infection, which may include the flu virus. Exercising creates more white blood cells, which are cells that prevent and fight illnesses.Not only does physical activity help you to sweat out toxins, it also improves your circulation, allowing nutrients to be absorbed into your body more easily..


Walking or running in particular are highly effective forms of exercise that everyone can do anywhere. All you need are a good pair of shoes.
Walk, jog, run, or do another cardiovascular exercise at least 30 minutes, 3 times per week. Ideally, you should try to get exercise every day., This is a great way to get your exercise in and quiet your mind. Yoga is known to soothe the nervous system, thereby greatly reducing stress, while also lubricating the joints and building core strength. When stress is low, your immune system is stronger and can fight disease better.

, Swimming can be done year-around in most places due to indoor pools. Swimming regularly is great for your joints, as the water mitigates impact. Much like other forms of exercise, it builds your immune system so that you can potentially avoid the flu.


If you want an extra boost to your immune system from swimming, consider cold water swimming. The cold water causes your body to interpret the temperature shift as an attack of sorts, resulting in an increased number of white blood cells and other internal changes related to a more efficient immune system.Remember to moisturize your skin and scalp after swimming to reduce the drying effects of chlorine.
Keep up your swimming routine in the summer, even if it’s not flu season specifically. Maintaining your exercise routine has benefits in all seasons!

, To stay adequately hydrated, men should drink 13 8oz cups of water and women should drink 9 8oz cups of water every day.Water oxygenates your blood and works to flush out toxins. When toxins build up, your immune system gets weaker. Flushing your system daily with plenty of water gets rid of harmful toxins in your body. .


Flushing your body out with water will not get rid of the flu, but it will keep your body hydrated, especially when you are dealing with diarrhea, vomiting, and a fever when your body needs fluids the most.
Getting enough water is easy! Just fill a large water bottle in the morning, and sip it throughout the day, refilling it when necessary.

, Alcoholic beverages are bad for almost every part of your body, but they additionally weaken your immune system so that fighting off disease becomes tougher because alcohol dehydrates you. In fact, alcoholics are far more susceptible to an array of diseases besides cirrhosis of the liver.If you don’t wish to cut out alcohol completely, consider limiting your consumption to less than three drinks per week.
Alcohol, although a liquid, actually dehydrates the body, stripping it of important nutrients.
Try to replace harder varieties of alcohol, such as vodka or gin, with red wine.

, In the seventies, sugar became known as the “white death” for a reason: studies show that it leads to premature aging and that it weakens your immune system. Try to cut out soda and sweetened juices completely, but if you cannot, minimize your daily consumption. Diet sodas and artificially sweetened juices should also be avoided.
Stick to fresh squeezed juices and unsweetened tea if you get easily bored with plain water.
Try all sorts of unsweetened teas, particularly green and black tea due to their antioxidant properties, if you want a flavored drink.

, You've probably been hearing this since childhood, but the old proverb is actually true: an apple a day keeps the doctor away. Apples are not the only health-giving food: imagine all the nutrients and disease-fighting boost you can get if you add a variety of vegetables and fruits in your daily diet!Add dark green, leafy vegetables such as spinach and kale to your regular diet.
Try to choose vegetables and fruits in an array of colors. It's the best way to ensure you're getting all the vitamins and nutrients your body needs to fend off disease.

, Omega-3 fatty acids have antioxidant properties, so foods and supplements with high levels of these acids might help ward off immune-busting free radicals.


You can get omega-3 into your system by taking a daily fish oil capsule, or you could eat more fish, nuts, seeds, and beans.
For an even stronger dose of omega-3, add 10 to 15 drops of liquid marine phytoplankton to your water or juice. This is the source that most fish get omega-3 from, so taking it will give you a more direct, concentrated dosage with many health benefits.

, Garlic has antiviral, antibiotic, and antifungal properties.


Try to get one or two servings of raw garlic into your diet to maximize its potential benefits.
To avoid minimizing the negative effect garlic has on your breath, cut one or two cloves into fine pieces and swallow whole with water or tea. Chew on a sprig of fresh parsley immediately after consuming the garlic to mask the garlic’s odor.

Take extra precautions if you are pregnant.",How to Prevent Zika1," Since mosquito bites are the main source of infection, you will need to cover as much of your exposed skin as possible. Wear long sleeves, long pants, socks, and closed-toe shoes when you are in mosquito-infested areas. You may even want to consider wearing a mosquito net hat when you are out.


You can also treat your clothing with permethrin or purchase permethrin-treated clothing to add an extra layer of protection.;
, Applying insect repellent to your body is another effective measure. Make sure that the insect repellant that you choose is Environmental Protection Agency or EPA-registered.You can find this information on the label.


Always read and follow the manufacturer’s instructions for use.
Reapply the insect repellant as often as the package suggests.
Apply sunscreen before you apply insect repellent.
Apply insect repellent over your clothes, not under them., If you are caring for someone who has Zika, then make sure that you wear gloves and wash your hands well if you need to clean up the infected person’s blood or bodily fluids. A person may have the Zika virus in their blood for about one week., Zika can be transmitted through bodily fluids, such as semen and blood, so it is important to use protection.Make sure that you protect yourself by wearing a condom every time you have sex.


Use a condom even if your partner seems healthy. Remember that in most cases, Zika has no symptoms., Pregnant women may pass the virus onto an unborn child, but it is rare. There have also been some reports of birth defects in babies born to women who contracted the Zika virus while pregnant. For these reasons, pregnant women should be even more cautious and do everything possible to prevent mosquito bites.Keep in mind that the link between Zika virus and the birth defect microcephaly is not fully understood. This condition results in an abnormally small head circumference as well as some developmental delays. In some cases, microcephaly can even be fatal.

Stay away from sick or dead birds.,
Report dead birds.,
Prepare poultry safely.,
Cook eggs until the yolk is firm.",How to Prevent Bird Flu (Avian Influenza)1," Avoid all contact with any bird that appears ill or dead. This applies to domestic birds such as poultry, as well as wild birds. Observe birds in the wild from a distance, and do not attempt to help a sick of injured bird.If you come into any contact with birds of any type, wash your hands as soon as possible. Use warm water and soap or hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
Do not touch bird excrement. Avoid any surface or material that is has bird excrement on it.If you are walking and realize you have stepped in bird excrement, clean your footwear with soap and water.;
, Your government’s health department or wildlife agency likely monitors bird health in your area. Call a wildlife agency in your area to let them know if you find a sick or dead bird. These reports can be significant, as large numbers of affected will prompt the agency to investigate and ensure an outbreak of bird flu has not occurred.This is especially important if you find multiple dead birds together.
Local authorities may tell you to dispose of the bird’s body. If so, do not touch the bird’s body with bare hands. Use plastic gloves or bags to dispose of the body in your trash. Wrap the bird in a double plastic bag, and then place it into a brown bag to ensure it is wrapped well. If you are concerned about the source of the birds, then you can burn the dead animal also.

, Handle and cook poultry safely to kill influenza viruses and ensure your health. Use different utensils to handle meat before and after it has been cooked. Wash your hands with warm water and soap before and after you handle meat. Serve meat that is fully cooked and still hot.Ensure cutting boards and other items that touched raw poultry are cleaned with soap.
Use a thermometer to ensure poultry is cooked until it reached at least at least 165 °F (74 °C).
If you have any concerns about poultry in the country you are in or traveling to, then you might want to consider avoiding it altogether. Look into vegetarian options or other safe meat choices.

, Consuming runny eggs from an infected chicken can put you at risk of contracting bird flu. Be sure to cook your eggs all the way through so that the yolks and whites are firm.Bird flu may also be present on the surface of eggshells, so make sure to wash your hands thoroughly after handling eggs.

Stay in places with air-conditioning or window screens.,
Sleep with a mosquito net.Mosquito nets can protect you from bites while you sleep.,
Remove standing water.,
Steer clear of high-risk areas if possible.",How to Prevent Zika2," Even if you are inside, it is possible to be bitten by a mosquito that has entered your home. Try to prevent mosquitoes from getting into your home by using air-conditioning or window screens instead of just opening windows.


If you are travelling to a high-risk area, then try to stay in hotels that have air conditioning and/or screens on all of the windows.If possible, run an air-conditioner when the weather is warm instead of opening windows and running fans.
If you do not have an air-conditioner, then put up window screens on all of the windows in your home. Make sure that there are no holes or tears in the screens through which mosquitoes may enter.

, Inspect your mosquito net to make sure that it is free from holes or tears. Also, make sure that it touches the ground and goes all the way around your bed.


Some mosquito nets are even treated with permethrin, which offers even more protection from mosquitoes during the night.

, Mosquitoes breed and lay eggs in standing water, which can increase the mosquito population in your area and increase your chance of contracting Zika. Make sure that you remove any items that might collect water, such as buckets, old tires, or flower pots.Fill in small puddles with sand or dirt to eliminate this potential breeding ground as well.

, To prevent the Zika virus, you may want to consider postponing travel to areas where there are outbreaks. Pregnant women are strongly encouraged to avoid high-risk areas due to the risks that the virus poses to unborn babies.Countries with recent outbreaks of Zika virus include:


Bolivia, Ecuador, Guyana, Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Suriname, Venezuela, Barbados, Saint Martin, Haiti, Martinique, Puerto Rico, Guadeloupe, Samoa, and Cape Verde."

Consider taking antiviral drugs.",How to Prevent Bird Flu (Avian Influenza)2," If you’ve been exposed to birds that may have been infected with bird flu, monitor closely for any signs of illness. These may include fever and cough, serious respiratory distress and discomfort in your chest, difficulty breathing, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Quick diagnosis and medical treatment are vital, as certain types of avian flu may lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure, mental disarray, seizures, organ failure, and death., Regardless of the type of flu you’ve caught, do everything you can to help prevent the infection from spreading. For instance, cover your mouth and nose and turn away from others when you cough or sneeze. Dispose of soiled tissues immediately, and wash your hand with warm water and soap.Avoid areas or places with lots of people.
Avoid kissing, hugging, or sharing any dishware with others., If you are concerned that you may have avian flu, see your doctor right away. Notify the first medical professional or receptionist you see of your concerns. They will seat you away from others and give you a surgical mask to cover your nose and mouth. If you are diagnosed with avian flu, your doctor will automatically notify the CDC, which will provide them with the latest guidance about how to help prevent the flu from spreading.
The CDC will also notify other agencies and the World Health Organization about some cases of bird flu, such as H5N1., Talk to your doctor about taking influenza antiviral drugs to prevent infection. While these drugs are more commonly used to treat different types of flus, they can potentially keep from falling ill.There is a specific vaccine for H5NI, a particularly dangerous type of bird flu. However, it is unlikely this vaccine will be used unless there is a substantial breakout of this virus.The standard flu vaccine will not prevent an infection from bird flu.

Wash your hands often.,
Install a footbath outside their coop.,
Keep designated chicken boots.,
Never allow wild birds to get close.,
Isolate new chickens.,
Store chicken feed safely.,
Report any signs of illness.",How to Prevent Bird Flu (Avian Influenza)3," Before and after handling your chickens, wash your hands with warm water and soap. You can use hand sanitizer instead, as long as it is at least 60% alcohol. Any clothes, gloves, or tools that touched the chickens or chicken poop should also be washed with soap., Use a footbath each time you enter or exit your chicken’s coop, or other sort of enclosure. Footbaths can be simple plastic tubs filled with a disinfectant designed for use on farms. Cover the footbath when not in use.Place the footbath on a slab of cement or on a pallet. This will help minimize the amount of dirt you track into the bath.
Change the disinfectant solution in the footbath daily.
Note that the footbath is for disinfecting your shoes, not your feet!

, You should only use one pair of footwear when you’re in the chicken’s enclosure. Do not use these footwear for any other purpose. In particular, make sure that nothing you use that may come into contact with wild birds ever goes into the chickens’ living area. This includes clothing and equipment as well, though boots are the greatest risk factor., Wild birds, including waterfowl, can potentially infect your chickens with bird flu. Especially if you live near a body of water, keep a vigilant eye out for birds that may try to visit your chickens. Wild birds may be attracted by your chicken feed, for instance. Buy props to scare other birds away online or from an agricultural retailer., Keep new birds away from your flock for 30 days. This ensures that they are not sick before exposing them to your other chickens. Keep the new chickens somewhere away from your chicken enclosure.Only get new birds from reputable sources.

, You want to ensure you’re getting your chicken feed from a supplier that keeps it clean. Once you have the feed, keep it in containers that prevent other birds, animals, and insects from getting to it. Large plastic bins work best. , Call your local wildlife agency if any of your birds become sick or die unexpectedly. They can advise you on how to proceed. If you are unable to reach a local agency, reach out a regional organization."

Eat carefully.,
Practice good hygiene.,
See a doctor if you may be sick.",How to Prevent Bird Flu (Avian Influenza)4," Never eat anything that might have raw or undercooked poultry products in it. Do not eat any meat that is still pink, or that is not served hot. Eat only hard-cooked eggs that do not have runny yolks. Never eat or drink something that includes any animal’s blood. Avoid eating from street vendors., Keep yourself clean to help avoid catching avian flu. In particular, wash your hands often with soap and warm water. If soap is not available, wash you hands with hand sanitizer that is at least 60% alcohol. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and/or mouth.Do not spend time around poultry. Do not visit farms, markets, or other places where birds are raised, kept, or sold. Do not touch any birds, dead or alive.

, If you become ill at any point during your travels, do not hesitate to see a doctor. Similarly, if you become sick shortly after traveling, see your doctor and tell them about your travels. This is especially important if you had any direct contact with birds that may have been infected with avian flu. Avoid contact with other people until you’ve made sure you do not have avian flu."

Wash your hands frequently.,
Use hand sanitizer if you don’t have soap.,
Keep your hands away from your face.",How to Prevent the Common Cold1," Washing your hands in the most preventable way of contracting the cold or flu virus. Scrub your hands with soap and water before eating, and before and after using the bathroom. To wash your hands, follow these instructions: Wet your hands with warm or cold water.
Apply soap to your hands.
Rub your hands to lather them together. Scrub everywhere. Do not forget to scrub under your fingernails, between your fingers, and the backs of your hands.
Scrub for at least 20 seconds. Singing “Happy Birthday” is a quick way to remember how long.

Treat their cough.,
Treat their aches and pains.,
Treat their fever.,
Keep them hydrated.,

Keep them occupied.",How to Nurse a Significant Other's Cold at Home," If you live with your significant other or if they live alone, the answer to this question may be obvious. But if they live with family, friends or roommates, they may already be getting the help they need. The only way to be sure is to ask. Even if someone else is caring for your loved one, you might be able to help by stopping by with food or medicine.;
, This is a good way to let your significant other know that you are concerned about their wellbeing. More importantly, talking to them about how they feel can help you figure out what kinds of symptoms they are having and what kind of help they need.


People sometimes have trouble describing how they feel when they are sick. Try asking about specific symptoms (for example, “Do you have a headache?” or “Is your throat sore?”).
One of the most important things to find out is whether or not they have a fever, and if so, how high it is. Take your significant other’s temperature with an oral thermometer. If their temperature is 105° F (40.56° C) or above, call 911 or take them to an emergency room., Depending on how they are feeling, your significant other may want or need different things at different times. The best way to find out what they need is to ask. People are not always communicative when they are sick, so help them out by asking specific questions (like “Do you want to get some sleep?” “Do you need more medicine?” or “Are you hungry?”).


Be considerate – don’t check in so often that they can’t get any rest! It doesn’t hurt to ask how often they would like you to check in. If they are sleeping or trying to get to sleep, don't bother them.
If they are taking medication for their cold symptoms, check the directions on the bottle to find out how often to give them a new dose. If it’s getting close to time for the next dose, it may be a good idea to check in and see if they would like to take some more.

, Nasal congestion is one of the most common cold symptoms. It is particularly important to treat congestion, because it causes discomfort, can aggravate or contribute to other symptoms (like sore throat and cough), and can make it difficult for the cold sufferer to sleep. One or a combination of the following remedies can help ease nasal congestion:Try an over-the-counter saline spray. Saline sprays can help clean out and soothe the nasal passages.
Use a cool mist vaporizer or a humidifier to increase the humidity in the room where your significant other is resting. Extra moisture in the air is soothing and can help clear out congestion.
Over-the-counter decongestants and cold medications can offer some relief. Be sure to follow the package directions carefully.

, A sore throat is often one of the first symptoms of a cold, and it may be aggravated by nasal congestion. Try one or more of these methods to reduce sore throat pain:Dissolve a little bit of salt (1/4-1/2 teaspoon) in warm water and ask them to gargle it.
Very hot or very cold liquids and foods can also soothe a sore or scratchy throat. Offer them hot tea with honey and lemon, ice chips, or a popsicle.
Try over-the-counter cough drops or throat sprays containing menthol or numbing agents.

, Throat irritation and congestion can cause a cough. Treating the sore throat and nasal congestion may relieve cough symptoms. You can also try over-the-counter cough medicines, like NyQuil Cough, Delsym, or Robitussin.


If the cough persists after other cold symptoms have resolved, comes with shortness of breath, or brings up yellow, green or brown mucus, then your significant other may have a secondary infection like pneumonia or bronchitis. If you notice any of these symptoms, advise them to see a doctor., Colds can cause headaches and body aches. These symptoms can be treated with over-the-counter pain killers like acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen or aspirin.


Never give aspirin to anyone under the age of 18 unless you are instructed to do so by a physician. In rare cases, children and teenagers can have a dangerous and potentially fatal reaction to aspirin., A fever is one of the body’s methods of fighting infection, but high fevers can be uncomfortable or even dangerous. If your significant other has a fever below 102° F (39.89° C), the best thing they can do is rest and stay hydrated. If their fever is higher than 102° F (39.89° C), you can reduce the fever with acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen or aspirin.Before giving your significant other acetaminophen, make sure they have not recently taken another medication that contains acetaminophen, in order to avoid an accidental overdose. Acetaminophen is a common ingredient in over-the-counter cough and cold medicines.
If their fever exceeds 105° F (40.56° C), seek medical attention immediately., It’s easy for someone with a cold to become dehydrated. Give them clear liquids like water, broth, or juice.Alcohol and caffeinated beverages like coffee and soda can make dehydration worse and interfere with sleep.
Chicken soup is a traditional cold remedy that is hydrating, nourishing, soothing on the throat, and easy on the stomach. Hot broth can also help loosen up congestion and clear stuffy nasal passages. Try this simple and comforting recipe for chicken soup.

, Rest and sleep are crucial for helping the body heal. If your significant other is having trouble sleeping, treating other cold symptoms and creating a restful and comfortable environment for them can help. Some cold medications contain ingredients that cause drowsiness and can help a cold sufferer get a good night’s sleep.

, You can help your significant other a lot just by making sure whatever they need is in reach. Keep tissues, water, medications, a thermometer, blankets, reading material, or whatever else they might want in the room where they are resting.

, Make sure they can rest on a bed or couch with clean sheets, pillows and blankets. Keep noise to a minimum. If they are trying to sleep, keep the room dark. Make sure they are not too hot or too cold.

, While rest and sleep are very important to recovery, most people will spend a lot of time feeling bored and frustrated when they are sick. While your significant other is awake, find ways to help keep their spirits up.


Put on a favorite movie or TV show.
Play music they enjoy.
Bring them books or magazines to read. If they are feeling too sick to focus on reading, offer to read to them or play an audio book.
Offer your company and conversation.

Let your cold run its course.",How to Make Yourself Feel Better When You Have a Cold," Hot tea can be soothing to a sore throat, make mucus easier to cough up, and the steam can help ease inflammation. Chamomile tea is a popular herbal tea for colds but there are many varieties available that work well. Black and green tea contain phytochemicals that may help fight colds, and green tea may help rehydrate your body.


Add honey to your tea. The honey will coat your throat and help keep your cough at bay.
If your cold is keeping you up, you can add one teaspoon of honey and around 25 ml of whiskey or bourbon to your tea to help you sleep. Only drink one of these because too much alcohol can make your cold worse.;
, This will relax you, so you can unwind. The steam helps loosen mucus, calm inflammation in your sinuses, and relieve a stuffy nose. You will want to keep the bathroom door shut to encourage more steam accumulation, and inhale the steam for ten to fifteen minutes.You can also add aromatherapy or essential oils, such as eucalyptus or peppermint, to your bath so that the steam is more effective at combating your congestion.

, You don’t need to take a shower to reap the benefits of steam. Boil a pot of water, lower the heat and place your face a safe distance above the steaming water. Breathe in the steam slowly through your mouth and nose, being careful not to scald yourself on the pot or get too close to the hot steam.


You can also add a couple drops of aromatherapy or essential oils, such as eucalyptus or peppermint, to make your steam treatment even more effective.
If you can’t boil water at the moment, get a cloth wet with warm water and lay it over your face to cool.

, Nasal sprays and drops can be purchased at your local drug or grocery store and tend to very effective for relieving dryness and congestion. Plus, they are safe and don’t irritate your nasal tissues — even children can use them. Be sure to follow the directions on your label.


Try blowing your nose a few minutes after using the saline spray or drops. It will be easier to get the mucus out, and your nose may actually clear up for a while after using them.
For infants, you can put a few drops of saline nasal drops into one nostril. Use a bulb syringe to suction the mucus out by inserting it 1/4–1/2 inch into the nostril. You can make your own saline rinse by mixing a half-pint of warm water with a pinch of salt and soda bicarbonate. To be safe, you should boil your water and let it cool before inserting it into your nose. Squirt the mixture into one nostril while you keep the other nostril closed. You can repeat this 2–3 times before doing it to the other nostril., A neti pot uses nasal irrigation to flush out mucus and help clear congestion. Neti pot systems are readily available at your local drug, grocery ,or health food store. They can really help you breathe easier when you have a cold.


Mix one cup of warm water and ½ teaspoon of kosher salt. Boil the water beforehand and let it cool to kill any bacteria or pathogens that might be present. Fill up the neti pot with the water and salt solution.
You will want to stand over a sink or drain. Tip your head to the side so that it is horizontal and place the neti pot into the upper nostril. Pour the saline into the nostril until it comes out the other nostril. Repeat with the other nostril.

, These rubs are popular for use with children because the vapors are cooling and can soothe cough and relieve congestion. Rub the vaporub on the chest and back. You can also use a vaporub or mentholated cream under your nose if the skin is raw from repeated nose blowing.


It is not recommended that you put any rubs or creams directly under a child’s nose due to irritation or breathing problems that can develop related to the fumes.

, You can use hot or cold packs and place them on the areas that are congested. To make your own hot pack, use a damp cloth and heat it in the microwave for about 55 seconds. For a cold pack, use a bag of frozen vegetables with a cloth wrapped around it.

, You can take up to 2,000mg daily. Always tell your doctor before starting new supplements or vitamins.


If you take too much vitamin C, you can get diarrhea. Don’t take more than the recommended dose., You can drink Echinacea tea or take capsules, both of which can usually be found at your local grocery store. Like vitamin C, this herb may shorten your cold symptoms. Unless you have immune system issues or are on medications, go ahead and give it a try. Otherwise, speak to your doctor first.

, Zinc can be especially effective if it is taken as soon as you begin to feel the first symptoms of a cold. It could prove to be beneficial in helping you fight your cold. If you get nausea from taking zinc, then take it when you eat food. Don’t use nasal zinc gels or other intranasal zincs. It can cause damage that might make you lose your ability to smell.
Zinc in large doses can cause nausea and vomiting.

, Throat lozenges, or cough drops, come in many flavors — from honey to cherry to menthol. Some of them contain numbing medicines like menthol that will help you to feel better if you have a sore throat. The lozenge is dissolved slowly in your mouth over time, providing sore throat and cough relief.

, Cool-mist humidifiers or vaporizers add moisture to the air and, like steam, help break up mucus so it is not as thick. They can ease congestion and coughing so that you sleep better. Always follow the directions for your humidifier, and clean it properly so that it does not grow bacteria or molds.

, Gargling with warm salt water can reduce inflammation and relieve your sore or scratchy throat. It can help loosen mucus and make you feel better. If you make your own gargle, ensure that it cools first before you use it.


A salt-water gargle can be made by dissolving a teaspoon of salt in eight ounces of warm water.
If you have an annoying tickle in your throat, you might try gargling with tea.
You can also try a thicker gargle made with 50 ml of honey, steeped sage leaves and cayenne pepper in 100 ml of water, boiled for 10 minutes.

, Warm broth can really help your cold symptoms. The steam can clear up your sinus congestion and relieve your sore throat. Plus, the soup keeps you hydrated. Interestingly enough, chicken soup can actually reduce inflammation in some people and may help you fight off your cold., If you have a cold, you don’t need antibiotics. Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections and not viral infections, such as a cold. Additionally, antibiotics can have side effects, and using them when you don’t need to can contribute to antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

, Acetaminophen, naproxen, and ibuprofen can help with sore throat, headache, body aches and fever. These medications are readily available nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) found in drug and grocery stores. Be sure to follow the directions on the label when taking pain relievers.


Some NSAIDs have side effects and can cause stomach issues or liver damage. Never take NSAIDs long-term or take larger doses than those that are recommended. If you have to take an NSAID for more than four times a day or for more than two to three days, then you should contact your doctor. NSAIDs are not approved for infants under three months. Always check the dosages of the pain relievers that you are using for older babies and children. Some formulations are very concentrated.Aspirin should not be given to children under 12 due to the risk of Reye's syndrome.

, Coughing helps get mucus out of your lungs and throat. However, if your cough is very painful or you can’t sleep, then you might consider using a cough suppressant temporarily. Always read the labels and follow the directions before using a cough suppressant for your cold.


Children under six should not use cough suppressants.

, Congestion is no fun, and it may even cause your ears to ache as well. Decongestants and decongestant sprays can help relieve the pressure and swelling in your sinuses. They are usually available at your drug or grocery store over-the-counter.


Decongestants should be used sparingly and for no more than three days. Otherwise, your symptoms can become worse.

, There are probably sprays available at your local drug or grocery store that will numb your throat if it is sore. These work temporarily and will ease the symptoms you have. They can have a strong taste, though, and some people do not like the feeling of numbness these sprays cause.

, To blow your nose, cover one nostril and blow out into a tissue with the other. Do this gently. When you have a cold, you need to blow your nose regularly to get excess mucus out of your body.


Don’t blow too hard because this can push mucus into your ear passages or further into your sinuses., You shouldn’t go to work or school when you have a cold to avoid spreading it anyway. You might as well take the opportunity to curl up in your bed and focus on getting better. Put on your pajamas and relax. Your body needs rest to recover and you need to de-stress so your body has the energy it needs to heal.

, If you get less than five or six hours of sleep, you may be four times more likely to get a cold in the first place.Your body really needs the time to rest and rejuvenate that sleep provides, especially when you are fighting off a cold. So, get some cozy pillows and blankets, close your eyes, and drift off to dreamland.


Sleep in layers if your temperature fluctuates so that you can remove or add blankets depending on how you feel.
You can add an extra pillow to elevate your head, which might help with coughing and post-nasal drip.
Keep a box of tissues along with a trash bin or bag near your bed. This way you can blow your nose and throw out tissues whenever you need to.

, Computers and video games can be very stimulating with their lights, sounds, and so much information that you need to process. These devices can keep you awake and make it difficult to fall asleep. Using electronics and even reading too long may contribute to eye strain or headaches — the last thing you need when you already feel bad.

, Your body produces a lot of mucus when you have a cold. Mucus requires a lot of fluids. When you drink more fluid, it thins out your mucus so you can get rid of it easier.


Limit caffeine intake when you have a cold because it can really dry you out.

, The acids in citrus juices like orange juice can make your cough worse. It may be irritating to your already sensitive throat. Find another way to hydrate and get vitamin C., You want your room to be warm but not hot. When you are cold or hot, your body diverts energy to try to warm you up or cool you down. So when you have a cold, you don’t want to get chilled or overheated. Your body needs to focus on fighting the viral infection and not on maintaining your body temperature.

, Your nose skin can get irritated when you have a cold. This happens because you are blowing your nose so often. Some petroleum jelly dabbed under your nose or using tissues that contain a moisturizer of some sort can help., When you have a cold, it is best not to fly in an airplane. The change in pressure can damage your eardrums when you are congested. Use a decongestant and saline nose spray if you don’t have any choice but to fly. Chewing gum can sometimes help while in the plane.

, Stress can make you more likely to get a cold and make the cold harder to get rid of. Stress hormones compromise your immune system so it can’t fight off illnesses as well. Stay away from nerve-racking situations, practice meditation, and take deep breaths.

, Though a little alcohol can help you get to sleep, too much will dehydrate you. It can also aggravate your symptoms and congestion. Alcohol is not good for your immune system and can have bad reactions with your over-the-counter medications., Smoke is not good for your respiratory system. It makes your congestion and coughing worse and can make it last longer too. Smoking also causes damage to your lungs so it’s harder to get rid of colds.

, Even though you’re sick, you still need the energy and nutrients to help your body get well. Eat a low-fat, high fiber diet with fruits and vegetables, whole grains and protein. Try foods high in vitamin C and foods that can open up sinuses and break up mucus, like chilli peppers, mustard, and horseradish., You already know that exercising keeps your body healthy, but it can also make your cold pass more quickly. If you just have a cold, exercise is probably fine. However, if you have a higher fever, feel very achy or weak then you should rest instead.Scale back or eliminate the exercise program if it makes your cold feel worse.

, Stay home and get over your cold and try not to be around people. Be sure to cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze, and try to use the inside of your elbow instead of your hands. Also, wash your hands a lot or use hand sanitizers.

, Your symptoms are all part of your body’s way of getting rid of the virus. Fevers, for example, help to destroy viruses and allow the virus-fighting proteins in your blood to circulate more effectively. For this reason, not using medications or other means to lower a moderate fever over a few days can mean that you get better faster."
"
Be patient and monitor the temperature.,
Remove excess clothing or blankets.,
Take a cool bath or shower.,
Keep well hydrated.,
Sit or lay near a fan.,
Know when to see your doctor.,
Consider taking acetaminophen (Tylenol).,
Try ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) instead.,
Be cautious with aspirin.",How to Make a Fever Break," The vast majority of fevers in children and adults are self-limiting, and usually disappear within two to three days.Therefore, you should be patient with mild-to-moderate fevers for a few days (because they are beneficial) and monitor the temperature every couple of hours or so to make sure the fever doesn't get dangerously high. For infants and toddlers, it's best to take rectal readings. Fevers that last for a week or more are reason for concern, as are high temperatures (over 103°F or 39.4°C in adults and over 101°F or 38.3°C in kids).


Keep in mind that body temperature is usually highest in the evening and after physical activity. Menstruation, feeling strong emotions and being in a hot and humid environment also raise the core body temperature temporarily.
In addition to sweating, other symptoms associated with mild-to-moderate fevers include: muscle aches, general weakness, fatigue, shivering, headache, loss of appetite and flushed face.
Additional symptoms associated with high fevers include: hallucinations, confusion, irritability, convulsions, and potential loss of consciousness (coma).While waiting out a mild-to-moderate fever, make sure to keep well hydrated. Fevers trigger sweating, which can quickly lead to dehydration without making the effort to drink lots of fluids.;
, A simple and common-sense method of reducing a fever is to remove excess clothing during waking hours and excess blankets while in bed.Clothes and blankets insulate our bodies and prevent heat from escaping from our skin. Thus, wear one layer of lightweight clothing and use one lightweight blanket to sleep with while trying to combat a high fever.


Avoid clothes and blankets made from synthetic fabrics or wool. Stick with cotton fabrics instead because they breathe better.
Remember that your head and feet are capable of losing a lot of heat, so try not to cover your head with hats or your feet with thick socks while fighting a high fever.
Don't bundle up someone who develops the chills from a fever because they can get over-heated quickly., If you or your child develops a high fever with the associated symptoms (see above), then take action to lower the body temperature by taking a cool bath or shower.However, it's important not to use cold water, ice or alcohol solution because it often makes the situation worse by triggering shivering, which then tends to raise the core body temperature even more. Stick to tepid or cool water and bathe for about 10 to 15 minutes. Taking a bath may be easier than a shower if you are tired, weak and achy.


As an alternative, grab a clean cloth or sponge, soak it in cool water, wring it out, and apply it to the forehead as a cold compress. Change it every 20 minutes until the fever comes down.
Another good idea is using a spray bottle filled with chilled distilled water to spritzer (spray) yourself every 30 minutes or so in order to cool down. Focus on spraying your face, neck and upper chest for best results.

, Keeping well hydrated is always important, but it becomes even more so with a fever because you lose more water via perspiration. Aim to increase your water consumption by at least 25%. So if you're used to drinking eight large glasses of purified water daily (the recommended amount for optimal health), increase it to 10 glasses if you have a fever.Drink cool beverages with ice added to try and bring a fever down. Natural fruit / vegetable juice is a good idea because it contains sodium (an electrolyte), which is lost during sweating.


Avoid alcoholic and caffeinated beverages as they can flush the skin and make a person feel warmer.
For fevers without noticeable perspiration, consider consuming warmer beverages (such as herbal tea) and foods (such as chicken soup) to trigger sweating — it leads to evaporative cooling of the body.

, The more air that circulates around your body and over your sweaty skin, the more effective the evaporative cooling process is. That's why we sweat in the first place, so that our skin and surface blood vessels cool down as the ambient air evaporates the moisture. Being near a fan simply speeds this process up. Therefore, sit and sleep next to an oscillating fan to help bring down a fever, although make sure enough skin is exposed to be effective.Don't be so close to a fan or have it turned up so high that it causes chills, as shivering and the resulting goose bumps acts to increase the core body temperature.
Air conditioning may be the best idea for a hot and humid room, but a mechanical fan is usually a better choice because it’s less likely to make the room too cold after a while.

, Most fevers are beneficial and shouldn't be artificially reduced or suppressed, but sometimes it's necessary to prevent serious complications, such as a febrile seizures, coma or brain damage. To best understand how to treat a fever, make an appointment with your doctor if it doesn't go away within a week or if the temperature is considered high (see above). Your doctor has all the instruments necessary to take a temperature reading in the most appropriate area — either orally, rectally, under the armpit or in the ear canal.


It's time to take your feverish child to the doctor if they have a high fever (>101°F or 38.3°C) and are: listless, irritable, vomiting, makes poor eye contact, appears very sleepy most of the time and/or has completely lost their appetite.Keep in mind that since children are smaller and growing, they might become seriously dehydrated sooner if a fever continues more than a couple days.
Adults should see their doctor if they develop a high fever (>103°F or 39.4°C) and any of the following: severe headache, throat swelling, bad skin rash, light sensitivity, stiff neck, confusion, irritability, chest pain, abdominal pain, constant vomiting, numbness and tingling in limbs and/or seizures.If the high fever is caused by a bacterial infection, then your doctor may recommend antibiotics first in order to control or eliminate the infection.

, Acetaminophen is not only a painkiller (analgesic), but it's also a strong antipyretic, which means it can trigger the hypothalamus in the brain to lower body temperature.In other words, it works by turning down your brain's thermostat. Acetaminophen is typically best and safest for young children with high fevers (using the weight-appropriate dosage recommendations on the box) and also helpful for teenagers and adults.


For a high fever, it's recommended to take a dose of acetaminophen every 4 to 6 hours. For adults, the maximum recommended daily dose of acetaminophen is 3,000 mg.Taking too much acetaminophen or taking it for too long can be toxic and damaging to the liver. Pay attention to the ingredients in other medications as well. For example, cold medicine can include acetaminophen.
Alcohol should never be combined with acetaminophen.

, Ibuprofen is also a good antipyretic — in fact, in some studies it's more effective than acetaminophen at reducing fever in children aged between 2 to 12 years.The main issue is that it's typically not recommended for children younger than 2 years (especially infants younger than 6 months) because of potential serious side effects.Ibuprofen is also a good anti-inflammatory (unlike acetaminophen), which can be helpful if you or your child also experience muscle / joint aches with the fever.


For adults, between 400-600 mg can be taken every 6 hours for reducing high fevers. Child doses are typically half that, but it depends on their weight and other health factors, so ask your doctor.
Taking too much ibuprofen or taking it for too long can be irritating and damaging to the stomach and kidneys, so take the medication with food. In fact, stomach ulcers and kidney failure are the most serious side effects. Furthermore, alcohol should never be combined with ibuprofen.

, Aspirin is a good anti-inflammatory and strong antipyretic and is very effective for treating high fevers in adults.However, aspirin is more toxic than either acetaminophen or ibuprofen is, particularly to children. As such, aspirin should not be used for fever reduction or any other condition in children or adolescents, especially those experiencing or recovering from viral illness such as the chickenpox or flu — it's linked to Reye's syndrome, an allergic reaction involving prolonged vomiting, confusion, liver failure and brain damage.Aspirin (Anacin, Bayer, Bufferin) is particularly irritating to the lining of the stomach and a significant cause of stomach ulcers in the United States and Canada. Always take aspirin on a full stomach.
Maximum adult daily dosage of aspirin is 4,000 mg.Exceeding this amount may cause an upset stomach, ringing in the ears, dizziness and blurred vision.

Keep your distance from other people.,
Do not share cups, straws or other personal items.,
Limit your exposure at places like airports and malls.,
Remind your kids to wash their hands.",How to Prevent the Common Cold2," Try to keep at least 2 feet of distance between you and other people. Colds can be transmitted more easily if you’re closer to someone with a cold.


A cold virus can be contagious for up to 2 weeks. If a friend has a fever with cold symptoms, he is more than likely contagious. Even if your friend says he feels better, he might still share the virus with you.
If someone is on antibiotics for his cold, he can still spread the virus. Antibiotics do not treat the viral infection.

, The cold virus can be dormant for 24 to 72 hours before symptoms begin., Places where there are a lot of people are going to have more cold germs. If you are concerned about getting sick, stay away from these types of places as much as you can., While you may do everything you can to prevent getting a cold, you may still risk exposure if your kids get sick. Young kids are prone to catching colds from school or daycare. Reminding your kids about hand-washing may reduce the risk of them getting sick too."
"
Eat lots of fruits and vegetables.,
Eat yogurt to help boost your good bacteria in your gut.,
Eat foods to boost immunity.,
Drink lots of water.,
Gargle tap water.",How to Prevent the Common Cold3," While hygiene is the most important, eating a variety of healthy foods will do your body good. Feed your body nutrient-rich foods and cut down on sugar, processed and fried foods.Keep in mind that there is no proven benefit that eating any certain food will ultimately keep you healthy.A healthier diet does provide nutrition that can help your immune system fight off infections. For example, you cannot eat a bowl of strawberries, not wash your hands all day, and then expect to be healthy. Doing a combination of many strategies will be most helpful in preventing colds.

, Yogurt is part of a healthy diet. Yogurt contains good bacteria, called probiotics, which helps fight infection., Many foods have key vitamins or antioxidants which are helpful in fighting off infection. Some of these foods are:Oranges: These are always a staple when people think of Vitamin C. Eat an orange each day or drink a cup of orange juice to get a good amount of Vitamin C.
Apples: These have an antioxidant effect.
Papayas: These have a ton of Vitamin C.
Grapefruit: These have a lot of vitamin C in them, plus other great nutrients, such as cancer fighters.
Fish: This helps by fighting inflammation associated with colds. Eat deep water fatty fish such as wild salmon, mackerel, and whitefish.Garlic: This has antioxidant properties that help fight a cold.
Red peppers: These have even more Vitamin C than oranges.
Milk: This is a good choice because of its Vitamin D content.

, Keep yourself from getting dehydrated. Men should consume 13 eight-ounce servings of fluids per day and women should drink about 9 eight-ounce servings of fluids per day. This counts both water and fluids you've consumed through food.Water can also prevent dryness in your nose or throat, which may also help you avoid getting a cold.

, Water is generally good for you, and a Japanese study showed that gargling plain tap water could prevent a cold.Researchers for this study suspected that chloride in the water prevented the transmission of colds.

Take a daily multivitamin.,
Increase your intake of Vitamin C. Vitamin C will help your body fight off a cold.,
Get Vitamin D every day.,
Increase your intake of zinc.",How to Prevent the Common Cold4," Vitamins will help you fight off colds by supporting your immune system.


Getting extra vitamins has not been proven to prevent colds, but it will likely shorten the duration of a cold if you do get one.Don't take separate vitamins. Taking too much of extra vitamins has the potential to make you sick.

, Some studies show that vitamin C can shorten a cold’s duration as well.Drink diluted orange juice to increase your vitamin C intake as well as your water intake. Don’t drink too much juice since juice contains sugar.
Aim to get about 250-500 milligrams of vitamin C per day., Low vitamin D levels have been linked to higher risk for infection.Get some sunlight to boost your vitamin D levels. We make vitamin D when our skin is exposed to sunlight. Just 15 minutes of sun, or half the time it takes for your arms and face to become pink from the sun, is enough to boost the immune system.


If you spend more than 15 minutes in the sun, be sure to wear sunscreen. Some experts believe that you can still get the vitamin D benefits from the sunlight even when you protect your skin.
In winter when there is usually less sunlight, researchers are discovering that people may have a higher risk for respiratory infections such as colds. This is due in part to low vitamin D levels. Supplement low vitamin D levels with tablets or cod liver oil during the winter months.
Ask your doctor to check your vitamin D levels with a simple blood test.

, Some studies have shown that zinc can help prevent or shorten a cold.Eat foods rich in zinc, including beef or lamb, seafood, spinach, cashews and beans.Don’t take too much zinc. More than 40 milligrams per day may cause headaches, drowsiness, dizziness and other symptoms.
Some studies show that zinc shorten the duration of a cold in adults, but not in children."

Sleep much longer than normal.,
Exercise even when you are sick.,
Reduce stress.",How to Prevent the Common Cold5," By resting longer than you normally do, your body will get the rest it needs to regenerate. Your body’s day-to-day activities leaves wear and tear on the cells within your immune system. Good rest helps rebuild those cells in order to function every day., Believe it or not, exercise can help you prevent a cold. Exercise regularly to stay healthy, reduce stress, and boost your body’s energy levels.Even if you’re sick, keep exercising. You may need to slow it down a bit, especially if your energy levels are low.


Check with your doctor before starting an exercise regimen if you haven’t been exercising regularly.

, Stress affects you in a number of ways, including increasing the possibility of you getting sick. Stress also lengthens your recovery time. Keep your stress levels down by identifying the cause, learning coping mechanisms, taking a yoga class, and resting when you can."

Take herbal remedies.,
Eat a teaspoonful of raw honey.,
Try sprinkling brewer’s yeast on your food.,
Take ginseng capsules.",How to Prevent the Common Cold6," Herbs like thyme, licorice root, garlic, echinacea, and elderberry extract can help prevent and shorten the duration of colds., Brew one or more of these herbs into tea and drink a pot of it.
These herbs are also available at natural foods stores as supplements.
If you have high blood pressure or pollen allergies, you should be cautious when taking herbal supplements. Consult your doctor before you use these types of remedies.

, Honey has antimicrobial and antioxidant properties, which can help prevent a cold and shorten infection time. Eat a teaspoonful or two of honey or mix it in with a cup of herbal tea.Avoid the bear-shaped jars! This honey has been filtered, so many of the benefits have been removed. Studies have shown that most of this honey isn't honey at all. Instead, go for raw honey. It can be found at Amish-type stores or natural food stores, or be bought directly from the beekeeper, and is usually found in mason jars. It is relatively expensive, with large jars sometimes costing $10, but is worth it if you have the money.

, Brewer’s yeast is a kind of yeast left over from brewing beer. It is readily available in powdered form at natural health food stores. Brewer’s yeast can be used to prevent and treat a number of illnesses, including the common cold.Sprinkle a teaspoon of brewer’s yeast on your food every day.

, Ginseng is a root herb used in traditional Chinese medicine to prevent various ailments. Take a ginseng capsule of 200 milligrams per day to help prevent the onset of a cold."

Always wash your hands.,
Keep your hands away from your mouth, eyes, and nose.,
Don't accept anything from someone you suspect is sick.,
Cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze.,
Take care of runny noses properly.,
Be careful about any potential antibiotics you will have to take if you get sick.,
Take your medicine according to the doctor's directions.,
Hospitals are reservoirs for super-bugs.,
Eat healthy and well.",How to Minimize Antibiotic Resistance," Wash or sanitize your hands before every meal, using soap and water or hand sanitizer that is a gelled solution of 70% rubbing ethyl alcohol. Also be sure to wash your hands after you go to the bathroom, not simply run your hands under water. Water doesn't wash off the germs, the soap will help with that.;
, This is particularly important if colds or a particular flu is hanging around your place of work or school. This way you reduce the chance of ingesting or inhaling germs and getting sick yourself. Otherwise, make sure you sanitize or wash your hands.


Colds and flu are contagious and get spread around via airborne bacteria and viruses and contaminated objects. In a public place, the most high contaminated object would be stair-case handles, door handles, elevator buttons, computer keys, and even the sink taps. There's no avoiding touching these, but you can try to avoid taking in the ""bugs"" from these objects by keeping your dirty hands away from your face. You can also try to touch as little of these objects as possible.

, But be liberal about it. Food and drink is one thing you must be careful about, and have a napkin at the ready if a glass is headed your way with the sick person's hand having been previously handled it.

, Do not cover your mouth with your hand! Rather, use the crook of your elbow to stop most of the spray that you would put out with a terrifically shattering sneeze, and do the same if you are coughing. The back of your hand may also work as well if it's necessary.


If you can, try to keep the sneeze in, like sneeze quietly with your mouth closed and not a loud, ""AAH-CHOO!!"" This will reduce the chance of germs spreading onto other people and other things that people after you will use.
To control coughing, use cough lozenges like Ricola or Fisherman's Friend cough drops as prescribed on the package or by your doctor.

, Use a tissue or Kleenex, not your hand, to wipe your nose, and keep them handy, particularly if you are coming down with an illness that is leaving you with a runny, plugged-up nose. While this step goes in hand with step #2 above, this reduces germs getting to others and being spread around.

, If you are ill with something that may resemble the flu or an infection, see your doctor as soon as possible to get it checked out. Your doctor has the expertise to tell you whether what you have is a bacterial or viral infection, and whether it needs treatment or simply a day of rest and lots of fluids.

, Do not try any what is called ""extra-label"" use practices, like taking less or more of what is recommended, skipping times to take your meds, not taking enough (stopping when you think you are feeling better and think you don't need to take anymore medication), or insisting that you should take a particular medication because you've always taken that and it's always worked for you, even though the doctor strongly disagrees and says you need to take something different.

, This is something that everyone must know, no matter how hygienic or sterile and environment they seem to be. This is also where you must be absolutely cautious about where you put your hands and what surfaces you touch. Sanitize as frequently as possible (even if you feel you have to hit every sanitizer station along the route you take through a hospital), touch few surfaces as possible, and certainly keep your hands off your face as often as possible.

, Take in foods that are known for their health capacities, such as apples, honey, broccoli, blackberries, and many other fruits and vegetables. You do not have to go vegetarian or vegan to reduce your chance of getting an antibiotic resistant bug, as majority of meat and dairy products are made with a very, very low chance of you ingesting antibiotics.


Use your common sense with cooking meat. Ground beef and all poultry and pork meats must be cooked through or until they are well-done (no pink in the middle), and beef cooked in a similar fashion, or to the USDA recommended 145ºF for medium-cooked steaks and roasts.
Antibiotic resistance with regards to livestock is less of a concern from the point the animal is raised to slaughter, particularly when majority of producers practice safe-use labelling and follow withdrawal times (time from last injection to when the animal is to be slaughtered or be used for milk and eggs) according to drug labelling. While there is controversy and questions surrounding antibiotic use in livestock, antibiotic-residue presence in the meat is tested both on farm and at random in the slaughter plant. Any antibiotic that would be present in meat, milk or eggs are at such low levels that they are not a risk to human health, and not likely to contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. There are also many antibiotics used in animals that are not approved for use in humans."

, If you have a scratchy throat, gargling salt water will relieve it. Mix a teaspoonful of table salt in a glass of warm water. Take a sip of the water mixture and gargle. Spit it out. Repeat several times a day.

, If your nose is stuffy, try a saline spray to help relieve some of the pressure.Saline sprays or nasal drops are readily available at drug stores.


Follow the package’s instructions when using saline spray.

, Acetaminophen or ibuprofen can be taken to treat minor aches and pains associated with the common cold.


You can also take other over-the-counter medications, such as DayQuil or NyQuil to treat your cold symptoms.

, When you feel cold symptoms coming on, go to bed early. Try to get extra rest to help your body fight off the cold.

, Use tissues to trap coughs and sneezes. This will help stop the spread of germs. Sneezing into your elbow is the best way to prevent spreading if you have no tissue available., If you feel a cold come on, do not run to the doctor and ask for a Z-pack, which are antibiotics.When you take antibiotics unnecessarily, bacteria might survive the antibiotic treatment. Then this drug-resistant bacteria will multiply and increase the possibility of other bacteria surviving future antibiotic treatments.You may also get diarrhea or vomiting from antibiotics, which could result in dehydration.
If you develop a fever, it may be more than a cold. Talk with your doctor if you are concerned.

Check the meter for obstructions.,
Stand or sit up straight.,
Set the cursor to zero.,
Inhale deeply.,
Place the mouthpiece in your mouth.,
Blow forcefully into the meter.,
Repeat the test twice more.,
Take readings every day.,
Keep a journal.,
Share information with your doctor.,
Find your personal best.,
Track your flow zone.,
Refrain from comparing yourself to others.",How to Use a Peak Flow Meter," Peak flow meters only work properly if air is able to freely pass through them. Blowing into a meter that is obstructed by a foreign object will not provide an accurate reading and could cause unnecessary strain on your lungs.


Peak flow meters usually have an open orifice in the mouthpiece of the device; this is the area most likely to become obstructed, so check here first before use.
When grasping the meter in your hand, make sure your fingers do not obstruct the sliding scale on top of the device.;
, It is important to maintain good posture while using your peak flow meter because this will allow you to maximize your pre-test inhalation as well as your exhalation (which is measured by the device). Slouching or lying down while using the meter will not allow you to get a good reading.

, The sliding cursor on the back of the peak flow meter is what measures the force of your exhalation. If you do not zero the cursor before you use the meter, your reading will not be accurate.You can adjust the cursor by simply placing your finger on it and manually sliding it to the ""zero"" end of the scale, which is toward the mouthpiece of the meter.

, In order to register the most powerful exhalation you are capable of, you must first fill your lungs with air. Do this before inserting the peak flow meter into your mouth in order to ensure the fullest inward breath possible.Be sure to remove gum or anything else from your mouth before inhaling. Not only do you want to prevent blowing a foreign object into your peak flow meter, but you also don't want to accidentally inhale anything when you take your deep breath in.

, In order to get the best reading possible on the meter, you should place the mouthpiece between your front teeth and seal your lips around the opening. This will stabilize the meter and ensure that no air escapes from the sides of your mouth when you exhale.Pull your tongue backward, away from the mouthpiece, so you do not accidentally block the opening of the meter.

, The idea here is to get a hard, fast burst of air out of your lungs to push the sliding cursor on the meter as far as possible down the length of the device. This means that your initial burst of breath is the most important for getting a good reading.Don't worry about blowing for a long time or getting all the air out of your lungs when you exhale; only your most forceful rate of exhalation will register on the meter.
If you cough or sneeze into the device, you will have to do it over again, as these will give you false readings that are higher than your actual peak exhalation.Don't forget to write down the meter reading!

, Each time you take a reading using your peak flow meter, you should do the test three times in order to eliminate the possibility that your reading was affected by user or device error. The highest of the three readings is the one you should keep for your records.This is also why it is important to write down each of your test readings as you go.


Do not average your readings; you need to keep a record of your peak flow rate, which means you need to get the highest reading possible.
If you don't have enough energy or are out of breath after the first test, make a note of this for your records and stick with your first test reading.

, In order to track your air flow rate and determine whether your condition is improving, staying the same, or worsening, you need to take readings frequently. It is recommended that you use your peak flow meter once every morning and again in the evening.Your readings will be most consistent if you take them at the same time(s) each day.
If you become ill and experience more difficulty than usual breathing, testing your peak flow will not be beneficial. In fact, doing so could skew your records such that you notice a false improvement in your asthma once you are no longer sick.

, This is essential to monitoring your condition and adopting an appropriate course of action if your asthma worsens. Use your journal to record not only your peak flow readings, but also any additional details about your condition that you think might be useful for your doctor to know.Your journal should include information about your daily readings (including time of day), your personal best peak flow rate, any unusual respiratory issues you experience, and details about your testing experiences (for example, if testing causes you to become wheezy or lightheaded).

, Take your journal with you any time you go to see your doctor. Information about how your condition may have changed over time is essential for helping your doctor determine the proper course of action.Since your doctor might not have time to go through your notes, you should create a summary of important points from your journal. Be sure to at least have your information well-organized so your doctor can find the information he needs.
If you are up to the challenge, consider creating a chart tracking your peak flow readings over the past few weeks to show your doctor. This can be done by hand or on a computer and is a nice way to visualize any trends that may appear in your flow rate readings.

, It is important to know how your flow rate at any given time stacks up to your personal best reading. Establish your personal best by doing an additional flow test once a day for about two to three weeks. The highest reading over this period will be your personal best, and you can judge all other readings by this benchmark.Do your personal best testing between the hours of noon and 2 pm each day.
Make sure your condition is under control during your several-week personal best testing period. If you become sick during this time, you will likely not find your personal best.
If you are taking medication for your asthma, make sure you do your personal best tests shortly after taking your medication. This applies to both ""quick-relief"" medications and those you take regularly to prevent attacks.

, Once you have established a personal best flow reading, you can use this to judge the state of your condition thereafter. Many peak flow meters have indicators built into them that will help you with this, but they must be pre-set with your personal best reading in order to get accurate information.There are three flow ""zones,"" which are each based on the a percentage range of your personal best. The green zone is 80 to 100% of your best; the yellow zone is 50 to 79% of your best; and the red zone is 49% or less of your best.
Use your flow zone to gauge whether your condition is changing and what steps to take in response to those changes (if any).
If your condition is getting worse and you are already taking daily medication to treat your asthma, you should consider adding quick-relief meds to your normal regimen (but speak to a doctor before taking new or additional medications).
If your reading is in the red zone at any point, seek immediate medical attention!

, Everyone is different and as such there are no ""standard"" readings for peak flow; however, there are expectations for what is ""normal,"" and these are based on your age, sex, height, and race. The only relevant comparisons you can make are to your own previous peak flow readings.


See your doctor before attempting to determine what your peak flow rate should be.

If you have not gotten your breathing back into a normal pattern within 15 minutes, then seek medical attention., Sitting upright in a chair is the best position to be in as you try to get your breathing back under control. Do not recline or lie down because this may make it harder for you to breathe., Tight fitting pants or a tight collar may restrict your breathing. Take a moment to loosen up your clothing if you feel like it is interfering with your ability to breathe., Try to relax your body and focus only on your breathing. You may find it helpful to count to five slowly as you inhale and then count back down from five as you exhale. Closing your eyes or focusing on an image or object may also help to keep you calm as you work to get your breathing back under control.As you breathe in focus on pulling air down into your stomach, then use your stomach muscles to help you push the air out. This is called diaphragmatic breathing and it will help you to take in deeper breaths.To make sure that you are taking in full deep breaths, try placing one hand on your stomach (just below your ribcage) and the other on your chest. As you breathe, you should notice that the hand on your chest is staying still while the hand below your ribcage is rising and falling.

, If after 15 minutes you are still struggling to breathe, then seek immediate medical attention. You should seek medical attention sooner if the attack is severe or if you are very uncomfortable. Some signs that you should seek emergency medical help include:Being unable to speak in full sentences

You may also feel less anxious if you know that that person is going to be by your side until the attack is over.If you are out in public by yourself, then you will need to ask a stranger. Try saying something like, “I am having an asthma attack, but I don’t have my inhaler. Would you mind sitting with me until my breathing goes back to normal?”

, Drinking one to two cups of caffeinated coffee or tea may help your body fight off an asthma attack as well. Your body will turn the caffeine into theophylline, which is an active ingredient in some asthma medicines.The warmth of the liquid will also help to break up phlegm and mucus, which may make breathing easier.


Do not drink more than two cups of coffee or your heartbeat may become rapid.

, Pressing on lung acupressure points may help to relax your muscles and get your breathing back under control. Apply gentle pressure to the area in the front of your shoulders, just above your armpits. Press on one shoulder at a time for the same amount of time on each side.


If you have someone nearby who can help you, there is also a pressure point on the inner part of your shoulder blade, just about an inch below the upper tip. Ask a friend to press on these pressure points for a few minutes to help relieve your asthma attack.

, Steam can open up your breathing passages and make breathing easier. If you are at home, then turn the shower on hot and sit in the bathroom with the door closed for about 10-15 minutes. Breathing in the steam may help ease your breathing.You can also turn on a humidifier if you have one, or fill your bathroom sink with hot water and lean over it with a towel over your head to capture the steam.

, Sometimes a change of location may be what you need to reduce stress and help you get your breathing under control.

Learn about common triggers.,
Keep a diary to identify your triggers.,
Get tested for food allergies.,
Determine if you have any food sensitivities.",How to Stop an Asthma Attack Without an Inhaler3," An asthma attack may be triggered by many different substances or events. That is why identifying triggers and avoiding known triggers is always a part of the treatment of asthma. Common triggers include:Allergens including dust, animal fur, cockroaches, mold, and pollen
Irritants including chemicals, cigarette smoke, air pollution, and dust
Some medications including aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and non-selective beta-blockers
Chemicals used to preserve foods, such as sulfites
Upper respiratory infections, such as colds and other viral infections of the lungs
Exercise and other physical activities
Cold or dry air
Health conditions such as heartburn, stress, and sleep apnea

, One way that you can begin to identify your triggers is to keep a diary of the foods you eat as well as any other common triggers that you encounter. If you have an asthma attack, look at your diary to see what you ate or encountered that may have triggered the attack. In the future, avoid that food or trigger to reduce your chances of having another attack.


If you have known asthma triggers, then do everything that you can to avoid coming into contact with them.

, Food allergies involve a specific type of immune molecule, an IgE molecule that triggers the release of histamine and other allergic mediators.If you have noticed that your asthma attacks seem to come after eating sometime, then a food allergy may be to blame. See an allergist and ask to be tested for food allergies.

, Food sensitivities are not the same as food allergies, but they can also cause asthma attacks. Food sensitivities are quite common. One study indicated that 75% of children with asthma also have food sensitivities.To determine if you have any food sensitivities, pay attention to foods that seem to cause asthma attacks and tell your allergist about these reactions. Common food sensitivities include:


Gluten (a protein found in any wheat product)
Casein (a protein found in dairy products)
Eggs
Citrus
Peanuts
Chocolate

Include good sources of Omega-3s.,
Try an herbal supplement.",How to Stop an Asthma Attack Without an Inhaler4," You can take 500 mg of Vitamin C every day as long as you do not have kidney disease.You may also want to consider including vitamin C rich foods such as:Citrus fruits such as oranges and grapefruit
Berries
Cantaloupe
Kiwis
Broccoli
Sweet potatoes
Tomatoes

, Molybdenum is a trace mineral. The recommended daily allowance (RDA) of molybdenum for children up to 13 years is 22–43 mcg/day. The recommended amount for people over 14 years is 45 mcg. Pregnant and nursing women need 50 mcg/day. Most multivitamins will include molybdenum, but it can also be purchased on its own.You can also get molybdenum by eating certain foods, such as:Beans
Lentils
Peas
Leafy vegetables
Milk
Cheese
Nuts
Organ meats

, Selenium is necessary for the biochemical reactions involved in controlling inflammation.If you use a supplement, get a supplement that uses selenomethionine because this form is easier for your body to absorb. Don’t take more than 200 mcg of selenium a day because it can be toxic in higher doses. Food sources include:Wheat
Crab
Liver

, Vitamin B6 is involved with over 100 different reactions in the body. Vitamin B6 can help reduce inflammation as well as support the immune system. As a supplement, children between the ages of one to eight years should take 0.8 mg/day. Children between the ages of nine to 13 should take 1.0 mg/day. Adolescents and adults should take 1.3–1.7 mg/day and women who are pregnant or nursing should take 1.9–2.0 mg/day.Foods highest in the most absorbable form of Vitamin B6 include:


Salmon
Potatoes
Turkey
Chicken
Avocados
Spinach
Bananas

, When vitamin B12 levels are low, supplementing with vitamin B12 may improve symptoms of asthma.As a supplement, children between the ages of 1-8 years should take 0.9-1.2 mg/day. Children between the ages of 9-13 should take 1.8 mg/day. Adolescents and adults should take 2.4 mg/day and women who are pregnant or nursing should take 2.6-2.8 mg/day. Food sources of vitamin B12 include:Meats
Seafood
Fish
Cheese
Eggs

, Omega-3 fatty acids are anti-inflammatory. Aim for a total of 2000 mg every day of both EPA and DHA per day.You can get omega-3s from a variety of food sources including:Salmon
Anchovies
Mackerel
Herring
Sardines
Tuna
Walnuts
Flaxseeds
Canola oil

, There are some herbs that may be used to help treat asthma. Make sure that you talk to your physician before using these herbs because they may interfere with medications. If you take these as supplements, follow the manufacturer’s directions. To use herbs in a tea, steep one teaspoon of dried herb or three teaspoons of fresh herbs in one cup of boiled water for 10 minutes. Drink three to four cups per day.

Wash your hands often, especially after toilet trouble, dirty jobs and messes, before/after meals, after coughing and/or sneezing and/or bowing your nose 'till your brains come out.,
Try not to have anyone else (like a friend or relative) sleep in the same bed as you normally sleep in, or at least on the side you sleep on.,
Eat healthy.,
Take vitamins and minerals; especially Vitamin C and D. C is for many things, including the immune-system, and Vitamin D focuses just about everything on your immune system.,
Get good exercise!",How to Prevent Colds/Infections And/or Survive Them1," Sleep is your bodies only way to naturally process food and liquids so they can be used in the morning. Without sleep, your body cannot function correctly, because there is not enough energy. Think of it like this: Your body creates energy more efficiently during sleep, because you aren't doing day activities, such as running and playing. Your body is doing less work, and thus using less energy, so less energy being created is automatically being used by your body. Now if there was no sleep, no matter how much you eat or drink, your body cannot keep making energy fast enough to keep up with your necessities as well as other activities you do. Thus, everything that is going on is going slower and more sluggish than normal, due to the famine of energy. This also affects your immune-system, or your body's natural defense mechanism. Since your immune-system is going sluggish, infections are more likely to occur, because your body cannot fight them off as well! Freaky-Fact: Everyone thinks that the most important thing in surviving is water, and that's correct. But they also think that it is the necessity that you have to have within 3 days, a.k.a. the least amount of time. Part of that is correct, and the other part is wrong. Yes, you can only really survive around 3-days without water, but it's not ranked the least amount of time. Actually, the least amount of time is sleep. Normal functioning of the body cannot go over more than 2 days! This is why many dungeons and prisons would torture inhabitants by putting them through extreme sleeplessness, eventually leading up to insanity.;
, Water is imperative when it comes to normal functioning of the liver, kidneys, digestive-track, lymphatic-system, and just about every other part of your body. As said above, you cannot survive very long without water, so drink-up! The less stress and shock your body has, the better you'll turn out.

, out of your mouth, eyes, ears, nose, bellybutton, etc. It's like the dream-train for germs; a highway to your entire body.

, It's another way for viruses and bacteria to enter your body and someone else's.

, Drool, breath, snot, you name it always ends up on the pillow or comforter, and yet another pathway for infection has come up!

, Very blunt, yet very descriptive, and yet also has to be explained to a point. Vegetables and fruits, especially vegetables, give your body the right stuff for fighting viruses and keeps the function in order. Try to avoid refined flour, grains, and starches; blood sugar spikes, and drops, leaving you vulnerable to attacks. Milk is also quite-good, as well as other dairy stuff. Avoid sugars; they make your immune-system sluggish and tired. NO GOOD!!! Try to eat a balanced meal, too. If all you have is a grilled cheese sandwich with some chips and a Coke, not only will your blood sugar spike, but there is not enough vegetables and fruits to balance all those carbohydrates. Also, eating veggies and fruits will help reduce the impact of carbs and sugar on your blood sugar!!! By the way, try to not eat stuff with a waxy-coating, anything that has artificial preservatives, artificial colors and flavors, hormones, GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms) , chemicals, etc. They are hard on just about everything in your body.

, Very important!!!

, Exercise is proven to reduce the impact and help prevent colds in the first-place. Plus, it's great for your muscles and heart!

See an allergist.",How to Treat Nocturnal Asthma," If you're suffering from an asthma attack, you'll need something to treat your symptoms as quickly as possible. Your doctor may recommend quick-relief medications, which are intended for short-term, as-needed use to relieve an active asthma attack.However, you are using these medications more than twice per week, then you may need other medications such as inhaled steroids.Short-acting beta agonists are inhaled bronchodilators that help improve your lungs' function within minutes. Medicines in this class include albuterol (ProAir HFA or Ventolin HFA) and levalbuterol (Xopenex).
Ipratropium (Atrovent) is a fast-acting bronchodilator that is typically reserved for individuals with emphysema and bronchitis but may be used for severe asthma.
Corticosteroids like prednisone and methylprednisolone may be administered orally or via injection. These medications quickly relieve the symptoms of an asthma attack, but prolonged use can cause serious side effects.;
, While quick-relief medications can help an active asthma attack, they will not do much to manage your asthma on a long-term basis. For this reason, your doctor may also prescribe one or more long-term medications to help control your condition.Leukotriene modifiers are oral medications that can treat symptoms for up to 24 hours at a time. Medications in this class include montelukast (Singulair), zafirlukast (Accolate), and zileuton (Zyflo).
Long-acting beta agonists are inhaled medicines used to dilate the airways. Common beta agonists include salmeterol (Serevent) and formoterol (Foradil).
Combination inhalers pair long-acting beta agonists with a corticosteroid, though they may increase the risk of a severe asthma attack. Common medications include fluticasone-salmeterol (Advair) and budesonide-formoterol (Symbicort).

, Allergy medication will not directly treat asthma or nocturnal asthma, but they are commonly used for allergy control. Common OTC preparations include Zyrtec (cetirizine), Claritin (loratadine) and Allegra (fexofenadine). However, if your asthma is triggered by or exaggerated by allergies, your doctor may recommend that you take a prescription allergy medication.Allergy shots, also known as immunotherapy, involve your doctor administering small doses of a given allergen to reduce your immune system's reaction to it. This may start at once a week, then gradually move to once a month.
Omalizumab (Xolair) is a medication that is administered via injection every two to four weeks. This medication is specifically made for people who suffer from both allergies and severe asthma.
Inhaled corticosteroids have an anti-inflammatory effect on your airways. Common corticosteroids include fluticasone (Flonase or Flovent), budesonide (Rhinocort), flunisolide (Aerospan HFA), and ciclesonide (Alvesco).

, Dust mites are a common trigger for people with nocturnal asthma. While you cannot guarantee a completely dust-free environment, you can reduce the risk of nocturnal triggers by keeping your bedroom as clean as possible.Dust your room at least once each week to keep dust to a minimum. If you're worried about exposure while cleaning you can wear a disposable dust mask.Vacuum your rugs regularly. When you change your sheets and pillowcases, you can also vacuum your pillows and mattress.
Change your sheets and pillowcases regularly to prevent the buildup of dust and dust mites.
You can also purchase special dustproof covers for your pillows and mattress. These protect your sleep area from dust and dust mites.

, Carpets provide ample space for dust and dust mites to gather, even if you clean regularly. The best way to reduce dust in your bedroom is to remove any carpeting in that room and install hardwood floors or linoleum tiles., The air that you breathe can have a tremendous effect on your asthma. Instead of leaving the windows open or breathing in damp air, you can treat the air in your bedroom to make it more conducive to your condition.Use an air conditioner instead of opening the windows. This reduces your exposure to pollen and dust while also lowering the humidity in your bedroom.
If you live in an area that is prone to damp or humid weather, consider using a dehumidifier in your home to pull excess moisture out of the air.

, Mold spores can aggravate your asthma at any time of day or night. The best way to reduce your exposure is to be proactive in how you tackle mold problems in and around your home.Keep the windows closed, especially at night. This is when mold spores are most active in the air.Dry and disinfect damp areas around your home, including in the bathroom and kitchen.
Remove piles of leaves or damp firewood from your yard.

, Getting regular checkups for your asthma is the best way to keep it under control. Having nocturnal asthma symptoms is a sign that your asthma is not well-controlled, so you should see your doctor as soon as possible. Your doctor can use different tests to check your asthma and adjust your medications as needed.

If it has been a while since you last saw your doctor, then make an appointment today.

, Some factors are known to cause asthma attacks in individuals with any type of asthma.In people with nocturnal asthma, exposure to those triggers before and during sleep could be a significant factor.Common asthma triggers include, but are not limited to:


Tobacco smoke
Exposure to cold air
Scented items, especially perfume and cologne
Airborne particles, including hairspray and other chemicals

, Though there are multiple factors that could cause nocturnal asthma attacks, some experts believe that your body position during sleep could be a factor.Try adjusting the way you lie down when you go to sleep and find a position that seems to work best for you.

, Experts generally advise that living a healthy lifestyle can help reduce the incidence of asthma attacks in many individuals.While this won't prevent asthma attacks from occurring, it will improve your health and may help you manage your symptoms.


Try to reduce your emotional stress and anxiety levels, as these are tied to asthma symptoms in many people.
Get adequate rest each night. This may be difficult if your nocturnal asthma interrupts your sleep, so try to plan accordingly by giving yourself more sleep time than you typically need.
Eat a balanced, healthy diet. For help planning a healthy diet, you may want to consult with a nutritionist.
Some experts recommend incorporating exercise into your lifestyle to help maintain your health. However, exercise may actually trigger an asthma attack in some individuals., Some individuals may experience an asthma attack after exposure to pet dander. Having asthma does not necessarily mean you will need to get rid of an existing pet or that you won't be able to get one in the future. However, you will need to take precautions to limit how much dander your pet leaves around the house.Bathe furry pets once a week to reduce the amount of dander on their coats.
If furry pets are a problem for your allergies, consider keeping them outside your bedroom as much as possible.
Vacuum rugs often. You should also sweep and mop hard floor surfaces at least once each week.
Furry pets are not the only animals that can cause complications. Some people find that bird feathers can also aggravate asthma symptoms.If your symptoms worsen in spite of taking precautions, you may need to avoid exposure to these pets altogether. Talk to a friend or relative about taking care of your pet if you are no longer able to.

, Long-term management of your asthma symptoms will require you to keep regular contact with your doctor. The frequency of your doctor's visits will vary, depending on the severity of your asthma and how well under control your condition is at any given time.Follow up with your doctor every two to six weeks when you're first getting control of your condition.
Once your asthma is under control, schedule appointments for every one to six months. Keep these appointments indefinitely so your doctor can continue to assess your condition.

, Some medications are known to trigger or aggravate asthma symptoms in some individuals. These include over-the-counter medications like aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen. Beta-blockers, which are prescribed for heart disease and high blood pressure, are also known to trigger asthma attacks in some individuals.If you must take pain medication or beta-blockers for another medical condition, talk to your doctor about alternative medications that will not trigger your asthma.
Check the side effects of any new medication you are considering to ensure that it will not have any adverse effects on your asthma.

, If you suffer from allergies or if you find that allergens affect your asthma, you may need to see an allergist. An allergist can help you identify your particular allergies, work on allergen immunotherapy, and advise you on how to avoid known allergens.Ask your doctor for a referral to a recommended allergist. You can also find allergists in your area by searching online or checking your phone book, but you may still need a referral from your primary doctor.

Avoid known triggers.,
Identify food sensitivities.,
Assess your own individual triggers.",How to Treat Asthma Naturally1," In naturopathic medicine, as in mainstream medicine, the first step in treating asthma is to reduce exposure to known triggers by avoiding them as much as possible. In addition to avoiding known triggers, you need to keep alert to new potential triggers. This is an important part of the treatment of asthma. These triggers can include:Allergens (substances that cause allergic reactions) from things like dust, animal fur, cockroaches, mold, and pollens from trees, grasses, and flowers
Irritants including chemicals in the air, cigarette smoke, air pollution, and dust in the environment. These can also include cleaning and beauty products.
Some medications. Examples include aspirin, other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and nonselective beta-blockers often used in heart disease.
Chemicals used to preserve foods. The most common are the sulfites found in a number of foods and drinks.
Upper respiratory infections, such as colds and other viral infections of the lungs.
Exercise and other physical activities.
Cold or dry air.
Other health conditions, such as heartburn (acid reflux), stress and sleep apnea.;
, One study indicated that 75% of children with asthma have food sensitivities.Food sensitivities are most commonly identified by a process of trial and error, though lab tests are becoming more common and more available.


Food sensitivities are not the same thing as food allergies, even though the terms are often and incorrectly used interchangeably. Food allergies involve a specific type of immune molecule, an IgE molecule, which triggers the release of histamine and other allergic mediators. Food allergies can be determined using a skin test. Food sensitivities involve the immune response, but use quite different molecules: IgG, IgM and sometimes IgA.Common food sensitivities include gluten (a protein found in any wheat product) and casein (a protein found in dairy products). Removing gluten and/or casein completely from the diet can significantly decrease the frequency and severity of asthma attacks.Other foods that have been associated as asthma triggers include eggs, citrus, peanuts, and chocolate.

, It has to be emphasized that asthma triggers can be unique to each individual with asthma. The best way to find these triggers is to keep a diet diary, recording everything you eat along with any reactions you experience.


Keep this diary for at least 2 weeks. This should allow you to identify what, if any, food triggers you may have.
The treatment is to simply avoid these foods completely.

",How to Prevent Colds/Infections And/or Survive Them2," Is it an annoying stuffy nose, or is it located in the throat. Many common colds happen in your breathing/pulmonary area. Colds also like to start in the nose, then gradually come down to the throat, thus many coughs have a nose-problem, too. But since it started in the nose, and your body wasn't able to fight it off in time for it to reach your throat, coughs often show a weakness in the immune-system.

, Sleep, good hydration, sometimes exercise, etc. can help dramatically.

, Try to avoid drugs; it's an overload to the liver and can actually rebound if taken all the time. Try natural remedies, like Umcka, Zinc, Vitamin C and D, Echinacea and Goldenseal, Grapefruit Seed Extract, etc.

, Negative a pessimistic moods make things worse, mentally and physically. There's a sugar pill out on the market called Placebo, and the name says it all.

Eat anti-inflammatory foods to reduce inflammation.,
Keep your food as close to its original or natural form as possible.,
Take the time to cook for yourself.,
Include at least 90-95% complex carbohydrates in your meals.Complex carbohydrates are made up of individual sugar molecules that are strung together in long, complicated, and often branched chains.,
Read food labels closely.,
Increase the fiber in your diet.,
Limit red meats and increase the amount of fish and skinless poultry you eat.,
Increase the amount of water you drink.",How to Treat Asthma Naturally2," The anti-inflammatory diet is relatively straightforward, but will require some dedication because it avoids ALL processed and prepared foods. In other words, you will need to cook from “scratch.""


Try adding anti-inflammatory herbs to flavor your food. Adding normal food amounts is considered safe, unless, of course, you have a sensitivity to the plant. If you are not sure, try just a pinch of the herb first. If you have no reaction within 2 hours, it should be safe to use. Anti-inflammatory herbs include: garlic, onions, turmeric, curry, ginger, basil, cinnamon, cloves, and allspice.

, This means that you should try to limit any processed or prepared foods. It also means that as much as you can, include organic foods.


One reason to eat organic foods is that it limits the amounts of chemicals you take into your body. When you are trying to prevent or control asthma, that is good advice because you are potentially avoiding asthma triggers., This can be an adjustment for those who have little practice cooking. If you are pressed for time, try using a crock pot or preparing the basics (like rice, beans and even meats and vegetables) ahead of time and freezing those basics.

, Complex carbohydrates are found in whole, unprocessed foods such as whole grains, peas, lentils, beans, and vegetables. The reason that processed foods should be avoided is that they include both simple carbohydrates along with added sugars.


Simple carbohydrates are often found in processed foods. These include added sugars, like glucose, sucrose (table sugar) and fructose (most often added as high fructose corn syrup). These sugars are more closely associated with obesity, diabetes and heart disease, but can trigger asthma as well because they can promote inflammation., Reading labels can be useful to determine the amount of sugars in a food. However, manufacturers are not required to clearly list all added sugars. You can avoid any added sugars by sticking to the unprocessed foods.


A good rule of thumb is no “white” foods – no white bread, white pasta, white rice--also avoid candies, cookies, cakes and other confections.

, This can be done by increasing your fruit and vegetable intake, as well as by adding specific high fiber foods to your meals. For example, you can include a tablespoon of ground flaxseeds at every meal. Either get a coffee grinder to grind your own flaxseeds or keep pre-frozen ground seeds in your freezer (to keep the healthy oils that you also get in flaxseeds from getting rancid).

, Look for wild-caught fish, such as salmon, cod, haddock and tuna. These fish are good sources of omega-3 fatty acids that are essential for your health and are anti-inflammatory.


The skin of fish and poultry is avoided because it can be high in animal fat, as well as any added hormones and antibiotics. This promotes inflammation.
Obviously, you want to avoid any of the foods that you are sensitive to. If you are sensitive to salmon, for example, eat other types of fish instead.

, Try to get 1-2 L a day or about 6-8 8 ounce glasses of water a day. You should also avoid caffeinated drinks (coffee and black tea) and avoid all soft drinks, whether they are regular or diet soft drinks. These promote dehydration and inflammation.

Take a Vitamin C supplement.,
Incorporate Molybdenum into your diet.,
Make sure you are getting enough Selenium.,
Take Vitamin B6.,
Take Vitamin B12.,
Consider taking herbs specifically for asthma.",How to Treat Asthma Naturally3," A large number of clinical studies have studied the use of vitamin C in the treatment of asthma. The majority showed improvement with supplemental Vitamin C.You can take 500 mg of Vitamin C every day as long as you have no kidney disease.

, Molybdenum is a trace mineral found in beans, lentils, and peas.The Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) of molybdenum for children up to 13 years is 22-43 mcg/day while for people over 14 years is 45 mcg. Pregnant and nursing women need 50 mcg/day. Most multivitamins will include molybdenum, but it can also be purchased individually.

, Selenium is required for biochemical reactions that are involved in controlling inflammation. Food sources include organ meats, seafood, and meat.


If you use a supplement, get one that uses selenomethionine. Studies have indicated that this form of selenium is best absorbed.Don’t take more than 200 mcg of selenium a day. It can be toxic in higher doses.

, Vitamin B6 is involved with over 100 different reactions in the body.It can help reduce inflammation, as well as support the immune system.


Foods highest in the most absorbable form of Vitamin B6 are salmon, potatoes, turkey and chicken, avocados, spinach and bananas.
As a supplement, children between the ages of 1-8 years should take 0.8 mg/day. Between the ages of 9-13, 1.0 mg/day should be taken. Adolescents and adults should take 1.3-1.7 mg/day and women who are pregnant or nursing should take 1.9-2.0 mg/day.

, Vitamin B12 is important to your metabolism and the energy producing citric acid cycle. Deficiency can result in anemia and nervous system disorders.Food sources include meats, seafood, fish, cheese and eggs.


As a supplement, children between the ages of 1-8 years should take 0.9-1.2 mg/day. Between the ages of 9-13, 1.8 mg/day should be taken. Adolescents and adults should take 2.4 mg/day and women who are pregnant or nursing should take 2.6-2.8 mg/day., The most common is licorice root. Talk to your physician before using medicinal herbs, because they may interfere with medications.


If you take these as supplements, follow the manufacturer’s directions.
If using them as teas, take 1 teaspoon of dried herb or 3 teaspoons of fresh herb and steep in boiled water (1 cup) for 10 minutes. Drink 3-4 cups a day.
Lobelia inflata (Indian tobacco) is sometimes smoked for asthma relief, but only do this under the advice of a naturopath or a medical herbalist.

Assess whether you are at high or low risk of having asthma.,
Understand what asthma is.,
Understand the different types of asthma.,
Look for symptoms of asthma.,
Research theories about the causes of asthma.,
Consider using medications to treat asthma.",How to Treat Asthma Naturally4," Asthma tends to start during childhood, though it can affect both men and women of all ages. Adult women tend to be at higher risk than adult men, however, during childhood more boys than girls have asthma.Other factors play a role in asthma as well. Along with environmental factors, there are genetic factors. If someone in the family has asthma or atopy (extreme allergies) the risk for asthma is increased., In asthma, the breathing airways (bronchi, bronchioles) are inflamed. This pattern of inflammation causes the airways to swell and to be sensitive to a number of inhaled substances that act as triggers for an asthma attack.


During an asthma attack, the airways become even more swollen and narrowed, making it very difficult to breath.
Also, part of the inflammatory response in the lungs includes the production of mucus. During an asthma attack, even more mucus is produced, increasing the difficulty of getting a full breath and getting enough oxygen.

, There are two main types of asthma, intrinsic (non-allergic) and extrinsic (allergic) asthma.Extrinsic asthma is more common, directly involves an immune response and is triggered by inhaled substances. Intrinsic asthma is triggered by cold air, exercise, dry air and stress. The immune response is somewhat less critical in intrinsic asthma, but both involve an inflammatory response. Both forms of asthma can be mild, moderate or severe and both can be intermittent. Diagnosis is usually by a history of symptoms and family history-- you need to have a diagnosis from your physician.

, The most common symptoms of asthma are: coughing (often worse at night or early in the morning), wheezing (a whistling or squeaking sound that occurs during a breath), tightness in the chest, and shortness of breath.These symptoms can be triggered by a number of different substances or events.

, It is not altogether clear what causes asthma. However, there is some solid evidence that the lack of exposure to bacteria, viruses, fungi, molds and other pathogens early in life is at the root cause of asthma. This is called the “Hygiene Hypothesis.”


The immune system discriminates between “self”and “non-self.” Part of the way the immune system learns to do this is by being exposed, from birth, to a variety of pathogens, such as bacteria, fungi and viruses. Because modern society puts so much emphasis on sanitation and cleanliness, we spend a good deal of time sterilizing our environment. As a result, it is proposed that our immune systems do not learn those essential early lessons and tends to over-react in some cases (autoimmune diseases, atopy, allergies) and under-react in other cases (increased number of infections).One bit of evidence that supports this hypothesis is that children who are raised on farms and around animals tend to have lower rates of both asthma and allergies (atopy)., Medications can include short-term medications (rescue medications) such as inhalers with short acting beta agonists to open up the airways. These include albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others), levalbuterol (Xopenex) and pirbuterol (Maxair), ipratropium (Atrovent) and short-acting corticosteroids. Long-term medications are also used and include:Inhaled corticosteroids to reduce inflammation. These include fluticasone (Flovent HFA), budesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler), flunisolide (Aerobid), ciclesonide (Alvesco), beclomethasone (Qvar) and mometasone (Asmanex).
Other anti-inflammatory medicines, such as Cromolyn.
Long-acting beta agonists to open the airways. Examples include salmeterol (Serevent) and formoterol (Foradil, Perforomist)
Biological medicines that can reduce the response to triggers and decrease inflammation. These include Omalizumab (Zolair) and Leukotriene modulators such as montelukast (Singulair), zafirlukast (Accolate) and zileuton (Zyflo)
Theophylline acts to open airways.
Combination medications.

Other health conditions: such as heartburn (acid reflux), stress and sleep apnea;
, After you have a coughing fit, ask yourself what triggered it. If you're having trouble identifying common triggers, you may have to consider if there's an unknown trigger that you need to find. Keep a journal of your daily routine so you can determine what you experienced right before the coughing attack. Ask yourself:Has the season changed? Are there new environmental factors triggering my asthma?
Is there a new industry nearby that may be spilling pollutants into the air?
Have I added a new food into my diet? Am I taking any new medications that might be interfering with my asthma medication?
Has the weather changed suddenly? Was it warm and it is now cool and damp? Is it windy or has the wind changed direction? The wind may be bringing in new irritants.

, If you suspect that a food allergy is triggering your asthma cough, don't simply cut the food from your diet. This could lead to a nutritional deficiency. Instead, talk to your doctor about getting skin prick testing to determine what you're allergic to. Your doctor can then recommend strategies for managing the allergy. Common food allergies include:Gluten (a protein found in any wheat product)
Casein (a protein found in dairy products)
Eggs
Citrus
Fish and shellfish
Peanuts

, If you're having trouble identifying your asthma triggers, talk with your doctor about monitoring your peak expiratory flow rate (PEF) using a small portable tool. This will show how effective your lungs are at pushing air out. As your airways narrow your PEF will drop. Regularly checking your peak function and tracking your daily activities/foods can help you and your doctor determine your asthma triggers.Measuring your lung function is especially helpful if your triggers don't cause an immediate coughing fit. Some people find that their triggers take some time before an attack comes on.

, Keep the mucus in your throat loose by drinking six to eight 8-ounce glasses of water every day. If you have a dry cough that doesn't produce anything, you need to stay hydrated so the coughing doesn't irritate your throat. This is especially important if colds and flu are triggers for your asthma symptoms.Increase your fluid intake if you're coughing up yellow or green mucus.

, Keep the air in your home as pure as possible. Check any air filters in your home and avoid smokers. Since smoke is a common asthma trigger, talk to any smokers about not smoking around you. You should also avoid spraying hairspray and perfume.Since pollen can trigger your asthma, you should consider running an air conditioner on days when the pollen count is high. Just take care to regularly clean the air vents in your home so dust and mold isn't blown around.
Consider running a humidifier or leaving bowls of water around your home. This will add moisture to the air which can improve your breathing.

, Avoid deep over breathing  when you have an asthma cough. Some doctors believe that this can irritate your lungs even more.Instead, slowly breath only through your nose, keeping your inhalations and exhalations the same length. For example, breathe in through your nose while counting to 8. Hold your breath for as long as you can and breathe out for 8 counts. Stay calm, relaxed and still while you breathe.


While you'll be getting a little less oxygen during this exercise, it's about the same amount you'd be getting if you were coughing. Controlling your breathing by counting can decrease the cough and other symptoms of asthma., A coughing fit brought on by asthma can make you feel panicked or out of control. Calm yourself and your breathing by practicing a relaxing breathing pose. Lay on your back and bend your knees so that your feet are still flat on the floor. Place your hands on your belly put a pillow under your head so you're more comfortable. Close your eyes and let your belly sink down with each breath.The goal of this exercise is to relax your breathing which can calm coughing. While you slowly breathe, try to calm your mind and your thoughts.

, Emotions do not directly cause asthma, but the changes in your rate and rhythm of breathing that accompany emotions can trigger an attack. Severe anxiety and actions like crying and yelling can affect your breathing and bring on an attack. Even emotional distress brought on by an attack itself can worsen your symptoms. Learning techniques to cope with stress and anxiety may help prevent these episodes., Your doctor will work with you to create a written plan that you can follow when you start having an asthma attack or coughing fit. The action plan should give you a list of steps to follow to get your breathing back to normal. It should also list emergency and medical contacts.The doctor will explain how the action plan moves from green to yellow to red. Each colored section should list symptoms you should look for, your medication and treatments, and a place for you to record your lung function., If you're having a coughing attack, you'll probably be advised to use an inhaler. Your inhaler is designed to quickly get medication (like short acting beta agonists) into your airways so they open. Your doctor may prescribealbuterol, levalbuterol, pirbuterol, ipratropium, or corticosteroids.


To use an inhaler, take off the cap and shake the inhaler. Three or four good shakes should work. Remove the cap and breathe out.
Put the inhaler mouthpiece to your mouth and breathe in slowly. Press down once on the inhaler's button, and continue taking in one long, slow breath.
Take the inhaler out of your mouth. Hold your breathe for ten seconds, and then breathe out., These medications are used every day to prevent coughing and other asthma symptoms . They won't give immediate relief (you should use your inhaler or other short-term medication for that). Instead, long-term medications can reduce inflammation, open your airways, and reduce your body's response to triggers. You may also need treatments for allergies that trigger asthma attacks. Long-term medications or treatments include:Allergy shots
Inhaled corticosteroids like fluticasone, budesonide, flunisolide, ciclesonide, beclomethasone and mometasone
Anti-inflammatory medicines like cromolyn
Long-acting beta agonists like salmeterol and formoterol
Biological medicines like omalizumab and leukotriene modulators
Theophylline

, An important part of managing your asthma cough is knowing when to get medical treatment for it. Besides cough one hallmark sign of worsening asthma is wheezing. Wheezing is a high pitched whistling sound produced when air is forced through narrowed airways. Usually a wheezing sound is created when breathing out but can also occur when breathing in.Call your doctor immediately if you have to take more medication than advised, your coughing (or other) symptoms get worse, you have trouble breathing while talking, or your peak flow measurement is only 50 to 80% of your personally best measurement. You should go to the emergency room for help if:You feel sleepy or confused
You have severe shortness of breath while resting
Your peak flow measurement is less than 50% of your personal best
You have severe chest pain
Your lips and face look blue
You have extreme difficulty breathing
Your pulse is rapid
You have severe anxiety because of shortness of breath

If you cough frequently, even when you're not sick with a cold or flu, you may have asthma. Take note of your coughing throughout the day and mark when it tends to occur.With asthma, coughing tends to occur often at night. Coughing may interfere with your sleep schedule.
Coughing is also common early in the morning with asthma.;
, Wheezing is another common sign of asthma. Wheezing is a squeaky noise that tends to occur when you breathe. Take note of any wheezing you notice throughout the day. Frequent wheezing, that is not in response to something like a cold, may indicate you have asthma., If you have asthma, you may have symptoms of upper respiratory infections frequently. You may feel like you get sick more often than others. Symptoms of upper respiratory issues can include the following:.


Sneezing
Runny nose
Congestion
Sore throat
Headache
Difficulty sleeping

, Asthma can drain your overall energy level. If you have asthma, you may feel tired frequently. A low energy level can cause feelings of moodiness or irritation throughout the day.Fatigue may be related to difficulty sleeping due to coughing or wheezing at night.
Energy dips may be common in response to physical activities such as running.

, Asthma symptoms are not always the same for everyone, and you may not experience all the symptoms of asthma. Do not assume you don't have asthma if you only display a few symptoms or if your symptoms vary in severity. It is not uncommon for people with asthma to have symptom-free periods. Some people with asthma may only experience symptoms in response to triggers such as allergens or exercise. Any breathing or respiratory difficulties could possibly be related to asthma and should be evaluated by a healthcare professional., An asthma attack is a severe flare up of asthma that can occur on its own or in response to something like an allergen or air pollutant. If you have what feel like asthma attacks frequently, you may have asthma. If you notice others having these attacks, they may have asthma and need assistance taking out their inhaler or getting to a doctor. The symptoms of an asthma attack include:Shortness of breath
Tight chest
Coughing and wheezing

, Track when your symptoms tend to occur. Asthma is often triggered by specific environmental factors. Coughing or wheezing fits in response to your environment are more likely to be caused by asthma than symptoms you have due to a cold or flu. Write down when your symptoms and note anything unusual, such as physical exertion or air pollution, that occurred right before your symptoms appeared., People with asthma are very sensitive to pollution in the air. Common allergens, like pollen, may trigger asthma attacks. You also may experience asthma attacks in response to things like animal fur, mold, and dust. Things that create air pollution, like cigarette smoke, perfume, or hairspray, may also trigger symptoms., Pay attention to your breath when you exercise. If you experience any symptoms when you exercise, you may have sports-induced asthma. Signs may get worse in cold and dry air. You may find yourself getting out of breath easily and coughing, wheezing, or sneezing just after exercise.Keep in mind, symptoms may not consistently occur after exercise. Asthma flare ups can go through varying periods of severity. Just because you do not experience symptoms every time you exercise does not meant you don't have asthma.

, Certain factors can increase your risk for asthma. If you have some symptoms of asthma, as well as certain risk factors, this increases your likelihood of developing asthma. Risk factors that increase the likelihood of asthma include the following:A blood relative also having asthma
Allergies
Being overweight or obese
Smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke
Working with chemicals, such as chemicals used in hairdressing, farming, or manufacturing

, If you observe or experience any of the signs or symptoms of asthma and/or are at risk for the disease, see your doctor as soon as possible. Early diagnosis is important to help treat and manage the disease. Make an appointment with your physician for a basic physical and to talk over your symptoms.Your doctor will perform a basic physical exam and listen to your breathing through a stethoscope. They will also ask you about your symptoms and any family medical history.
If you're on medications, make sure you know the precise types of dosages before your appointment.

, If your doctor suspects you may have asthma, they will do a test to measure lung function. You will receive medication prior to a lung test that will open your airwaves. If you have asthma, this medication is less likely to lead to open airwaves.A spirometry test checks how much air you can inhale and exhale. Your doctor will ask you to take a series of deep breaths if they do a spirometry test.
With a peak flow test, your doctor uses a meter to measure how hard you're able to breathe out. A decreased ability to breathe out may indicate asthma.

, If your doctor suspects asthma after measuring your lung functions, they may recommend other tests. It may take several types of tests over a prolonged period before your doctor can definitely diagnose asthma. Be patient and take any tests your doctor requires.Your doctor may want to do further breath tests to test lung capacity and check for certain gasses in your breath.
An x-ray may be required to check your lungs.
Allergen tests may be used to identify any potential triggers for an asthma attack.

, Asthma treatments vary greatly depending on your specific symptoms and the severity of your asthma. Work closely with a doctor to come up with a specific action plan to treat your asthma. Medications, lifestyle changes, and the use of devices like inhalers can all be used to treat asthma.Long acting medications, such as corticosteroids, may be used daily to treat asthma.
Quick relief medications may be used as symptoms occur.
Allergy medications, like allergy shots, may be used if your asthma flares up in response to allergens.

Exercise.",How to Prevent Asthma," Many people with asthma can breathe, run and exercise without trouble most of the time—but certain triggers, inside or outside your body, can set off a cascade of symptoms that last from minutes to weeks. When your asthma kicks in, think about what environments you were recently exposed to and try to figure out what is setting you off. This will help you know what to avoid in the future. The most common triggers include:Air pollution - Smog and extreme changes in the weather can irritate and greatly increase the number of asthma attacks.

Exposure to an allergen - Common allergens include grass, trees, pollen, certain foods, etc). Note that the combination of an allergic reaction along with an asthma attack can be very dangerous and should not be taken lightly.

Cold air - Cold air can dry out airways and irritate the respiratory system, causing an onset of asthma

Illness - A respiratory infection such as the common cold can dry out the airways and irritate the respiratory system, causing the onset of your asthma.

Irritants in the air - Any smoke (from tobacco to wood smoke) can trigger an asthma attack, as can fragrances in the air, like perfumes, colognes and scented aerosols.

Dust and mold - Your home environment can be the source of an asthma attack, particularly if mold or dust are present.

Stress and strong emotions - If you are overwhelmed by stress or dealing with depression or anxiety, then you may be more susceptible to an asthma attack.Physical activity - Exercise can trigger an asthma attack in some people.Foods that contain sulfites or other preservatives - Some people also have asthma attacks after consuming foods that contain sulfites or other preservatives, such as shrimp, beer, wine, and dried fruit.;
, If you are having trouble figuring out what causes your asthma to flare up, keep track of your symptoms for several weeks in an asthma diary that details all the environmental, physical and emotional factors you encountered. Grab your diary any time you experience a flareup and document your symptoms, how you felt, and what you did or were exposed to right before the attack.


Look for a pattern. If you suspect your asthma is triggered by bodily factors like the flu, track your asthma and other illnesses over the course of a year and see if you can find a correlation.
Be consistent. The diary will be most useful if you fill it in as often as possible. If you tend to be absent-minded, set an appointment on your phone or computer to remind you to update it if something eventful has happened.
Bring your diary with you to checkups with your doctor, as this can help your doctor craft a proper treatment regimen for you.

, You should learn to recognize warning signs of an impending attack, such as coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath or chest tightness. It's also a good idea to regularly measure and record your peak airflow with a home peak flow meter since you may not be able to immediately register that your lung function is decreasing.A peak expiratory flow meter is a small device that measures the maximum speed of expiration in order to monitor a person's ability to exhale air. If the measurements range from 50% to 79% of your personal best, this is indicative of an asthma flareup. Regularly measuring and logging your peak flow can help you determine what is normal and thus, what is abnormal for you.

, If your triggers still aren't clear, your pulmonologist, allergist or general practitioner can perform tests to help you discover what sets off your asthma.


Allergy testing is not a tool used for general diagnosis of asthma, but it is a useful technique for determining triggers.A number of allergic symptoms can be associated with asthma. The association of asthma with atopy is well documented . Atopy is defined as having IgE antibodies to particular antigens, which means you would have a genetic predisposition towards certain diseases including asthma, rhinitis, and eczema., These are common asthma triggers, and keeping a clean environment can go a long way in preventing asthma flareups. Make vacuuming and dusting part of your weekly cleaning routine to avoid triggering an asthma attack. To avoid dust mites, use mattress and pillow covers, wash bedding often and avoid quilts that use down feathers.


Mold is caused by humidity, so use a hygrometer to check how humid your home environment is. Use a dehumidifier to keep the environment moisture and mold-free. Regularly disinfect showers and other places where moisture can lead to mold growth. If you suspect there is a significant mold problem in your home or work place, get it professionally inspected and removed.
Get a HEPA or other type of air filter for your home. You can also use fans and air conditioning to maintain good air circulation.

, Some people with asthma are highly sensitive to perfumes. If that's you, don't wear a lot of perfume and try to avoid being around people who wear a lot of perfume. If you must use perfume, use it lightly and try not to inhale it.


Avoid using scented candles and air fresheners as well, as scented products can irritate your nasal passages and breathing airways. You can even opt for scent-free laundry detergent.

, Studies have shown that cities with high levels of air pollution have much higher asthma rates, especially among children.Smog, car exhaust and other air pollutants can all contribute to asthma.


Monitor your local air quality index and avoid exercising or spending too much time outside on bad days. Learn when air quality is best, such as mornings in the summer, and schedule outdoor activities for those times.Filter the air in your home through your air conditioner, instead of opening windows.
Avoid living by the highway or a busy intersection. If you can, move to a home that has fresh, dry air.

, Whether from tobacco, incense, fireworks or anything else, do your best to avoid inhaling smoke. Not only should you not smoke at all, but you should make an effort to avoid being in the presence of other smokers or anything that elicits smoke and can cause your asthma to flare up.


Research suggests a clear link between secondhand smoke and asthma, especially in young people. Nearly 26,000 new diagnoses of asthma in children and teens may be due to secondhand smoke., When your body is focused on dealing with an illness, it has fewer resources to handle other types of diseases. Thus, the combination of a cold/flu with an asthma attack can be very dangerous. When your asthma is triggered by other viruses, minor sniffles can turn into weeks of wheezing and coughing. Take extra precautions to avoid getting sick.


Get a seasonal influenza and pneumonia vaccination. The flu isn't fun for anyone, but people with asthma especially should be sure to get a flu shot every year. Consult your primary care physician for more information. Flu vaccines are typically offered from September until mid-November each year.Avoid close contact with people who may be contagious. Don't share any food or drink with people who have a cold or the flu. This increases your likelihood of getting sick.
Wash your hands often—especially during cold and flu season. Being mindful of germs and maintaining good hygiene can keep you from getting sick.

, If you have allergies that hit your lungs or sinuses, getting them treated can go a long way towards getting your asthma under control as well. Talk to your doctor or allergist about medications and strategies to treat your allergies.Decongestants and antihistamines can be purchased over-the-counter treat some allergy symptoms.
Prescription nasal sprays and tablet medications can treat a variety of seasonal allergies.
Immune therapy shots can reduce your allergies over the long term by helping your immune system build a tolerance to offending allergens.
If you're uncertain about whether you have allergies in the first place, talk to your doctor about a possible allergy test. This test will determine whether you demonstrate reactions to the most common allergic triggers, which can also be unknown triggers for asthma.

, Once you are diagnosed with asthma, create an asthma action plan with your allergist or physician. This plan is basically a step-by-step process of what to do when you face an acute attack. The plan should be written down and include emergency phone numbers as well as those of family and friends who can meet you at the hospital if needed.Having this plan and being in control of your own treatment can make you feel more in control over the illness. You control your asthma, it doesn't control you.

, If you do have asthma, there are a number of prescription drugs that can help you manage your asthma so that attacks become less frequent. There are inhalers for both daily and quick-relief use. Talk to your doctor about finding a medication that works for you.There are two different type of rescue medications that you may have been prescribed: a Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI) or a Dry Powder Inhaler (DPI). MDIs the are most common inhalers. They deliver asthma medication through a small aerosol canister equipped with a chemical propellant that pushes the medication into the lungs. A DPI inhaler means of delivering dry powder asthma rescue medication without propellant. A DPI requires you to breathe in quickly and deeply, which makes them difficult to use during an asthma attack. This makes them less popular than the standard MDIs.
Your doctor may also prescribe you a quick relief inhaler, like albuterol, which you are to use during emergencies and flareups. Watch yourself carefully for increasing use of this type of medication. If you find yourself using it more and more often, it means that your asthma is not under control. Seek medical advice from your doctor.Take your medication as prescribed. Just because your asthma seems to be improving doesn't mean that you should stop the medication. Consult your physician before making any changes.

, Asthma treatment is broken down into intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent, and severe persistent disease. The main diagnostic feature between these four categories include nocturnal awakenings. The more severe and frequent the nocturnal awakenings are the more severe the asthma is categorized.Intermittent asthma usually occurs during the day, with one or two episodes per week. You experience two or less nocturnal awakenings per month.

Mild persistent asthma presents with symptoms more than twice a week. You may have three to four nocturnal awakenings per month.

Moderate persistent asthma means you have daily symptoms, with nocturnal awakenings more than once per week.

Severe persistent asthma means you experience symptoms daily and nocturnal awakenings each night.
Treatment for intermittent asthma includes a short acting beta-agonist medication while treatment for severe disease includes a long term beta-agonist medication with medium dose inhaled glucocorticoids with possible leukotriene inhibitors.
Pay attention to your symptoms and consult your doctor if you are having increasing nighttime awakenings and worsening daily symptoms.

, Make an effort to relax yourself as stress, anxiety and emotional upsets can trigger asthma and make it worse. Techniques including yoga, meditation, deep breathing, and progressive muscle relaxation may help alleviate your tension and stress and in turn reduce the risk of an asthma flare-up.Focusing on deepening your breath is one way to invoke the relaxation response to stress. Deep breathing encourages full oxygen exchange, which helps to slow the heartbeat and stabilize or even lower blood pressure. Begin by finding a quiet and comfortable place to sit or lie down. Take a normal breath or two to settle yourself. Then try a deep breath: breathe in slowly through your nose, allowing your chest and lower belly to expand as you fill your lungs. Let your abdomen expand fully. Now breathe out slowly through your mouth (or your nose, if that feels more natural). Try doing this for several minutes., Smoking cigarettes and similar products, even a little bit, can contribute to asthma and a variety of other severe health problems. Quitting smoking isn't easy, but doing so will have a dramatic positive effect on your health., Obesity can contribute to asthma and makes it more difficult to control existing asthma with exercise. If you are overweight, get yourself on a diet and exercise plan that will get you into a healthy range. Whether someone is overweight or obese is determined by using the body mass index (BMI), an indicator of body fatness. BMI is a person's weight in kilograms (kg) divided by the square of the person's height in meters (m). A BMI of 25-29.9 is considered overweight, while a BMI greater than 30 is considered obese.Reduce the number of calories you intake and increase the amount of exercise you do. This is the secret to weight loss.Watch portion sizes and make a concerted effort to eat slowly, savor and chew your food and stop eating when you are full. Remember that you just need to feel satiated, not stuffed to the brim.

, Research has shown that exercise has a positive impact on asthma and should be done as tolerated. Exercise can decrease the severity of asthma symptoms, although you need to be cautious to consider your asthma when planning an exercise regimen. If you have exercise-triggered asthma, be careful about exercising in cold or overly dry or humid environments. Activities that are better for people who suffer from exercise-induced asthma (EIB) include swimming, cycling, hiking and walking.Yoga is a good option for asthmatics because it both increases fitness and helps you learn to regulate and become more aware of your breath.If you want to play team sports, consider those with short bursts of activity (like baseball or football), rather than sports with longer spurts of activity like soccer, long-distance running or basketball.Use your inhaler if you are worried your workout is going to bring on an attack. In fact, it's a good idea to always bring your inhaler with you wherever you go, just in case – and this includes the gym or outdoors.

The major difference is that H1N1 is a variant influenza virus, meaning it is a variation of the influenza A virus that most commonly circulates among pigs and is rarely found in humans. H1N1, just like any other flu virus, can be very dangerous for at risk populations, but is no more or less dangerous than a regular seasonal flu virus.H1N1 cannot be spread by eating pork or pork products. H1N1 is spread from pigs to humans or from human-to-human contact.
If you show signs of the flu after contact with pigs, tell your healthcare provider.;
, Use a thermometer to assess your temperature. If you have a temperature of between 100.4 – 104°F (38 – 40°C) and some of the other flu-related symptoms, you may have the flu. About 80% of cases of H1N1 involve fever.It is important to note that sometimes people with the flu do not have a fever., Both influenza and H1N1 can present as very similar constellation of symptoms. If you are coughing, have a sore throat or a runny or stuffy nose, you may have H1N1. Chest discomfort can also be more severe with H1N1 than with seasonal flu.Sneezing is more common with a common cold and not the flu.

, As with any flu, body aches and headaches are common, as is fatigue. The level of discomfort varies from person to person whether they have seasonal flu or H1N1 flu.If on a scale of one to ten, with ten being the worst you've ever felt, you feel like you have pain levels from four to six, it is likely moderate pain. If it is above that range, it is likely severe., Chills are common with both the seasonal flu and H1N1. If you are experiencing chills along with other symptoms of H1N1, you may have H1N1. These are not readily distinguishable from the chills associated with seasonal flu., Gastrointestinal symptoms are common with both the seasonal flu and H1N1. Such symptoms include vomiting and diarrhea. If you have these symptoms, along with other symptoms, you may have H1N1., Only people who are hospitalized, are pregnant, or have weakened immune systems should get tested for H1N1. Because the type of flu you have does not usually change its treatment, there is little need for the H1N1 test specifically. Treatment does not differ whether you have seasonal flu or H1N1. Additionally, around 99% of cases of the flu during the 2009 season (when H1N1 was at its height) were H1N1., Most rapid test results are unable to distinguish between H1N1 and the seasonal flu. For more accurate results, it is necessary to wait for the lab test that takes several days; however, unless you are hospitalized, you may be well before you get the results., The more people who get the vaccine, the more immunity in the human population. So in other words, your vaccine helps prevent you and others from getting sick. It's best to get the vaccine early in the season if it is available, but even if you eventually get it toward the end of the season, it still helps., If you have an abrupt onset of fever, headache, chills, body aches, cough and fatigue see your healthcare provider as soon as possible. If you are diagnosed with the flu, antivirals are only effective if you start treatment within 48 hours of your symptom onset.

, CDC recommends that people with influenza-like illness remain at home until at least 24 hours after they are free of fever or signs of a fever without the use of fever reducing medications. This recommendation only applies to camps, schools, businesses, mass gatherings and other community settings. If you work in the healthcare setting, it is recommended that you should stay home for seven days from symptom onset or until the resolution of symptoms.Going out can spread the disease to vulnerable individuals, who could be hospitalized or even die. H1N1 isn’t unique in this: the regular flu harms the same vulnerable populations.

, Use warm water and antibacterial soap. This is especially important before you eat and after you sneeze or cough. Again, your actions help keep you and others from getting sick., It is important not to get dehydrated if you have the flu. It can lead to complications. You should stick to beverages that are easy on the stomach like water or herbal tea., Make sure you take it easy while you are healing. You will need your strength to get better. Don't push yourself to work while you're sick with the flu. It will likely extend the period of time you're sick."

If a child tells you directly that she “can’t breathe” or is having trouble breathing, don't ignore it! During milder phases of an asthma attack, the child may wheeze, although in the severe stages this may or may not be present.;
, A child having an asthma attack may also report chest pain or a tight feeling in the chest. Chest pain is common during asthma attacks because as air gets trapped in narrowed airways, the pressure in the chest can rise. Because the airway is constricted, you might also notice decreased breath sounds.

, A young child or one who's never had an attack before may not know how to describe or report shortness of breath or chest pain. Instead, she might panic and describe symptoms vaguely: ""I feel strange"" or ""sick."" Watch asthmatic children closely for observable clues of an attack, like shallow breathing or wheezing. Don't assume that a child is not having an asthma attack just because she doesn't report breathing trouble or chest pain.

, Infants and very small children (from birth through 6 years of age) have higher metabolisms. This, in turn, results in higher respiratory rates. Because children this age can't communicate symptoms well, observe their breathing closely. Any suspicion of abnormal breathing is enough to prompt further exploration of symptoms. The average breaths per minute in this age range can vary greatly, but the general guidelines are:Infant (birth–1 year) 30–60 breaths/min
Toddler (1–3 years) 24–40
Preschooler (3–6 years) 22–34

, Most children with asthma begin showing signs by the age of 5, when they will start reacting poorly to their asthma triggers.An asthma trigger is anything that can cause symptoms to flare up.Triggers can vary from child to child, so be aware of the things that can cause an attack for your child, especially when you suspect one coming on. Some triggers (like dust mites and pet fur) can be eliminated, but others (like air pollution) have to be monitored as best as possible. Common triggers include:Pet fur: either vacuum or damp-mop regularly to remove fur from your home.
Dust mites: use mattress and pillow covers to protect the child from dust mites, wash bedding often, avoid putting stuffed animals in your child's room, and avoid pillows or quilts that use down feathers.
Cockroaches: cockroaches and their droppings are a common asthma trigger. To discourage cockroaches in your home, don't leave food or water out. Sweep up all crumbs and food particles immediately, and clean the home regularly. Consult an exterminator for pest control advice.
Mold: mold is caused by humidity, so use a hygrometer to check how humid your home environment is. Use a dehumidifier to keep the environment moisture and mold-free.
Smoke: any smoke — from tobacco to wood smoke — can trigger an asthma attack. Even if you step outdoors to smoke, the smoke that lingers on your clothing and hair puts your child at risk.
Certain foods: Eggs, milk, peanuts, soy products, wheat, fish, shellfish, salads, and fresh fruits are all known to trigger asthma attacks in children who are allergic to them.Air pollution or extreme changes in weather

, Keeping the environment clean of asthma triggers might not be enough. When children get highly emotional — whether sad, happy, frightened, etc. — they are at a higher risk of asthma attack. Similarly, too much exercise might cause the child to get winded and take deep, gulping breaths that can trigger an asthma attack.

, Viral or bacterial upper or lower respiratory infections can trigger asthma attacks. Be sure to have your child evaluated by a pediatrician if she shows signs of a respiratory infection. She may need medication to manage the symptoms of the infection or to help it go away more quickly.


Be aware that antibiotics treat bacterial infections. Viral respiratory infections may need to be approached from a management perspective rather than a treatment perspective.

, A normal respiratory rate in an adult is generally no more than 20 breaths per minute. Depending on age, children can have faster resting respiratory rates. It's best to watch for any general signs of abnormally fast breathing.Children between 6-12 years should take about 18-30 breaths per minute.
Children 12-18 years should take about 12-20 breaths per minute.

, A child who is breathing normally mainly uses the diaphragm to breathe. A child having an asthma attack, though, may have to use other muscles in her effort to move more air. Look for signs that the child’s neck, chest, and stomach muscles are working harder than usual.


A child who is struggling to breathe might assume a hunched posture, with her arms braced on the knees or a table.If you notice this posture, the child may be having an asthma attack.

, Children having asthma attacks often make a soft whistling, vibrating sound when they breathe. This usually happens when they exhale, as air is forced through a narrowed passageway.You may be able to hear wheezing during both inhaling and exhaling. Note, though, that in mild attacks or early in severe attacks, you may only hear the wheezing when the child breathes out.

, Asthma is the most common cause of chronic childhood cough. Coughing causes the pressure in the airway to rise. This, in turn, forces narrowed airways open and temporarily allow better airflow. So while coughing helps the child breathe, it's a symptom of a larger problem. Children might also cough when the body tries to expel environmental triggers that may have caused the attack.A cough can also be a sign of a respiratory infection, which can trigger asthma.
Persistent night coughing is a common symptom of mild to moderate persistent asthma in children. However, if the child coughs repeatedly for a long time, she is probably having an attack.

, Retractions are a visible “pulling-in” between and just below the ribs or at the collarbone as the child breathes. They occur as the muscles work hard to pull air, but the air can’t move quickly enough to fill the space because of blocked airways.


If the retractions between the ribs seem mild, take your child to the doctor as soon as you can. If they are moderate to severe, call for emergency medical attention., When a child is working very hard to breathe, you will often notice the nostrils flaring. This is a particularly useful sign of an asthma attack in babies and very young children. Children of that age may not be able to report their symptoms or assume the hunched posture typical of older children.

, This happens in severe cases, when airways get so blocked that there isn't even enough airflow to produce wheezing. ""Silent chest"" calls for immediate emergency medical attention.The child may be so exhausted from the effort it takes to breathe that she can't expel carbon dioxide or take in enough oxygen.


Another sign that your child is not getting adequate oxygen and needs medical attention is if she is unable to speak in full sentences.

, A peak flow meter is a simple device used to measure the child's ""peak expiratory flow rate"" (PEFR). Take daily readings to figure out the child's normal PEFR. Abnormal readings will serve as early warning signs and help you predict asthma attacks. The normal ranges of PEFR depend on the age and height of the child; you should talk to your doctor about the numbers for each ""zone"" and what actions you should take if your child is in the red or yellow zone. As a general rule, though:80-100% of the child's personal best PEFR puts her in the ""green zone"" (lower risk of attack)
50-80% of her personal best puts the child in the ""yellow zone"" (moderate risk; continue to watch her and give her whatever care your doctor has prescribed for this zone.)
Less than 50% of her personal best means there's a high risk the child will suffer from an attack. Give her quick-relief medication and seek medical attention.

, Children having asthma attacks often struggle so hard to breathe that you'll be able to see it. If have any feeling that the child is struggling to breathe or that “something is wrong,” trust your instincts. Give the child her inhaler or other prescribed immediate relief medication and seek medical attention if possible.

, When children have asthma attacks, their bodies have to work hard just to breathe. As a result, the skin may appear sweaty or damp. But instead of looking flushed and pink as it would from exercise, it will appear pale or white during an asthma attack. Blood turns red only when exposed to oxygen, so if a child isn't getting enough oxygen, you won't see the pink flush of normal blood flow., If you notice a blue tinge to the skin, or if the lips and fingernails become blue, the child’s attack is very serious. She is severely oxygen-deprived and needs immediate medical help., If the child has had previous attacks, she likely has prescribed asthma medication, probably in the form of an inhaler. If so, administer that medication immediately in the case of an asthma attack. While inhalers are simple, you can still use them improperly and decrease their effectiveness. To correctly use an inhaler:


Remove the cap and shake the inhaler hard.
Prime the inhaler if necessary. If it's new or hasn't been used in a long time, release some of the medicine into the air before using it.
Have the child exhale completely, then inhale as you administer one puff of medication.
Ask the child to continue inhaling as slowly and as deeply as she can for 10 seconds.
Always use a spacer or chamber, which helps the medicine go into the lungs instead of the back of the throat, when using an inhaler for children. Ask your doctor about how to use it properly.

, The label will tell you if you have to wait before administering another dose. If using a β2-agonist such as albuterol, wait a full minute before giving the child another dose. If not a β2-agonist, you may not have to wait before giving a second dose.

, You should see results within minutes of using the inhaler. If not, you may choose to give the child more medication. Use the individual dosing recommendation found on the inhaler's label or follow your physician's advice, which may include additional puffs right away. If symptoms don't get better with medication, you need to seek medical attention.

, Mild symptoms may include coughing, wheezing, or mildly increased work with breathing.Contact your pediatrician if the attack is mild, but symptoms don't improve with medication. The doctor may want to treat the child in the office or provide you with more specific instructions.

, ""Silent chest"" or blue lips and fingernails suggest the child isn't getting enough oxygen. A child with those symptoms needs immediate treatment to avoid the possibility of brain damage or death.If you have asthma medication for the child, you can administer it on the way to the emergency room. But don't delay in taking the child to the emergency room.
Delayed emergency treatment during a severe attack can cause permanent brain damage and even death.
Call 911 immediately if your child has a blue color that does not go away with medication or that moves beyond just the lips or fingernails.
Call 911 immediately if your child loses consciousness or is difficult to rouse.

, If your child's asthma was triggered by a food allergy, insect sting, or medication, call 911. These types of reactions can progress quickly and lead to closed airways.

, The doctor will recognize the signs and symptoms of asthma. Once the child arrives at the ER, medical staff will give her oxygen if needed and may administer more medication. If the asthma attack is severe, they may give the child corticosteroids through an IV. Most patients will improve under expert care, and you'll be able to take them home soon. But, if the child doesn't improve within several hours, they may keep her in the hospital overnight.


The doctor may perform a chest x-ray, pulse oximetry, or draw blood.

Colds are unlikely to lead to severe symptoms such as high fever or crippling headache.Usually people experience cold symptoms 2-3 days after infection: this means that by the time your throat is sore, you already have a cold. However, it is possible to shorten the duration and minimize the symptoms of a cold by knowing immediately when you are symptomatic. Common symptoms of the cold include:


Cough
Stuffy nose
Runny nose
Sore throat
Minor headache
Minor body aches
Low-grade fever
Sneezing
Watery eyes;
, In most cases, colds clear up on their own or with the help of home remedies. However, sometimes colds can lead to more severe infections that require medical treatment. This is more likely to occur in children than in adults.Be sure to take yourself or your child to the doctor if you notice:


High or persistent fever
Dehydration or inability to drink liquids
Severe headache
Stiff neck (could indicate meningitis)
Difficulty breathing
Earache or ringing in the ears
Vomiting

, As soon as you feel initial cold symptoms come on, take steps to keep the cold from worsening. Otherwise, you might be stuck with cold symptoms for a week.Treat pre-cold symptoms such as sore throat, tiredness, or runny nose as a sign that you need to begin taking care of yourself.

, Staying hydrated is one of the keys to minimizing the effects of a cold.Drink eight to ten glasses of hydrating liquid each day.Hydration strengthens the immune system and also minimizes the symptoms of nasal stuffiness and sore throat. If you keep hydrated, your mucus will be thinner and easier to flush out of your system.Avoid alcohol and caffeine. Stick to water and herbal tea if at all possible. Alcohol and caffeine will make it more difficult to stay hydrated., Most adults get one to two colds each year. However, you are much more likely to catch a cold — and to have a cold that lasts — if you get less than eight hours of sleep per night.If you feel a cold coming on, be sure that you give yourself extra time to sleep so that you can keep your immune system healthy.If you can manage 12 hours of rest during the pre-cold period, that is even better.Many over-the-counter cold medications are not recommended if you want to prevent a cold from worsening. However, if your cold symptoms are keeping you awake at night, you might want to take medication so that your sleep is undisturbed. For example, if you have a persistent cough that prevents you from getting your needed rest, consider taking a cough syrup with benadryl to make sure you sleep through the night.

, Stress can weaken the immune system and make it more difficult to combat a cold.If you are in the pre-cold stages, take active steps to minimize the stress in your life. These might include:


Practicing mindfulness
Meditating
Taking deep breaths
Writing your stressful thoughts down in a journal

, Colds can often reduce a patient's appetite. However, it is necessary to eat a balanced diet in order to keep the immune system strong and healthy.Stick to whole grain foods that are rich in fiber as well as antioxidant-rich vegetables and fruits in order to combat colds more quickly.Some excellent foods to eat include:Blueberries
Dark, leafy greens
Red bell peppers
Squash
Yogurt

, Not only is chicken noodle soup excellent comfort food, but it has also been shown to help fight colds. Soups are also a terrific way to keep hydrated. Moreover, chicken noodle soup can both soothe a sore throat and reduce congestion.Find a recipe that is rich in vegetables and low in salt in order to keep yourself well balanced.

, Exercise can help prevent colds, but it might make you worse once you've been infected with the common cold virus.Stay away from exercise and too much activity if at all possible.Give yourself a few days to rest from your training program, and let your body work on fighting the cold instead of improving muscle tone.


If possible you should also stay home from work or school. This will allow your body to rest as well as prevent the risk of infecting your colleagues., Studies are not conclusive, but zinc lozenges may be able to reduce the severity of the common cold. They might also shorten the duration of a cold by a day or so.Be sure that you follow all instructions on the package so that you do not experience any adverse effects from the zinc lozenges.


Be aware that zinc lozenges may cause side effects such as a bad taste in the mouth. Do not use zinc nasal sprays since they might affect your ability to smell.Avoid zinc pills. Too much zinc can upset your stomach, and taking a zinc pills is an easy way to overdo it. The usual oral intake of zinc is 4 mg/day.

, Echinacea is a controversial herbal remedy that may or may not help you fight off a cold. Some studies show that echinacea can reduce the duration of a cold by half a day or so.Echinacea is likely more effective at reducing the severity of cold symptoms than it is at preventing a cold in the first place.Be sure that you consult a physician before taking echinacea, especially if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, have chronic problems with your immune system, or are taking other medications.The recommended dose varies by manufacturer, but you should take about 300 – 400 mg of dry extract three times daily.

, Keeping your body warm can help encourage your immune system to fight infection. Keep warm compresses handy, take a warm shower, wear warm clothing, and use a blanket to keep yourself nice and toasty., There is evidence, however, that Vitamin C can reduce the length of a cold by 8% once symptoms begin.Vitamin C might be especially effective for high-risk groups, such as schoolchildren in the winter months.It is important, however, that you do not overdose yourself with Vitamin C, and always speak to a doctor before taking any supplements or over-the-counter medications.

, Probiotics are microorganisms that improve gut health and that might have a healthy effect on the immune system.Probiotic supplements can be found in most health food stores. They might be able to reduce the length of a cold by 2 days.While it is unclear the extent to which probiotics might prevent colds, there are very few adverse effects from taking probiotics., Honey can help suppress coughs naturally, and it also has antibiotic properties. Putting one to two teaspoons of honey in your tea can help a sore throat from worsening. It can also ease the pain of a sore throat and make it easier for you to stay hydrated.If you hate tea or other hot beverages, try taking a spoonful of honey. Honey by itself has properties that help prevent coughing.Do not give honey to infants, and consult your physician if you are pregnant or breastfeeding about whether honey is safe for you to consume., A salt water rinse not only reduces throat inflammation but might also be able to get nasty viruses out of your system.There are also no adverse effects from a salt water rinse. Simply mix 1/2 teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water. Take a sip of the salt water, gargle for 15 seconds or so, then spit. Repeat as necessary in order to get the full benefits of the salt water rinse., Hot and warm beverages can help thin the mucus in your throat, which will allow you to flush toxins more easily. They can also be incredibly soothing to a sore or scratchy throat. Moreover, hot beverages might be easier to drink than cold beverages during your pre-cold period, which will encourage you to stay healthy and hydrated.For maximum benefit, the hot beverages should be hydrating and should not have caffeine or alcohol. Try drinking:


Herbal teas
Hot water with lemon and/or honey
Clear broths

, Cigarette smoke can exacerbate a sore throat as well as weaken the immune system. Smoking can also dry out the throat, which makes it harder for the mucus membranes in your throat to fight infection. Stay away from cigarettes and secondhand smoke if you feel a cold coming on., Nobody likes having a runny nose. However, flushing out mucus and phlegm is an important way for your body to get rid of toxins or harmful infections. Resist the urge to keep yourself blocked up. Instead, assist your body in expelling as much mucus, snot, and phlegm as possible. You will recover more quickly.

, Decongestants might help temporarily clear your nose and head. However, these medications might also cause ""rebound effects"" that actually prolong the symptoms of a cold.You should only resort to these medications if they are absolutely necessary to your comfort, your ability to breathe, or your ability to sleep. Otherwise, you are better off using other methods of keeping your passages clear., The steam can loosen the mucus in your nose.Breathe in deeply during a long, hot shower. Be sure to keep the bathroom doors and windows closed, and do not turn on a fan during the shower. You want to keep the room as warm and steamy as possible.

, Spicy foods can encourage your nose to run, which can help your body rid itself of virus-filled snot and mucus.Some studies have also shown the immune-boosting effects of spices such as turmeric and fenugreek, which are often found in spicy foods such as curries., Saline nasal sprays can be found at most drugstores and grocery stores. By inserting a nozzle into your nostril and squeezing the bulb, the saline solution reaches deep inside your nasal cavity, breaking up blockages. This will allow your passages to clear and will help your body expel any irritants that might be worsening your cold symptoms., Keeping your mucus membranes moist is essential to preventing infection and to staying comfortable while dealing with a respiratory illness. A vaporizer helps keep the air in your room from drying out, especially during winter months when your heater is on. Use a vaporizer when you feel symptoms coming on, and use the vaporizer every night while sleeping. Follow all instructions for using a vaporizer properly to ensure that molds and bacteria do not enter the vaporizer., Keep facial tissues handy, and blow your nose often when you feel cold symptoms begin.Don't blow too hard to prevent the possibility of ear infection. If you are finding it difficult to blow your nose, use a nasal spray solution to break up any blockages in your nasal passages.

, Your body will more effectively drain its passages when you remain upright. It is especially difficult for your body to rid itself of mucus while you are lying down to sleep. Use an extra pillow or two to keep your head and neck propped up in bed to promote the healing process., A vapor rub can help those with colds or those who feel a cold coming on to continue breathing properly. Rub a small amount of the vapor rub on your chest and back. This is especially helpful to do before bedtime to make sure your body gets the rest it needs to fight infection. Do not use a vapor rub on your nostrils. "

Vacuum your bedroom once a week.,
Dust your bedroom once a week.,
Remove carpeting from your bedroom.,
Wash window coverings regularly.,
Reduce clutter.,
Keep walls free of adornment.,
Keep your pets out of your bedroom.",How to Make Your Bedroom Asthma Friendly1," Use a vacuum that employs a HEPA filter or another small-pore, multi-layered vacuum bag designed to help trap allergens. Vacuums with motorized heads are also recommended, as they are better at capturing the dust that the vacuum agitates. Be sure to get into every nook and cranny in your room each time you vacuum.Vacuum any carpeted areas in your home twice a week, making sure to slowly vacuum the entire surface. If someone who is not asthmatic is able to do so for you, have them do so when you are not around. If you must do the vacuuming yourself, wear a face mask while you do so.
If you have the option, get rid of the carpeting and have hardwood floors in your bedroom.;
, Ideally, use a damp microfiber cloth to dust every hard horizontal surface in the room. The dampness of the cloth helps you capture particles, as opposed to simply agitating them back into the air.Don't forget hidden and hard to reach spots. For instance, if you keep items on shelves, remove them to dust behind them — and dust the item itself, too.

, Carpeting, especially wall-to-wall carpeting, should be removed from any room in which an asthmatic person sleeps. In fact, you may want to remove wall-to-wall carpeting from your entire home, as carpeting is a haven for the allergens that can trigger your asthma. Replace with wood, vinyl, or tile flooring, and mop the floor weekly.Wash any small rugs once a week in hot water.

, Any window coverings you use in your bedroom should be easy to remove and wash. Simple coverings that do not need to be dry cleaned are ideal. Wash in hot water.Remove blinds from your bedroom, as they are especially proficient at catching and collecting dust.
Avoid coverings with heavy material or deep folds, such as Venetian blinds.

, Remove anything upholstered — such as furniture or pillows — from your bedroom. Further, do not use your bedroom for storage. Boxes of knickknacks and stacks of books often collect particles that can trigger your asthma. Even picture frames and houseplants are best kept in another room.Do not leave piles of clothes around your room.
If there is a closet in your bedroom, use it only for clothing. Always dust and vacuum the closet whenever cleaning the bedroom.
Never hang clothes in your bedroom or closet before they are fully dry.

, Anything hung on the wall of your bedroom risks gathering dust and other potential triggers. This includes things like frames, wreaths, tapestries, and even posters. Structural adornments such as shelves are particularly problematic, as they are effectively dust collectors. In short, the less on your walls, the better., Not only may your pet be a source of asthma triggers, they may also carry triggers into your bedroom. Pet dander also provides ample food for dust mites. Put their bed outside your room and never allow them on your bed.Brush and groom your pets outdoors and wash them weekly.

Find out what triggers your asthma.,
Make lifestyle changes.,

Take your medication.,
Drink coffee.,
Change your toothpaste.,
Exercise!",How to Reduce Asthma Triggers at Home," The best way to reduce asthma triggers is to find out what your triggers are. Don't purposely put yourself at risk of an asthma attack if you think that something may trigger it. Instead, think back to times when your asthma started to flare up. Is there any relationship between all of the events? Maybe your asthma mainly occurred in a specific part of the day, or a specific environment. Some asthma triggers include smoke, allergies or change in temperature.;
, Now you know what triggers your asthma, you can start to make changes that will help you reduce your asthma triggers. For example, if your asthma is triggered by smoke you could do your best to avoid smoking areas by taking a different route. Or if your asthma is triggered by allergies, before going out you could take some medicine to help your allergies.

, If you want your asthma to improve, then you obviously need to take your medication. However not everyone remembers, so one tip to remember to take your medication would be to put it somewhere where you go everyday. For example, maybe you could put it near your mirror or in the bathroom., This may seem very odd, but a recent study shows that the caffeine in coffee reduces respiratory muscle fatigue, which can help with wheezing and shortness of breath for up to 4 hours!, Again this does seem very strange, but sometimes certain toothpaste ingredients can trigger asthma. It is quite hard to tell whether your toothpaste is making your asthma worse, but it doesn't hurt to try and see whether it makes a difference!

, Almost everyone has been told that exercise helps asthma, which is partly true. Exercise does help you to become fitter and be able to control your breathing easier, but what people with asthma don't know is that in some cases exercise can actually make asthma worse, as it is also a trigger for asthma. However if you are wanting to exercise and you have asthma, the best thing to do is start of slowly and build yourself up, as this will help you to be able to control your breathing.

Select bedding and pillows made from synthetic materials.,
Sleep on a bed with wooden or metal frames.,
Wash and dry bedding in hot water.,
Use mite-proof covers.",How to Make Your Bedroom Asthma Friendly2," Feather, wool, foam, and down pillows and blankets are rife with potential asthma triggers. Sheets and pillows should be made with Dacron or another synthetic fiber., The more soft materials in your bedroom, the more surfaces where dust and dust mites can settle. You may even be able to forego a box spring by employing a solid frame that fully supports your mattress.Avoid using a headboard, as this would be another surface where dust might collect.

, Every other week, wash all of your bedding in water that is at least 130°F (54.4°C). Cold water will not kill dust mites. Dry bedding on high heat as well. Never line dry your bedding outdoors, as it may collect pollen that could trigger your asthma.If children regularly sleep in your room, wash and dry any stuffed animal companions in the same manner, once a week. Alternatively, seal the stuffed animal in a plastic bag and place it in the freezer for at least five hours to kill dust mites.

, Get a mite proof cover for your pillows, your mattress, and even your box spring. You can find these covers at home goods stores or online. While these covers do not need to be washed, wipe them down with your sheets each time you remove the sheets for cleaning.Covers may be labeled either “dust proof” or “mite proof,” and seal around each item via zipper. If your asthma is especially sensitive to dust mites, tape over the zippers with electrical or duct tape.

Never allow smoking in your home.,
Heat your home with an electric or gas furnace.,
Air condition with window units or central air.,
Use a dehumidifier.",How to Make Your Bedroom Asthma Friendly3," You probably know this one already. Smoke is an extremely common cause of asthma attacks. Don’t allow smoking of any type, anywhere in your home. Similarly, don’t light incense or anything else that produces smoke either., Be sure to change the air filter on the furnace once a month. Add filters to the furnace outlets in your bedroom, and change them biweekly. You can use about ten layers of muslin or cheesecloth to make your own filter for this purpose.Wood stoves and kerosene heaters can create asthma triggers, especially when used in your bedroom.

, Whichever type of air conditioning you use, be sure to change and/or clean filters monthly. Avoid using fans of any type in your room, as they may keep asthma triggers suspended in the air. Keep bedroom windows closed, especially during seasons where you’re asthma is triggered outdoors., Especially if you live in a home with a basement, it can help to run a dehumidifier, especially during more humid parts of the year. Since dust mites are more prevalent in high humidity, keep your home below 50% humidity.Avoid using a humidifier, especially in your bedroom, as this can contribute to both mold and increased dust mites, both of which might trigger your asthma.

Speak to your doctor.,
Use a medical sauna or hyperthermia unit.,
Cut down on fever-reducing drugs.",How to Induce a Fever1," If you decide that you want to try to induce a fever the first thing you should do is speak to a medical professional. Make an appointment to see your doctor and ask her about how to induce a fever. Your doctor will advise on the potential benefits and dangers of artificially inducing a fever and what your options are. Sometimes drugs induce a fever when they are taken, but this generally is considered an adverse response akin to an allergic reaction.Immunizations, such as diphtheria and tetanus, may induce a fever.The drugs work by increasing metabolism or evoking an immune response. Drug-induced fevers can cause other symptoms as well.
Doctors who do use this option might use Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), a tuberculosis vaccine.If your doctor advises you not to try to induce a fever you should listen to her. Do not attempt to induce a fever against your doctor's advice.;
, Look for a medical centre or centre of alternative medicine that actively uses fever therapy. These sources will usually be equipped with an infrared sauna unit, also known as a hyperthermia unit. Follow the instructions provided at the centre when using this unit to induce a fever. Usually, you will be instructed to warm yourself internally before using the unit. You might be asked to drink ginger root tea or to take ginger root and cayenne pepper capsules.


Before entering the unit, you will undress and cover the skin in an herbal formula, often containing ginger.
Wrap yourself in towels then enter the unit. A standard session lasts for 60 minutes, but if you are not demonstrating any negative reaction, your session may last for two to three hours.
You will need to drink water during the process, especially if undergoing a longer session.
If you do not sweat within the first 10 minutes or otherwise experience a negative reaction, the session will end early.
After a successful session, you'll undergo a warm to cool shower to close your pores.

, As the debates about the potential benefits of fevers continues, some doctors are advising that people limit their use of fever-reducing drugs, such as aspirin. By using these drugs with discretion you will enable a moderate fever to run its course which can prompt your body's own immunological defences to activate.


The endogenous pyrogen hormone will travel to the brain and prompt a rise in your body's temperature.
Rapid muscle contractions may also be triggered, which will produce heat. Nerves may constrict outlying blood vessels, resulting in a reduction of heat lost to the environment.
Body tissues may be broken down to produce heat.
The sensation of coldness can prompt you on put on extra layers of clothes or drink hot fluids which will help to raise your temperature."

Understand the symptoms of a stomach virus or flu.,
Assess whether you have a stomach virus.,
Contact your doctor if your illness is very extreme or persists for a long period of time.,
Know when to get emergency care.,
Be aware that dehydration can be more life-threatening in certain people.",How to Know if You Have a Stomach Virus," This illness affects each area of the gastrointestinal tract. Its symptoms can include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and general malaise. You may have one or all of the symptoms if you have a stomach virus.


The illness is self limited, meaning the virus usually runs its course in 2-3 days.This means that you should have physical symptoms for under a week.;
, Have you come into contact with someone who has a stomach virus? Do you have any of the symptoms of a stomach virus? If your symptoms are mild-moderate nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, you most likely have a garden variety stomach flu caused by the three most common viral pathogens, norwalk, rotavirus, or adenovirus.


Those suffering from this type of stomach virus usually do not need medical care in order to recover unless two things are present: you have severe or localized abdominal pain (this could indicate appendicitis, pancreatitis or other serious medical conditions) or you have the signs of dehydration, which are feeling faint or lightheaded, especially upon rising, or racing pulse.
In infants and children decreased tear production, decreased wet diapers, sunken skull, and skin tenting (if you pinch the skin it hold the shape) are all signs of dehydration.

, This is especially important if your symptoms don't lessen over time. Call a doctor or visit a clinic if you're experiencing the following symptoms:


Increased or constant vomiting for more than a day
Fever over 101 °F (38 °C)
Diarrhea for more than 2 days
Weight loss
Decreased urine production
Confusion
Weakness, Dehydration can become a serious medical issue. If you experience the following symptoms of severe dehydration, visit an emergency room or call for emergency services immediately.


Fever higher than 103 °F (39 °C)
Confusion
Sluggishness (lethargy)
Seizures
Difficulty breathing
Chest or abdominal pains
Fainting
No urine in the last 12 hours., Infants and toddlers are at an increased risk complications such as of dehydration as are diabetics, the elderly or those with HIV.Babies and children are at a higher risk of severe dehydration than adults.

Follow your veterinarian's treatment suggestions.,
Do not smoke anything around your cat.,
Control your cat's weight with diet and exercise.,
Use unscented products.",How to Spot and Treat Feline Asthma," When asthma for cats flare up, the cat's lungs swell and constrict. This can make breathing difficult for the cat. However, because cats tend to hide any ailments they have, it may be hard to spot this problem. If your cat shows any of these symptoms, it could possibly have asthma.Persistent coughing
Wheezing
Lethargy
Persistent gagging
Open-mouthed breathing
A crouched position while wheezing or coughing;
, Cats are not typically born with asthma, as it is thought to be caused by an immune response to allergens the cat inhales. Your cat may develop asthma at between 1 and 8 years old, however most cats are diagnosed between the ages of 4 and 5. Pay closer attention to your cat in these years if you feel it is at risk for asthma.Of course, you can't spend every waking moment observing your cat in these years. However, if you suspect your cat is at risk of asthma, it is most likely to crop up in these years.

, If you suspect your cat to have feline asthma, take it to be seen a veterinarian. The veterinarian will do a thorough exam and will pay special attention to your cat's respiratory system. Do not try to self diagnose if you do not have the credentials to do so. You may end up diagnosing wrong ailment and, by extension, treating it incorrectly.

, While there is not one specific test for diagnosing asthma, there are a variety of tests that your veterinarian will use in combination to come to come up with a diagnosis. By using radiographs, bronchoscopy, and computed tomography, in combination with tests of cells from your cat's lungs, the veterinarian will be able to see the state of your cat's lungs and the extent of its condition.A bronchoscopy is a procedure that is used to view the inside of your cat's airway. It will allow the veterinarian to examine all the parts of the cat's respiratory system.
Computed tomography, commonly called a CT scan, is a detailed imaging process that gives detailed images of parts of the body.

, Depending on the extent of your cat's condition, treatment will vary. Your veterinarian may prescribe corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and make it easier for the cat to breath. However, these are not typically used for long-term treatment. They may also prescribe bronchodilators, which open up the airway and are commonly used to control asthma.Your veterinarian may give your cat a dose of the medications they prescribe right away. After that first dose, it will be your responsibility to continue its treatment at home.
Both corticosteroids and bronchodilators come in a variety of different forms. Your cat may be prescribed an oral, inhaled, or injected medication.

, Smoking around a cat with asthma can may make their condition worse and it could even be fatal to a cat with severe asthma. Because it is believed that asthma in cats is caused by environmental allergens, smoking around your cat could cause your cat to develop this condition. Thus, even if your cat doesn't have asthma, it is a bad idea to smoke around it., Excess weight can make your cat's asthma worse, as obesity alone can diminish your cat's respiratory health. It can increase your cat's blood pressure and put unnecessary stress on its respiratory system. In order to avoid this, be sure not to over-feed your cat and make sure that it gets daily exercise.Play with your cat often to give it consistent exercise. This does not need to be strenuous exercise, but it should get your cat's blood flowing and its respiratory system engaged. Having it exercise in this way will strengthen it's lungs and improve its breathing over time.
However, be careful to not overexert your cat. Keep an eye on it and if you see signs that it is having trouble breathing, discontinue your activity.

, Scented litter should not be used for cats with asthma. Also eliminate the use of scented home products, such as perfume, air fresheners, and hairspray if you have a cat with asthma.


If you need to freshen the air in your home, consider using a non-scented air purifier instead of scented products. This will have the added benefit of clearing pollen out of your home in addition to freshening it up.

Prepare a Schlenz bath at home.,
Try an alternate form of bath therapy.,
Try g-tummo meditation.,
Exercise to increase body temperature.",How to Induce a Fever2," Also known as an ""overheating bath,"" this centuries-old technique works by stimulating the body's natural immunological response.You can take a bath at a professional Schlenz centre, but the process is simple enough to do at home. Before the bath, drink one or two cups of hot herbal tea, such as ginger, lemon balm, peppermint, elder, or goldenrod tea. If you have a weak heart, add several drops of Crataegisan to the tea to reduce the potential risk brought about by the hot bath.


Fill the bathtub with hot water. Keep the temperature between 97 and 98°F (36 and 37°C).
Submerge your entire body. If you cannot fit your entire body into the tub, bend your knees so that you head is submerged. Make sure that your nose and mouth remain out of the water so that you can breathe without any problems.
You should not allow the water temperature to drop during the process. Add more hot water, as needed, to maintain the heat. Allow the water to reach a temperature of 100.4°F (38°C) with each addition.
Remain in the bath for about half an hour. Have another person help you out of the water if you feel faint or dizzy getting out., Aside from the traditional Schlenz bath, there are other hot bath therapies you can use to induce a fever. One technique, which has been claimed to have cancer-fighting qualities, requires you to draw a hot bath, making the water as hot as you can comfortably stand. Do not scorch yourself. Mix in 2-1/4 lbs (1000 g) Epsom salts. Soak as much of your body as possible in the bath. Stay in there for a full 20 to 25 minutes, adding more hot water as needed to maintain a constant source of heat. Sip on ginger root tea during the bath to heat the body from the inside as you heat your body from the outside using the bath water.


Be careful when getting out of the bath. If you feel faint or dizzy, ask for someone else's assistance.
Dry off naturally instead of drying yourself with a towel.
Spread a sheet of plastic over your bed to protect it from getting wet and lie down, covering yourself with as many blankets as possible.
Stay there for three to eight hours. You will sweat a lot and should stay in bed until the fever breaks.
Usually, the fever will go away after six to eight hours.
You can repeat this once a week for as many as six to eight weeks., A specific kind of meditation associated with Tibetan monks has been cited as a way to increase body temperature and potentially induce a fever. Scientific analysis has shown that g-tummo meditation can help raise body temperature to the temperature zone of a slight or moderate fever. The rise in body temperature has been observed during the Forceful Breath vase breathing element of the meditation, and the length of time the temperature can be sustained appears to depend on the neurocognitive element (meditative visualisation) of the meditation.Find an expert instructor and ask him or her to guide you through the practice.
The Forceful Breath vase breathing technique can be practised at home to help to regulate your body temperature.Vase breathing is essentially breathing in clean air and then exhaling around 85% of that air. This breathing helps create a vase shape in your lower abdomen.
It can be coupled with visualisation, such as picturing flames travelling up your spine.

, Exercise and strenuous physical activity increase your core body temperature. Doing a tough workout on a hot day, or wearing layers of clothing will make it harder for your body to cool down and lose heat. Your core temperature could rise by a few degrees.You should take care when exercising or you could induce a number of heat-related illnesses, including heat cramps and heat exhaustion.


Some athletes, wrestlers for instance, wear extra layers of clothes even plastic bags and do cardiovascular activities like running and lifting. These athletes also go into the sauna with this apparel on in order to elevate their body temperatures and lose water weight while flushing out their systems.
Be sure to drink plenty of fluids to avoid becoming dehydrated.
Be aware of symptoms of heat-illnesses such as dizziness, nausea, heart rhythm problems, and visual problems.
If you experience any of these symptoms stop immediately, cool down and recover."

Serve yourself some brown rice.,
Eat ice cream.,
Use cayenne pepper.,
Consume more coconut oil.,
Eat more peanuts.,
Get more ginger into your diet.",How to Induce a Fever3," A side of brown rice with every meal, or at least with every dinner, can cause your body temperature to rise within a matter of days. As a complex carbohydrate, brown rice gives your digestive system a challenge. The extra work your system uses in the digestive process heats you up inside. Note that other whole grains, like quinoa and buckwheat, can also have a similar effect., Eating one serving of ice cream each day can gradually cause your core temperature to increase over a span of several weeks. The shock of cold your system receives forces it to heat up to prevent your temperature from dropping. Additionally, foods that contain fat, protein, and carbohydrates heat up the body more as your digestive system processes them.


Fat moves especially slow through your digestive system, forcing your body to warm up as it works more., Add as little as 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) of cayenne pepper to your food each day. If the heat is too much to handle in one sitting, spread it out by only adding a dash of cayenne pepper to your food at each meal. Cayenne pepper contains an especially hot compound known as capsaicin. This compound is responsible for the initial burst of heat you experience when eating cayenne pepper, but this burst of heat is not responsible for the change in body temperature.


The digestive process your body undergoes when processing capsaicin is what causes the spike in your temperature.
While it is not certain, jalapeno and habanero peppers may have a similar effect., Coconut oil is a medium chain triglyceride (MCT) that aids in elevating core body temperature and metabolism. MCTs are known to increase metabolism and enhance weight loss. Instead of being stored as fat it is converted to energy, thereby increasing body temperature. This may be beneficial to people that have low thyroid function. Further, coconut oil may have antiviral properties and may help people with diabetes stabilize their blood glucose., Peanut are a good source of protein and fatty acids. Peanuts also have a lot of niacin. Niacin is a B vitamin that is responsible for respiration and metabolism at the cellular level. When consumed, niacin causes a flushing that leads to an elevation in temperature. Peanuts also have antioxidant properties and can rev up a sluggish circulatory system., Eating a thumb-sized piece of raw ginger can give your body temperature a quick spike. If eating it does not appeal to you, though, you could also make a tea by boiling the same sized piece in water for five to 10 minutes. Ginger increases digestive activity, thereby increasing body temperature.


Other root vegetables may help somewhat, as well. If ginger does not appeal to you, try carrots, beets, or sweet potatoes."

Drink plenty of warm fluids.,
Take steamy baths and showers.,
Consider oil pulling.,
Use a neti pot to irrigate your sinuses.,
Blow your nose correctly.,
Use a humidifier.",How to Get Rid of a Cold Naturally Fast1," Drinking warm fluids helps to loosen the secretions in your sinuses so that your mucus flows more freely, making you feel better faster. Studies show that drinking warm fluids relieves cold symptoms such as runny nose, cough, sneezing, sore throat, and fatigue.Hot, non-caffeinated tea will do the trick. Stick with a herbal tea like chamomile or peppermint to rehydrate yourself. Adding some honey and lemon will soothe your throat and help the effects last a little longer. Chamomile is good for reducing stress and fatigue, while peppermint relieves nasal congestion.
Japanese Benifuuki green tea may help reduce nasal congestion and allergic symptoms when drunk regularly.The traditional herbal tea “Throat Coat” has been shown to be much better at relieving sore throat pain than regular teas.Hot broth is also a good choice when you have a cold. Drink vegetable or chicken broth in large quantities, but look for low-sodium broths to avoid consuming too much salt. Chicken soup can help soothe a sore throat and loosen mucus to ease congestion.If you're a coffee lover, there's no need to avoid it. Drinking coffee has been shown to increase alertness among those with colds. Children should still avoid caffeine.Warm water, tea, and broth should be the main fluids you take in, as too much caffeine can dehydrate you.
Avoid alcohol. It may make nasal congestion and swelling worse.;
, Steam moisturizes your nasal passages so they feel less irritated, and the relaxing effect will help ease your cold symptoms.Draw yourself a hot bath and soak, or start each day during the duration of your cold with a nice, hot shower so you benefit from plenty of steam.You may even find a mentholated “shower bomb” helpful to relieve congestion.









For a quick steam treatment, you can heat up a pot of water just shy of boiling. When it starts producing quite a lot of steam, remove the pot from the heat and place it on a stable surface such as a table or countertop.
Lean your head over the pot, but don’t get too close to the steam or the water or you may get burned. Cover your head with a light cotton towel. Inhale the steam for 10 minutes.You can use this treatment two to four times per day.Adding a few drops of essential oil to the water is a good way to further decongest your sinuses and get the benefits of aromatherapy.Try peppermint oil to help relieve sinus headaches.Eucalyptus oil helps relieve nasal congestion.Do not use tea tree oil, as it is toxic when consumed., Oil pulling is an Ayurvedic remedy that uses oil to remove germs and bacteria from your mouth. Most microorganisms adhere to the fat in oil, allowing you to spit them out along with the oil.








Use coconut oil. Coconut oil has anti-bacterial properties and also contains lauric acid, an anti-microbial agent.Use organic, cold-pressed oil. Sesame and sunflower oil will also work, but coconut oil has additional anti-microbial properties (and also tastes more pleasant).
Take a tablespoonful of oil and swish it in your mouth for at least one minute. The longer you swish, the more bacteria you will remove. Swirl the oil around your mouth, suck it through your teeth, and make sure to get it onto your gums too.
Don’t swallow the oil. If you have trouble swishing the oil without swallowing, spit a little out.
After swishing the oil around, spit the oil into a trash can. (Spitting it into the sink could clog your pipes.) Rinse out your mouth with lukewarm water., A neti pot is designed to flush the mucus from your sinuses and relieve cold symptoms for several hours through a process called nasal irrigation. A saline solution is poured into one nostril, and it carries mucus out the other. Neti pots are available at most drug stores and health food shops.








Start with one irrigation a day while you have symptoms. As you feel better, you can increase it to twice daily.

Make a saline solution or buy one from the store. To make your own solution, combine ¼ tsp of kosher or pickling salt, ¼ tsp of baking soda, and eight ounces of warm distilled or boiled water. It’s important to use distilled water, or water that’s been boiled and cooled, because tap water may contain parasites or amoebas.
Fill the neti pot with four ounces of the saline solution. Stand over a sink or work in the shower or bathtub to prevent messes. Tilt your head at about a 45-degree angle.Hold the spout of the neti pot to the upper nostril. Tip the pot to pour the saline solution into one nostril and let it flow out the other. Repeat with the other nostril.

, While it's important to blow your nose while you have a cold to help keep your sinuses clear, don't blow too explosively. The pressure from blowing hard can impact your ears, giving you an earache on top of your cold.Be sure to blow gently, and only as often as necessary.









Doctors recommend that you blow by holding a finger over one nostril and gently blowing the other into a tissue.
Wash your hands each time you blow your nose. This will eliminate bacteria and viruses on your hands that could cause other infections (or spread infection to others).

, If the air in your home is too dry, it can worse your cold symptoms and make them last longer. Use a humidifier to keep the air moist, which will keep your nasal passages lubricated and make it easier to drain mucus. Run a humidifier at night to help ease your breathing.









Make sure to regularly clean your humidifier. Mold and mildew can grow easily in damp environments.
You can also release moisture into the air by boiling two cups of distilled water in a pot. Use distilled water to avoid any trace impurities from further agitating your cold.
Houseplants act as natural humidifiers. Their flowers, leaves, and stems release water vapor into the air. They also clean the air of carbon dioxide and other pollutants.Good choices include aloe vera, bamboo palm, weeping fig, Chinese evergreen, and various species of philodendron and dracaena.

Do not use elderberry for a prolonged time without consulting with your doctor. You should talk with your doctor before taking elderberry, as it may present side effects for pregnant women, people with autoimmune disease, and people with low blood pressure. People who take diabetes medication, laxatives, chemotherapy drugs, or immunosuppressants should also consult with a doctor before using elderberry.
Do not use unripe or uncooked elderberries. They are poisonous., Eucalyptus has antioxidant properties that protect against free radicals, molecules that can damage cells. The active ingredient in eucalyptus is cineole, a compound that works as an expectorant to fight respiratory infections and alleviate coughs.You can find it in lozenge, cough syrup, and vapor bath forms at most drug stores.









Ointments containing eucalyptus oil may also be applied to the nose and chest area to relieve congestion and loosen phlegm.
Fresh or dried eucalyptus leaves can be used in teas and warm water gargles to soothe sore throats. You can make eucalyptus tea by steeping two to four grams of dried leaves in a cup of hot water for 10–15 minutes. Drink this tea up to three times per day.
For gargles, steep two to four grams of dried leaves in one cup of warm water. Add ¼ to ½ tsp salt. Steep for five to 10 minutes. Use after meals to reduce bad breath and soothe sore throats.Don’t consume eucalyptus oil by mouth, as it can be toxic. People with asthma, seizures, liver or kidney disease, or low blood pressure should not use eucalyptus without asking their doctor.

, Peppermint is also widely used to treat cold symptoms. Its main ingredient, menthol, is an excellent decongestant. Menthol thins mucus and breaks up phlegm. It can also soothe sore throats and coughs.You can find peppermint in essential oils, lozenges, supplemental extracts, herbal teas, and as a fresh or dried herb.









Peppermint tea can help soothe sore throats. Steep one tea bag (approximately three to four grams of leaves) in hot water. Adding a little honey will help quiet coughs.
Do not use peppermint oil or menthol with children under two.
Peppermint oil is safe for aromatherapy use and as a rub. Do not consume peppermint oil orally.

, Honey contains anti-viral properties and strengthens your immune system, and raw honey is even better for you.

For maximum benefits, look for raw honey that has been harvested locally, as it helps your body combat the allergens particular to your area.









You can use honey and lemon in tea to soothe sore throats and quiet coughs.
Do not give honey to a child under one year old., Echinacea may help boost your immune system. Studies have not proven that it can help fight the common cold, although it is a common remedy.You can find echinacea in supplement form at most drug stores and pharmacies.








If you have ragweed, daisy, or marigold allergies, do not use echinacea.People who use certain medications, such as some heart medications and anti-fungals, should not use echinacea. Consult with your doctor before you use echinacea or any herbal supplement.

, Garlic appears to boost your immune system, and may have a mild anti-viral quality.More studies are needed to determine whether garlic can help fight colds, but it shows some promise.








You can take garlic as a supplement, or eat it in foods. You should aim to eat two to four cloves of garlic per day to maximize any effects."

, Vitamin C will not “cure” a cold, but it can help your body heal faster.Most adults should consume between 65–90 mg a day, and no more than 2,000 mg per day.








Citrus fruits, red and green peppers, kiwifruit, spinach, and other raw fruits and vegetables are good sources of vitamin C.Do not over-consume vitamin C. In addition to the small possibility of overdose, your body cannot store excess vitamin C. It will expel what your body doesn’t use in your urine.

, Staying hydrated can help soothe a sore throat. Drink plenty of water, juice, or clear broth. If you have been vomiting, you may need to drink a sports drink containing electrolytes to restore your electrolyte balance.









Warm lemon water with honey can help loosen congestion.Mix the juice of ½ a lemon with one cup warm water. Stir in honey to your liking.
Warm apple juice may soothe a sore throat. Pour one cup of apple juice into a microwave-safe mug and microwave for one minute.Women should drink at least nine cups (2.2 liters) of fluids per day when they’re well. Men should drink at least 13 cups (3 liters) of fluids per day when they’re well. When you’re sick, you should plan to drink even more.Avoid alcohol and caffeinated beverages. Alcohol can make inflammation worse. Both alcohol and caffeine dehydrate you.

, Your body needs rest in order to heal faster, so go ahead and call in sick. (Your coworkers probably don’t want to catch your cold, either.) Pushing yourself too hard can weaken your immune system, meaning it takes longer to recover from your cold.









Try to take plenty of naps during the day, since having a cold can make you feel run-down and you need to keep up your strength.
If you have trouble breathing while sleeping, elevate your head on a pillow to help you breathe more easily.

, Several studies suggest that practicing relaxation techniques can help reduce the duration of colds and flu.Some good stress reduction techniques include breathing exercises, yoga, and tai chi.









For deep breathing, place one hand on your chest and the other on your lower belly. Take a slow, deep breath through your nostrils for a count of four. You should feel your belly expand against your hand. Hold your breath for a count of four, then slowly exhale for a count of four.Yoga is a mind-body therapy that improves fitness, lowers blood pressure, promotes relaxation and self-confidence, and reduces stress and anxiety.

Blow your nose.,
Inhale steam.,
Use a saline solution.",How to Get Rid of a Cold Without Using Medications1," Apply pressure to one nostril. Blow gently through the other into a facial tissue. Repeat the process for the other nostril. Be sure to blow gently. Blowing too hard can cause further damage to the inside of your nasal passage, which will extend the time it takes to heal. Do not blow through both nostrils at the same time. It won’t be effective. Wash your hands after blowing your nose.Avoid sniffling as much as possible. All you are doing is sucking the mucus back up in your body. If your nose is running, blow it.
Frequent blowing can irritate your skin. Use soft tissues with lotion to alleviate dryness.;
, Steam inhalation helps with nasal decongestion. It loosens mucus, which can easily be blown away afterwards. Boil some water. Pour it into a bowl. Place that bowl on a table and then sit with your head over the bowl. Place a towel over your head. Close your eyes and breathe deeply. Do so for around 60 seconds at a time and make sure that your face is not too close to the surface of the water. You should be comfortable the entire time.


Add a drop of menthol, eucalyptus, camphor, thymol, or pine oil to the water for a pleasant and effective addition. These natural ingredients help loosen mucus up further.Do not allow children to do this by themselves. Hot water scalds and a child probably won’t be able to handle the boiling water well enough to avoid injury.
Run a hot shower. Steamy showers act in a similar way and can be a great alternative for children to use. The child doesn't need to get under the hot water — they only need to be in the bathroom with the door closed to benefit from the steam.

, Saline is just a natural mixture of salt and water. You can purchase pre-made saline nasal drops over-the-counter at any pharmacy. They can be used on children.They should be used once a day for maximum effectiveness.To use nasal drops or perform a nasal wash, stand over a sink with your head bent downward. Place the tip of the bottle in one of your nostrils and spray. You should be squeezing approximately 4 ounces of the solution into your nasal passage. Rotate your head back and forth and let it drip back out of your nose naturally. Then repeat this process in your other nostril. Do not swallow the saline solution. If you feel it entering your throat, lower your head more over the sink. When you’re done, blow your nose gently to remove any leftover saline solution.If you are using a Neti pot, fill it with your saline solution. Stand by a sink. Tilt your head sideways and place the spout of the Neti pot in the upper nostril. Breathe through your mouth and pour the saline solution into your nostril slowly (again, around 4 ounces is best). The liquid should drain through your nasal system and come out of your lower nostril after around three or four seconds. Then repeat through your other nostril. Be sure to blow your nose after using your Neti pot.Saline drops can be used in infants too. Add two to three drops into each nostril of your baby. Then take a bulb syringe. Place the tip in each nostril and suck out the saline solution gently. Do not add solution to both nostrils at the same time. It could further impair your baby’s ability to breathe."

Drink plenty of fluids.,
Use natural herbs to reduce common cold symptoms.,
Eat garlic.,
Take vitamin C. Perhaps, an orange a day helps keep the doctor away.",How to Get Rid of a Cold Without Using Medications2," Drink warm fluids. Staying hydrated will reduce the effects of many symptoms such as headaches and sore throat, while also preventing dehydration. Hot teas and soups are a good way to increase your liquid intake, while also helping to relieve sinus congestion and reduce inflammation in the nose and throat.Drink enough fluids to quench thirst. Getting enough fluids when you're sick is important, but getting too many may actually force your liver and kidney to work overtime in order to process it. Drink a little more than normal when you're sick, but don't feel like you need to drink 12 or 15 glasses a day.
A good indication that you are drinking enough fluids is that your urine will be almost clear. A darker yellow implies a higher concentration of waste in your body that is not dissolving and diluting enough — so raise your fluid intake., There are several natural remedies out there — some are the stuff of late-night infomercials and others are legitimate. There are two herbs shown to improve cold symptoms.



Andrographis paniculata (a common Southeast Asian herb) has been shown to reduce symptoms. Take a 100 mg capsule twice daily for five days. Higher dosages can cause vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.You can also take Pelargonium sidoides (a South American herb). This is most often sold as a liquid extract. Take 1.5 ml or 30 drops of the liquid three times a day before meals for up to 10 days. Side effects can by mild nausea, diarrhea, and general skin irritation. Cease taking it if you experience any of these side effects., There is some evidence, which suggests that garlic could reduce the occurrence and improve symptoms of common cold. Allicin in garlic has been shown to fight off viruses. You can either eat whole garlic cloves, add them to soup, or take garlic supplements. Capsules containing 180 mg of garlic extract decrease the duration of common colds.Garlic can increase the risk of bleeding, therefore people on blood-thinners (aspirin or warfarin ) should not take garlic.

, Taking vitamin C supplements before the onset of a common cold can decrease the duration of symptoms. Vitamin C supplements are available as tablets and 200 mg can be take every day.Doses exceeding more than 2000 mg/day can result in diarrhea, fainting, headache, and abdominal pain."

Use an additional pillow to elevate your head while you sleep. This will help make sure that your nose effectively drains while you sleep rather than getting even more clogged up.


Take time off from work or school. You cannot continue your normal routine and also get enough rest. You should stay at home. To prevent the transmission of the virus, you need to stay away from large groups of people. With the common cold, the rhinovirus spreads through the air. Normally the worst day of your cold — around day two — is when your body is eliminating the virus. You’ll still be a carrier for a couple of days past this.

, The steamy soup clears congestion, relieves stuffy noses, and provides a great source of nutrition to keep you going. Researchers argue that compounds found in chicken soup actively increase white blood cells, which attack foreign bodies that cause illness., If you have a fever, your body will inevitably feel colder. Get a warm blanket and snuggle up on the couch. Wear plenty of layers and use as many blankets as you need to. While staying warm won’t get rid of a cold, it will make you feel more comfortable while your body fends it off. There is little scientific evidence to back up the assertion that sweating fights colds. You cannot “sweat” out a cold., Since nasal congestion often leads to sore throats be sure to gargle with salt water regularly. Add 1/4 tsp table salt to 8 oz (237 mL) of water. Thoroughly dissolve the salt in the water. Take small sips and gargle for about 30 seconds each time. Spit and repeat as needed.

, You can purchase these supplements at most pharmacies. Many of these supplements also come in the form of “cough drops.” Find some with honey, licorice, or slippery elm as ingredients.


Honey consumed in lozenges or tea can be a good remedy for sore throats and can help suppress coughs.Licorice root can be purchased in a tablet or as a separate solution. Dissolve 500 mg of licorice root (generally 1 1/2 tablets) in 30 ml of warm water. Gargle and spit.Slippery elm has been used as an herbal supplement in North America for centuries. You can purchase it in tablet or powder form. Take three to four tablets (400 – 500 mg each) daily for one to two months. To make a slippery elm tea, add two tsp of the powder to 2 cups of warm water (473 mL). Drink three times a day for the duration of your cold.

, Using either a humidifier or vaporizer in the room you are resting in can make you more comfortable by keeping the air moist.This is especially helpful if your nasal passages or throat are dry and irritated. Keep in mind that although humidifiers might help soothe your throat, they probably don't help relieve cold symptoms or shorten the duration of the cold.


Some studies have suggested that humidifiers and vaporizers may be more harmful than useful. Humidifiers can spread pathogens, mold, and toxins, in addition to causing nasty burns. Use your own judgement to decide if using a humidifier is right for you., According to the Mayo Clinic, products like Vick's VapoRub don't actually relieve nasal congestion, but the strong scent of menthol and camphor does manage to break past your clogged up nose. This tricks your brain into thinking that you can breathe, which decreases illness-driven anxiety. Try it to calm yourself., Tobacco use can weaken your immune system and exacerbate many cold symptoms. In addition, the added strain on your throat and lungs hinders the healing process., Sometimes, you simply need to visit a doctor.You should visit a doctor when you experience the following symptoms:


Fevers over 103 degrees Fahrenheit
When symptoms persist for more than 10 days
Difficulty breathing
Severe ear pain or discharge of mucus from the ear
Confusion, disorientation, or seizure
Frequent vomiting or abdominal pain
Painfully swollen glands in the neck or jaw

"
Use over-the-counter medication for fevers caused by colds and flu.,
Try taking a bath in lukewarm water.,
Drink water.,
Take supplements to boost immune health.Supplements can fill nutritional needs, helping your body fight the cause of fever.,
Administer ""wet socks treatment"" at home.If you go to sleep wearing wet socks, your body will defend itself by circulating blood and lymphatic fluid to your wet feet.,
Cool children's bodies if necessary.,
Stay as comfortable as possible.,
Hydrate and eat mild foods to recover from gastrointestinal (GI) infection.,
Consume herbs known to fight fever.,
Take care not to spread infection.While you are ill, make sure to cover your mouth and nose while coughing and sneezing, and dispose of used tissues properly.,
Recall if anyone around you has been sick lately.,
Keep a temperature log.If the illness doesn't resolve on its own, you want to be able to give the doctor a detailed log of how the fever has behaved.,
Record your other symptoms.,
Seek medical advice.,
Follow your doctor's instructions for viral infections.,
Take antibiotics for bacterial infections.Bacterial infections are highly treatable, and generally respond well to antibiotics.,
Talk to your doctor about other causes of fever.,
Use a digital thermometer to take your temperature orally.A digital thermometer can measure your temperature orally, rectally, or in the armpit.,
Take your temperature in the armpit.Either remove your shirt or wear a loose shirt that allows you to take the measurement at your armpit.,
Decide which measurement method to use on a child.,
Take the child’s temperature rectally with a digital thermometer.Make sure the tip of the thermometer has been sterilized in rubbing alcohol then rinsed clean.,
Interpret the results.,
Get vaccinated.,
Get enough sleep every day.Adults who get less than six hours of sleep per night have impaired immune responses.,
Eat a healthy diet.What you put into your body can have a massive effect on its ability to fight infection.,
Avoid contact with germs.If you know someone is ill, keep your distance until they've recovered and are no longer contagious.,
Reduce your stress levels.Studies show that high levels of stress actually depress the immune system's response.",How to Get Rid of a Fever Fast," Taking an over-the-counter medication is one of the fastest and easiest ways to get rid of a fever. If your fever is from a viral infection, then it may be difficult to treat. Viruses live in the cells of the body and reproduce rapidly. They do not respond to antibiotics.You can, however, take medication to try to manage your body's fever response, no matter what the cause.


Try taking acetaminophen (Tylenol) or aspirin to help bring down your fever. Make sure that you follow the instructions on the package and do not exceed the recommended dosage.
Don't give aspirin to children, because it can cause Reye's syndrome if they have viral infections. Acetaminophen is a safer option. Look for ""children's"" formulas, and follow dosage instructions carefully.;
, Bathing or showering in lukewarm water may also help to cool down your body faster as well.Fill the bathtub with lukewarm water or adjust your shower until the water is lukewarm. Soak in the tub or stand in the shower for 10 to 15 minutes to help cool down your body.


Do not take a freezing cold shower or add ice to the bath to bring down your fever. Just stick to lukewarm water to gently reduce your fever.

, A fever can dehydrate you and this may make matters worse. Make sure that you drink plenty of water to help your body combat the fever and keep yourself well-hydrated as well.


Kids may also need to drink an electrolyte fluid, such as Pedialyte, to help replenish lost electrolytes.Ask your child's pediatrician first to see if this is necessary.
Gatorade or Powerade are also an option. You may want to cut these with water to reduce the sugar and calorie content.

, Taking multivitamins will not fight the fever directly, but it will strengthen your body so it can fight.


Take a multivitamin with vitamins A, C, E, and B-complex vitamins, magnesium, calcium, zinc, and selenium.
Take one or two capsules or teaspoons of fish oil every day for the omega-3 fatty acids.
You can also try zinc or echinacea.
Probiotic supplements or foods (like yogurt with ""active cultures"") will introduce more Lactobacillus acidophilus bacteria into your system and improve immune health. But if you have a severely compromised immune system, talk to your doctor before taking probiotics.
Do not take herbal supplements without consulting your doctor. Some can interact with prescription medication or medical conditions.

, This, in turn, stimulates the immune system and triggers a more restful, healing state of sleep.


Soak a pair of thin cotton socks in lukewarm water, then wring them out until they're moist but not dripping.
Put them on when you're going to bed, then wear a thicker pair of dry socks over them.
Take two nights off after five to six days.

, Adult bodies can handle fever pretty well, but children may suffer febrile seizures if the fever rises too high. In fact, fever is the leading cause of seizures in children between six months and five years.If the child's temperature rises over 104°F (40°), or begins to rise quickly, start cooling them off immediately. Remove his clothing. Use a sponge or washcloth to pat tepid (not cold) water all over his body to bring down his temperature.Applying ice to a fevered body can be dangerous if done incorrectly. It causes shivering, which actually raises body temperature.They may apply ice in a hospital setting, but it's best to use tepid water at home.
Call the doctor immediately if your child’s fever spikes. They will either direct you to take the child to an ER or provide detailed guidance for how to care for them at home.
Call 911 for emergency assistance if the child has a seizure.
Your doctor may administer rectal diazepam to treat febrile seizure in your child.

, Sometimes a fever just has to run its course, but you can do things to make yourself more comfortable while you wait for it to go away. For example, placing wet towels on your skin won't reduce the fever, but it may help to reduce discomfort from the fever.Moisten a washcloth or hand towel with cool water and apply it to your neck or forehead.


Wear warm clothes and stay under blankets to deal with the chills from the fever. If you feel hot, then just use a light sheet and wear light, breathable clothes.

, GI infections are more commonly known as the ""stomach flu."" Symptoms include diarrhea, stomach pain, nausea or vomiting, and muscle or headaches.They often also present with a low-grade fever. GI infections resolve on their own in three to seven days, so you just need to take care of yourself until yours passes. Drink at least eight to ten 8 oz. glasses of water per day, especially if you are vomiting. Watch for symptoms of dehydration in children, as this needs emergency attention. Signs include fewer wet diapers, decreased fontanelle (soft spot on the skull) size, sunken eyes, and lethargy. If you see these symptoms, call emergency services or seek immediate medical attention.

The BRAT (Bananas, Rice, Applesauce, and Toast) diet is often recommended for GI trouble, but the evidence to support it is weak. The American Academy of Pediatrics does not recommend using it for children, as it does not provide adequate nutrition.Eat reasonably, stay away from greasy, heavy, and spicy foods, and drink plenty of water.

, Herbal remedies can be taken in a number of forms: powder, capsule, or tincture. Many people prefer to brew hot teas with dried herbs. The warm liquid soothes the throat while the herbs fight the fever. To brew an herbal tea, steep one teaspoon of the herb in a cup of hot water for five to ten minutes for leaves or flowers or ten to twenty minutes for roots. Talk with your doctor before consuming any herbs or natural remedies, as they may interfere with prescription medication or other medical conditions. The following herbs all improve immune function, but can have some negative side effects:Green tea may increase your anxiety levels and raise your blood pressure. You may want to avoid drinking green tea if you have diarrhea, glaucoma, or osteoporosis. Consult your doctor if you have liver disease.
Cat's claw may make autoimmune disorders or leukemia worse. It can also interfere with certain types of medications, so talk to your doctor before drinking it.
Reishi mushroom you may find this as a tincture rather than in dried form. Take 30-60 drops two to three times a day. Reishi may interact with some medicines as well, like blood thinners and blood pressure medications.

, Wash your hands often with antibacterial soap. Keep your distance from uninfected people and public spaces as much as possible. Don't share glasses or utensils with anyone, and don't take it personally if your partner doesn't want to kiss you for a while!


Have children play with hard toys that can be cleaned easily in the sink with soap and water.

, If someone in your household or workplace has been ill in the recent past, you may have picked it up from them. Children often spread illnesses to each other, and may catch a cold or the flu from friends at school or the playground.If you know that the other person’s illness resolved on its own, you can relax a bit. Your illness will likely also resolve with rest and plenty of water.

, They may be able to use that information to diagnose you with a specific illness. For example, you may assume you have a simple cold, but after a week, your fever spikes suddenly. Odds are you have a secondary bacterial infection like an ear infection or pneumonia. Some cancers, like non-Hodgkin lymphoma, on the other hand, cause a fever at night, but none during the day.


Make sure to take your temperature multiple times every day until the fever recedes.
Night fevers may be a sign of tuberculosis or HIV/AIDS.

, Make note of anything that seems out of the ordinary, even if it doesn't make you feel ill, necessarily. Unexpected weight change, for example, can point to several causes. Your other symptoms may be able to point to the organ system being affected, which will narrow the field for diagnosis.


For example, a cough suggests a lung problem like pneumonia.Burning during urination points to a kidney infection., Give your temperature log and list of symptoms to your doctor, who will try to diagnose the cause of the fever. They will do a physical examination will provide further clues about the source of the fever.The history you provided and physical exam will help the doctor narrow down the possible causes. The causes can be easily confirmed or ruled out with lab analysis or imaging.


Common tests your doctor may order include a physical examination, white blood cell count, urine analysis, blood cultures, and a chest X-ray., Cold and flu are by far the most common viral infections doctors see. However, there are a number of somewhat less common viral infections that also won't respond to antibiotic treatment.Croup, bronchiolitis, varicella (chickenpox), roseola, and hand, foot & mouth disease are caused by viruses too.Many of these resolve on their own; for example, foot, hand, and mouth disease usually passes within seven to ten days. For most of these viruses, good self-care (proper hygiene, nutrition, and rest) are the best treatment, but talk to your doctor.


Ask your doctor how long the virus will last and whether there are any ways to speed up the healing process.
Ask what you should be looking for as you monitor your symptoms, as some normally harmless viruses can progress and become dangerous. Foot, hand, and mouth disease, for example, can cause fatal brain inflammation in rare cases., Antibiotics either kill the bacteria or stop them from reproducing in your body. From there, your immune system can fight off the remaining infection.


Bacterial pneumonia is a common cause of fever.
The doctor will take a blood sample to determine which bacteria is causing the fever.
They will use that information to decide which antibiotic to use to fight the infection and reduce your fever.

, Viruses and bacteria are the most common causes of fever, but they aren't the only ones. Fevers can also be caused by reactions to immunization, allergic reactions, and chronic inflammatory conditions such as IBS (inflammatory bowel disease) and arthritis.


If you get frequent or recurring fevers, talk to your doctor about potential causes. You may be able to treat the underlying condition and reduce the number of fevers you get.

, You should not try to measure your own temperature rectally, so use the thermometer either orally or in the armpit. Clean the thermometer with cold water, then rubbing alcohol, then a final cold water rinse. Never use a thermometer that has been used rectally in your mouth.


Don't eat or drink anything for five minutes before taking your temperature. This could change the temperature in your mouth and lead to an inaccurate measurement.
Put the tip of the thermometer under your tongue and hold it still for about 40 seconds. Most digital thermometers beep to let you know when they've finished taking the measurement.
After reading the measurement, rinse the thermometer in cold water, clean with rubbing alcohol, and rinse again to sterilize.

, Place the tip of the thermometer directly into your armpit. It should only be touching skin, not fabric from your shirt. Wait for about 40 seconds or until you hear the beep letting you know the measurement is finished.

, Take the child’s temperature by which ever method they can realistically handle. A 2-year-old, for example, cannot hold a thermometer still under the tongue long enough to get an accurate reading. Ear thermometers have been met with mixed results. The most accurate measurement you can take is a rectal one, which is not painful for the child. This is recommended for children between three months and four years of age., After drying the tip, lubricate it with petroleum jelly for ease of movement.


Have the child lay down on their back, then lift their legs into the air. For babies, you should lift the legs like you would when changing a diaper.
Gently insert the thermometer about 1/2 to one inch into the rectum, but don't force it against resistance.
Hold the thermometer still for about 40 seconds or until it beeps to let you know the measurement is ready.

, You may have heard that a healthy body temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), but this is merely a guideline. A normal body will fluctuate in temperature, even in the course of one day. Temperature is usually lower in the morning and warmer in the evening. Furthermore, some people simply have higher or lower resting temperatures. A healthy daily range can be from 97.5 to 98.8°F (36.4 to 37.1°C). The guidelines for feverish temperatures are as follows:


Children: 100.4°F (38°C) measured rectally; 99.5°F (37.5°C) measured orally; 99°F (37.2°C) measured in the armpit.Adults: 100.7°F (38.2°C) measured rectally; 100°F (37.8°C) measured orally; 99°F (37.2°C) measured in the armpit.
Temperatures under 100.4°F (38°C)are considered ""low-grade"" fevers. You shouldn't worry about a fever until it reaches 102°F (38.9°C).

, Viral infections don't respond well to treatment. But scientists have developed vaccines that can prevent a large number of viral infections. Talk to your doctor about which vaccinations they would recommend. Having children vaccinated at an early age can prevent many potentially serious illnesses later in life. Consider getting vaccinations against:


Pneumococcal infection, which protects against the bacteria that causes ear infection, sinus infection, pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis.H influenzae, which causes upper respiratory infections like ear and sinus infections. It can also cause more serious infections like meningitis.
Children age 11 years and older should be vaccinated for meningitis.There is no evidence that vaccinating your child causes autism. Vaccinations must be licensed by the FDA and be extensively tested to show that they work. Vaccinating your child could save their life., This reduces your ability to fight off infection.


Try to get at least seven to eight hours of uninterrupted sleep every night to keep your immune system strong

, Nourish your body with whole foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Avoid processed foods, which tend to be high in sugars and saturated fats that are bad for your body.


Make sure to get 1000 mg of Vitamin C and 2000 iu of Vitamin D per day. Vitamins A and E are also important for their antioxidant properties.

, Even when there's no visible illness around you, maintain good hygiene practices.


Wash your hands after leaving public spaces, and always wash them before eating. If you don't have access to water in public, carry a small bottle of hand sanitizer with you.

, This leaves you vulnerable to illness. Make room in your life for relaxation and activities you enjoy, and try to be present in those moments when you have them.


Yoga and meditation are popular activities that help people reduce their stress levels. Aerobic exercise also has a significant impact on stress.
Try to get at least 150 minutes of aerobic exercise every week, in periods of 30 to 40 minutes.
When you exercise, aim for a target heart rate appropriate to your age. Calculate this by subtracting your age from the number 220.Target heart rate is 60-80% of your Max Heart Rate depending on fitness.

Know the Dangers of getting the Swine Flu.,
Make sure that you are aware of the dangers of getting the vaccine.,
You should definitely get the vaccine if:

You are under the age of 6.",How to Get the Swine Flu Vaccine1," This is the first and most important step to getting the vaccine.


Most individuals develop typical symptoms of the flu, including:

Fever
Sore throat
Cough
Headache
Muscle or joint pains
Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea


However, individuals with certain conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, obesity, heart disease, HIV/AIDS, neurodevelopmental conditions (in children), or pregnancy, may be subject to more severe symptoms, or even develop viral pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome, which manifests itself as increased breathing difficulty, typically occurs 3–6 days after initial onset of flu symptoms.;
, You should not get the vaccine if you are sick, work on a poultry farm, et cetera.

,
You live in a remote area that is 350 kilometers (220 mi) or more from a medical clinic.

Use steam.,
Try a Neti pot.,
Gargle with salt water.,
Allow a mild fever to run its course.,
Blow your nose as often as possible.",How to Get Rid of the Flu1," Nasal and sinus congestion are common symptoms of the flu. If you are suffering from congestion, using steam may give you some relief. The heat of the steam loosens mucus while the moisture helps to relieve dry nasal passages.Try a hot shower or bath to help to clear your congestion faster. Turn the water as hot as you can stand it and let the bathroom fill with steam with the door closed. If the heat leaves you feeling a little weak or dizzy, stop immediately and do not continue.
When you get out of the shower, dry your hair and body thoroughly. Damp hair can cause you to lose body heat, which is not good when you are sick.
You can also use steam by filling your bathroom sink with hot water and placing your face over it. Drape a towel over your head to keep the steam in. You can even add a couple of drops of a sinus-clearing essential oil, such as eucalyptus, or peppermint, to maximize the sinus-clearing benefits.;
, The Neti pot clears nasal passages by thinning and flushing the sinuses with a saline solution. The Neti pot is an oblong ceramic or clay teapot that can be purchased online, in health food stores, and in some pharmacies; however, any kind of bottle or container with a thin spout can also be used.


Buy the saline solution used in the Neti pot in health food or drug stores; however, you can make your own saline solution by mixing half a teaspoon of kosher salt into a cup of sterile water. It is essential that the water is sterile or properly distilled — ensure this by boiling the water for five minutes, then allow it to cool to room temperature.
Fill the pot with the saline solution and, tilting your head to one side over a sink, insert the spout of the pot into one nostril. Slowly pour the solution in, which should flow in one nostril before coming out the other. When the water stops dripping, blow your nose gently, then repeat the process on the opposite side., A dry, tickly, or sore throat is a common symptom of the flu. An easy, natural way to deal with this is to gargle a salt solution. The water hydrates the throat and the antiseptic properties of the salt fight infection.Make a gargling solution by dissolving a teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm to hot water. If you don’t like the taste, add a pinch of baking soda to ease the saltiness.
You can also try gargling with apple cider vinegar and warm water for a similar effect.
Gargle this solution up to four times a day.

, A fever is your body’s way of fighting off the infection, so it is best not to treat it unless it is severe. It is thought that he fever will heat up your body and blood, which makes it easier for your body to fight off the infection, or that the virus may be unable to replicate as easily when your body is at a higher temperature.Adults with a mild fever (less than 101°F or 38.3°C) may allow the fever to run its course. Do not try to bring it down with fever reducers.
Seek medical attention if your fever goes above 101°F (38.3°C).
Seek treatment for an infant under 12 months old with any type of fever., Blowing your nose often is the best way to get excess mucus out of your sinuses and nasal passages when you are sick with the flu. Do not inhale mucus back into your nose because that can lead to sinus pressure and earaches.To blow your nose, hold a tissue over your nose with both hands. The tissue should be covering your nostrils so that the tissue will catch the mucus when you blow your nose. Then apply gentle pressure on one nostril and blow out through the other one.
Dispose of used tissues immediately and wash your hands to minimize the spread of germs.

Side-effects include swelling, soreness, and tenderness at the site of injection vomiting.",How to Get the Swine Flu Vaccine2," Headache, malaise, dizziness, headache, fever, and muscle pain. Two people had more severe reactions, with a much longer spell of nausea, muscle pain and malaise that lasted several days. There were reports of tingling lips or tongue, difficulty breathing, hives, and skin rashes. Thirty six people had serious adverse effects, including anaphylaxis and febrile convulsions; one woman in her 80s died in Quebec. Rare side-effects are temporary bleeding disorders and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), a potentially fatal condition involving the system. There is the possibility that immune stimulation by vaccines or any other cause might worsen pre-existing heart disease. A possible case of dystonia has been reported; a woman noted flu-like symptoms starting ten days after influenza vaccination, followed by difficulties with movement and speech. This disorder is extremely rare, since over the past eighteen years there have been only 5 cases that might have been associated with influenza vaccinations. According to the CDC, due to the very low numbers of cases, the disorder is poorly-understood and there is no evidence either for or against it being caused by the vaccinations The Dystonia Medical Research Foundation have stated that it is unlikely that the symptoms in this case are actually dystonia and say that there has ""never been a validated case of dystonia resulting from a flu shot"".

Find a good medical clinic.,
Once you have done that, go to the clinic.,
You will then get the vaccine if you have answered all the required questions as you should have.

,
Once you have gotten the vaccine, the doctor will keep you in the clinic for 15 minutes, to make sure that you are all right.

",How to Get the Swine Flu Vaccine3," It is best if the clinic is near you, since you can quickly get there.

, The doctor will give you a list of questions. Answer them correctly and honestly.

Rest as much as possible.,
Keep yourself warm.,
Stay home.,
Drink plenty of fluids.,
Seek medical help if necessary.",How to Get Rid of the Flu2," When you're sick, your body works hard to get you better. This drains all of your energy from your body, meaning you will be more tired than usual. This also means you need to rest more, since your body is working so hard. If you try doing more than you have to, you can make your flu last longer and make your symptoms worse.


At least eight hours of sleep per night is ideal, but you will probably need even more when you're sick. Sleep in and take naps throughout the day.Take time off of work or school so you can get adequate rest.

, Keeping your body temperature up will help speed up your recovery. Make sure that you turn on the heat in your house, so that it is warm enough for you. You can also stay warm by wearing a fuzzy robe, by staying under the covers, or by using a portable heater.


Dry heat can bother your nose and throat, causing them to dry out even more and making your symptoms worse. Try using a humidifier in the room where you spend most of your time. This will add moisture back into the air, which can ease coughing and congestion., When you are sick, you need to rest. It is the only way to regain your strength and let your body recuperate. If you go into work or school while you are sick, you will be spreading your germs to those around you. Also, when you are sick with the flu, your immune system is weaker. This means you might pick up other illnesses from those around you and you could be sick longer.Ask your doctor for a note to excuse you from work or school for a few days.

, Blowing your nose a lot and sweating due to fever and increased environmental heat causes you to lose hydration. This can worsen flu symptoms and cause more symptoms, such as headaches and a dry, irritated throat. Try to drink more fluids than average when you're sick. You can drink decaffeinated hot tea, an electrolyte solution like PediaLyte, diluted sports drinks, eat soups and water-heavy fruit and vegetables such as watermelon, tomato, cucumber, and pineapple, or drink more juice and water.


Avoid sugary sodas because soda acts as a diuretic, which causes you to urinate more and lose water. Drink ginger ale if you have an upset stomach, but drink more water.To check for dehydration, examine your urine. Very pale yellow or almost clear means you’re well-hydrated. When urine is dark yellow, you may be dehydrated and you should drink more water., There is no way to cure the flu after getting it, so you will just have to ride it out. Once you have the flu, symptoms generally last seven to 10 days. If your symptoms last more than two weeks, make sure that you contact your doctor. You should also contact your doctor if you have:


Difficulty breathing or chest pain
Sudden dizziness or confusion
Severe or persistent vomiting
Seizures
Flu-like symptoms that improve but then return with fever and worse cough
Change in mental status in a young child (i.e. more drowsy than usual/not waking up to stimulation like normal)

"
Take oral decongestants.,
Use spray decongestants.,
Try pain relievers and fever reducer.,
Use a cough suppressant.,
Try an expectorant.,
Consider an over-the-counter multi-symptom medicine.,
Ask your doctor about a prescription antiviral medication.,
Know the side effects of antivirals.",How to Get Rid of the Flu3," Nasal decongestants help shrink swollen blood vessels in the nasal membranes and allow the nasal passages to open up. The two oral decongestants available over-the-counter in tablet form include phenylephrine, such as Sudafed PE, and pseudoephedrine, such as Sudafed.


Side effects of oral decongestants include insomnia, dizziness, increased heart rate, and increased blood pressure.
Do not use oral decongestants if you have heart issues or high blood pressure. Use under a doctor's care if you have diabetes, thyroid problems, glaucoma, or prostate issues., You can also take over-the-counter decongestants in nasal spray form. Nasal sprays can provide immediate and effective relief from congestion, which can be administered in one or two quick squirts.


Nasal sprays can contain oxymetazoline, phenylephrine, xylometazoline, or naphazoline as a decongestant.
Be sure to use the nasal spray only as often as directed. Using it for more than three to five days can cause you to feel stuffier after discontinuing use. This is called the ""rebound effect."", If you have a fever and aches and pains, you can take over-the-counter medicine for relief. The main pain relievers and fever reducers are acetaminophen, such as Tylenol, or NSAIDs, which are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen or naproxen.


Avoid taking NSAIDs if you have acid reflux or peptic ulcer disease. These medications can upset your stomach. If you are already taking an NSAID for other issues such as blood clots or arthritis, talk to your doctor before taking the medicine.
Many multi-symptoms medicines contain acetaminophen. Make sure you take the appropriate amount because an overdose can lead to liver toxicity.Do not give aspirin to children or teenagers, especially if they are exhibiting flu-like symptoms. This is linked to a serious liver failure disorder called Reye's Syndrome.

, If you have a severe cough, try a cough suppressant. Cough suppressants include dextromethorphan and codeine, though codeine will likely need a prescription. Dextromethorphan is available as a tablet or syrup and can come in combination with an expectorant.


Side effects of these types of medications can include drowsiness and constipation.
The dosages of these medications vary depending on what you buy and how strong it is, so always follow doctor’s and manufacturer’s directions., Chest congestion is a common flu symptom. To help cure it, you can try an expectorant. Expectorants are medicines that loosen and reduce mucus in your chest. Less mucus will help you breathe better and make your coughs more productive. Many over-the-counter medications for cold and flu have expectorants in them, which can be liquid, liquid gels, or tablet form.


If you are unsure about what kinds to take, ask your doctor or pharmacist. Also ask about common side effects of expectorants, which can include drowsiness, vomiting, and nausea., There are countless combination over-the-counter medicines that contain a lot of these different medications. These are helpful if you experience multiple symptoms at the same time. Most contain a fever reducer and pain reliever such as acetaminophen, a decongestant, a cough suppressant, and sometimes an antihistamine to help you sleep.


If you are taking a combination medicine, make sure not to take other medications that may duplicate what is in the multi-symptom. This can lead to overdoses.Examples include Tylenol Cold Multi-Symptom, Robitussin Severe Multi-Symptom Cough Cold & Flu Nighttime, DayQuil Cold & Flu, etc.

, ""The flu"" is sort of a general layman's term that is often referring to the common cold in severe form. Influenza is one specific virus (the Influenza Type A or B virus) that causes severe symptoms and can be life-threatening for infants and the elderly. If your doctor determines that you have Influenza, he may also prescribe antiviral medications to household members for prevention, especially if they are at high risk, such as someone with a chronic disease or who is older than 65. Antiviral influenza drugs work to reduce the severity and duration of the illness by a couple days, control outbreaks in close quarters or to other members of your family, and possibly reduce complications from the flu.These medications include:Oseltamivir (Tamiflu)
Zanamivir
Amantadine
Rimantadine

, To be effective, antiviral drugs must be started within 48 hours of becoming sick and should be taken for five days; however, a number of flu viruses have developed resistance to some antiviral medications. Taking these may also help contribute to other strains of the flu becoming resistant. Though uncommon, side effects of antivirals medications can include:Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea
Dizziness
Stuffy or runny nose
Headache
Cough

Get a flu shot.,
Try the nasal spray vaccine.,
Understand the complications.,
Be aware of the potential side effects of the vaccine.",How to Get Rid of the Flu4," The single best way to treat any disease is to prevent it. Anyone over six months old should get the flu shot, which specifically targets the influenza virus. This is especially important for anyone at risk of complications from the flu and those who are in contact with those who are especially at risk. This includes those ages 65 or older, young children, women who are pregnant, those with depressed immune systems (such as those undergoing chemotherapy), or those with chronic health conditions like asthma or diabetes. If you are a parent or caretaker for a person with the risk factors just described, or a healthcare worker, it is important you get the flu shot too to protect these people.


Flu season is October to May, with its peak December to February.. Around this time, flu shots, which are vaccines, are available at most pharmacies. Most insurances cover this cost.
Get the vaccine few weeks before the season starts. The vaccine takes a good two weeks to fully kick in, by helping you develop antibodies to the flu so you can fight it off; however, getting it early will help you not contract it during the two weeks you are susceptible to the flu.
The vaccine is only effective for one flu season, so you must get it every year. It also only covers some strains of the flu.Also worth noting is that flu vaccine manufacturers in partnership with doctors basically have to guess which flu strains will be prominent that year and make the vaccine to include those strains. Some years they are wrong, and the vaccine is not effective because it didn't contain the strains that end up being prevalent that season.

, Other than the flu shot, you can get the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This could be easier for some people, but should be avoided by others. You should not take the nasal spray vaccine if:


You are younger than two or older than 49
You have heart disease
You have lung disease or asthma
You have kidney disease or diabetes
You've had previous problems with your immune system
You are pregnant
You have active respiratory symptoms like running nose, cough, etc.

, There are some complications that can arise if you receive either vaccine. Before getting either vaccine, talk to your doctor if:


You are allergic to, or have previously had an allergic to, flu shots or eggs in the past. There is a different flu shot for those with an egg allergy.
If you have a moderate to severe illness with a fever. You should wait until you recover before getting the vaccine.
You have the rare nerve disorder, Guillain-Barré syndrome, in which your immune system attacks your peripheral nervous system.
If you have multiple sclerosis.

, Despite all the good that flu vaccines do, there are some side effects of the flu shot. These can include:


Soreness and swelling at the injection site
Headaches
Fever
Nausea
Mild flu like symptoms"

Avoid sick people.,
Wash your hands frequently.,
Follow a healthy diet.,
Stay stress-free.,
Get enough sleep.,
Exercise most days of the week.",How to Get Rid of the Flu5," To prevent the flu, avoid coming into close contact with people who have the flu. Close contact includes coming close to the mouth, so avoid kissing or hugging those with the flu. You should also avoid an infected person if they sneeze or cough near you. Any bodily fluid can transfer the flu germs.


Also avoid touching surfaces the infected individual touched, which will be contaminated with germs.

, Proper hand washing is the best way to prevent all kinds of infections. When you are in public or around a sick individual, you should wash your hands frequently. Carry hand sanitizer with you to use when you may not have access to a sink. According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), proper hand washing technique is as follows:


Get your hands wet with clean, running water. It can be either warm or cold. Next, turn off the tap and apply soap.
Lather the soap into your hands by rubbing them together. Don’t forget the backs of your hands as well as in between your fingers and under your fingernails.

Vitamin C has long been considered important in fighting off colds, even though the research is somewhat contradictory. It may be that Vitamin C works best with an overall healthy diet, so try to get food sources of vitamin C. Citrus fruits and citrus juices as well as tropical fruit (papaya, pineapple) are good sources.
Zinc is essential for immune function, but don’t overdo it (15-25mg/day) and don’t use zinc-containing nasal sprays. These have been associated with loss of the sense of smell.
Selenium is an essential mineral and is lacking in some because the soil in many areas of the world is selenium deficient (selenium is taken up by plants and plants grown in selenium-deficient soils will not contain selenium). Do not take more than 100 mcg/day.

Assess whether you need nasal spray.,
Collect supplies.,
Make the nasal spray.,
Try using baking soda instead of salt.,
Pour the solution into the spray bottle.,
Spray one or two squirts into each nostril as needed.,
Apply the nasal spray to infants or small children with a rubber bulb.",How to Get Rid of a Cold Without Medicine5," A saline (salt water) nasal spray can be used to help you get through a cold, allergies, or to simply help keep your nose clear. Saline nasal sprays can be made at home and used as often as needed without worries. They can be used for adults, children and infants.

, You will need water, salt, and a small spray bottle. The spray bottle should be a 1-2 ounce bottle.


If you will be using the spray to help an infant or a small child with nasal congestion, you should also have a soft, rubber-bulb syringe to remove nasal secretions gently and efficiently.
You can use sea salt or table salt, but if you have an allergy to iodine (or if you don’t know if you have an iodine allergy), use a non-iodized salt such as pickling salt or kosher salt.

, Boil 8 ounces of water and allow it to cool to very warm. Add ¼ teaspoon of salt to the 8 ounces of water and mix well. The ¼ teaspoon of salt will make a saline solution that matches the amount of salt in your body (isotonic).


You may want to try a salt spray that has a greater concentration of salt than your body (hypertonic). To do this add ½ teaspoon of salt instead of adding ¼ teaspoon of salt. This may be useful if the congestion is significant with a lot of discharge, and you are having significant trouble breathing or clearing your nose. Don’t use a hypertonic solution for infants or small children younger than five years old.

, Add ½ teaspoon of baking soda to 8 ounces of hot water and mix well. The baking soda will adjust the pH of the solution to make it less likely to sting a sore nose.

, Some of the solution will probably go down the back of your throat. Be sure to have a towel or tissue on hand to deal with drainage.

, For infants and small children, apply the nasal spray by placing the tip of the bulb over one nostril (avoid touching the inside of the nostril at all if possible), give one or two small squirts, and wait 2-3 minutes. Then tilt the baby’s head back slightly and use the soft, rubber-bulb syringe to gently remove nasal secretions.Don’t squeeze the bulb too much.
Gently suction out the solution by squeezing the bulb, placing the tip slightly into the nostril, and then releasing the bulb.
Avoid touching the inside of the nostril if you can, though this may be difficult with a squirming baby. Wipe the bulb off on a tissue and discard the tissue. Use a new tissue for each nostril, as you are trying to minimize any contamination and to minimize the spread of an infection. Wash your hands before and after each treatment.Repeat this only two to three times a day. If your baby squirms too much, relax and just try again later. Remember to be very gentle!For older children, you can repeat the process four to five times a day

Be prepared.,
Keep your distance from anyone showing symptoms.,
Wash your hands frequently.,
Disinfect surfaces as appropriate.,
Stay home if you are infected.,
Cover coughs and sneezes.",How to Help Out During a Flu Pandemic1," As obvious as it may seem, it's worth mentioning that one of the most important things you can do to reduce the impact of a flu pandemic is to not catch the flu yourself, or at least not spread it to others. A first step in being able to make this small but important contribution is to prepare in advance.


One thing you can do to prepare yourself is to get vaccinated every flu season. While any pandemic that might occur would likely involve a new strain of influenza,staying up to date on flu vaccinations will reduce your chances of contracting the disease.Another way to be prepared is to ensure that you have medications on hand for dealing with the flu if you or someone in your household does contract it. Make sure to have medications on hand for easing the symptoms and reducing a fever.These medications may be more difficult to obtain once a pandemic has begun.
One supply you may not think to stock up on ahead of time is face masks. These items sell out quickly during a disease outbreak, so make sure you have a supply before this happens. Wear a mask when going out and provide one to any family members that are sick or immunocompromised.
It's also a good idea to keep two week's worth of food and water on hand, as these things may also be harder to obtain.Preparing for your own needs means emergency supplies will be available to someone else who needs them.;
, The flu is most often transmitted via tiny droplets of water that are released when people cough or sneeze. During a pandemic (or any flu season) avoid exposure to the virus.Stay away from anyone coughing or sneezing.
Avoid unnecessary handshaking.
Avoid kissing or any other activities that might expose you to other people's saliva.
Spend as little time as possible in crowded places.

, Because people touch so many things throughout the day, your hands are the part of your body most likely to come into contact with the influenza virus.Wash your hands regularly with hot water and soap.


Similarly, try to keep your hands away from your face, especially your nose and mouth.This reduces the risk of accidentally infecting yourself, and also reduces the risk of passing the flu on to others if you become infected.
If you can, wash your hands right away after coughing or sneezing.

, Clean and disinfect surfaces in your home and workplace that many people touch and could easily be contaminated with germs such as the flu.This kills germs that could infect you or others.


Examples of areas to disinfect include doorknobs, microwaves, refrigerator handles, toilet flushers, and computer keyboards.You can use a commercially available disinfectant (or disinfecting wipes), or make your own by mixing one cup of bleach with a gallon of water.You can put this mixture in a spray bottle or use a clean cloth or paper towels to disinfect surfaces.

, If you feel ill, stay home to avoid infecting others. Do not go to work or school.You should also try to avoid going to a clinic unless absolutely necessary, as you risk infecting others. Many clinics have a phone triage process so that if you have typical symptoms of the flu, they will prescribe medication over the phone. If, however, you have other or more serious symptoms, you should be seen by a medical professional.


If possible, work from home. In a true pandemic situation, your employer will likely be understanding about your decision not to come to work
If your symptoms become severe, contact your doctor and ask whether you should seek medical attention., Just as it is important to stay away from other people who are coughing and sneezing, you should also reduce the risk of infecting others by covering your own coughs and sneezes.Cough or sneeze into a single-use tissue, or into the sleeve of your shirt or jacket rather than your hand to reduce the risk of spreading infection by touching things.Wash your hands immediately afterwards if possible.

"
"
Designate a single care provider.,
Provide a separate area.,
Give the infected person plenty of fluids.,
Watch for signs of danger.",How to Help Out During a Flu Pandemic2," Another way you can help out during a flu pandemic is by properly caring for an infected friend or family member. If someone in your household is infected, it is best to designate a single person responsible for caring for him to minimize contact with the public.The designated caregiver should be especially vigilant about washing her hands, and should do so after each time she visits the infected person.
It is also a good idea for the caregiver to cover her mouth and nose when caring for the infected person.Invest in a surgical mask or other mouth-covering device, and replace it often.

, To the extent that it is possible, provide the infected person with a separate area of the home where others do not go to avoid the risk of infection.Keep the infected person at least three feet away from others.Keep this space aired out using natural breezes from open windows or doors, if it is not too cold outside., Having the flu causes a person to lose water at a faster rate than normal. It is important to keep an infected person hydrated, as dehydration can lead to serious health risks.Give the sick person as much water as he can drink.
Provide other liquids like juice or broth as well., Influenza can become severe and lead to other complications like pneumonia. In such cases, the illness can cause death. Watch for the following danger signs, and if you notice these, seek medical attention:Difficulty breathing
Severe chest pain
Inability to stand
Passing out or other sudden loss of consciousness
High fever for more than three days
Seizures or inability to wake up

"
Follow the news and watch for public bulletins.,
Cooperate with home isolation or quarantines as necessary.,
Care for children outside of school.,
Participate in ""social distancing."",
Cooperate with any other CDC requests.",How to Help Out During a Flu Pandemic3," The Center for Disease Control (CDC) has created several voluntary community level strategies for combating a flu pandemic.Keep an eye on your local news for public bulletins about steps you should take.


These community-level interventions are triggered by the number of cases of illness in a given community and the number of deaths it has caused.In a severe pandemic, you will be asked to take certain steps to minimize the spread of the disease.

, The CDC may ask that infected people be isolated from others during treatment. This can occur in the home or in a medical facility, depending on the severity of the illness.Comply with all instructions given by community leaders.


As noted, it's generally a good idea to keep infected persons away from healthy ones. In a pandemic situation, however, the CDC may provide additional instructions for keeping infected persons isolated.

, In a moderate to severe pandemic, the CDC may ask schools to shut down temporarily.Make plans for caring for your children at home if this should occur.


This may require you or another family member to take time off work.
Plan some activities your children can take part in should school be cancelled for more than a day or two.
Make sure your children are washing their hands regularly and taking other precautions to avoid infection.

, In a more severe pandemic situation, the CDC may recommend what it calls social distancing. This means avoiding unnecessary contact with other people, even if you are healthy. This could include a variety of recommendations, such as the following:Asking people to voluntarily work from home, if it is an option
Asking people to cancel or stay away from large gatherings, such as sporting events or concerts
Asking people who are caring for someone with the flu to stay home from work
Asking employers to stagger work shifts in order to reduce the number of people working in a facility at any given time

, In addition to these measures, the CDC may request that people in your community take other steps to reduce the risk of infection. Be attentive to announcements from the CDC or your community leaders, and do your best to comply with all requests.

"
Research volunteer opportunities in advance.,
Consider joining the Medical Reserve Corp. At the federal level, the one institution that you can volunteer with to help in a widespread medical emergency such as a pandemic is the Medical Reserve Corp (MRC).,
Participate in required training.,
Accept any assignment given.",How to Help Out During a Flu Pandemic4," If you want to play a more active role in helping during a pandemic, there may be volunteer opportunities. Many of these require you to get involved before a pandemic starts. Spend some time researching organizations in your area that will provide services.


Both federal and state agencies will be involved in combating a flu pandemic. The government is generally not allowed to accept volunteer services, but may do so in emergencies such as a pandemic.Do an internet search using the name of your state and ""emergency volunteers.""
Reach out to your local Red Cross for volunteer opportunities. This organization is wide-spread and welcomes volunteers of all skill levels.

, Visit their website for information about what they do and how you can get involved.If you have medical training of any kind, your experience will make you particularly valuable to the the MRC; however, people without medical experience can also volunteer.The MRC website has a utility you can use to find out if they have a unit near you.If they don't, you can contact them about the possibility of organizing one!, Both the MRC and local volunteer organizations provide and require training for their volunteers. Many of these trainings must be carried out well in advance, so get involved and get trained before the pandemic hits.Front line volunteers working with infected persons will require more rigorous and extended training. If you hope to be involved in this way, it is very important that you get involved early.Some of these organizations do provide ""just-in-time"" trainings.This is short-notice training intended for immediate use in some critical task. In many cases, however, you will still need to be registered in advance as a volunteer so the appropriate agency will know to contact you., Especially if you don't have medical experience, the tasks you will be assigned may not be glamorous or exciting. Remember that whatever you are doing is still important, even if you can't see a direct effect. Here are some examples of tasks you might be assigned.Driving support vehicles
Training or coordinating other volunteers
Fundraising
Transporting supplies or coordinating supply operations
Answering phones or emails, or other administrative work

Drink extra water.,
Get extra sleep.,
Ease breathing difficulties with humidity.,
Avoid getting chilled.,
Keep up your energy with chicken broth.,
Avoid food and drinks that contain milk.",How to Get Rid of a Cold1," Having a drippy nose or a fever causes you to lose moisture. Make sure you drink enough so that you aren’t forcing your body to deal with both the cold and the physical stress of dehydration.When you sleep, keep a cup of water, juice, clear broth, or warm lemon water near your bed. If you sleep restlessly, this will enable you to take a few swallows each time you wake and avoid dehydration throughout the night. Avoid alcohol and coffee. Both will dehydrate you.
If you are urinating infrequently or passing dark or cloudy urine, these are signs that you are dehydrated.;
, Most adults require about 8 hours per night when they are healthy. If you are fighting off a cold, you will probably need more.Give yourself permission to nap. When you are sleepy, that is your body telling you what it needs.
Being fully rested will help boost your immune system and enable your body to fight the cold more effectively.

, If you have a stuffy nose or coughing, it can be very difficult to sleep at night. Try keeping the air in your bedroom moist with a cool-mist humidifier or a vaporizer. The better you sleep, the more energy you will have to fight off the virus.If you don’t have a humidifier or vaporizer you can quickly and cheaply make one. Put a pot of warm water on the radiator and let it slowly evaporate overnight.

, A low fever will make the air temperature around you feel colder. If you are so cold that you start shivering, this will cost your body energy that it could be using to fight the cold virus. If you have to go to work or school, bundle up with an extra warm layer of clothing like a big sweater. If you can stay home, add an extra blanket to your bed.


Try using a hot water bottle or sipping a cup of warm tea if you have trouble getting warm.

, The nutrients and salt will replenish your electrolytes. In addition, the warm steam will help clear your nose.If you have an appetite for something more substantial, you can add chunks of chicken, noodles, peas, carrots, and other nutritious vegetables to the broth.

, Milk (more precisely any kind of fat) increases the amount of mucus being created by your body. These products can be:

Products containing milk (including almond and soy milk).
Yogurt, pudding, cream.
Butter, margarine, cream cheese.
Most other products that are high in fats.

Stay warm.,
Keep the air moist.",How to Fight Off a Cold or Flu1," A healthy adult should get about eight hours of sleep at night. If you have a cold or the flu; however, you might find that you need a lot more.Give in to the urge to take a nap. You might find that you wake up feeling much better.
Sleeping allows your body to direct more energy to your immune system, which will help you fight the infection faster.;
, Your body loses water during a fever or when producing mucus. Be sure to drink enough so that you are replacing your fluids.Good drinks include water, juice, clear broth, or warm lemon water. The juice, broth, and lemon water will also help replenish your electrolytes.
Don’t drink alcohol or coffee because they are dehydrating.
The best way to avoid dehydration is to drink enough so that you do not become thirsty. If your urine is dark or cloudy, you need to drink more.

, This age-old remedy helps because it has anti-inflammatory properties and reduces congestion.The nourishment will also help you keep your strength for combating the infection.
The salt in the soup will top up your electrolytes.

, If you have a fever, even a low one, it may make you feel cold. This happens because your body temperature is higher relative to the temperature around you.


Put extra blankets on your bed or use a hot water bottle. However, don't overdo it with blankets. Over bundling, especially for babies, can actually increase your temperature and make you feel worse.
Keeping warm will reduce shivering and let your body direct more energy to your immune system.

, Using a cool-mist humidifier or a vaporizer will make it easier to breathe.Using it at night may help you sleep better because you may be less congested and may cough less.
If you don't have a commercial humidifier, you can make one by putting a pot of water on the radiator or handing a wet towel on a clothing dryer. The water will evaporate slowly into the air.

Into 1 cup of warm (body temperature), sterilized or distilled water, stir to dissolve ½ teaspoon of salt (or 1 package of Nasaline salt).,
Leaning over a basin (e.g., bathroom sink or tub), place the applicator’s silicone tip against the nose so that it completely seals the nostril.

,
As you slowly and evenly push the saline solution up into the nostril, breathe normally (or say aaahhh) through the mouth, refraining from swallowing.,
Repeat for your other nostril.,
Blow your nose gently to clear any remaining solution and mucus.,
Clean your Nasaline.",How to Use Nasaline,"  Gently fill the Nasaline applicator with the saline solution.;
,,  This process should take from 3 to 7 seconds for each nostril.  By reflex, your palate will close so that the solution will pour out of the other nostril.

,  It s recommended to flush 2 full syringes twice in each nostril once or twice a day, or as instructed by your physician.

,  If some of the saline solution remains in your nasal passages, it will trickle out within a few hours.  Or you can lean forward and tilt your head from side to side immediately after rinsing to release it.

,  When finished nasal rinsing, clean your Nasaline by completely pulling out the plunger from the syringe, removing the silicone tip and flushing all 3 parts with water.  You can also clean your Nasaline with a mild dishwashing liquid and rinse well.  Allow your Nasaline to air dry.

, Remove as much mucus as possible. Do not blow too hard. For best and safest results, press down on one nostril with your finger as you blow the other, and then do the same to the other nostril., After you have blown your nose or otherwise cleared your nasal passages, if you still cannot get air through then it is unlikely that the medication will be effective as it will not be able to travel far enough up the nasal passages., If you have blown your nose but still find that there is a lot of congestion, try these other home remedies to diminish the congestion in your nostrils. It is important for your nasal passages to be as clear as possible before using the medication. Some things to try include:Taking a hot shower. Heat can help to clear out your nasal passages.
Use a saline nasal spray.
Using a humidifier. Contrary to popular belief, dry air actually worsens nasal congestion. Moist air, on the other hand, can help to clear out your nostrils.
Drink plenty of water. Being well-hydrated can help to diminish congestion.

"
"
Treat congestion with steam.,
Apply a vapor rub to your chest when you sleep.,
Clear your nose with saline drops.,
Try decongestant medications if saline solution didn’t work.,

Go to the doctor if you are an adult with a severe infection.",How to Get Rid of a Cold2," Boil a pot of water and then add essential oils like eucalyptus or rosemary to the water. Put the pot on the table on a thick cork coaster and breathe in the steam. This will smell good, relax you, and help relieve the blockage in your nose.Maximize the amount of steam you inhale by using a towel to form a tent over your head and the pot. Inhale the steam for at least 10 minutes or until you get relief.
Children must be supervised so they don’t accidentally burn themselves on the hot water or hot pot.
Do not ingest the eucalyptus oil or allow a child to do so. It can be poisonous.

, This will help keep your nose clear as you lie flat. Apply it to the skin on your chest and inhale the vapor. Read and follow the instructions on the packaging when applying it.Do not apply it to your nostrils because this puts you at risk of inhaling small droplets into your lungs.

, If the drops just contain salt water, they are safe, even for children. They will help dry out the nose and make breathing easier. They are available over-the-counter without a prescription.Some saline sprays and drops contain more than just salt and water. Read the ingredients on the label to determine if they also contain preservatives. These preservatives may harm the cells in the lining of your nose. If you are using a spray with preservatives, do not use it more often than is recommended on the packaging. In addition, consult a doctor before using it if you are pregnant, nursing, or treating a child.

, These medications can be taken orally or as nasal sprays. They are available over-the-counter. They should only be used for a week at the longest, after which they may cause inflammation of the tissues in your nose, which will make your symptoms worse.

, The warmth will be soothing if your throat is sore from coughing. The salt may also help fight the infection.Mix at least 1/4th of a teaspoon of table salt into a glass of warm water until it is completely dissolved and you no longer see it. If you don’t mind the taste of the salt, you can add more to make it stronger.
Tip your head back and gargle. Children should be supervised during this process so that they do not choke.
Try to gargle for about one minute. Do not swallow the water when you are done because it has lots of germs from your throat in it. Spit it into the sink instead.

, This will also be effective against headaches or joint pain. Commonly used medications include ibuprofen or acetaminophen/paracetamol. Consult a doctor before using these medications if you are pregnant, nursing, or treating a child.Follow your doctor’s instructions or the directions on the packaging when determining the dosages, especially for children. Check the ingredients in any other cold medicines you may be taking to make sure they do not contain the same ingredients. If so, do not take them together because this increases your risk of overdosing.
Aspirin should not be given to children or teenagers because it is associated with Reye’s syndrome.

, Coughing is your body’s way of removing pathogens and irritants from your airways. Suppressing the cough may be necessary if you can’t sleep, but it may make it harder for your body to clear the virus from your system.Do not give cough syrups to children younger than four. For older children, follow the instructions on the bottle. If there are no instructions specific to your child’s age, consult a doctor.
Most pediatricians do not recommend giving cough medicines to any children, especially those under the age of eight, as they have not been shown to have much effect.

, There are several remedies that people use that are either known to be ineffective or do not have sufficient evidence to suggest that they are successful. If you do use alternative treatments, consult your doctor first because they may interact with other medications. These treatments include:Antibiotics. Colds are caused by viruses, not bacteria, so antibiotics will not help.
Echinacea. The evidence for the effectiveness of Echinacea is unclear. Some studies suggest it helps when you take it at the start of a cold, others suggest it is ineffective.
Vitamin C. The evidence is mixed. Some studies suggest that it may shorten the cold, others suggest it does not help.
Zinc. Some studies suggest that zinc may help when taken at the start of the cold. Other studies suggest it is not useful. Do not take zinc in the form of a nasal spray because it can cause you to lose your sense of smell.

, The doctor will check to make sure the infection is not something more serious than a common cold. Symptoms to watch out for include:A baby under three months old with a fever over 100.4°F (38°C)
A child between three months and two years old with has a fever and cold. Call your doctor and they will let you know if your child needs to be seen.

Fill a one-quart pot with water.,
Cover your head.,
Breathe.,
Use this technique frequently.,
Consider steaming on the go.",How to Use Steam to Relieve Sinus Pressure1," Boil the water on the stove for a minute or two or until it is steaming vigorously. Then remove the pot from the heat.Place the hot pot on a heat resistant mat on a table.

Avoid sugar.",How to Get over a Cold1," The average adult needs 7-8 hours of sleep per night, and sleep is even more important when your immune system is compromised. Make sure that you're well-rested: don't stay up too late, and sleep in when possible. Sleep gives your body time to heal.


Consider calling in sick at work--or going in late--to give yourself plenty of time to sleep in. You don't need to stay in bed all day unless you feel so inclined, but try at least to take it easy.;
, It is easy to become dehydrated when you're sick, and dry sinuses will only worsen your cold symptoms. Drink plenty of water, tea, and soup to minimize irritation.


Avoid drinking alcohol and sugary drinks, as even low consumption can weaken your immune system.Wait to resume these habits until you're well and your immune system is ready for the beating.
Consider using a humidifier in your bedroom to keep from breathing dry air at night. You can buy an electric humidifier at some department stores and drugstores.

, Your immune system is already compromised, so try to stay away from bacteria that might make your condition worse. Avoid hospitals, crowded areas, and other sick people; avoid any place where germs congregate. Wash your hands with antibacterial hand sanitizer several times throughout the day.Consider carrying a small bottle of hand sanitizer about with you. Whenever you come into contact with germs or sick people, cleanse your hands.

, Sugar consumption weakens your immune system, and eating a lot of sugar-heavy foods may reduce your body's ability to recover from cold symptoms. There is some medical disagreement as to whether avoiding sugar during a cold can actually reduce the duration, but it is generally accepted that avoiding sugar in general is better for your immune system.


People tend to get sick at times when they're eating a lot of sugar: times of stress, and during the winder months. Stress itself weakens the immune system, so the combination can be dangerous.It is best to avoid excess sugar before these times, so that you don't compound the problem.
Avoid candy, soda, and other sweets. Fruit juice is sugary, but it is also typically high in Vitamin C--just try to avoid juices that have a lot of sugar added to them.
Many other animals are able to convert sugar into vitamin C, but humans cannot. Sugar competes with vitamin C in the body, so high sugar consumption often results in low vitamin C concentrations.

, The CDC recommends that you use warm water and soap. Scrub your hands for about 20 seconds, or about the amount of time it takes to sing the ""Happy Birthday"" song twice., You should warm the water for 5 seconds at a time if using a microwave. It should be at body-temperature, or ""lukewarm.""


Do not use water that is not micro-filtered, boiled, or distilled to rinse your sinuses. Tap water may contain microorganisms that could cause illness., The correct amount of water should be 8 oz. (240 ml). Your water line should be at the dotted fill line of the bottle. If you are using a Kids Sinus Rinse kit, you will use 4 oz. (120 ml) of water.

, Don't use your teeth to tear the packet.

, Make sure you screw the cap on tightly so it doesn't fall off in the next step.

, This will allow the saline mixture to dissolve into the water.

, Tilt your head down and breathe through your mouth, not your nose.

, Keep your mouth open, because the mixture can drain from your mouth as well as the opposite nostril. This also reduces pressure on the ears.

, Squeeze until the solution begins to drain from the opposite nostril.

, You can use up to half the solution per nostril, but you should always use at least one-quarter of the solution for each.

, Pinching your nose entirely shut would put too much pressure on your eardrums. Then, try sniffing in the remaining solution to help clear out the nasopharyngeal area (at the back of your nasal passages).


Tilt your head to the opposite side to expel any remaining solution from your sinuses or nasal passage.
Spit out any solution that reaches the back of your throat.

, Use the rest of the solution.

, Never store leftover solution. It can breed bacteria.

, Rinse the cap, tube, and rinse bottle with water. Then, add a drop of dishwashing detergent to the bottle and fill it with water. Put the cap on and shake the bottle well.

Evaluate your needs.,
Review tissue types.,
Watch out for sales.",How to Use a Tissue1," The tissue type you choose depends on your current needs. Spend some time considering why you need tissues.


If you have a cold, more heavy-duty tissue types may be necessary. You also may want to consider softer tissues or tissues that use aloe vera or lotion. This can prevent chafing from blowing your nose too often.
If you're just using tissue for day-to-day allergies and occasional nose blowing, you can probably opt for a cheaper brand that is less soft and does not have any special lotions or creams.;
, There are many different types and brands of facial tissues. Spend some time evaluating tissue types before making a decision.


Consumer Reports runs tests reviewing the effectiveness of various types of tissues. Keep an eye out for such reports when making your decision. This can help you choose the most durable tissue available.Keep in mind your use of tissues can affect how effective they are. If you have rough skin, for example, you might want to opt for a 2-ply or 3-ply product to prevent tearing., If you're simply looking for tissues for day-to-day use, you might just want to buy tissue at sales prices. Keep your eyes peeled at the supermarket. You can also look for coupons in your local newspaper. If tissues are being sold in bulk prices, like 10 boxes for $10, it might be a good idea to stock up so they'll last you awhile.

Fill a one-quart pot with water.,
Add 1-2 drops of an essential oil.,
Use dry herbs.,
Always test any herb for sensitivity.",How to Use Steam to Relieve Sinus Pressure2," Boil the water on the stove for a minute or two or until it is steaming vigorously. Then remove the pot from the heat.

, Start with 1 drop/quart of water. The following essential oils have either antibacterial, antifungal or antiseptic properties, meaning they can kill bacteria and other microorganisms that can infect the sinuses:



Spearmint or peppermint - Both peppermint and spearmint contain menthol which has antiseptic and immune-boosting properties.Thyme, sage, and oregano - These herbs boost the immune system and have antibacterial properties. They also increase circulation of the blood by opening up blood vessels.Lavender - Lavender is known as a soothing herb that also has antibacterial properties. It will help you feel calm and relaxed and can relieve anxiety and depression.Black walnut oil - If you know you have a fungal sinus infection, add black walnut oil, which has antifungal, antimicrobial, and antiseptic properties.Tea tree oil - Tea tree oil has antiviral, antifungal, and antiseptic properties and has provided relief to some people suffering from sinus infections., If you don’t have the above essential oils on hand, you can substitute ½ teaspoon of dried herb per quart of water.


Once you add the herbs, boil for another minute, turn off the heat and move the pot to a comfortable area and begin steaming.

, Each time you try a new herb, give yourself a test to make sure that you don't have any adverse reaction, such as sneezing or skin irritation. Make the concoction and steam your face with the new herb for about a minute. Then, take your face away from the steam for 10 minutes and wait.


If you don't notice any irritation or other reaction, reheat the water and do the full steam treatment.

Use a humidifier.,
Take hot showers.,
Drink fluids.,
Keep your head elevated.",How to Use Steam to Relieve Sinus Pressure3," To help improve the health of your sinuses, place a humidifier in your bedroom while you sleep. A humidifier produces steam and moist air, which will help clear out the nasal passages.When your nasal passages are blocked, you need to focus on keeping your nasal passages and sinuses moist. Although many people think that if you have have a runny nose, that dry air is the trick, dry air only further irritates the membranes in your nasal passage.
Humidifiers are especially good during the wintertime because the air in most homes is very dry due to central heating.Even placing a hot water bottle near the ear may have a similar effect and help to draw out ear fluid.

, Taking a long, hot shower works very similarly to the steam treatments described above. The hot water from the shower creates warm, moist air that is useful in clearing out blocked nasal passages and relieving sinus pressure.You also achieve a similar beneficial effect by placing a warm compress on your face to help open up your nasal passages and relieve any pressure you might be feeling in your sinuses., Make sure that you drink lots of water (at least 8 full glasses a day) because this will thin out your mucus and can help prevent sinuses blockages, and thereby ease pressure.Thinned out mucus is much more likely to drain. Whenever you feel the beginnings of sinus pressure, make a concerted effort to stay hydrated., When you go to sleep at night, place a couple of pillows beneath your head so that it is elevated. This will make breathing easier and keep the sinus pressure from building up."

Use nasal decongestants to relieve sinus symptoms.,
Use cough suppressants to relieve coughing.,
Use over-the-counter pain relievers to alleviate headaches, sore throats, and other pain.",How to Get over a Cold2," Decongestants will not reduce the duration of your cold, but they may make it easier to tolerate the symptoms. These drugs are available in pill, chewable, and liquid form; you may also consider using steroidal nasal sprays. Decongestants are generally safe to take, provided that you follow the dosage instructions listed on the package. You can find nonprescription decongestants in the aisles of most pharmacies, drugstores, and grocery stores.


The active ingredient in most commercial decongestants is either pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine. Decongestants work by narrowing blood vessels in the lining of the nose. This reduces how much blood flows through the area so that swollen tissue inside the nose shrinks and air can pass through more easily.
Do not use decongestant medications for more than 3 days, lest your body becomes dependent on them. If you become dependent on these medicines, your nose may feel even more stuffed up when you quit using them. This is known as the “rebound effect.”, You can find over-the-counter cough syrup in most pharmacies and grocery stores, and you can find soothing cough drops--medicated and non-medicated--in the same places. Some cough syrups are designed to facilitate your function in everyday life, while some (such as Nyquil and Z-Quil, and any medicine ending in ""PM"") will help you sleep when your coughing keeps you awake.Dextromethorphan is the primary active ingredient in most cough medicines. It is safe to ingest in moderation, but do not drink more than the recommended dose--especially if the bottle contains the expectorant guaifenesin--and avoid taking it if you are on antidepressants.
Consider carrying cough drops around with you throughout the day. Cough syrup lasts much longer than cough drops, but cough drops tend to be herbal, non-medicated relievers that will not make you drowsy.

, Pain medications will not shorten the duration of your cold, but they may make some of the symptoms more bearable. You should only use these drugs to temporarily relieve severe pain; do not use them habitually, and be careful not to develop a dependence.


The active ingredient in most over-the-counter pain medications is either acetaminophen or any of several nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Although these products are effective at relieving pain, not everyone responds to them the same way--so if one drug doesn't work for you, another might.Make sure to follow the dosages listed on the packaging. Never take more than the suggested dose, and never take pain relievers for longer than recommended. ""Nonprescription"" does not mean ""nontoxic"". An overdose of acetaminophen, for instance, can cause liver failure that can lead to liver transplant or death.

Try using menthol or honey to relieve coughing and sore throat pain.,
Try using menthol, eucalyptus, and camphor oil to open your sinuses.,
Consider taking herbal supplements to boost your immune system.,
Drink hot liquids to relieve nasal congestion.,
Gargle with warm salt water to relieve a sore throat.,
Apply hot packs to your face to open congested sinuses.,
Blow your nose often to relieve congestion.,
Keep your head elevated to avoid becoming congested when you sleep.",How to Get over a Cold3," If you don't want to take over-the-counter pain cough suppressants or pain relievers, you can use natural compounds to similar effect.


Consider using menthol--the active chemical in mint--to relieve your throat symptoms. Keep a package of Altoids with you, or gargle with mint-flavored mouthwash, and use the mild numbing effect of the menthol to soothe your pain.
Consider using honey as a cough suppressant. Researchers have tested it against dextromethorphan and found honey even more effective. This trick may be especially useful for treating children who refuse the taste of over-the-counter cough suppressants.Be careful not to over-use honey, however, as the sweetness that suppresses coughs may also weaken the immune system in large doses.

, Place a small dab of mentholated salve under your nose to help open breathing passages and help restore the irritated skin at the base of the nose. Menthol, eucalyptus, and camphor all have mild numbing ingredients that may help relieve the pain of a nose rubbed raw., Support your immune system with vitamins, herbs, and other natural aids: vitamin C, zinc, garlic, ginseng, echinacea, etc. Consider taking a multivitamin for general support. These supplements will not magically cure your cold, but they may strengthen your body and enable it to fight the infection more effectively.You can find immune-support supplements in health-food stores and many grocery stores. Research the effects of any herbal supplement before you put it into your body--but know that these herbs and vitamins typically aren't nearly so potentially hazardous as many over-the-counter pharmaceuticals.Echinacea has been touted as an ""immune stimulant"", but its supposed ability to prevent or reduce the severity of colds is disputed within the medical community. Laboratory tests have shown garlic working against bacteria, viruses, and fungi, although further research is pending. A number of small studies—and staunch practitioners of eastern medicine—suggest that ginseng can powerfully stimulate immune function.

, Hot liquids help relieve nasal congestion, prevent dehydration, and soothe the inflamed membranes that irritate your nose and throat. Hot tea, hot soup, hot water with lemon juice or hot herbal tea are good choices. Make sure that the liquid isn't uncomfortably hot, or else you may scald your throat and put yourself into even greater discomfort.If you're so congested you can't sleep at night, try a hot toddy, an age-old remedy. Make a cup of hot herbal tea. Add one teaspoon of honey and one small shot (about 1 ounce) of whiskey or bourbon. Limit yourself to one. Too much alcohol inflames the sinus membranes, which is counterproductive if you're trying to treat a cold.

, Gargle at least once each hour with 1 tsp (5 g) of salt dissolved in 8 fl oz (240 mL) of warm water to reduce swelling and relieve your discomfort. If you have post-nasal drip--mucus running down from the back of your nose into your throat--gargle often to prevent more throat irritation.Consider gargling with apple cider vinegar.The high levels of acidity can kill bacteria in your throat--plus, apple cider vinegar helps boost your immunity by increasing your white blood cell count, and it is a natural expectorant that kills bacteria and loosens phlegm.
Consider gargling with antibacterial mouthwash. The mouthwash may not relieve your symptoms, necessarily, but it will kill some of the bacteria in your throat so that the germs propagate more slowly.

, You can buy reusable hot packs at a drugstore, but you can make your own at home. Take a damp washcloth and heat it for 30 seconds in a microwave. You can also run hot faucet water (or pour hot/boiling water) over a washcloth until it is thoroughly soaked. Before you apply the hot pack to your face, make sure that it isn't going to scald you.

, Blow gently so that you don't irritate your sinuses or disturb your inner ear--hard blowing could cause nosebleeds and ear infections. Try holding one nostril shut and blowing out of the other, then switching nostrils.


Blow your nose into your hands during a hot shower, and let the water wash away any mucus. This is a great way to completely--if temporarily--clear your sinuses.
Consider using a fresh roll of toilet paper as a cheap alternative to tissues. Keep the roll near you in case you need to wipe your nose, blow your nose, or sneeze.

, Prop your head on one or two extra pillows; make sure that they're clean. You may become congested at night as fluids flow to the back of your throat, especially if you usually sleep on your back. Consider sleeping on your side or your stomach to keep your throat and nose open.

Try a multi-symptom medication.",How to Get over the Flu2," A pain medication can keep you more comfortable by reducing the pain of a sore throat and achy muscles.It will also reduce your fever.Don't double dose. Many flu and cold medications contain acetaminophen, so don't take it separately unless you're sure it's not in your other medications. Check the labels for the drug, as medications must list the individual drugs and dosages on the package.

, Nasal sprays can relieve congestion.


Nasal decongestant sprays contain medications to help with congestion. They are safe to use any time of day, even at night, as they only affect the nose. Be sure to follow the time schedule on the back of the bottle. Pill decongestants can make you jittery, keeping you awake, but sprays won't because they work locally.However, you should stop using them after 3 days, as after that amount of time, they can make congestion worse.Nasal saline sprays can be used in conjunction with decongestant sprays because they do not contain medications, just sterile saltwater. They can loosen mucus and provide moisture to nasal membranes. They can also partially clear out the virus and bacteria from the nose., Antihistamines can reduce symptoms such as a runny nose or watery eyes. However, be aware that some antihistamines can make you drowsy., Cough syrups can help with many flu symptoms, making you more comfortable.Cough suppressants lessen the effects of a dry cough.Cough expectorants are best for a wet cough that produces mucus. Expectorants bring up mucus from the chest, relieving congestion. Bringing up that mucus can help you get over the sickness faster., Many over-the-counter medications treat multiple symptoms at once and can simplify the process, such as Nyquil.


When using a medication like Nyquil, always check what medications are in it before taking anything else. For instance, Nyquil Cold and Flu Nighttime Relief Liquid has a cough suppressant, a pain reliever, and an antihistamine in it, so you wouldn't want to take those medications separately while taking Nyquil.

Use the tissue properly.,
Know the proper times to use a tissue.,
Carry extras on hand when you have a cold.,
Wash your hands frequently when sick.,
Know when to see a doctor.",How to Use a Tissue2," Once you've selected your tissue type, you can begin to use your tissue. Using a tissue is fairly simple. With the tissue in your hand, place it under your nose to catch the mucus. Hold one finger over one nostril and push air out of the opposite nostril until your nose is clear. Then, repeat on the opposite side. This may take more than one tissue. Be sure to carefully fold up tissue and throw away after use.


If you have a particularly harsh cold, consider folding the tissue in half or using two tissues to blow your nose. This can protect your hands from getting contaminated with mucus as the tissue is less likely to break.
If you use the tissue to dab your nose, do so gently. When dabbing up mucus, use light dotting motions instead of rubbing, which causes friction and irritation.
Always dispose of tissues after using them, especially when you have a cold.

, Understand when you should use a tissue. Tissues can be used to help clear mucus and also to prevent the spread of colds.


If you have a cold or flu, you can dramatically reduce the risk of it spreading through proper tissue use. Exposure to airborne germs is the number one cause of colds. In fact, 58% of people who work from home do not catch colds over the winter months. If you have a cold, use a tissue each time you sneeze and cough in public to fully cover your nose and mouth.At home, blow your nose as often as you see fit. Germs and bacteria that cause colds are expelled from the body through snot and mucus., You can buy travel sized containers of tissue at your local supermarket. Keep these in your purse or pocket so you always have a tissue on hand in public.

, If you have a cold, or if there's a cold going around your school or office, wash your hands frequently. This can help prevent the spread of germs. You should also wash your hands frequently when out in public to keep yourself from picking up a cold, especially during cold and flu season.


Scrub your hands for 20 seconds with soap and water. To keep track of time, you can hum the ""Happy Birthday"" song to yourself twice. Rinse your hands thoroughly in lukewarm, clear running water.Wash your hands before touching your nose, eyes, or mouth. If you wear contacts, always wash your hands before handling or removing them.You should also wash your hands after blowing your nose or coughing into them.
If you don't have easy access to soap and water, carry an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with you.

, The common cold does not usually warrant medical attention. However, if your symptoms persist for more than a couple of weeks and if you develop a high fever, blurred vision, nausea, or other symptoms make an appointment with your doctor.See a doctor if you regularly see blood in your mucus after blowing your nose, or if you have thick or green mucus for more than a week accompanied with pain around face and eyes.

Do not use unripe or uncooked elderberries, as they may be toxic.If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, do not take elderberries or elderberry extract.
If you have an autoimmune disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, consult with your doctor before taking elderberries or elderberry extract.
Elderberry may interact with diabetic medication, laxatives, chemotherapy drugs, or immunosuppressants. If you take any of these medications, consult your doctor before taking elderberry.

, Pineapples are rich in an enzyme called bromelain, which is used in medicines for reducing swelling and inflammation of the nose and sinuses.You can get bromelain by eating two slices of fresh pineapple or drinking pineapple juice daily.
If you are allergic to latex, wheat, celery, carrot, fennel, cypress pollen, or grass pollen, you might experience an allergic reaction to bromelain.
Do not eat soybeans or potatoes with pineapple, as they both contain substances that hamper the effect of bromelain.

, Getting enough sleep is important for your body to heal itself. Try to lie on your back when you’re congested. If you’re a side sleeper, sleep on the side that is least congested. Try to get a full 24-hour period of rest, if possible.Sleeping with your head propped up on a pillow can help keep mucus from blocking your sinuses. The pillow should support the natural curve of your neck and be comfortable. A pillow that’s too high can cause muscle strain in your back, neck, and shoulders. Choose a pillow that will keep your neck aligned with your chest and lower back.Avoid sleeping on your stomach. This can make it difficult for you to breathe when you’re congested. It can also put strain on your neck and shoulders.
Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and sugary foods 4-6 hours before bed.
Avoid exercise 2 hours before bedtime. Regular, moderate exercise can help you sleep better, especially if you exercise in the afternoon.Talk with your doctor if you frequently sleep poorly.

Irrigate your nasal passages with a Neti pot or syringe.,
Try making your own saline solution.,
Use a humidifier.,
Try steam treatment.,
Eat spicy foods.",How to Treat Nasal Infection Naturally2," Saline sprays add moisture to your nasal passages. It can also help clean them of crusts and mucus.You can purchase over-the-counter saline sprays at most drug stores and pharmacies. These sprays come as pressurized canisters or pump spray bottles.


Ask your doctor or pharmacist what type of saline solution is best for you. Hypertonic saline sprays have a slightly higher concentration of salt than is found in your body tissues. Isotonic saline sprays have the same salt concentration as your body. Hypotonic saline sprays have a slightly lower concentration of salt than your body.If you have sensitive skin, use a saline spray with a sodium content of less than 1%. The body's saline concentration is 0.9% (which is why replacement fluids given in medical emergencies is a 0.9% saline solution.)Nasal sprays may sting lightly or cause irritation if they have a sodium chloride content higher than 0.9%.
Most saline sprays are safe to use as often as you like. If you experience nosebleeds, discontinue using your saline spray. If bleeding or irritation continues, consult your doctor., If you use a pressurized canister, wash it at least once a week. When using a pressurized canister, blow your nose once to clear it of mucus. Shake the canister a few times. Keep your head upright and breathe out slowly. Hold the canister up to one nostril and hold your other nostril closed. Press down on the canister as you inhale slowly through the open nostril. Repeat for the other nostril.


When using a pump spray, blow your nose once to clear it of mucus. Lightly shake the bottle a few times. Tilt your head forward slightly and exhale. Hold the pump to one nostril and hold the other nostril closed. Squeeze the pump as you inhale through your nose. Repeat for the other nostril.
Try not to sneeze or blow your nose immediately after using a saline spray.
Follow the directions on the packaging. Otherwise you may end up wasting medication or causing further irritation.

, Most Neti pots and syringes come with prepackaged solution (or dry packets). If you use a Neti pot or syringe to irrigate your nasal passages, start with once per day. If you feel better, you can increase to twice a day.Nasal irrigation has minimal side effects. You may experience a slight burning or irritation when you first start irrigating.Lean over the sink so you are looking down into the basin. You can also do this in the shower or tub to avoid splashing. Breathe through your mouth. Tilt your head at a 45-degree angle.Place the spout of the Neti pot into your upper nostril so it forms a comfortable seal. Do not press the spout against the middle part of your nose. Tip the Neti pot so the solution pours into your upper nostril. It will drain through your nasal passages and out the other nostril. Continue breathing through your mouth.
Once the pot is empty, breathe out firmly through both nostrils. This will help clear out extra salt water and mucus. Gently blow your nose into a tissue.
Always rinse out the extra salt water and wash the Neti pot or syringe with soap and water after use.
It’s normal for your nose to “run” for up to 30 minutes after irrigation. Carry a tissue with you to wipe up any drops.
If your nose stings or burns, use less salt next time.

, To cut down on the expense of your saline treatments or take more control over the ingredients of the solution, you can make your own.


Use ¼ tsp kosher or pickling salt, ¼ tsp baking soda, and 8 ounces of warm distilled or boiled water. It’s important to use water that has been distilled or boiled and cooled because tap water may contain amoebas or parasites.

, Dry air can irritate and worsen your sinusitis. Using a humidifier will help keep the air moist. This will help your sinuses drain and will keep your symptoms from getting worse.Aim for the right humidity. The air in your home should range between 30-55% humidity. If the humidity is too high, it may encourage the growth of mold and dust mites, both of which are common allergens. If the humidity is too low, you may get dry eyes and develop throat or sinus irritations. You can purchase a humidistat to measure your home’s humidity at most hardware stores.
Keep your humidifier clean. Mold can easily grow on these devices and spread throughout the house.
Adding a few drops of an essential oil such as eucalyptus to the water in the humidifier can help reduce congestion.Consider getting a houseplant. Plants can help regulate indoor humidity through transpiration, where flowers, leaves and stems of the plant release water vapor into the air. They also help clean the air of carbon dioxide and other pollutants. Good indoor plants include aloe vera, bamboo palm, weeping fig, Chinese evergreen, and various species of philodendron and dracaena., Inhaling steam from a hot shower or bowl of hot water is an excellent way to moisten your nasal passages and reduce congestion. Some studies suggest that warm showers also help reduce anxiety and stress.Limit your time in hot showers to 5-10 minutes. People with sensitive skin should only take a hot shower once or twice a week to prevent their skin from drying out and becoming irritated.
A mentholated “shower bomb” can help reduce congestion, but some people experience airway irritation from their contents. If buying a store-bought shower bomb, be sure to read the ingredients and warning labels before you buy it.
To use a steam bowl, pour hot water into a temperature-safe bowl. Place the bowl on a sturdy, secure space such as a table or counter.Lean your head over the bowl. Don’t get so close that the steam or water burns your face.
Cover your head and the bowl with a light cotton towel. Inhale the steam for 10 minutes.
You can add 2-3 drops of eucalyptus oil or other decongesting oil to the water to help clear your congestion. Keep in mind that eucalyptus is a very strong scent and people with asthma or those who are sensitive to smells may be overwhelmed by the scent.
Use 2-4 times daily., Some research suggests that spicy foods, especially foods such as horseradish and hot peppers, may help clear congested sinuses.The capsaicin in peppers and other spicy foods may help thin mucus and promote sinus drainage."

Consume more Vitamin C. Strengthening your immunity will help your body heal faster and lessen your risk for future infection.,
Incorporate probiotics into your diet.,
Take zinc.,
Consume more vitamin E. Vitamin E is an antioxidant that protects body tissue from damage caused by bacteria and viruses.,
Avoid foods that cause inflammation.,
Stop smoking.",How to Treat Nasal Infection Naturally3," Research has shown that vitamin C plays a vital role as an antioxidant. It strengthens your immune system and lowers your risk of various chronic diseases.Your body does not produce or store vitamin C. If you consume more than your body can use, it will be expelled in your urine. The recommended daily intake is between 65-90mg a day, and no more than 2,000mg a day.Keep in mind that low doses of vitamin C may aid in prevention, but will do little to fight an acute cold or sinusitis. Very high doses of vitamin C (1000mg-2000mg) may help kill virus or bacteria.The best way to increase your consumption of vitamin C is by adding more nutrient-rich foods to your diet. The following foods are rich in vitamin C and other essential nutrients:Citrus fruits (e.g., oranges, grapefruits) and juice, red and green peppers, and kiwifruit have very high levels of vitamin C.
Broccoli, strawberries, cantaloupe, baked potatoes, and tomatoes also have vitamin C.


People who smoke need more vitamin C than people who don’t smoke. This is because cigarette smoke increases the amount of vitamin C your body needs to repair the damage free radicals do to your cells. If you smoke, take 35mg more vitamin C per day than the recommended dose for nonsmokers., Probiotics are microorganisms that are naturally found in our digestive systems and in certain foods. Research has shown that probiotics can reduce the severity and duration of symptoms of illnesses like colds and flu.Probiotics also help boost your body’s production of cells that fight infections.


You can find probiotics in yogurt, some types of milk, and certain soy products. Look for products that contain Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium strains. Make sure the product says “contains live cultures.”Probiotics are also available as dietary supplements.
Consult with your doctor before taking probiotics if you have a weakened immune system or are currently taking immunosuppressant drugs. Antibiotic drugs may reduce the effectiveness of probiotics., Zinc is an essential trace mineral found in many of the foods you may eat on a regular basis, such as red meats, shellfish, or cheese. Zinc has antibiotic properties that help protect cells in your body from damage caused by bacteria and viruses.Some studies have shown that zinc can help reduce symptoms caused by the common cold.Adults should aim to consume between 8-12mg of zinc daily.Good dietary sources of zinc include shellfish (especially oysters), red meat, and poultry. Other good sources include beans, nuts, whole grains, and dairy products.Eating a good diet and taking a multivitamin supplement should give you all the zinc you need in most cases.
If you do need more zinc, such as when you’re trying to fight off a cold, you can find zinc in many supplements. Easily absorbed forms of zinc include zinc picolinate, zinc citrate, zinc acetate, zinc glycerate, and zinc monomethionine. Do not take high doses of zinc for more than a few days without consulting with your doctor.

, It also boosts your immune system, helps form red blood cells, and keeps blood from clotting.The recommended daily intake for adults was 15mg per day, but has recently been raised to 50mg or 400IU.Look for supplements that contain at least some gamma tocopherol (the most effective type of Vitamin E), not only the less effective alpha tocopherol.Good dietary sources of vitamin E include vegetable oils, almonds, peanuts, hazelnuts, sunflower seeds, spinach, and broccoli.The highest safe level of vitamin E supplements for adults is 1500 IU per day for natural forms, and 1000 IU per day for synthetic forms. Ask your doctor which amount is best for you.
Eating vitamin E in foods is not harmful or risky. However, taking very high doses of vitamin E in supplement form may increase your risk of serious bleeding within the brain. Pregnant women who take very high levels of vitamin E may also increase the risk of birth defects., Inflammation happens when a part of the body becomes reddened, swollen, and painful in reaction to an injury or infection. Nasal infections result in inflammation, and certain foods can slow down your body’s ability to heal this inflammation.Try to avoid the following foods to avoid inflammation:


Refined carbohydrates, such as white bread, pastries, and doughnuts
Fried and greasy foods
Sugar-sweetened beverages
Red meats such as veal, ham, or steak (limit to once per week if possible)
Processed meats such as hot dogs
Margarine, shortening, and lard

, In addition to being unhealthy for your body in general, smoking irritates the linings of your sinuses. Cigarette smoke, even secondhand smoke, is linked to recurrent sinusitis.Secondhand smoke contributes to as many as 40% of the chronic sinusitis cases in the US each year."
"
Check for indicators of an infection.,
Consider how long you have been experiencing symptoms.,
Avoid changes in external stimuli.,
Consult with your doctor.,
Consult an ENT specialist.",How to Treat Nasal Infection Naturally4," Sinusitis can be hard to diagnose, especially since the symptoms are similar to that of a cold. Acute sinusitis often occurs after you have a cold, and symptoms get worse after 5-7 days. Symptoms of chronic sinusitis are usually a bit milder, but last much longer. Common symptoms of sinusitis include:Headache and fever
Pressure in the forehead, temples, cheeks, nose, jaw, teeth, behind the eyes, or at the top of the head
Facial tenderness or swelling, especially around the eyes or cheeks
Nasal stuffiness, loss of smell
Nasal discharge (usually yellowish green) or post-nasal drip (feeling a sensation of fluid dripping down the back of your throat)
Cough and sore throat
Bad breath
Fatigue

, Sinusitis can be acute (lasting less than 4 weeks) or chronic (lasting longer than 12 weeks).Acute sinusitis has many causes, but viral infection is the most common culprit, causing 90-98% of cases.This type of acute sinusitis will usually get better within 7-14 days.
Chronic sinusitis also has several causes, but allergies are the most common. You may also be more likely to have chronic sinusitis if you smoke or have asthma.

, Sinusitis is common during seasonal changes that may trigger colds or allergies. Changes in your environment or hazardous chemicals or particulate in the air may also trigger sinusitis.Allergens such as pollen or dust are common causes of sinusitis.
Cigarette smoke and hazardous fumes irritate nasal tissue, which can cause sinusitis.
Changes in pressure, such as when you scuba dive, fly, or climb high altitudes, can cause sinusitis.
Extreme temperatures or sudden changes in temperature can also cause sinusitis.

, Some cases of sinusitis may be caused by bacterial infections. These types of sinusitis may be more severe and may need to be treated by antibiotics. Because the symptoms of bacterial, viral, and allergic sinusitis are similar, it’s important to see a doctor so s/he can diagnose and treat you properly.Tell your doctor if you are pregnant. Also tell your doctor if you recently had any surgery related to dental problems or physical injuries.
Seek professional help immediately if you have a high fever (above 104F) or are experiencing shortness of breath. These could be signs of a more serious condition.
Rare complications associated with chronic sinusitis include blood clots, abscesses, meningitis, orbital cellulitis, and osteomyelitis, an infection that spreads to the bones in the face.
Do not take antibiotics for sinusitis unless your doctor has prescribed them. Only 2-10% of sinusitis cases are caused by bacterial infections. Antibiotics will only treat bacterial sinusitis. It will not help other types.Using antibiotics when you don’t need them can increase your risk of developing antibiotic-resistant infections.If your symptoms have lasted longer than 8 weeks, your doctor may request imaging tests, such as an x-ray, CT scan, or MRI. Your doctor may also order an allergy test to determine whether allergies are causing your sinusitis.

, If your symptoms last longer than 8 weeks, your doctor may refer you to an otolaryngologist (Ear-Nose-Throat, or ENT doctor). An ENT specialist can perform a nasal endoscopy using a fiber optic scope to examine your sinuses.


In some cases, your ENT doctor may suggest an endoscopic sinus surgery. This can help remove structural blockage from a deviated septum or polyp, damaged or swollen tissue, or other problems causing your sinusitis."

Place a clean, airtight container on a flat surface.,
Measure out your dry ingredients.,
Pour one cup of boiled or distilled water into the clean airtight container.",How to Use a Nasal Rinse1," To begin making your nasal rinse, make sure you have a container that will be suitable for mixing and storage.


This container should not contain any dangerous plastics, or be a non-reusable container.
Glass or BPA-free plastic are both good container materials to consider.
Always remember to wash your hands before and after creating your nasal rinse. This will avoid cross contamination and the introduction of microorganisms or viruses.;
, Take a measuring spoon and look for the spoon with ½ teaspoon indicator.


Get the container with the pickling salt, and dip your measuring spoon inside the container.
You will get more than a ½ teaspoon of salt, so make sure to use a knife to level off the measuring spoon.
This will give you an exact measurement of the salt.
Repeat this process to measure out a ½ teaspoon of baking soda.
Set aside your salt and baking soda.

, Begin creating your nasal rinse.


Put your measured salt into the boiled or distilled water.
Stir the mixture until the salt and baking soda have dissolved, or until the water is clear.
Wait until the solution cools to a lukewarm temperature before using it.
A homemade nasal rinse can be stored for 3 days at room temperature.

Take the combination of gender and age into consideration.,
Look for a family history of asthma.,
Take note of any allergies.,
Avoid exposure to tobacco smoke.,
Lower your stress levels.,
Stay away from the air pollution in your environment.,
Take your medications into consideration.,
Maintain a healthy weight.Many studies have found a link between increased weight and increased risk of asthma.,
See a doctor even for mild symptoms.,
Notice excessive coughing.,
Listen for noise when you exhale.,
Take note of unusual shortness of breath.,
Be on the watch for rapid breathing.To get more oxygen in the constricted lungs, the body increases its respiration rate.,
Don't ignore cold or flu symptoms.,
Seek medical attention if you can't breathe, even without exertion.Normally, the shortness of breath caused by activity in asthmatics gets better with rest.,
Check your respiration rate.,
Take your pulse.,
Look for a bluish tinge to your skin.,
See if you're tensing your neck and chest muscles.When we breathe heavily or are in respiratory distress, we engage accessory (not usually central to breathing) muscles.,
Check for chest tightness or pain.,
Listen for worsening noise during respiration.In mild and moderate symptoms, the whistling and wheezing is only heard on exhalation.,
Treat asthma symptoms as soon as possible.,
Seek emergency attention for severe asthma symptoms.These symptoms suggest you're having an acute attack, and your body is struggling to draw enough air to function.,
Provide your doctor with your medical history.The information you give should be as accurate as possible.,
Submit to a physical examination.The doctor might examine some or all of the following during your exam: your ears, eyes, nose, throat, skin, chest and lungs during the exam.,
Allow the doctor to confirm the diagnosis with a spirometry test.,
Do a peak air flow test.This is similar to spirometry, and measures how much air you can exhale.,
Ask the doctor to do a methacholine challenge test.,
Test your response to asthma medication.Sometimes your doctor will forgo these tests and just provide asthma medication to see if you get better.",How to Know if You Have Asthma," In the US, boys under 18 years have a 54% higher rate of asthma than girls. But by 20, female asthma sufferers outnumber the males. After 35 this gap grows, with 10.1% of women having asthma compared to 5.6% of men. After menopause the rate decreases for females, and the gap narrows but does not completely disappear.Experts have a few theories on why gender and age seem to affect asthma risk:


Increased atopy (a predisposition to allergic sensitivity) in male adolescents.
Smaller airway size in male adolescents compared to females.Sex hormone fluctuations during premenstrual, menstrual, and menopausal years in women.
Studies that re-introduced hormones for menopausal women had an increase in newly diagnosed asthma.;
, Experts have found more than 100 genes that associated with asthma and allergies. Research done on families — especially twins — suggests that asthma is caused by a shared hereditary factor. A 2009 study found that family history was actually the strongest predictor of whether someone will develop asthma. If comparing families with normal, moderate, and high genetic risk for asthma, moderate risk subjects were 2.4 times more likely to develop asthma, and high risk subjects 4.8 times more likely.Ask your parents and other relatives if there is a history of asthma in your family.
If you are adopted, your biological parents may have provided a family history to your adoptive family.

, Research has linked an immune protein antibody called ""IgE"" with the development of asthma. If you have high IgE levels, you're also more likely to inherit a predisposition to developing allergies.When there's IgE in the blood, the body experiences an inflammatory allergic reaction that causes airway constriction, rashes, itchiness, watery eyes, wheezing, etc.


Note an allergic reaction you may have to common triggers, including food, roaches, animals, mold, pollen and dust mites.
If you have allergies, you also have an increased risk of developing asthma.
If you experience severe allergic reactions but can't identify the trigger, as your doctor for allergy testing. He or she will expose small patches of your skin to different types of allergens to look for allergic changes.

, When we inhale particles into our lungs, the body's reaction is to cough it out. These particles can also trigger an inflammatory response and asthma symptoms. The more exposure you get to tobacco smoke, the greater risk you have of developing asthma. If you're addicted to smoking, talk to your healthcare professional about strategies and medications you can use to quit. Common strategies include using nicotine gum and patches, gradually decreasing cigarette use, or taking medications like Chantix or Wellbutrin.Even if you're having trouble quitting, make sure not to smoke around other people. Consistent exposure to second-hand smoke can cause asthma to develop in those around you.


Smoking while pregnant causes childhood wheezing, increased risk of food allergies, and inflammatory proteins in the blood. The effect is even greater if the child continues to be exposed to second-hand smoke after birth.Talk to your OBGYN before taking any oral medication to help you stop smoking.

, Many studies have shown that high levels of stress hormones can lead to the onset of asthma symptoms, increased allergen sensitivity, and lung constriction.Try to identify the things that cause the most stress in your life, and work toward removing those stressors.


Try relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, and yoga.

Exercise regularly to release endorphins that ease pain and reduce stress levels.
Improve your sleeping habits: go to sleep when you're tired, don't sleep with the TV on, don't eat before going to sleep, avoid night time caffeine, and try to maintain same sleep schedule daily., A significant portion of childhood asthma is caused by exposure to air pollution from factories, construction, vehicles, and industrial plants. Just as tobacco smoke irritates the lungs, air pollution triggers inflammatory reactions that lead to lung damage and constriction. While you can't eliminate air pollution, you can reduce your exposure.Avoid breathing the air around major streets or highways when possible.
Have children play outside in areas far away from highways or construction.
If relocation is an option, see the EPA's air quality index guidelines to find the areas with the best air quality., If you are taking certain medications, note if you've been having more asthma symptoms since you began taking them. If so, consult your doctor before stopping, reducing dosage for, or changing medications.


Studies show that aspirin and ibuprofen can cause lung and airway constriction in asthmatic patients sensitive to them.ACE inhibitors used to treat blood pressure don't cause asthma, but cause a dry cough that can be mistaken for it. However, excessive coughing from ACE inhibitors can irritate your lungs and trigger the onset of asthma. Common ACE inhibitors include ramipril and perindopril.
Beta blockers are used to treat heart problems, high blood pressure, and migraines. They can constrict your lung airways.Some doctors may prescribe beta blockers even if you have asthma, and just keep an eye on you for changes. Common beta blockers include metoprolol and propanolol.

, The extra weight makes it harder to breathe and pump blood throughout your body. It also increases the number of inflammatory proteins (cytokines) in the body, making you more likely to experience airway inflammation and constriction.

, Early symptoms aren't serious enough to interfere with your normal activities or daily life.When the condition starts to progress, though, you'll notice yourself having trouble with normal activities. People usually continue to experience the early symptoms, but more severely.


If left undiagnosed or untreated, the early, mild symptoms of asthma can get progressively worse. This is especially true if you don't identify your triggers and avoid them.

, If you have asthma, your airways can get closed off because of the constriction or inflammation from the disease. Your body will respond by trying to clear your airways through coughing. While the coughs you get during a bacterial infection are wet, mucus-y coughs, asthma coughs tend to be dry, with very little mucus.If coughing begins or worsens at night, it may be asthma. A common symptom of asthma is nighttime coughing, or coughing that gets worse right after you wake up.In more progressed cases, coughing extends into the day.

, Asthmatics often notice a wheezing or high-pitched whistling when they exhale. This is caused by the constriction of airways.Note when you hear the sound. If it's at the very end of exhalation, it's an early sign of mild asthma. But as the condition progresses from mild to moderate symptoms, you’ll wheeze or whistle throughout the entire exhalation.

, ""Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction"" is a type of asthma seen in those who've just done something strenuous, like exercising. The airway constriction will leave you tired and gasping for air sooner than you should be, and you may have to give up the activity before you want to.Compare how long you can normally exercise to instances when fatigue and shortness of breath limit you.

, Place your palm over your chest and count how many times your chest rise and falls in one minute. Use a stopwatch or clock with a second hand, so you can time out an accurate minute. A normal respiratory rate is between 12 and 20 breaths in 60 seconds.


With moderate asthma, your respiratory rate can be from 20 to 30 breaths per minute.

, Though the coughing from asthma is different from that from a cold or flu, bacteria and viruses can trigger asthma. Look for signs of infection that may be causing the asthma symptoms: sneezing, runny nose, sore throat, and congestion. If the coughing dark, green, or white mucus, the infection may be bacterial. If it's clear or white, it may be viral.If you see these infection symptoms combined with noise on exhalation and gasping for breath, you likely have asthma triggered by an infection.
See a doctor to find out exactly what's going on.

, However, when severe symptoms are present or when you're experiencing an asthma attack, breathlessness occurs even when you're resting because of triggers activating the inflammatory process. If the inflammation is serious enough, you will suddenly find yourself severely short of breath or taking deep gasps of air.


You may also feel like you can't fully exhale. When the body needs the oxygen from inhalation, it shortens exhalation so it can get to oxygen more quickly.
You may find that you can’t speak in full sentences, but are using short words and sentences between gasps.

, Even mild and moderate asthma attacks can make you breathe rapidly, but severe attacks are worse. The constriction in your airways is preventing you bringing enough fresh air into your body, starving it of oxygen. The rapid breathing is your body's attempt to get as much oxygen as possible to correct the situation before it suffers damage.


Place your palm over your chest and note how many times your chest rise and falls in one minute. Use a stopwatch or clock with a second hand to time out an accurate minute.
In severe episodes, your respiration rate will be over 30 breaths per minute., To get oxygen to your tissues and organs, blood picks up oxygen from the air in your lungs and carries it to different parts of the body. During a severe attack, when there's not enough oxygen being brought in, the heart must pump blood faster to get as much oxygen to tissues and organs as possible. You may feel your heart racing without explanation during severe attacks.


Hold your hand out, palm up.
Place the tips of the index and middle fingers of your other hand on the outer part of your wrist, below the thumb.
You will feel a rapid, beating pulse from the radial artery.
Calculate your heart rate by counting how many times your heart beats in one minute. A normal heart rate is less than 100 beats per minute, but in severe asthma symptoms you may get rates over 120.Some smart phones now have heartbeat monitors built right in. If yours does, you can use that.

, Blood is only bright red when it's carrying oxygen — otherwise it's much darker. Whenever we see it, it's hit the open air outside of our bodies and turned bright with oxygen, so we're not used to thinking of it any other way. But during a severe asthma attack, you may experience ""cyanosis"" caused by dark, oxygen-starved blood traveling through your arteries.This causes the skin to appear bluish or grayish, especially on the lips, fingers, nails, gums, or the thin skin around the eyes., The muscles we bring into the breathing process in these situations are on the sides of the neck: the sternocleidomastoid and scalene muscles. Look for deep outlines in the neck muscles if you're having trouble breathing. Furthermore, the muscles between our ribs (the intercostals) get pulled inward. These muscles help lift the rib cage during inhalation, and may be able to see this retraction between your ribs in serious conditions.


Look in the mirror to see both the deeply outlined neck muscles and the retracted muscles between your ribs.

, When you're working too hard to breathe, the muscles involved with respiration get overworked. This results in muscle fatigue in the chest, which feels like tightness and pain. The pain might feel dull, sharp, or stabbing, and can around the middle of the chest (sternal) or slightly off center (parasternal). This requires immediate medical attention and a visit to the emergency room to rule out heart issues.

, However, in severe episodes, you can hear it both on exhalation and inhalation. The whistling noise we hear on inhalation is known as ""stridor,"" and is caused by constriction of the throat muscles in the upper respiratory tract. Wheezing tends to occur on exhalation, and is caused by constriction of muscles in the lower respiratory tract.


Noise on inhalation can be a symptom both of asthma and of severe allergic reaction. You need to be able to distinguish between them so you can treat the cause appropriately.
Look for hives or red rashes on the chest, which indicate an allergic reaction instead of an asthma attack. Swelling of the lips or tongue also point to allergies.

, If you have a severe attack that makes it hard to breathe, call 911 and get to an emergency room immediately. If you're undiagnosed, you likely don't have a rescue inhaler. If you have one, though, use it.


Albuterol inhaler pumps should only be used 4 times a day, but in a attack it's ok to use it as often as every 20 minutes for 2 hours.Take slow deep breaths, counting to 3 in your head on inhalation and exhalation. This can help reduce stress and your breathing rate.
Remove the trigger if you can identify it.
Asthma will get better when you use steroids prescribed by your physician. These drugs can be inhaled through a pump or taken as a tablet. Take a puff of the medication or a tablet with water. It takes a few hours to start working, but will control asthma symptoms.

, This is considered a medical emergency that could prove potentially fatal if not treated immediately.

, This will allow the doctor to get an overall picture about the issues affecting you. Prepare the information beforehand so you don't have to think of it off the top of your head at the doctor's office:


Any signs and symptoms of asthma (coughing, shortness of breath, noises during breathing, etc.)
Past medical history (previous allergies, etc.)
Family history (history of lung diseases or allergies with your parents, siblings, etc.)
Your social history (tobacco use, diet and exercise, environment)
Any medications you may be on (such as aspirin) and any supplements or vitamins you're taking

, This may include using the stethoscope on the front and back of your chest to listen for breathing noises or absence of lung sounds.


Because asthma is related to allergies, he or she will also look for runny nose, red eyes, watery eyes and skin rashes.
Finally, the doctor will inspect the throat for swelling and your ability to breathe, as well as any abnormal sounds that may indicate constricted airways.

, During this test, you will breathe into a mouthpiece connected to a spirometer that measures your air flow rate and how much air you can breathe in and out. Take a deep breath and exhale forcefully for as long as possible while the device takes the measurement.While a positive result confirms asthma, a negative result doesn't rule it out., Your doctor or a lung specialist may recommend this test to help confirm the diagnosis. To take the test, place your lips over the opening of the device and set the device to zero. Stand up straight and take a deep breath, then blow as hard and fast as you can in one breath. Repeat this a few times so you can get consistent results. Take the largest of these numbers — this is your peak flow. When you feel asthma symptoms coming on, repeat the test and compare your airflow to your peak flow.If your value is over 80% of your best peak flow, you're in a safe range.
If your value is between 50 and 80% of your best peak flow, your asthma is not being well-managed and your physician will likely adjust medication for you. You're at moderate risk of experiencing an asthma attack if you're in this range.
If your value is less than 50% of your best peak flow, you're experiencing a severe decrease in breathing function that likely needs to be addressed with medication.

, If you're not presenting with symptoms when you see the doctor, it can be hard for him or her to diagnose you accurately. He or she may recommend a methacholine challenge test. He or she will provide you with an inhaler you'll use to inhale methacholine. The methacholine will cause airway constriction if you have asthma, and trigger symptoms that can be measured with spirometry and peak air flow tests., If symptoms reverse, chances are you have asthma. Symptom severity will help your doctor choose what medications to use, but a full history and physical exam will also factor into the decision.


A common medication is an albuterol/salbutamol inhaler pump, which you use by pursing your lips over the opening and pumping the medication in your lungs while you inhale.
Bronchodilator medications help open constricted airways by dilating them.

Go to a sink to prevent a mess.,
Draw some fluid into a bulb or syringe.,
Use the rinse.,
Ensure that your rinse and syringe are sanitary.,
Take caution if you any of the following categories apply to you.",How to Use a Nasal Rinse2," To use the nasal rinse, you have to be near a sink or some other place that can catch the dirty water.


The water will travel into one nostril and out the other, so make sure it has somewhere to go.

, Draw about 4ml of nasal rinse into a bulb or syringe to prepare for administration.


Make sure that whatever you are using to administer the rinse is clean and disinfected.

, Tilt your head to the left to provide a good angle for drainage.


Place the syringe or bulb on your right nostril, creating a seal.
Slowly press the syringe or the bulb to release the rinse.
Always breathe through your mouth while using the nasal rinse, to prevent it from entering your throat.
It will pass into your right nostril and run out of your other nostril, flushing out mucous, dust, and pollen.
After doing this, blow your nose unless your doctor indicates otherwise.
This procedure will loosen the mucus that is inside the nose.
Repeat this at least 2 to 3 times a day until for 2 days.

, Discard the solution after one day's use and make a fresh one to avoid any contamination.


Also, clean the bulb syringe after every use.

, You should avoid using a nasal rinse if:


You have an ear infection
You are administering the rinse to babies or kids under 6 years of age.
You have a nasal polyp.

Chop the ginger into small pieces and steep it in 1 cup of boiled water for 5 minutes. Drink the ginger tea 4 to 5 times a day. Ginger is a natural anti-inflammatory herb that has been used for centuries to treat respiratory problems.You can also make a cold ginger drink. Mix ½ cup ginger juice, ½ cup pomegranate juice and add honey to taste. Drink this 3 to 4 times a day. The ginger acts as an anti-inflammatory and the pomegranate juice is high in antioxidants. Honey is for flavor, but also has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties.;
, Although more research is needed, some herbalists believe the lobelia plant can relieve asthma. To effectively breathe in lobelia and relieve asthma symptoms, place 2 or 3 drops of lobelia essential oil into a bowl of steaming water. Place a heavy towel over the back of your head and lean over the bowl so that the steam is trapped. Breathe in the steam for 5 to 10 minutes.


Keep your face about 18 inches away from the steaming water so you don't burn yourself.

, Take an ointment that has menthol and eucalyptus and rub it over your chest. These can prevent or shorten an asthma attack. In a study, participants who used rubbing ointments went to the emergency room less often than those who only used inhalers.You can also do a facial steam with eucalyptus essential oil. Eucalyptus can break up mucus and may help you breathe easier. You can also place a few drops of the eucalyptus oil on a cotton ball and keep it nearby (stored in a baggie). If you feel any asthma symptoms, pull out the cotton ball and take a few sniffs of the eucalyptus.

, If you're experiencing an asthma attack, take slow shallow breaths instead of quick deep breaths. This is the idea behind the Buteyko Breathing Therapy technique. A good exercise to try is to place the tip of your tongue behind your front teeth. Hold it there while you inhale slowly through your nose. Exhale slowly so that the breath moves around your tongue. Do four of these breaths at a time.While there are breathing exercises that focus on strengthening your respiratory muscles or improving your posture to help breathing, studies have shown that exercises to retrain breathing techniques are most helpful in managing asthma.You can also look into using the Papworth or Pranayama yoga methods of breathing.

, If you have asthma, you should be seeing your doctor regularly, especially if you're planning on taking supplements or changing your diet. Some supplements could interact with your asthma medication. Never stop taking your asthma medication without talking to your doctor first.


Your doctor will work with you to create an asthma plan of action so you know exactly how to respond and recover from an attack.

, Vitamin C has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. You can take 500mg of vitamin C every day as long as you have no kidney disease. You can also get vitamin C from:Citrus fruits
Strawberries
Broccoli
Leafy greens
Bell peppers
Papaya

, Vitamin B6 can reduce general inflammation and improve your immune system so it's better able to fight off asthma triggers. Foods highest in the most absorbable form of Vitamin B6 are salmon, potatoes, turkey, chicken, avocados, spinach and bananas. You could also take a supplement. For:Children between 1 and 8 years old: take 0.8 mg/day.
Children between 9 and 13 years old: take 1.0 mg/day.
Adolescents and adults: take 1/3 to 1/7 mg/day.
Pregnant or nursing women: take 1.9 to 2.0 mg/day.

, You can get vitamin B12 from meats, seafood, fish, cheese and eggs. Vitamin B12 can block the effects of sulfites and some studies have shown that it's most effective in helping pediatric asthma. The vitamin can reduce the severity and frequency of asthma symptoms.If you'd rather take a supplement, take 2.4 mg/day (if an adolescent or adult), 2.6 to 2.8 mg/day (if pregnant or nursing), 0.9 to 1.2 mg/day (if between 1 and 8 years old), or 1.8 mg/day (if between 9 and 13 years old).

, More research is needed, but some studies have shown that taking selenium can reduce inflammation that causes asthma. You can get selenium from your diet if you eat organ meats, meat, and seafood. Or, you can take a supplement that uses selenomethionine. Studies have indicated that this form of selenium is best absorbed.Don’t take more than 200 mcg of selenium a day. It can be toxic in higher doses.

, Molybdenum is a trace mineral that helps your body detoxify the sulfites that can trigger an asthma attack. You can get molybdenum from beans, lentils, and peas. Or, you can take a multivitamin or individual supplement. Always follow the manufacturer's dosing instructions. In general, the Recommended Daily Allowance for:Children up to 13 years: 22 to 43 mcg/day
People over 14 years: 45 mcg/day
Pregnant and nursing women: 50 mcg/day

, Keep a journal for at least 2 to 4 weeks, writing down the foods you eat and if you had reactions. Since asthma triggers are unique to each person with asthma, you may be able determine if a certain food triggers your asthma and completely avoid it in the future.Tracking your reactions to foods can also help you determine if you're sensitive to a food or if it's a trigger for an asthma attack. One study showed that 75% of children with asthma have food sensitivities.Foods that have been associated as asthma triggers include eggs, citrus, peanuts, chocolate, wheat (gluten), and dairy., Food triggers are usually things that you're actually allergic to which is why you react by having an asthma attack. Food allergies can be determined by a skin test. Food sensitivities are also an immune response, but there are no diagnostic tests to determine if you're sensitive to a particular food.


If you have a food sensitivity, you may still benefit from removing the food from your diet. If you really are sensitive to it, avoiding it can reduce the frequency and severity of asthma attacks (especially gluten and dairy)., Once you've learned what foods to avoid, you need to reduce inflammation. Prepare your own foods and cook from scratch so you can control the quality and avoid chemicals, hormones, and antibiotics in your food. Try to choose organic food which isn't produced with these. You should also reduce sugar intake since it can lead to weight gain and inflammation. To follow a diet that reduces inflammation eat:Complex carbohydrates and fiber from whole grains, beans, peas, flaxseeds and vegetables.
Lean proteins like skinless poultry and fish like salmon, cod, haddock and tuna (which are also good sources of omega-3 fatty acids).
Reduced amounts of red meat and animal fat.
A variety of fruits and vegetables.

, Not only do herbs flavor your food, several have also been shown to reduce inflammation. Seasoning your food in normal amounts is considered safe unless you have a sensitivity to the plant. If you are not sure, try just a pinch of the herb first. If you have no reaction within 2 hours, it should be safe to use. To reduce inflammation, cook with:Garlic and onions
Turmeric and curry
Ginger
Basil
Cinnamon
Cloves
Allspice

Understand the different symptoms.,
Know what can trigger an attack.,
Keep a diary.,
Contact their doctor.,
Create an asthma action plan.",How to Help Your Teen Learn to Control Their Asthma1," Make sure your teen understands the different signs and symptoms of an oncoming flare-up or attack. Asthma symptoms include coughing, wheezing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath.Coughing caused by asthma is often worse at night or early in the morning. This can make it difficult to sleep.
Wheezing is a squeaking or whistling sound that occurs when you breathe.
Chest tightness feels as if something is squeezing or sitting on your chest.
Shortness of breath feels as if you cannot catch your breath, or cannot get air out of your lungs. You will generally feel out of breath.;
, Many different things can trigger or worsen asthma symptoms. Triggers include allergens, irritants, medicines, sulfites in foods and drinks, viral upper respiratory infections, and physical activity. Other health conditions, such as a runny nose, sinus infections, reflux disease, psychological distress, and sleep apnea, can trigger an attack and make asthma harder to manage.Allergens include dust, animal fur, cockroaches, mold, and pollens from grasses, trees, and flowers.
Irritants include cigarette smoke, air pollution, sprays (like hair spray), chemicals or dust, and compounds in home décor products.
Medicines include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), like aspirin, and nonselective beta-blockers.

, Encourage your teen to keep a diary detailing when the flare-up occurred (for example time of day), what they were doing, their surrounding environment, and the medicines they took to control the flare-up. This way, your teen can identify specific triggers in order to avoid them. A diary will also help your teen determine how well their medicine is controlling their asthma.


For example, “It was 3:30 p.m. and I was sitting in the middle of class when my teacher announced that our final is coming up in a week. Everything was fine until my teacher mentioned the test. I then began to feel shortness in my breath. As soon as I felt the shortness I reached for my inhaler. Once I used my inhaler, my symptoms subsided.”

, The doctor will diagnose the asthma based on your teen's medical and family history, test results, and a physical exam. Your teen's doctor will also diagnose the severity of asthma, i.e., intermittent, mild, moderate, or severe. Then, the doctor will formulate a treatment plan based on the severity of the asthma.


Let the doctor know whether your teen's symptoms happen during a certain time of the day, at certain places, or if they get worse at night.Have your teen bring their asthma diary for the doctor to review.
Doctors use a test called the spirometry to check how well the lungs are working.
The doctor may also recommend allergy tests, chest x-rays, and tests to rule out other diseases that have similar symptoms to asthma like sleep apnea, vocal cord dysfunction, or reflux disease.

, With their doctor, create an asthma action plan with your teen. The asthma action plan should detail asthma triggers and the different levels of severity of an asthma attack. It should outline symptoms and peak flow measurements that indicate a flare-up or worsening asthma, as well as specific medicines to take based on their signs, symptoms, or peak flow measurements. The action plan should also outline symptoms or peak flow measurements that indicate the need for urgent medical attention.The plan should also include telephone numbers for emergency contacts, your healthcare provider, and your local hospital.
Encourage your teen to carry their action plan with them wherever they go.
You can find an action plan template here: http://teenshealth.org/en/teens/action-plan-sheet.html?WT.ac=ctg.

Move the indicator to the bottom of the scale.,
Have your teen place the mouthpiece in their mouth.,
Blow out.,
Have them write down their score.,
Find their personal best.,
Use it every day.",How to Help Your Teen Learn to Control Their Asthma2," Tell your teen to stand up and to take a deep breath. Make sure your teen fills their lungs with air all the way, like a balloon., While your teen does this, make sure they hold their breath. Also, make sure they place the mouthpiece between their teeth. Then, have them seal their lips around the mouth piece.Make sure they do not place their tongue inside or against the hole.

, In a single blow, tell your teen to blow out as fast and as hard as they can. Remember that the most important burst of air is the first burst of air. You cannot correct this by blowing for a longer time.However, if they coughed or did not blow hard or fast enough, have them redo steps one through three again.

, In order for them to find their peak flow number, they will need to repeat steps one through three twice more. Have them record the number each time. The number that ranks the highest will be their peak expiratory flow (PEF).Make sure they record their peak flow number in their asthma action plan.

, In order for them to find their personal best, have your teen take their peak flow each day for two to three weeks. The highest number they get over the two to three week period is their ""personal best"" PEF.Make sure they do not take their measurement if their asthma isn’t under control. Advise them to use the peak flow meter two times per day around the same times each day, and as instructed by the healthcare provider., Once your teen knows their personal best, help your teen develop a habit of using the meter to track their breathing. Your teen should use the meter every morning before they take their medicine, when they are experiencing asthma symptoms or an attack, and after they have taken their medicine for an attack or the presence of symptoms.Have your teen check to see which zone their number is in, and what actions to take depending on their action plan.

"
Pay attention to the signs.,
Follow the action plan.,
Remove the trigger.",How to Help Your Teen Learn to Control Their Asthma3," When your teen notices any signs or symptoms of an oncoming attack, they should tell someone that a flare-up is about to happen, or let people around them know what is going on. Advise them to sit down and take slow, steady breaths.Symptoms of an oncoming attack are a cough, breathlessness, wheezing, tightening of the chest, difficulty speaking or eating, and increased or rapid breathing.
For example, if they are at school, tell them to let their friends, teachers, coaches and/or school nurse know what is going on. Make sure the school nurse has your child's action plan on record and an extra rescue inhaler.

, Have them revert immediately to their action plan. Remind them to remain calm and follow the action plan’s protocol.To help your teen act swiftly in a situation, do practice runs at home. Practice for each asthma zone, i.e., the green, yellow, and red zones. Practicing at home will help your teen feel confident that they can control and prevent a full attack even if they do not have their action plan with them.

, If they can figure out what triggered the attack, then encourage them to remove the trigger, or remove themselves from the area. Remind them to not ignore a flare-up in hopes that it will go away on its own. It needs to be dealt with promptly in order to prevent an emergency situation.Advise them to call an ambulance (911) if they don't have their inhaler or medication with them, if their symptoms do not improve after 10 puffs, if they feel worse despite using their inhaler, or if they are worried at any point.If the ambulance takes longer than 15 minutes, then have them repeat step two.

Recognize an asthma attack.,
Remain calm.,
Confirm that the person wants help.,
Ask about their action plan.,
Get the person’s medication for them.,
Help them take their medication if they can’t do it alone.,
Call Emergency Services if their symptoms worsen or don’t improve with medication.,
Calm and reassure the person.,
Help them sit upright.,
Instruct them to take long, deep breaths.,
Loosen any restricting clothing.,
Move them away from the trigger.,
Give them hot coffee or tea.,
Get them to a steamy room.",How to Help Someone Having an Asthma Attack," If you know that someone has asthma and they suddenly have difficulty breathing, they are likely having an asthma attack. Sometimes, however, you will need to help a stranger or someone you don’t know well. Watch for signs and symptoms of an attack so you can recognize when you need to help. Someone is likely having an asthma attack if they have:Difficulty speaking
Difficulty breathing
Wheezing
Coughing
Distress or panic
Blue tinge to their lips or beneath their fingernails;
, The person having the asthma attack may feel frightened or start to panic. It’s important that you remain calm.Take slow, deep breaths. Use positive language, like, “It’s going to be okay,” or, “I’m here with you.” When you tell the person what to do, speak in a calm, firm voice – “I need you to sit upright and point to where your medicine is.”

Avoid saying anything that may make the person more afraid, like, “I don’t know what to do!” If you stay calm, you’ll help the victim feel calmer.

, If you encounter a stranger having an asthma attack, don't assume that they want your help. Approach them calmly, quickly introduce yourself, and offer assistance. Don't be offended if they don't want your help. If they do, ask what you can do for them.

Approach the person and say something like, ""Hi, my name is Tom. I noticed you may be having some trouble. I'd like to help, if I can. Can I offer any assistance?""
Ask permission before touching the person. Say, ""I'm going to help you sit down, is it okay if I hold your arm?""

, If the person can talk, ask them about their asthma action plan. Many people with asthma have a plan for flare-ups and attacks. They may be able to tell you how to help, when to get their medication, where their medication is, and if or when to call for emergency services.They may also be able to tell you what has helped to relieve their symptoms in the past, such as getting away from certain triggers or going to a calm, cool area., If you know where the person keeps their inhaler, get it as quickly as possible. If you don’t know, ask the victim where their inhaler is kept.If they can’t speak, tell them to point or write it in the dirt with their finger. Call someone who can help, like a family member.

Be aware that a person may have more than one inhaler or other type of medication. Some medications are used for “maintenance” (everyday use to reduce or prevent asthma symptoms), while others are quick-acting “rescue” medications intended to relieve an asthma attack in progress. If the person is able, have them tell you (or point out) which medication they use for an emergency.Many asthma patients carry an instructions card with their inhaler. Look for this. It can help you know what to do, even if the person can’t speak., Most asthma patients know how to use their inhaler correctly, so let them do it themselves. If they are not calm enough to do it, you can help. Shake the inhaler. Place the mouthpiece of the inhaler between their lips. Tell them when you are about you give the medication, so they can take a deep breath at the same time. Wait several seconds before giving the next dose, or until they say they’re ready.Help the person take 1-2 puffs from their inhaler every 2 minutes. Do this until their symptoms get better, or until they have had 10 puffs.If emergency medical services haven’t arrived after 15 minutes, repeat this process.Using their own inhaler is ideal, but using someone else’s inhaler may be better than having no medicine at all. If they don’t have their inhaler but you do or someone else does, it’s okay to use that inhaler in an emergency., Mild symptoms can improve if the person stays calm and takes their medicine - if they can speak and move around, you can try to help alleviate their symptoms without calling for help. However, you may need to locate the nearest phone and call for emergency medical services. If possible, stay with the victim while you call – use a mobile phone or yell to another party to call. Leave them momentarily if necessary, but tell them, “I am calling for help. I will be right back.” You can also drive them to the hospital if you have the means.Get help if:They do not have their inhaler
The inhaler doesn’t help after using it for 10 puffs
The inhaler helps at first but then their symptoms worsen again
They are struggling to breathe or can’t talk
Their lips or nail beds turn blue
They lose consciousness

, Staying calm will help keep the victim’s muscles from tightening more and worsening their breathing trouble.Inform the person that help is on the way and that you are there to help. Hold their hand, or just stay nearby. Speak in a soothing voice.

Ask the person if there is anything you can do to help them. They may have a plan or be able to instruct you.Suggest that they try to meditate, or lead them through a calming meditation., Assist the person to sit up straight, whether on a chair or on the ground. Sitting upright can help them to breathe easier. Lying down and slouching constricts breathing.Tell the person what to do, such as, “Sit on the ground and sit up straight.” If they are panicking and do not listen, try to gently guide them with your hands.

Firmly hold their arm and try to lead them to a seated position. Place your palm on their back over their spine and use gentle pressure to encourage them to sit up straight. Do not push, shove, or handle the person roughly.

, When someone has trouble breathing, their natural response may be to take short, gasping breaths. This can make them hyperventilate. Tell the person to take long, deep breaths. Say, “Breathe in through your nose, and breathe out through your mouth.” This may be difficult for them, but encourage them to do it the best they can.Help them breathe in to the count of 4 and breathe out to the count of 6. Count out loud and breathe along with them.Show them how to purse their lips while breathing out to slow down their exhalation.

, If the person is wearing anything restricting, help them to loosen it.Use your judgment about whether it’s appropriate to touch the person or their clothing.

If you’re helping a stranger, suggest they loosen their clothing. If it’s a family member, it’s okay to do it for them. In an emergency, don’t be afraid to help as much as possible.

, Asthma attacks can be triggered by chemicals, smoke, mold, pets, sawdust, or other allergens.If it seems like the attack was triggered by something in the environment, lead the person away from the trigger. Keep them away from smoke, dust, and chemical smells – including chlorine, like if you’re in an enclosed pool or hot tub. Take them to an air conditioned space or somewhere with clean air.If you cannot move the person, have them breathe through a scarf or sleeve to minimize how much irritant they inhale.Asthma attacks can also happen without a trigger., If their symptoms are not very severe – if they can breathe with only minor difficulty and they are calm – try giving them a cup of a hot, caffeinated beverage. This may help open up their breathing pathways for a short time.Give them one or two cups of coffee or caffeinated tea to drink right away., If possible, bring the person to a bathroom filled with steam. Run a hot shower and close the door so the room steams up, or have them take a hot shower. The heat and steam can loosen mucus in their lungs and help to open their airways."

Learn to identify an asthma attack.,
Be sure the child knows exactly what asthma is.,
Create a plan to handle the actual attacks (Asthma Action Plan).,
Create a plan to soothe the emotions involved in the attack (Asthma Coping Plan).,
Alert everyone who comes in contact with the child on a regular basis of the plan.",How to Help Children Cope with Asthma Attacks," For both you as carer and for the child as asthma sufferer, knowing the symptoms is a vital part of good management of asthma attacks. Typical symptoms of an asthma attack include:


Difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, or very rapid breathing
Severe wheezing when breathing both in and out
Coughing that won't stop
Chest pain or pressure
Tightened neck and chest muscles, called retractions
Difficulty talking and performing normal daily activities
Feelings of anxiety or panic
Pale, sweaty face
Blue lips or fingernails
Worsening symptoms despite use of medications;
, Use the steps above to reach the child to recognize the symptoms so they know when they're having an attack.

, You can develop this with your doctor based on the severity of your child's attacks.


If you are with a child who has an 'asthma action plan,' be sure you know the steps to follow to control/manage the attack.
If you are with a child who does not have an asthma action plan, call the emergency services immediately.

, You should always plan to remain calm in order to help the child remain calm. The plan should be simple and focused only on coping with the asthma attacks.


Be sure to limit the number of steps in the asthma coping plan to no more than 10 actions, and be sure to know all steps in advance.
Here is a personalized asthma attack action plan (suitable for a child between the ages 6-12) that you might like to adapt to your own child:

Remain calm.
Alert a medical professional.
Tell Barker 'everything will be okay' and help him remain calm.
Enforce the ""no crying"" rule with the ""no tears"" chant (""Tears, tears... go away, come again another day, little Barker wants to play, tears, tears go away"").
Help him relax by playing soothing music or his favorite calming song.
Smile and help Barker smile (no laughing, as laughing can make the attack worsen).
Tell Barker one of his favorite stories to keep him calm and remove his focus from the attack.
Allow Barker to read one of his favorite books.
If he's calm, and coping well, play a game with Barker that does not require many words or too much physical movement, where he can relax more, like a video game or board game.
Hug Barker and give him massages on the arms, back, and face.



, This includes family members, school officials, babysitters, coaches, clergy/church members, instructors, tutors etc. The more people who know of the plan, the better the chances are of the child creating healthier coping habits.

Ask your doctor for a peak flow meter.,
Take your peak flow reading.,
Record the highest of your three peak flow readings in your diary.,
Determine your best peak flow reading.,
Determine the zone of your peak flow reading.,
Communicate your peak flow readings to your doctor.",How to Keep a Breathing Diary for Asthma1," If you have moderate or severe asthma, your doctor should be able to prescribe a peak flow meter. This device takes a measurement of how fast the air moves out of your lungs. Your doctor should also be able to give you a peak flow chart, which allows you to record your peak flow readings. Insert or copy the chart into your asthma diary. This is a great, inexpensive way to monitor symptoms in people 5 years and older.


If you have mild asthma, you could monitor your symptoms in your diary instead of peak flow readings.;
, If you are using a peak flow meter to monitor your asthma, you should recording your peak flow readings in your diary. Start by taking a peak flow reading:Align the arrow with the zero on the scale.
Stand up tall or sit up straight.
Take a long, deep breath.
Put your mouth tightly around the mouthpiece.
Blow out as hard and as fast as you can for a second.
Observe the number on the scale and write it down.
Do it again two more times.

, After obtaining three peak flow readings, record the highest number in your diary. This is your peak flow reading for the morning or the evening. You should record your peak flow once or twice a day.

, Over the course of a two-week period when your asthma feels relatively stable, record your peak flow every morning and evening. You should take a reading prior to using your bronchodilator and then again afterwards. At the end of the two week period, review the readings in your diary and find the highest number. This is your personal best., If you know your best reading, you can continuously monitor your peak flow readings relative to your best reading. You should record your daily peak flow readings by tracking them in relation to three zones in your diary:The green zone means your peak flow reading is eighty to one hundred percent of your best peak flow reading. The green zone means everything is good. You can relax and enjoy the day.
If you recorded a peak flow reading between fifty and seventy-nine percent of your best peak flow reading, you are in the yellow zone. The yellow zone means you should take precautions. You should follow the specific directions that your doctor prescribed for when things get worse or your “backup plan.” This could mean taking additional medications.
If you recorded a peak flow reading of less than fifty percent of your best reading, you are in the red zone. You should use your inhaler and call your doctor immediately.

, When you go for your doctor’s checkup or to the hospital, bring your peak flow diary. When they ask you about your symptoms, you can share your peak flow readings so they have a sense of your recent asthma experience."

Write down any wheezing episodes.,
Record unusual sleep patterns.,
Take note of your asthma symptoms in response to exercise.,
Record asthma related changes to your everyday life.,
Take action if there is an increase in symptoms.",How to Keep a Breathing Diary for Asthma2," Take note of any coughing episodes during the day. Record the severity and the duration of the coughing, as well as whether it was related to a specific trigger such as smoke from a fire or cigarettes.


If you are using the asthma diary to monitor your children, take note of whether the coughing is associated with active play. You should also take note of whether it is accompanied by a runny nose and clear mucus., If you feel a tightness in your chest at any point during the day, you should record it in your diary. Write down the severity of the symptom and how long it lasts.Tightness in the chest is a symptom of occupational asthma. Record whether it gets worse during the work week as well as whether or not it goes away on weekends.Chest tightness is a symptom of asthma in children., If you experience any wheezing during the day or night, you should take note of these episodes in your asthma diary. Observe whether the wheezing got worse in response to a particular activity such as exercise. Take note of the duration of your wheezing episodes.Occupational asthma involves wheezing at night.Recurrent wheezing is a symptom of asthma in children., If you wake up in the middle of the night or have difficulty falling asleep due to asthma symptoms, you should write this down in your diary.More severe asthma at night is called nocturnal asthma and is connected to more severe diseases. You should tell your doctor if you experience nocturnal asthma., Exercise is highly encouraged for people with asthma but it can also worsen symptoms.Take note of any of the following symptoms of exercise-induced asthma:Chest tightening.
Wheezing.
Shortness of breath during exercise.
Excessive fatigue during exercise.
Coughing during or after exercise.
If your symptoms get worse during or after exercise, you should record your experience and take appropriate action such as using your inhaler. If symptoms are severe, see a doctor.

, If your asthma symptoms caused you to make a major change to your everyday life, you should record the event. For example, you might want to record any of the following asthma related changes to your life:


Missed work or school.
Visit to the emergency room.
Doctor visit.
Missed social events.
Cancelled sports event.

, If you observe an increase in symptoms in your diary, you should visit your doctor. You may need to alter your medication to account for the shift in your symptoms. If your symptoms increase for two days in a row, you should be prepared for a possible asthma attack.A 20% increase in symptoms for two consecutive days is associated with an asthma attack 65% of the time.

Write about your emotional life.",How to Keep a Breathing Diary for Asthma3," Many people have asthma symptoms that arise in response to cold air. Airways respond to temperature and can contract in response to cold air. Note any asthma symptoms in response to cold air in your diary., If your asthma gets worse in response to pollen, mold, pets, cockroaches, or dust, record the experience in your journal. Identifying patterns of response can help you manage your asthma. You might be able to minimize your exposure to certain airborne substances if you are able to identify what they are., Record any asthma symptoms that arise in response to indoor pollution such as cigarette smoke or outdoor pollution such as exhaust from cars.If you visit a new city and your asthma gets worse, see if it is related to the pollution levels in the city.
If your asthma gets worse after going to a party where people where smoking, record the event in your diary. You might want to avoid exposure to smoke in the future.

, You should observe the impact of any new or old medications on your asthma. Some people experience aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, and beta blockers as triggers., You should observe the relationship between your exercise routine and asthma. Although exercise is encouraged for people with asthma, you might experience some forms of exercise as a trigger for your asthma. Take note of any symptoms that emerge in response to certain forms of exercise such as running in cold environments or swimming in cold water., A range of foods can trigger asthma so you will need to identify your own personal triggers. Some of the foods that are commonly experienced as asthma triggers include shrimp, processed potatoes, beer and wine. Take note of any asthma symptoms that arise after the consumption of these or other food items., Medical conditions such as the common cold and gastroesophageal reflux disease can sometimes trigger asthma symptoms. You should observe whether your asthma symptoms arise in response to other medical conditions., You should also record any patterns or connections between your stress levels and emotional life and asthma symptoms. Stress can impact asthma so if you are experiencing a lot of work or relationship related stress, record this in your diary."

Difficulty walking or talking
Skin between ribs or above breastbone sucks in while breathing
Rapid movement of nostrils, ribs, or stomach while breathing
Expanded chest that does not deflate after exhaling
Chest painFor young children — Refusal to eat, inability to recognize parents;
, Asthma is difficult to diagnose at home, and can be fatal in serious cases. If you experience any of the symptoms below, make an appointment with a doctor. If a doctor has failed to diagnose you, and you have one of the symptoms below, visit an allergy and asthma specialist.


Visit the doctor even if your symptoms don't match asthma. It could be another serious condition.
Symptoms can change with each asthma attack. The symptoms may last just during the attack, or persist for much longer.

, Many asthma patients complain of tightness, pain, or unusual sensations in the chest. You may feel like someone is sitting on your chest.

, Do you ever feel unable to catch your breath, or to draw enough air into your lungs? This is a very common symptom of asthma.


Exercising more vigorously than usual can cause this feeling in anyone. It's more likely to be a sign of asthma if even light exercise triggers this feeling. Until you get an official diagnosis, set exercise limits that don't cause breathing issues.

, Wheezing breath sounds like whistling or squeaking in your chest. This has several possible causes, but asthma patients often wheeze when exposed to allergens or viral infections (such as a cold)., Some people with asthma suffer from coughing fits. These often happen at night or early morning, making it hard to sleep., If you or your biological family have allergies, eczema, or skin rashes, you are more likely to have asthma., Kids under the age of five often wheeze due to an infection or cold, even if they don’t have asthma. A doctor may not be able to diagnose a child at this age, but he may still suggest treatment to make your child more comfortable. If symptoms stick around past the age of five, the child most likely has asthma.Children don't always tell people about their symptoms. Look for indirect signs of problems, including fatigue and avoiding sports or social events. Infants with breathing issues may have difficulty feeding, or may grunt during feeding."

Write down possible triggers after each attack.,
Consider common allergens.,
Avoid inhaling irritants.,
Minimize cold air exposure.,
Learn about asthma and exercise.,

Bring along this record when visiting a doctor, especially an allergy and asthma specialist.

, Inhaled allergens can inflame your airways, causing asthma symptoms. The most common examples include:Dust
Animal fur
Mold
Cockroaches
Pollen (learn how to reduce pollen exposure)


, These substances can trigger an asthma attack in many patients:Smoke, including from tobacco
Car exhaust
Polluted air
Any sprayed chemical product, including hairspray and air freshener
Home décor products, including paint and cleaning products

, Cold air can constrict your airways and trigger an asthma attack. If this happens to you, make a doctor's appointment. In the meantime, take the following precautions in cold weather:Inhale through your nose, not your mouth
Wrap a scarf over your mouth and nose
Avoid exercise in cold locations

, If you have difficulty breathing during exercise, visit a doctor as soon as possible. It may be dangerous to continue exercising before you have asthma medication and medical advice.


Asthma patients can learn to exercise safely, even at the Olympic level! Exercise that involves short bursts of activity is less likely to cause an attack.

, Chemicals in the workplace can irritate your lungs. Don't assume a chemical is safe because you've been using it for years; you may have developed an allergy that triggers asthma. Take precautions to avoid these if your breathing improves during time off. Here are the most common workplace asthma triggers:Hydrochloric acid, ammonia, or sulfur dioxide
Latex gloves
Paint hardener
Powdered medications
Plastics or resin manufacture
Detergent powder manufacture
Insecticides
Flour
Any of the allergens and irritants listed earlier

, Some people react to sulfites, a type of food preservative often found in processed foods. The following foods often contain sulfites, but may be available in sulfite-free preparations:Dried fruits or vegetables
Wine and beer
Shrimp (including fresh shrimp)
Bottle lime or lemon juice
Many processed or pickled foods, especially potato products

Understand other tests.",How to Diagnose Asthma3," Some activities may interfere with the diagnostic tests. To give yourself the best chance at a same-day diagnosis, prepare for your doctor's visit:Do not smoke any substance on the day of your visit.
Avoid all caffeine on the day of your visit.
Avoid exercise and cold air exposure.
Let your doctor know if you have recently had a cold, viral infection, or immunization (shots).

, Try to pinpoint the triggers that may cause your attacks. Tell the doctor if they happen more at certain places, certain times of year, or certain times of day or night.Mention any family history of allergens or skin conditions.

, Some health conditions may make your asthma worse. Let your doctor know if you are experiencing any of the following, or if you experience them regularly:Runny nose
Sinus pain or infection
Acid reflux (heartburn)
Stress
Sleep apnea (snoring and restless sleeping)

, A spirometer measures how well you can breathe. Breathe into the mouthpiece according to doctor's instructions. Typically, you'll take a full breath, then breathe out either slowly or quickly, as directed.For the most accurate results, the test should be conducted at least three times.Tell your doctor first if you have recently had a heart attack, stroke, chest pain, pneumothorax (""punctured lung""), eye surgery, abdominal surgery, or hemoptysis (coughing up blood). Exhaling hard can put pressure on affected areas.
Ask the doctor to explain the results. She will interpret them based on your height and weight, so make sure she has accurate information.

, The doctor may give you a bronchodilator, or medicine that expands your airways, and test you again. If your lung strength improves significantly, you likely have asthma.The doctor may decide to give you a trial of asthma medication, then bring you back in for more tests another day.

, Some doctors may have you exhale into another machine, one that measures nitric oxide. Inflammation in your airways can produce this gas., If your symptoms and test results don't match an obvious cause, the doctor may arrange for other tests. This usually includes one or more of the following:Bronchoprovocation: A test of lung function after cold air, exercise, or irritating your lungs with a spray or powder. This may be unpleasant, but the doctor will reverse the effects afterward.
X-ray of your chest
CT scan (CAT scan) of your sinuses (a computer-aided X-ray of your head)
Allergy skin tests, usually at an allergy specialist's office
EKG: a test to detect problems with heart function, which can cause similar symptoms to asthma
Blood sample to measure immunoglobulin E, an antibody produced in allergic reactions

Start cycling to improve your breathing.,
Go for brisk walks.,
Get a lung function test or Spirometry test to track your improved lung capacity.",How to Control Asthma Without Medicine2," Place a candle 1 meter from where you are seated on a table. Sit across the table and try to blow the candle out with one deep breath. Pushing out all the air in your lungs will increase the breathing capacity of your lungs as well as reduce the volume of the residual air in the lungs. The more the residual volume, the more the lungs are damaged as they cannot exchange air well.


Once you can blow the candle from a distance of 1m, move it further away from you and repeat the same procedure.

, This exercise will improve your breathing capacity and increase your total lung volume, as well as decrease the residual volume in your lungs.

Start by cycling for about 10 minutes and then gradually increase up to 30 minutes or more each day.

, Brisk walking in the early part of the day improves breathing capacity of the lungs. This will then reduce the spasms of the bronchial tubes and enhance your breathing.


A walk early in the morning also helps to stimulate the metabolism and wake it up from the night’s slacked pace. This improves your metabolism, bolsters your circulation and helps clear out allergens and inflammatory substances that tend to accumulate overnight.
Start with a 10 minute brisk walk or a shorter distance if this is too much for you. Increase the time slowly up to as much as forty minutes a day, at least 5 times a week, to see significant results.

, The lung function tests or Spirometry tests determine your lung’s capacity to comfortably and forcibly breathe air in and out. A small tube is attached to a machine that makes calculations of the air you breathe into the tube.


You should see drastic improvements in your test results after repeating these exercises for three months."

Make your food at home.,
Increase the fiber in your diet.,
Choose meats wisely.,
Eat more fruits and vegetables.,
Incorporate anti-inflammatory herbs and spices to flavor your food.,
Determine how these foods can help.",How to Ease Asthma Symptoms Through Diet1," Eat as much of your food from natural, whole ingredients as possible. If you do this, you can limit any processed or prepared foods that you buy and stick to whole foods and meals from scratch.


Since chemicals can cause asthma to flare up, avoiding chemicals in your food can help prevent asthma symptoms.Talk to local farmers in your area and see if there are any that don't use pesticides to treat their produce.
Preservatives have also been known to trigger asthma symptoms, which are found in prepared foods. For example, sulfites, found in wine, pickles, frozen shrimp, and dried fruits, can trigger asthma.;
, Increased fiber has been shown to ease some asthma symptoms.Try to include more foods with high fiber content in your diet to help reduce your asthma symptoms. Although many high fiber foods contain wheat, avoid these if gluten triggers your asthma. Male adults should get 38 grams of fiber a day, and female adults should get 25–26 grams of fiber per day.High-fiber foods include:


Fruits, such as raspberries, strawberries, bananas, oranges, and figs, as well as fruits and their edible peelings, such as apples and pears
Beans, seeds, and nuts, such as black beans, lima beans, split peas, lentils, almonds, and pecans
Vegetables, such as green peas, turnip greens, Brussels sprouts, potatoes with the skin, carrots, artichokes, broccoli, and corn
Grains, such as whole wheat pasta and breads, bran flakes, brown rice, barley, oatmeal, and oat bran, Red meats can increase inflammation, which may make your asthma symptoms worse. Instead of this, eat fish or skinless chicken instead. Chicken skin is high in fat and may also contain antibiotics and hormones, which both promote inflammation as well.


Get wild-caught fish such as salmon, haddock, cod, and tuna, which all contain omega-3 fatty acids. Omega- 3 fatty acids have many properties which are anti-inflammatory and promote good health. Adults should have between 1.1–1.6 grams per day of omega-3 fatty acids daily.
To avoid hormones and antibiotics in any meat, look for free range, all natural meats., There are many different fruits and vegetables that help reduce inflammation. Look for a variety of colors and types of vegetables, from berries to kale to peppers. Most vegetables are great sources of antioxidants, vitamin E and C, and beta carotene. These vitamins have been shown to help decrease inflammation and reduce lung swelling and irritation.You should get at least 15 mg/day of vitamin E and 75–90 mg/day of vitamin C. Higher doses of vitamin C do not hurt the body because any excess is eliminated when you urinate; however, vitamin E is fat-soluble (meaning your body will store excess amounts it in your fat) and it can become toxic if consumed in large quantities.
Fruits such as berries and vegetables such as carrots are high in these substances.
Pick a variety of fruits and vegetables and incorporate them into each meal and snack.

, There are certain herbs you can add to foods and recipes that can help with inflammation in your lungs. Make sure you test a small amount of each of these herbs before you use too much. Taste a pinch, and if you have no reaction within two hours, it is safe to use. These helpful herbs include:

Coughing typically occurs during early morning hours, especially between 2:00 am and 4:00 am.There is usually no mucus or phlegm being coughed up. It's most frequently a dry, persistent cough.
Some people experience intense wheezing with coughing, though you may still have nocturnal asthma even if you do not experience wheezing.
If you have a partner, roommate, or family member living with you, ask them to listen to you at night and report any dry coughing and/or wheezing that you experience in your sleep.;
, Difficulty breathing is a very common symptom of asthma, including nocturnal asthma. Talk to your doctor as soon as possible if you experience any of the following symptoms:


shortness of breathtight chest
difficulty expanding the lungs while breathing in
pain in the chest
wheezing

, Many individuals with nocturnal asthma experience sleep disturbance because of their condition. Nocturnal asthma can cause fatigue and impaired performance the day after an asthma episode.If you consistently feel tired and unrested after a normal night's sleep, or if you have difficulty concentrating or performing at work or school, you may be suffering from nocturnal asthma.

, People with asthma, including nocturnal asthma, may experience varying degrees of severity when it comes to an asthma attack. The estimated severity of an asthma attack typically depends on your ability to speak and lie down while experiencing the attack.During a mild asthma episode, you may experience shortness of breath without any effect on your ability to speak or lie down once you're awake.
During a moderately severe asthma episode, you may feel out of breath while talking once you wake up.
During a severe asthma episode, you may feel restless and out of breath while resting once you're awake. You may also be incapable of lying down or speaking in complete sentences.

, If you suspect you may have asthma, it's important to see a doctor as soon as possible. Only a doctor can give you a definitive diagnosis and prescribe any medications you may need to treat your condition.Your doctor will run tests to confirm your condition and gauge its severity.
Your doctor will also want to rule out any other diseases.
Panic disorder is frequently mistaken for asthma. Numerous pulmonary conditions may also be mistaken for asthma, including chronic obstructive lung disease, pneumonia, bronchitis, a pulmonary embolism, and severe allergic reactions.

, Because nocturnal asthma symptoms are typically most prevalent at night, your doctor may not be able to directly observe your asthma symptoms. Therefore, many doctors rely on a self-completed questionnaire to assess the symptoms of asthma and their frequency.Ask your doctor if you're unclear on any of the terms or the phrasing of any questions, as accuracy is important when answering the questionnaire.
If you do not feel able to accurately diagnose your own symptoms during the night, consider having a friend or family member sleep in the same room as you and report any symptoms to you.

, Imaging scans may be performed on the lungs and sinus cavities to assess any infections, diseases (including tumors), or structural malformations that could cause breathing problems.Ruling out these potentially fatal conditions is an important step in diagnosing asthma.

, There are a number of different tests your doctor may have you perform in order to diagnose a case of asthma.The main categories of tests are either spirometry, which measures both the quantity of air expelled and the time it takes to exhale, and peak flow, which measures your lungs' ability to breathe in and out.A vital capacity test measures the maximum quantity of air that your lungs can inhale or exhale at any given time.
A peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) test, also called a peak flow rate test, measures your lungs' maximum rate of flow while exhaling as hard as you can.
A forced expiratory volume (FEV1) test measures the maximum quantity of air your lungs can exhale in one second.

, This test may not be widely available in some regions. However, in locations where it is available, it can help give some insight into whether an individual has asthma. This test measures how much nitric oxide is in your breath, as high levels of this gas are usually associated with inflamed (and therefore asthmatic) airways., Sputum is a mixture of saliva and mucus that your lungs expel while you cough. When you experience an asthma attack, your body's levels of a particular white blood cell called eosinophil become elevated, and those cells are visible in your sputum when viewed under a microscope.Your doctor will collect a sample of sputum from you and stain it with a dye called eosin. The sample can then be viewed under a microscope.
The presence of eosinophil in your sputum is usually a confirmation of asthma.

, Once your doctor has run the necessary tests, they will be able to determine whether or not you have asthma. If you have asthma, your doctor will also classify the severity of your asthma based on the frequency of your symptoms.Mild intermittent asthma is characterized by having symptoms up to two days in a given week and up to two nights each month.
Mild persistent asthma is characterized by having symptoms more than twice weekly, with symptoms never occurring more than once in any given day.
Moderate persistent asthma is marked by the presence of symptoms once each day and more than one night in a given week.
Severe persistent asthma involves having symptoms throughout the day on most days of the week with frequent episodes occurring at night.

, There are medications your doctor can prescribe for long-term use that will help with your condition. However, you may also need quick-relief medications for short-term relief of asthma attacks.Short-acting beta agonists like albuterol (ProAir HFA) or levalbuterol (Xopenex) can help improve your ability to breathe very quickly.
Fast-acting bronchodilators like Ipratropium (Atrovent) can help relax your airways almost immediately.
Corticosteroids like prednisone and methylprednisolone can be used to quickly relieve inflammation of the airways. However, corticosteroids can have multiple serious side effects, and prolonged use is not recommended.

, Short-term relief is crucial when it comes to asthma attacks, but you'll also need something to manage your symptoms over time. Many short-term relief medications cannot be taken for prolonged periods of time, so your doctor will most likely prescribe some type of long-term medication in addition to those short-term relief medications.Long-acting beta agonists like salmeterol (Serevent) and formoterol (Foradil) are administered via inhaler. They help dilate the airways, but they can also cause severe asthma attacks if not used in conjunction with a corticosteroid inhaler.
Inhaled long-acting beta agonists combined with corticosteroids like Advair (fluticasone/salmeterol) and Symbicort (budesonide/formoterol)can help relieve inflammation in your airways. They will not provide immediate relief, though, and it usually takes several weeks before your condition will improve.
Leukotriene modifiers like montelukast (Singulair) and zafirlukast (Accolate) are taken orally to reduce the symptoms of an asthma attack. These medications can provide relief, but they can have psychological side effects, so it's important to exercise caution if taking them.

, Allergy medications will not help everyone with asthma, as it does not directly act on your inflamed airways. However, if you have allergies and asthma, allergy medications may help control your allergies and reduce the risk of a severe allergy-triggered asthma attack.Some medications are specifically designed for people with both asthma and allergies. For example, omalizumab (Xolair) may be administered every two to four weeks to control allergies and reduce asthma symptoms.
Ask about immunotherapy. This involves gradual exposure to a known allergen over several months until your body gets used to it and decreases your immune system response.

, Asthma can often be aggravated by exposure to irritants during exercise, viral infections, and inhaled allergens in your home, such as tobacco smoke and dust. To help control your nocturnal asthma, make sure that you do what you can to avoid and eliminate these irritants. Some things that might help include:

Avoiding outdoor exercise when pollen counts are high or when poor air quality has been reported.
Using an air purifier in your home to help filter dust and other airborne allergens.
Not allowing people to smoke in your home or around you.
Seeking treatment for allergies.
Getting a flu shot every year."

Keep a food diary.,
Watch out for common trigger foods.,
Avoid your trigger foods.,
Determine how food triggers and sensitivities can hurt you.",How to Ease Asthma Symptoms Through Diet2," The best way to figure out what your food triggers are is by trial and error. In order to find a pattern and discern your reactions to foods, keep a food diary of everything you eat during the day. Write down any reactions you have, even if they seem minor.


Keep this diary over the course of two to four weeks. This should be plenty of time to decide what foods you react adversely to.
Try to eat a wide range of foods so you can ensure that you get the largest sample for possible triggers.
Share your food log with your doctor or nutritionist so that they can help you make informative decisions about your health and asthma.

, There are certain foods that are common triggers for asthma reactions. Make sure you test these foods in particular because they are known to cause asthma reactions in many individuals. These foods include:


Dairy products
Gluten
Eggs
Nuts, especially peanuts
Seeds, especially sesame
Fish and shellfishCitrus and citrus juices, The treatment then is to completely avoid these foods. Once you have found out which foods trigger you, make sure you do not eat them. You will have to start looking at labels to look for these foods on the ingredient lists so you can make sure you miss out of these.


If you eat out, make sure you look for possible trigger foods listed on the menu. If you are unsure, ask the waiter or chef.Some restaurants have special menus that are geared for people with gluten, egg, or nut sensitivities.

, When you are using food to ease asthma symptoms, you need to make sure you avoid foods that may make your asthma worse. Your asthma triggers will vary from everyone else, even those in your family. Asthma is often triggered by foods you are allergic or sensitive to; around 75% of children with asthma have food sensitivities.Food sensitivities may not cause as harsh of an asthma attack as food allergies.
Your body will react to these foods in an adverse way, causing an asthma attack.

Figure out if you have extrinsic asthma.,
Determine if you have intrinsic asthma.,
Recognize the symptoms of asthma.,
Identify your non-food asthma triggers.",How to Ease Asthma Symptoms Through Diet3," There are two main types of asthma: extrinsic (allergic) and intrinsic (non-allergic) asthma.Extrinsic asthma is more common, and it involves an immune response triggered by inhaled allergens that cause an allergic reaction in your lungs. When this reaction occurs, your airways become inflamed and make it difficult to breathe.This type of asthma may be mild, moderate, or severe and will vary in time between attacks.

, Intrinsic asthma is triggered by cold air, exercise, dry air, and/or stress. The immune response is somewhat less critical in intrinsic asthma, but it also involves an inflammatory response. This form of asthma may be mild, moderate, or severe.


This kind of asthma may also be intermittent., Although the cause of asthma will depend on the person, environmental factors, and the type of asthma you have, the symptoms of asthma are the same for all types. Asthma symptoms include recurring periods of:


Wheezing, which is a whistling or squeaky sound during a breath, typically on an inhale
Chest tightness
Shortness of breath
Coughing, often worse at night or early in the morning
The inability to get enough breath, Since asthma is caused by allergic reactions or activities, there are many different things that may be the cause of your asthma. There will be different for everyone and depend on your type of asthma as well. These triggers include:


Allergens, such as dust, animal fur, cockroaches, mold, and pollens from trees, grasses, and flowers
Inhaled irritants, such as chemical fumes, cigarette smoke, air pollution, beauty product fumes, and dust in the environment
Some medications, such as aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and nonselective beta-blockers
Sickness, such as upper respiratory infections, colds, and other viral infections of the lungs
Exercise or other physical activities
Cold or dry air
Additional health conditions, such as heartburn, stress, and sleep apnea"

Learn the art of deep yogic breathing.,
Establish calm with a deep relaxation exercise.,
Unlock your diaphragm with the wave.,
Exhale from your abdomen.,
Try the alternate nostril breathing technique.",How to Do Yoga to Help Your Asthma1," Training yourself to breathe deeply will engage your diaphragm and allow you to breathe better and more easily. Deep breathing exercises also are relaxing and can decrease stress and tension.To start, find a comfortable place to sit. Take a minute to relax and connect to your breath, paying attention to your inhales and exhales.
Inhale through your nose, imagining that you are filling your lungs from the bottom to the top. Expand your belly and open your chest as you breathe in.
Instead of rushing to exhale, find a pause at the completion of your inhale. Take in the feeling of your lungs being completely full of air.
Exhale slowly out of your mouth, imagining that you're emptying your lungs of air just as you would pour water out of a glass. Press your navel towards your spine. Find a pause before inhaling again.;
, A deep relaxation exercise can put you in the right mindset for a sustaining and healing yoga practice. With your mind and body relaxed, you may find it easier to breathe.Start by lying down on the floor with a pillow or folded blanket to support your head. Bend your knees so that your feet are flat on the floor. You also can put a pillow or rolled blanket under your knees so that you are fully supported. You may also want to play some calming music to help you relax.
Bend your arms at the elbows to place your hands on your belly. You can interlock your fingers if it feels comfortable and helps you relax your arms. Bring your mental attention to your breath.
With each inhale, expand your belly up towards your hands so that your hands rise away from the floor. On each exhale, allow your belly to slowly sink away from your hands. Find a pause after each inhale and each exhale so that you are not rushing to breathe.
Continue this exercise for 5 to 10 minutes or longer if you want, maintaining focus on your breath.

, You can follow the deep relaxation exercise with the wave exercise, which will help you develop a stronger habit of breathing deeply from your diaphragm rather than taking rushed, shallow breaths.Lie down on the floor with a pillow or folded blanket under your head and your feet flat on the floor, if you are not already in this position. Your arms should be flat on the floor alongside your torso, palms on the floor.
As you exhale, press your lower back in the floor. On each inhale, lift your lower back away from the floor to create a slight arch in your back. Make sure your hips stay planted to the floor.
Keep your breathing slow and gentle as you repeat the exercise 10 to 15 times. Notice how your breathing amplifies the rhythmic wave in your spine.

, If you're feeling short of breath, you may be unable to exhale fully. This exercise will help you strengthen your exhalations so that you are able to enjoy a better breathing cycle.For this exercise, you want to lie on your back and close your eyes. You can stretch your arms out or allow them to lay flat at your sides.
As you exhale, purse your lips and blow, as though you are blowing out the candles on a birthday cake. Focus on pushing the air out of your lungs using your abdominal muscles. Go slowly, controlling the exhalation rather than trying to force all the air out at once.
When your exhale is complete, relax and pause for a few seconds. Keep your throat open and allow the air to flow into your lungs through your nose. Count the number of seconds that you inhale, and try to make your exhale last the same number of seconds as your inhale.
Repeat this exercise for 5 to 10 breath cycles, trying to make each breath cycle last a little longer than the previous.

, The alternate nostril breathing technique is a good way to calm your mind as well as relieve stress. The technique's stress-relieving properties may promote healing for you and enable you to breathe better if you have asthma.Find a comfortable seat and turn your mind to your breath. Place your first two fingers against your left nostril to close it and inhale through your right nostril. Use the same deep yogic breathing, expanding your belly to slowly take in as much air as possible.
Pause at the top of your inhale and move your fingers to your right nostril to press it closed. Then exhale slowly through your left nostril.
When you've completed your exhale, pause and switch to repeat the cycle. Continue this practice for 5 to 10 minutes.

Figure out your triggers.,
Record your peak flow rate in the AAP.,
Collect all additional relevant information.,
Write your plan with your doctor and respiratory therapist.,
Determine your Green Zone.,
Figure out your Yellow Zone.,
Determine your Red Zone.",How to Create an Asthma Action Plan1," Asthma attacks are caused by triggers. Triggers are different substances or events that cause your airways to become more inflamed, causing an attack. In order to write a detailed action plan, you need to be able to list all your triggers and how much they affect you. As time passes, keep a lookout for any new triggers and add them to your plan. Common triggers can include:


Irritants from cigarette smoke, chemicals in the air, fumes from cleaning and beauty products, and air pollution
Allergens from animal fur, dust, mold, cockroaches, grasses, trees, and flowers
Sickness such as colds and other viral infections of the lungs
Conditions such stress, heartburn (acid reflux), and sleep apnea
Medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and nonselective beta-blockers
Exertion from exercise and other physical activities
Dry or cold air;
, A peak flow meter is a hand-held device that tests how well your lungs are working day to day. You should include a space on the action plan for recording your peak flow rate every day to check if your asthma is getting worse. Talk to your doctor about getting a peak flow meter.


A low measurement on a peak flow meter is an indication that your lungs are not working as well as they should be., When you start to write your action plan, you need all of the relevant information that will help take care of an attack. These relevant facts include:


A list of all the medications you are taking, both long-term and short-term
What your ideal peak flow measurements are, which may be used with moderate to severe asthma patients and will be determined by your doctor.
Names and numbers of emergency contacts, which should include a loved ones, your doctor, and your local hospital, Your asthma action plan requires you to understanding your condition and know your asthma history. The plan is a written document that outlines the steps you need to take in order to deal with your asthma and stop it from getting worse. You need your doctor and respiratory therapist to help you outline the best set of steps to help treat your asthma anywhere you go.


In preparation for your plan, you doctor may have you track your symptoms so you know what triggers you the most and to what extent. Your plan will outline the three levels of urgency when dealing with an asthma attack and give you guidelines on when you need to call your doctor or seek emergency medical attention.If you want a base action plan to start from, you can download one from the American Lung Association.

, The American Lung Association recommends that your action plan be divided into three sections called zones. These zones reflect the severity of your asthma attack. The Green Zone is when you have no problem breathing, you are not coughing or wheezing, and you can go about your daily activities like normal., The second section, called the Yellow Zone, is the zone that you need when you are experiencing some kind of asthma symptoms but not a full on asthma attack. You are in the Yellow Zone if you are coughing, wheezing, and a tight chest. These symptoms may also wake you up at night.


If you find yourself in the Yellow Zone, get away from any triggers, if possible and then take time to breath deep and slow down. This is the time where you might need to take some prescription quick-relief medication.

, The Red Zone, which is the most severe, means you are having an asthma attack. If you are in this zone, you are breathing fast and hard, you can't walk or talk well, and your rescue medication is not working. This is the stage where you may need emergency care if you cannot get your asthma attack under control.


This section should include any rescue medications such as inhaled corticosteroids that are prescribed by your physician."

Expand your chest with a bridge.,
Stretch your bronchial tube with a supportive fish.,
Stand in mountain pose.,
Open up your lungs with a forward bend.",How to Do Yoga to Help Your Asthma2," The bridge will help you open up your lungs as well as strengthening your abdominal muscles to enable you to breathe more fully and deeply.Start this pose by lying flat on your back with your knees bent so that your feet are flat on the floor. Lie your arms alongside your torso with your palms on the floor, and scoot your feet back so they are close to your fingertips. Your feet should be directly below your knees.
On an inhale, lift your hips toward the ceiling, bringing your chest up to meet your chin. Keep your thighs together – don't let your knees splay out. If you have difficulty with this, you may want to place a yoga block or rolled towel between your thighs that you can press. Keep your shoulders lowered so that your shoulder blades are resting flat alongside your spine.
Try to hold the position for 30 seconds to a minute, breathing deeply. Slowly lower on an exhale.

, The supportive fish pose may have a funny name, but it can provide natural asthma relief by helping to open your airways and strengthening your bronchial tube.For this pose you'll need two rolled-up towels or blankets, one thinner than the other. Lay on your back and place the thinner of the two props under your mid-back, the thicker one behind your neck so the bridge of your nose is aligned with your chin.
You can pull your legs into a cross-legged position or simply extend them straight out in front of you, relaxing your feet. Rest your arms on the floor at a 45-degree angle from your hips, palms pointed toward the ceiling.
Relax and hold this position for 5 to 10 breath cycles, breathing deeply.

, When you get in this yoga pose, you may feel as though you're not doing yoga at all – that you're just standing. However, this simple pose can improve your posture and open your chest to help you breathe more easily.Stand with your big toes touching, heels slightly apart. Straighten your spine and roll your shoulder blades down and back so they are resting flat alongside your spine.
Let your arms hang loosely at your sides, palms toward your body and fingers spread. Distribute your weight evenly through all four corners of your feet.
Hold this position for 5 to 10 breath cycles, breathing deeply in through your nose and out through your mouth.

, When you do a forward bend in yoga, don't think about forcing yourself to the floor or touching your toes. Rather, you want to fold gently from your hips, bending your knees as much as necessary.Stand with your feet about hip-width apart or wider if you need to. On an exhale, slowly fold your body forward from the hips as far as you comfortably can. You may be able to rest your palms flat on the floor, or you can rest them on your shins if that's as far as you can go.
Inhale and cross your forearms over your head, taking your elbows in your opposite hands. Close your eyes and simply let your body hang for 5 to 10 breath cycles. On an inhale, slowly rise back to stand.

This relaxing inversion can open your chest and help relieve stress so that you find it easier to breathe.Start on all fours with your hands slightly in front of your shoulders. Spread your fingers and palms wide to provide a good base and tuck your toes under your feet.
On an exhale, lift your hips away from the floor, extending your arms and legs. You can keep a slight bend in your knees if it's more comfortable. If you're able to flatten your feet on the floor, do so, but you also can stay on your toes.
As you inhale, think about pushing down through your heels into the floor. With each exhale, think of lifting your hips toward the ceiling, pulling the weight away from your wrists. Hold this pose for 5 to 10 breath cycles, then slowly lower your knees to the floor on an exhale.

, Cobra is a supported pose that can help you manage your asthma symptoms by creating more space in your chest and opening up your lungs. The gentle backbend also stretches your spine.Start by lying on your belly on the floor with your legs extended straight behind you. Place your palms under your shoulders, spreading your fingers wide. Press your elbows back into your sides, making sure your shoulders are neutral with your shoulder blades melting down your spine.
On an inhale, straighten your arms to lift your chest up and your torso away from the floor. Lift through your sternum, keeping your back soft.
Hold this pose for 15 to 30 seconds, breathing deeply in through your nose and out through your mouth.
If you want to challenge yourself, you can create a flow between the cobra pose and downward-facing dog, with a breath between each movement. Start on all fours, then on an exhale lift into downward-facing dog. Pause, then lower and lift your chest into cobra on an inhale. Repeat the flow three to five times.

, At first blush, the savanna or ""corpse"" pose may feel like you're simply lying on your back. But there's more to the pose than that, and it is a great pose for stress relief that can help you manage your asthma symptoms.Lie on your back, tucking your tailbone and allowing your shoulder blades to melt down your back along your spine. Extend your arms down your sides, palms up toward the ceiling. Relax your feet.
Close your eyes and release any tension in your face. Inhale slowly through your nose, expanding your belly and lifting your chest. Pause, then exhale through your mouth as slowly as you can.
Hold this pose for 5 to 10 minutes, focusing on your breath. Try to breathe as slowly and evenly as possible, relaxing every muscle in your body as though you are dropping through the floor.

, The butterfly is a relaxing pose that also helps stretch your muscles to open up your chest and help you manage your asthma symptoms.From a comfortable seated position, bring the soles of your feet together so that your knees are pointed out to the sides. This is the shape that gives the pose its name, since your legs look a little like two butterfly wings. Hold the arches of your feet with your hands, maybe even giving yourself a little foot massage.
Take a few deep breaths, and then on an exhale, fold forward from the hips, bending your elbows alongside your shins. You also can press your elbows down onto your knees to deepen the stretch in your legs and hips.
Hold the fold for 5 to 10 breaths, then slowly rise to a seated position on an inhale.

, If you're coughing and wheezing due to asthma, the goddess pose can open up your chest to help control these symptoms. In some cases, you may notice an immediate effect.Get a long, rolled blanket or bolster. Sit on the floor and place this prop directly behind you in the same direction as your spine. Bring the soles of your feet together with your knees out to each side. Your legs should resemble a diamond shape or butterfly wings.
Slowly lie back on the bolster, making sure it supports both your head and lower back. You can place your arms alongside your body with your palms facing up, or you can raise them over your head.
Stay in this position for between 5 and 20 minutes, breathing deeply in through your nose and out through your mouth. Focus on your breath and notice how your chest starts to open up.

You can track the pattern of your asthma with you action plan, which can help you pinpoint new triggers or if your asthma is getting worse, despite following your plan., You may want to give your asthma action plan to those you work with in case you have an attack at work. This way, those around you will know what to look for and have all the relevant emergency contact information in case you have a severe attack. You may want to also provide a copy to your partner or any individuals living in your home with you.


If you child has asthma, share his asthma action plan with his school, daycare center, or other institution that he spends large amounts of time., Once you have finalized the action plan with your doctor, you should keep a copy on your person and a copy in a place in your home that is safe and accessible. , You should review your action plan during every doctor’s visit to ensure the plan is up to date with your asthma symptoms and your asthma treatment. If there are changes made to your asthma treatment, such as new medications, or if you develop another asthma trigger, add it to the action plan. Keeping the action plan as current as possible will ensure it is effective and relative to your condition.Reviewing the action plan with your doctor regularly will also ensure you are taking the right dosage of your medication and your action plan is reflective of your doctor’s instructions.

However, it can develop any gender at any age and adult females are at higher risk than adult males., There are a few common symptoms of asthma. If you suffer from these issues often, talk to your doctor to help diagnose asthma or some other issues. These symptoms include:


Coughing, which is typically worse early in the morning or at night
Wheezing, which is a squeaking or whistling sound emitted during a breath
Tightness in the chest
Shortness of breath, If you believe you have asthma, go see your doctor. She will check for a history of symptoms and any family history of the condition. She will also help you decide what the best medication is for your type of asthma and pinpoint your triggers.Asthma manifests in two ways: as intrinsic, non-allergic asthma and as extrinsic, allergic asthma. Extrinsic asthma is the most common, which is triggered by inhaled substances and directly involves an immune response. Intrinsic asthma is all trigger based, and triggered by exercise, cold air, stress, and dry air.
Either form can be mild, moderate, or severe., One of the components of an asthma plan is to list your medications. To help treat your asthma in the short-term, use rescue medications, typically inhalers, such as levalbuterol (Xopenex), albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA), pirbuterol (Maxair), and ipratropium (Atrovent).

Manage your stress.",How to Deal with Asthma During the Holidays1," Your asthma action plan is crucial to making it through the holiday season, since it helps you track your symptoms and take appropriate action. In a written diary or on a device, you should keep track of your asthma symptoms, triggers, and medication use during the holiday season. In dialogue with your doctor, you can use this action plan to adjust your medications in response to any changes in your symptoms.If you do not have an asthma action plan, inquire with your doctor about making one.;
, Asthma can get much worse if you get the flu. So, you should ask your doctor to give you a flu shot at the beginning of the season.

, Exercise can improve the health of your heart and lungs, which helps to reduce asthma symptoms. If you are vacationing in a cold environment, you will want to wear a face mask and stay warm. If exercise in the cold is an asthma trigger for you, you should look into indoor exercise options such as a local gym or indoor pool., The holiday season offers many opportunities for overeating. However, maintaining a healthy weight is important for asthma prevention and treatment. Becoming overweight, in turn, can worsen symptoms., Stress can make asthma much worse because it causes your body to release certain chemicals and tighten the muscles in your airways. Tackle your stress by eating well, getting exercise, meditating, talking to a friend, and making time for yourself. You might find it helpful to review these five ways of reducing stress:Give yourself an exercise break. A short period of exercise lasting at least twenty minutes can lower your stress levels significantly.
Remember that a few laughs and a smile can reduce your stress significantly. Take the time to go see a play or a film with a friend and remember to find a comedy.
Make time for meditation. Brief periods of meditation can help your body and mind deal more effectively with stress.
Take a moment away from the stressor. If there is a person or project in your life that is causing you stress, you should give yourself a bit of time away from it. Although it is not wise to avoid or ignore the stressor entirely, which will make it worse, it is important to take a break from it once in a while to gain some perspective.
Find social support. Take the time to call a friend and review the stressful situation. This can help you process the situation and reduce your stress levels.

Inquire about your room.,
Prepare your travel insurance documents.,
Find out how to get medical help at your destination.,
Pack extra inhalers.,
Tell your doctor about asthma medications when you get vaccinated.,
Take a pet toy.",How to Deal with Asthma During the Holidays2," If you have severe and persistent asthma, you should weigh the risks of travel (e.g., triggers, access to a good doctor) against possible benefits (e.g., sun and relaxation). Talk to your doctor about the decision and plan accordingly.If you decide to go, you should try to choose a trip that is easier on your asthma symptoms and reduces exposure to triggers such as pollen and cold weather.If you have mild or moderate asthma, you should be fine but you should consult your doctor about the trip.If you are well enough to travel, then ask your doctor about getting extra medication to take along with you.

, If you are traveling to spend time with family during the holidays, you might not have a choice of destination. However, if you are planning a trip with your family, you may be able to choose a holiday destination that will be relatively easier on your asthma symptoms. In deciding on a destination, you should consider weather, pollen, physical activity level, accommodation, and air travel. In particular, take the following considerations into account:Coastal areas often have lower pollen counts. Inquire about the pollen conditions at your destination.
Consider the impact of the altitude at your destination. People who are triggered by the cold sometimes have difficulty with high altitudes.
Shifts in weather from hot to cold or changes in humidity can be a trigger for some people, so you should look into the weather at your destination.
If you are managing your asthma well, flying shouldn’t be a problem. That said, some people have trouble with the air pressure on flights. Talk to your doctor about tests to determine your ability to fly.
Go through your list of triggers with your travel agent to make sure your accommodation is safe.

, If you will be staying at a family house or at a hotel, you should inquire about the décor and ask to see if the room is smoke-free. You should try to find a place to stay that does not have carpeting, and request a room that is always a smoke-free room. Hardwood flooring tends to be easier on the lungs because it is easier to keep clean and dust free. In general, you want to find out what measures are taken to ensure a dust and allergen free environment in your room so that you can reduce possible triggers. You could ask your host the following questions about décor:Are there dustproof covers on the mattress and pillows? If not, is it a clean room?
Is there firewood in the house? If so, how is it stored? Firewood can be a source of mold spores, so you want to avoid being around it too much.
Have the pets been cleaned? If pets with fur or feathers are a trigger for you, this is a very important question.

, You should make sure your travel insurance covers asthma related costs such as treatment for an asthma attack in a foreign country. You should make sure you have all of your insurance information easily accessible and check to see that your travel companions know where to access this information in case of an asthma attack., Inquire with your travel agent or online to find out the emergency telephone number for medical services at your destination. You should also write down a list of medical clinics that are reputable and accessible at your travel destination., You never know when you will need an inhaler. In case you lose one or your symptoms get worse during travel, you should pack extra inhalers. It is wise to pack extra inhalers in your carry-on baggage so that you don’t lose them in the event of lost luggage.Plan to bring enough asthma medication for your entire trip and then an extra week. In addition, take one or two extra inhalers.Take your medication in its original packaging and with the prescription details attached to it.You will need to put your medications into a sealed plastic bag to get through security. The security guards may do tests on the medication but they will let you through once they figure out that it is for your asthma., If you are getting travel vaccinations, you should tell your doctor about your asthma medications and especially any high-oral dose steroids you may be taking., If you stay away from your pet for a long time during the holiday season, you may lose your tolerance for it. This is sometimes referred to as the “Thanksgiving effect.” To avoid this situation, you could bring a piece of your pet’s clothing (e.g., a dog’s shirt) or a toy with you on the trip. Although there is no proof this will help, it can’t hurt and will remind you of them during your trip."

Tell the host about your asthma.,
Find out about the holiday decorations used at your work party.,
Avoid the room with the Christmas tree.,
Stay away from fireplaces and scented candles.,
Wash your hands regularly.,
Keep your rescue inhaler on you at all times.",How to Deal with Asthma During the Holidays3," If a family member is hosting the holiday party this year, you should tell them about your asthma. They may be able to better accommodate you if they know about your triggers. For example, if mold is a trigger, you should tell them about it.

, If your employer is hosting a holiday party, find out what decorations will be used for the event. A number of common holiday decorations can be triggering for people with asthma, such as poinsettias, Christmas trees, artificial trees, and alcoholic drinks. If you know any of these items are likely to cause an asthma attack, you might want to tell the people who are organizing the work party or avoid the party altogether., If you find yourself at a holiday gathering with a large Christmas tree and your asthma acts up, try moving to a different part of the house or building that is a good distance away from the Christmas tree. Christmas trees often contain mold if they have been indoors for a couple of weeks. If it is an artificial tree, it may have mold or dust from the storage warehouse., If there is a room with a fireplace or a lot of scented candles, you might want to avoid it. Try to stay away from smoke, especially if you have experienced smoke as an asthma trigger in the past., You may touch a communal object at the party or elsewhere that has dust or mold on it, so you should wash your hands frequently. This should help you manage your symptoms at the party., Always make sure that you carry your rescue inhaler with you so you will have it if you need it. Also, always keep a second rescue inhaler at home as a backup."

Put a warm compress on your forehead and nose.,
Blow your nose regularly and gently.,
Take a steamy bath or shower.,
Breathe in steamy water with essential oils.,
Irrigate your nose and mouth with a saline solution.",How to Fight a Flu Naturally1," Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms. Sleeping longer hours and slowing down your activities will help your body focus on fighting the flu. Because your body is more exposed to contagion when fighting the flu, staying at home will also prevent the possibility of catching other infections.Keeping an extra pillow under your head when you lie down or sleep will provide some relief to your congested airways. While at home, spend as much time as possible lying in bed. Decrease your mobility to avoid wasting the energy your body needs to fight the infection.;
, Moisten a cloth with warm water or use a hot water bottle to relieve the pain. The heat will loosen the tension in your muscles and relieve cramps. If your muscles are sore, you can also apply the hot water bottle in the area to soothe the pain.
Don’t do this before going to bed to avoid burning your skin while asleep.

, Blowing hard could cause a nosebleed and push germs into your ear passages, thus spreading the infection. In order to blow gently, press one nostril closed with your finger and blow softly to clear one at a time. Sniffing the mucus back into your nose is very bad for your airways. Always have soft paper tissues at hand to blow into whenever you need.

, Humidity will open up your airways and speed up their decongestion, as well as bring some relief to muscular pain. If you feel too dizzy to take a shower, sit in your bathroom with the shower running and let the steam fill the room.
You can also use a room humidifier to moisten the air: just clean it thoroughly before using it.

, This is another common home remedy to relieve nasal congestion. Essential oils like menthol, eucalyptus, camphor and ginger have properties that open the sinuses.To use them:


Add 10 to 30 drops of the essential oils of your choice to a pot of boiling water.
Place a towel over your head and lean over the pot, keeping your eyes closed and some distance from the water surface to avoid getting burnt.
Take deep breaths with your nose and blow your nose regularly.

, The water will help you expel mucus from your mouth and throat while the salt will kill germs.

Check where your symptoms are.,
Avoid exercise if your symptoms are severe.,
Stay hydrated.,
Cut back on how much you exercise.,
Lower your intensity.,
Take breaks while working out.,
Keep out of the cold while exercising.,
See your doctor.",How to Exercise when You Have a Cold1," When you have a cold, there are only certain symptoms with which you can exercise. If your symptoms only affect parts of your body above your neck, you are safe to work out. Working out may actually help open your nasal passages. If your cold symptoms affect any body part below the neck, you should not exercise and instead rest.


Above the neck symptoms include minor sore throat, runny nose, sneezing, or nasal congestion.
Below the neck symptoms include chest congestion, productive or wet chest coughing, or upset stomach.;
, Although it may be helpful to work out when you have a cold, you should never work out if you have severe cold or flu symptoms. Never work out if you have a fever, are extremely fatigued, or if you have widespread muscle aches.


These are symptoms of a more intense cold, which may lead to a more severe illness if you overwork yourself with exercise., When you are sick, you need elevated levels of fluids. The same is true for when you work out, both before and after a workout. This means that it is especially true when you are sick and are working out. Make sure you get plenty of water before you work out and drink plenty afterwards.


If your throat is scratchy before or after, try warm liquids, such as tea or chicken broth, to help ease any discomfort.
You might also eat a healthy snack afterwards as well to keep your energy up, even if you just worked out for a short time., Your body expends a lot of energy fighting off the virus infecting your body when you are sick. Even if your symptoms are above the neck and not very severe, you should not work out for extended periods of time. Instead, try to keep your workout short.


This means you should skip your normal hour-long exercise routine and do about 30 minutes instead.
The reduced time will still be beneficial and it won't strain your healing body., Just like with a shorter amount of time, you should also lower the intensity of your workout. If you work out really hard for even a short amount of time, it can strain your body too much and cause you to get worse.


For example, if you do high-intensity kickboxing for 45 minutes at a time, try a different type of exercise while you are sick that is less intense, such as a cardio dance class.Working out at a high-intensity can actually increase your symptoms and make your immune system more susceptible to additional infections or illnesses.Light intensity workouts have been shown to help reduce the severity and length of upper respiratory infections., While you are sick, you may tire easier than other times that you work out. If you find yourself feeling lightheaded or overextended, take a break before you return to working out.


The breaks can last from five minutes to 30 minutes, depending on how you feel. Only start back your exercise routine when you feel better and more stable.
You should also take breaks as often as you need them. It depends on your personal well being.
If you keep going, you may cause yourself injury or lengthen your symptoms., When you have a cold, you should avoid doing any exercises outside if it is cold. The cold, dry air can irritate your airways, which can trigger coughing fits, a runny nose, or other breathing issues.This means you should not jog or walk in the cold.
Cold air is a risk factor for bringing on an asthma attack; therefore, if you have asthma be especially vigilant.
You should also avoid outside winter activities when you have a cold, such as skiing, snow hiking, or snowboarding.

, If you aren't sure if you should work out with your symptoms, see your doctor. Your doctor will be able to tell you whether or not your symptoms are too severe to work out. Your doctor may also be able to give you other tips on how to work out with your symptoms.


If your symptoms get worse while you work out, you may also need to see your doctor to make sure your condition is not getting worse.Stop and call your doctor immediately if you have a coughing fit while exercising or if you develop increased chest congestion.
If you have trouble breathing, have increased chest pressure, feel extremely dizzy, or have difficulty balancing during a workout, you may need to seek immediate emergency care."

Walk.,
Jog.,
Try qigong.,
Do yoga.,
Dance.,
Swim in moderation.",How to Exercise when You Have a Cold2," When you are sick, walking is a great way to get some exercise without overdoing it. You can decide exactly how long you walk, how far, and at what speed without too much effort. The fresh air may also help relieve your congestion if it is severe.Avoid going outside if your sinuses are made worse by allergies, especially if you are sick.

, If you are a runner, you can still jog some while you are sick. Your body is used to running if you are a runner, so it will not take as much out of you if you are sick; however, if you are still learning or training to become a runner, lay off of jogging until you feel better.


Make sure you jog at a slower speed and for shorter periods of time when you are sick., Qigong is a traditional Chinese exercise that focuses on movement. It blends low-impact martial arts and meditation. This kind of exercise is great for you when you are sick because it doesn't take too much out of you physically while still working your muscles.It also helps reduce stress, lower anxiety, increase your energy, and improve your blood flow.There is even some early evidence that Qigong can help improve immunity if done at least three times a week., Yoga is a great low-impact exercise that you can do while you are sick. When you are sick, your body releases stress hormones, such as cortisol. Yoga can help relieve this stress and also may help boost immunity.However, you should avoid high-intensity versions of yoga, such as hot yoga, especially since these intense forms can make your sickness worse.
Stick to low-intensity versions of yoga or low-intensity moves. These include Supported Bridge Pose and Reclining Twist., Dancing is a great exercise when you have a bit of a head cold. Typically, dance classes get your heart rate up but are relatively low-impact, which will keep you from causing too much strain on your body. It also helps with stress relief and the production of antibodies that help fight colds, both of which help boost your immune system.


Try classes such as Zumba or cardio dance., Swimming is a low-impact exercise that can be moderated easily. You can swim for short periods of time or leisurely if you are feeling fatigued. For some people, swimming can also help with their cold and open up their sinuses.


However, this may not work for all people, especially if lying sideways bothers your sinuses.
Avoid swimming if you have a hard time breathing or if the chlorine in the water bothers your sinuses."
"
Don’t weight train.,
Avoid playing sports with your friends.,
Skip the machines at the gym.,
Cut out long-distance running.",How to Exercise when You Have a Cold3," When you are sick, your body is not at its peak. Your muscles are weaker and you fatigue faster. Because of this, you are likely not going to be able to perform to the same standards as you typically do with weights.


This means that you are at greater risk of injury while you are sick, especially if you try to do the intensity and weight you are used to doing while healthy., Vigorous team sports are not a good idea when you are sick. Although some physical exercise may make you feel better, a large game of football or soccer could cause you to worsen your symptoms. Your friends may also crash into you while you are weak with a cold, which can do more harm to your body when you aren’t feeling well.


Plus, you are likely to spread your germs to the other players if you are all handling the same equipment, which isn’t safe for them., If you are sick with a cold, avoid going to the gym. Not only are you more likely to do a more vigorous workout that can weaken your body more, you are also at risk of spreading your germs to those around you.


Consider if you would want a person with your symptoms using the machines at the gym before you.
Instead of going to the gym, do a simple, gentle exercise routine at home., If you are training for a marathon or triathlon, take extra care when you get a cold. Instead of heading out for your long-distance run like usual, run for a shorter length of time or skip a day all together. Long-distance running takes hours and puts continual stress on your body over this time period, which is not good for your immune system.


Studies have shown that intense bouts of strenuous exercise actually compromise your immune system for up to a day afterward. This means your body would be more susceptible to increased or additional sickness in the time after your run."

Let the fever do its work.,
Be cautious about higher fevers.,
Seek immediate medical care if fever is experienced with severe symptoms.,
Take a lukewarm bath.,
Wear wet socks.,
Cool the head, neck, ankles and the wrists.",How to Cure a Viral Infection with Home Remedies1," It is not well appreciated by most, but fevers are one of the body’s main defenses against infections. Let a fever run as long as possible without too much discomfort. Fever is most often a symptom of an infection but can also be caused by inflammatory conditions, thyroid disease, cancer, vaccines and some drugs. Temperature is regulated by a small gland located in the center of the brain, the hypothalamus. The thyroid gland also plays a role in body temperature. Body temperature can vary throughout the day, but a normal temperature is considered 98.6 degrees F or 37 degrees C.
During an infection, the infecting agent (bacteria, virus) produce temperature-increasing substances called pyrogens. Some pyrogens are also induced by the immune system. These pyrogens tell the hypothalamus to increase body temperature. This in turn, stimulates the immune system to be more effective at fighting off an infection. Higher body temperature is believed to kill off infectious agents as well., For adults, most fevers are not dangerous and you can let the fever “run its course”. If the fever is sustained at over 103 degrees F (39.4 degrees C) or higher for more than 12 to 24 hours, consider calling a physician.;
, While you can allow a fever to run its course, there are limits to how high you should let a fever go:For infants younger than four months old with a rectal temperature of 100.4 degrees F (38 degrees C) or higher, immediately call your physician for advice.
For children of any age, if their rectal temperature is 104 degrees F (40 degrees C) or higher, immediately call your physician for advice.
Any child six months or older with a fever of 103 degrees F (39.4 degrees C) by measuring on the forehead, ear or armpit, should also be seen.

, It is recommended that if your child has any fever along with any of the following symptoms, call your doctor (or emergency services) as soon as possible:


Looks sick or has no appetite
Is very fussy
Is drowsy
Has obvious signs of infection (pus, discharge, streaky rashes)
Has a seizure
Has a sore throat, a rash, a headache, a stiff neck, an earache
In very young infants, if the soft area on the top of baby’s skull is bulging

, Start off by drawing a lukewarm bath. Have the person with a fever get in and relax while the temperature of the water slowly drops. Because the temperature of the water drops slowly, the person cools down slowly as well. You don’t want the water too cool because you don’t want to drop the body temperature too fast., This treatment is a traditional naturopathic approach. The theory is that cold feet stimulate an increase in circulation and an increased response from the immune system. The result is that the body expends heat and ends up drying the socks and cooling the body. This treatment can relieve chest congestion as well. The wool socks, by the way, serve as insulation. This method works best overnight.


Use a pair of cotton socks long enough to cover the ankles. They should be pure cotton because cotton absorbs a lot of water.
Thoroughly wet the socks in cold running tap water.
Wring out all excess water and put the socks on.
Cover these cotton socks with wool socks. The wool socks should be pure wool because this supplies excellent insulation.
The person wearing the socks should be covered with a blanket and rest in bed for the rest of the night. Most kids will be pretty cooperative because they should begin to feel cooler within a few short minutes.

, Take one or two hand towels and fold along the longer axis. Soak the towels in either very cold water, or, if desired, ice water. Wring out the excess water and wrap the towel around your head, around your neck, around your ankles or around your wrists.


Don’t use the towels over more than two areas. That is, use the towel around your head and your ankles OR around your neck and your wrists. Otherwise, you may cool down TOO much. The cool or cold towels draw heat out of the body and can lower the body temperature.
Repeat when the towel is dry or not cool enough anymore to give relief. This can be repeated as often as needed.

So, stay home from work, keep children home from school and keep your activity level low and as easy as you can.

, You probably have heard the phrase “Feed a cold, starve a fever” A recent article in Scientific American agrees-- except you don’t really want to go so far as to “starve” the fever-- you just don’t want to waste the body’s energy with digestion when that energy should be used to control the infection.


Try chicken broth or chicken soup with just some rice and some vegetables. , , These fruit are also rich in vitamin C, which can help fight infections and lower fevers.

, Try either plain or flavored yogurt that contains “active cultures” of bacteria. These intestinal bacteria have been shown to be essential for a functional immune system.

, Make sure you include a good and easily digested source of protein such as scrambled eggs or chicken. For example, you can add a few pieces of meat to your chicken broth.

, Avoid foods that are heavy, fatty or oily like barbecued or fried foods. Avoid spicy foods like chicken wings, pepperoni, or sausages too. These are too hard on your system when you’re ill.

, The BRAT diet is often recommended, especially after a stomach virus. This consists of gentle and easy-to-digest foods, including:Bananas

Rice

Applesauce

Toast (whole grain).

, Zinc has been shown to reduce the length of time one has a cold. Food sources of zinc include seafood (oysters, king crab, lobster), beef, chicken (dark meat), yogurt, beans and nuts (cashews, almonds).

Drink plenty of water.,
Try an oral rehydration solution such as Pedialyte or CeraLyte.,
Keep breastfeeding your baby.,
Monitor for signs of dehydration.",How to Cure a Viral Infection with Home Remedies3," Fever can lead to dehydration and you want to make sure you avoid this. It will only make you feel worse. Kids (and you) might enjoy frozen popsicles as well, but you do want to avoid too much sugar. Try making popsicles from herbal teas such as chamomile or elderberry. Frozen Italian ices or frozen yogurt or sherbet may be good choices as well. But don’t forget plain water!

, You may want to consider using an oral rehydration solution for young children like CeraLyte, Pedialyte. Call your physician before you do, and ask their advice.


Be prepared with a list of symptoms and about how much your child has been eating, drinking and how high their fever has been.
Also keep track of how often you have to change diapers or, for an older child, how often they have to urinate.

, If your baby is suffering from a viral infection, it’s a good idea to continue breastfeeding as much as possible. This provides food, water and comfort to your baby.

, Call your physician for advice even if you are just seeing the signs of mild dehydration, especially in babies. These can progress to more serious dehydration pretty quickly. Some symptoms of mild dehydration include:Dry, sticky mouth. In a baby, look for dry lips or crustiness around the lips/eyes. Also look for “lip-smacking” behavior.
More sleepiness, fussiness or tiredness than usual.
Thirst: This is hard to tell in a small infant, but the “lip smacking” behavior or pursing her lips as if she is feeding may be a clue.
Decreased urine output: Check an infant’s diapers. They should need to be changed at least every three hours. If the diaper is dry after 3 hours, this may indicate some dehydration. Keep pushing fluids and check after another hour. If the diaper is still dry, call your physician.
Check the color of urine. The darker the urine, the more dehydrated the baby or child may be.
Constipation: Check for bowel movements as well, especially when you’re checking the diaper for urine.
Few or no tears when crying
Dry skin: Gently pinch the back of the baby’s hand, just pinching the loose skin. Well-hydrated babies have skin that bounces right back.
Dizziness or lightheadedness

Boost your immune system with high doses of vitamin C. Orthomolecular medicine has found that vitamin C is important in stimulating the immune system.,
Increase your intake of vitamin D3.,
Try coconut oil.",How to Cure a Viral Infection with Home Remedies4," In one study, asymptomatic adults came down with the flu. They were given 1000 mg of vitamin C on an hourly basis for six consecutive doses. They then received 1000 mg three times daily as long as they were symptomatic. Their reported flu and cold symptoms were reduced by 85% compared to a placebo.Take 1000 mg of vitamin C every hour for six hours. Then take 1000 mg three times a day until you don't feel your symptoms anymore.

, Vitamin D3 is an important vitamin that stimulates the immune system. If you are not already taking vitamin D3 supplements regularly, there is a high probability that you may be deficient in vitamin D. This could be measured with 25-hydroxyvitamin D blood levels. But when a flu hits, there is no time to do this.


For adults: Take 50,000 IU of vitamin D3 on the first day you feel sick. Then take the same amount every day for the next three days. Reduce the vitamin D3 dose slowly over the next few days to 5000 IU daily.
In schoolchildren, another study showed that 1200 IU of vitamin D3 reduced the incidence of influenza by 67% compared to a control group that did not take any vitamin D3 supplement. , Coconut oil has medium chain fatty acids that have antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal and antiparasitic effects without having side effects. The main ingredient in coconut oil is lauric acid, a medium chain saturated fatty acid. It inserts itself into the viral outer membrane and causes a rupture and death of the influenza virus without harming the human host of the virus.


Take one to two tablespoons of coconut oil three times per day. Mix it in warm orange juice or take it with a meal. Usually within one to two days, the virus will be eliminated. Symptoms often disappear within one day, when normally it would have taken five to seven days to recover from a flu,"

Try drinking herbal tea.,
Use a neti pot.,
Use a diffuser.,
Use the old-fashioned method of steaming.,
Breathe in herb-infused steam.",How to Cure a Viral Infection with Home Remedies5," Plants get viruses too, so it does make some evolutionary sense that plants have developed antiviral substances. You can buy these herbs in teabags. If you have them at hand, add one teaspoon of dried herb for every cup of water. Use half a teaspoon for children. Steep in boiled water for five minutes and flavor as desired with lemon and honey. Be sure to let the tea cool down. Avoid adding milk--dairy products tend to increase congestion.


Don’t use these teas with infants, except under the advice of a physician.
Try an herbal tea made from the following herbs: Chamomile: Chamomile is safe for children and has anti-viral properties., Oregano: Oregano is also safe for children (but make it as a weak tea) and has antiviral properties., Thyme: Thyme is safe for children (as a weak tea) and has antiviral properties., Olive leaf: This is safe for children (as a weak tea) and has antiviral properties.Elderberry: This is safe for children (as a tea or as a juice) and has antiviral properties., Licorice leaf: Licorice leaf is safe for children (as a weak tea) and has antiviral properties., Echinacea: This is safe for children (as a weak tea) and has antiviral properties., , A neti pot can be used to wash out a stuffy nose. It is a device that looks somewhat like a teapot. You use it to pour water into your nose to flush out your nasal cavities.


Choose your essential oils. The herbs that can be used to make teas are also good choices for essential oil treatments. These include: chamomile, elderberry, licorice root, Echinacea, olive root, thyme and oregano. Combine an equal number of drops of your chosen oils. The TOTAL number of drops should be nine to ten at the most.
In a separate bowl, add one and a half cups of very warm distilled water. Don’t use water that is so hot that you scald the delicate nasal tissues.
Add six tablespoons of finely ground unprocessed sea salt. Stir to dissolve the salt. The salt is included to help ensure that the nasal tissue is protected.
Add the essential oils and mix thoroughly.
Add the liquid to your neti pot.
Bend forward over a sink, turning your head to one side. Slowly pour the solution through the nasal cavities to clean them.

, This method can be very useful, especially if more than one member of your family has a sinus infection or respiratory infection. Choose your oils from among chamomile, elderberry, licorice root, Echinacea, olive root, thyme and oregano. Or, you can make your own unique mixture.


Follow the manufacturer’s instructions using the diffuser. Most use about a half cup of water with three to five drops of essential oils.
Anyone with a sinus infection should sit as close as possible to the diffuser.

, In this method, all you need is water and your chosen essential oils or mixture of oils. You’ll boil water to create steam, which you’ll breathe through your nose.


Pour water (distilled is best, but tap water is fine) until the bottom of the pot has about two inches of water.
Heat the water to boiling, turn off the heat and add eight to ten drops of essential oils. Stir.
You can either leave the pot on the stove or take it off. Just be careful, whichever you decide.
Cover your head with a towel and breathe in the steam through your nose. You can also breathe through your mouth, especially if you have a sore throat or a throat infection.
Do this as long as the steam is rising. Repeat if desired by reheating the water. The same solution can be used over and over until all the water is gone.

, Take the old-fashioned method of breathing steam and add herbs to the water.


Pour water (distilled is best, but tap water is fine) until the bottom of the pot has about two inches of water.
Heat the water to boiling, turn off the heat and add two teaspoons of oregano and two teaspoons of basil. If you want, you can add a pinch of cayenne pepper. Just be careful!
Cover your head with a towel and breathe in the steam through your nose. You can also breathe in through your mouth, especially if you have a sore throat or a throat infection.
Do this as long as the steam is rising. Repeat if desired by reheating the water.

See your doctor if your immune system is compromised.,
Call a doctor immediately if the common symptoms worsen.,
Seek immediate medical care if you experience certain severe symptoms.,
Get vaccinated.,
Visit your doctor if you don’t get relief from home remedies.,
Ask about antiviral drugs.",How to Cure a Viral Infection with Home Remedies6," With most common viruses and with most healthy adults, viral infections clear without additional treatment. If, however, an individual’s immune system is compromised, a doctor should be called as soon as any symptoms of infection occur. Immune compromise can occur in the very young, older individuals, those infected with HIV/AIDs, individuals who have had an organ transplant and cancer patients going through chemotherapy. Watch for these common symptoms of viral infections:


Fever
Joint aches and pains
Sore throat
Headache
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
Skin rash
Fatigue
Nasal congestion

, If any of the common viral infection symptoms becomes severe, call a physician immediately. If a physician is not available, call for emergency services. , If you experience any of the following symptoms at any time, go to your nearest emergency room.Any change in your alertness or level of consciousness
Chest pain
A deep chest cough that produces wet or liquid yellow, green or brownish phlegm (discharge)
Lethargy or unresponsiveness to stimuli (sounds, light, touch)
Any form of seizure
Any shortness of breath, wheezing, or any difficulty breathing
A stiff or sore neck, or a severe headache
Yellowing of the skin or the sclera (the whites of the eyes)

, Specific treatment always depends on the specific virus. There are hundreds of different viruses that are known to infect humans. Many can be largely prevented with vaccination, such as influenza, chicken pox, shingles and others.


Talk with your doctor about getting vaccinated against certain viruses.

, If you experience symptoms that you think may be a viral infection for more than 48 hours without getting relief from the approaches listed, make an appointment to see your doctor as soon as possible. Many viral infections, like the common cold (rhinoviruses), the flu (influenza virus), measles (rubeola) or mononucleosis (Epstein-Barr virus, or EBV), require primarily supportive treatment. Other viruses cause serious, life-threatening diseases such as cancer and Ebola. Some persistent viruses cause long-term disorders including hepatitis, HSV and varicella-zoster (causing chickenpox and shingles) and HIV., Until relatively recently, there were no effective antiviral drugs. That is changing, with more antiviral drugs being introduced.Antiviral therapy is important for certain infections, including infections with herpes viruses (HSVs), cytomegaloviruses (CMVs) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).


Another approach to treating viral infections is to use interferons. These are natural substances (cytokines) released from infected cells which function to block various facets of viral replication. Use of the interferons is particularly important in the treatment of the hepatitis viruses (B and C), Kaposi’s sarcoma associated with HIV infection, and a sexually transmitted infection called condyloma acuminata, which results in genital warts.

Cough or sneeze into a tissue or the crook of your arm, not into the air.Cold viruses can be spread through the air.,
Avoid close contact with others when you or they are sick.,
Disinfect frequently touched surfaces like doorknobs, TV remotes, and children’s toys.Use a disinfecting cleaner spray and disposable paper towels or disinfecting wipes to clean these items thoroughly.",How to Ease Cold Symptoms Quickly," Fevers are your body’s way of fighting infections, so it is common for people to experience fever while combating a cold. Having a fever of up to 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit (or 39 degrees Celsius) is nothing to worry about, but anything over this level requires immediate evaluation by a doctor. If you are experiencing discomfort from the fever or have a fever of over 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit, there are several ways to reduce it.


Certain over-the-counter pain killers can be taken to reduce a fever. Take acetaminophen (Tylenol, paracetamol), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or aspirin in its recommended dosage.Aspirin should not be giving to children or teenagers because it can cause Reye's syndrome, a potentially fatal condition.Only give Tylenol (acetaminophen) to children. Consult with your doctor before giving any medication to a child under the age of 2.
Seek professional medical help if your fever stays consistently above 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit, does not respond to medication, or lasts for longer than 3 days.Consult your doctor immediately if your infant has a fever over 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit.;
, Cold water will restrict your blood vesselsand send more blood to your internal organs,potentially increasing your core body temperature instead of reducing it.

, Nasal congestion is caused when your sinus tissues are inflamed with excess fluid.It may be accompanied by nasal discharge, also known as a runny nose, or post-nasal drip, which can irritate your throat. Nasal congestion may lead to a sinus infection if left untreated.


Decongestants typically come in pill form (Sudafed, Sudafed PE, which require an ID to purchase and are kept behind the counter) or as nasal sprays (Afrin). Pseudoephedrine (the active ingredient in Sudafed) may cause your blood pressure to rise, and should not be taken by people with high blood pressure. It may also cause drowsiness or cause difficulty sleeping. Do not use nasal sprays for more than 3 days in a row.Do not take an antihistamine for congestion unless your congestion is caused by allergies. Many people mistake seasonal allergies for a cold. If your congestion is accompanied by itchy eyes and frequent sneezing, it is possible you have seasonal allergies and should take an antihistamine.If you are having problems determining if you have a cold or allergies seek medical attention of a Primary Care Physician or Allergist.

, Clean the neti pot with soap and water before use. Fill with a lukewarm saline solution made from distilled or sterile water; never use tap water in a neti pot. If you do not have access to distilled water, sterilize your tap water by bringing it to a boil for 1 minute and allow to cool before use., Bring 4-6 cups of water to a boil and pour into a bowl with a combination of eucalyptus, peppermint leaf, rosemary, thyme, lavender, and salt. Cover the bowl and let steep for 5-10 minutes. Place a towel over your head to trap the steam and hold your head 5-10 inches over the bowl with your eyes closed. Breathe in the steam for no more than 10 minutes., Hot peppers may also help to reduce fever by increasing your blood circulations., The salt helps to draw excess moisture out of inflamed tissues in your throat and helps to break up mucus from post-nasal drip.Dissolve a half a teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water and then gargle the saltwater in the back of your mouth for 30-60 seconds, or up to 3 minutes. Spit out the saltwater and any mucus it has loosened up. Repeat as often as necessary.


A sore throat can also be soothed by sucking on lozenges, hard candies, or ice chips. Do not give lozenges or hard candies to children under the age of 4, as they are a choking hazard.You may also use a sore throat spray, which will numb your throat and keep it from hurting. Follow dosing instructions on the product packaging and do not use more frequently than the recommended amount.

, Try herbal teas made with ginger, basil, chamomile, sage, fennel, licorice root, or peppermint.Black, green, and white teas are also helpful because they contain a lot of antioxidants, which are believed to help strengthen your immunity to illness.Adding lemon to your tea also helps to boost your immunity because lemons are packed with vitamin C and other antioxidants.Honey is very soothing on your throat and has antimicrobial and antibacterial properties.Be careful giving tea with lemon and honey to children, the honey can cause Botulism.

, Over-the-counter pain relievers can help to relieve pain caused by coughing, sore throat, headache, or general body aches. Acetaminophen (Tylenol, paracetamol), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or aspirin can each be used in its recommended dosage. Follow the directions on the packaging for correct dosing information. If you are taking any of these products as a fever reducer, do not take more to treat pain symptoms unless directed to do so by your doctor.

, Your body needs water to function properly, and it is recommended you drink at least 8 glasses a day and at least 8 oz. every 2 hours while you are sick.Drinking lots of fluids will allow your body to replace fluids lost from sweating and producing mucus. It also helps loosen that mucus so you can cough it out of your system.Avoid diuretics including alcohol, caffeine, salty foods, and sugary drinks like soda. All of these can cause dehydration and can slow your body’s natural healing process., Sleep is the body’s most effective way of self-healing. You should get at least 7-9 hours of sleep each night, and even more when you are sick.Take time off of work or school if possible to allow your body to rest and recover. Exhausting yourself by working too much while you have a cold will most likely prolong your illness. Taking time off will also prevent you from spreading your cold virus to others.
Keep your mind distracted while you are resting by reading a book, watching movies or television shows, playing video games, or doing anything that is not physically demanding. Indulging in things you like to do can also help distract you from how bad you feel.

, Tobacco smoke can irritate your nasal passages, throat, and lungs, exacerbating your cold symptoms. Tobacco users are also more likely to catch a cold and to have a cold develop into a more serious illness, like pneumonia., Colds are caused by viruses, which do not respond to antibiotics. Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections., Washing your hands is one of the best ways to keep germs from spreading.To wash your hands properly, wet your hands, apply soap, then work the soap into a lather by rubbing your hands together. Be sure to spread the soap across your palms, the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your fingernails. Continue scrubbing your hands for at least 20 seconds, then rinse off and dry thoroughly.If you do not have access to running water and soap, use a hand sanitizer. Apply the amount directed by the product label and rub the product all over your hands and fingers until dry., When you cough or sneeze, you are releasing thousands of virus particles into the air that can then infect other people. Limit the spread of those viruses by containing your cough or sneeze.

, Don’t hug, kiss, or shake hands when you or the other person has a cold. This can increase the chances of transmission from one person to another. Also don’t share drinking straws or eating utensils, such as forks and spoons with someone who is sick., Cold viruses can live on surfaces for up to 24 hours, so cleaning them frequently helps limit the transmission from person to person."

If you're cold, wrap up in warm and/or your comfiest clothes, and if you can, spend the day bundled up in blankets on the couch or in bed.,
Peppermint candies or tea is an excellent way to relieve coughs and sore throats.,
For a runny nose, it's best to just keep a box of tissues and some hand sanitizer with you and let nature run its course, because naturally blowing snot out of your nose helps flush out any toxins or germs in your body.,
If you have a low to medium fever, try taking a cool, short bath, wrapping your feet in rags soaked in minced onion and egg whites, or taping (medical or foam tape) a slice of fresh potato to both of your inner wrists and taking a nap.

Investigate whether garlic helps with cold symptoms.,
Deal with the smell.,
Eat raw garlic.,
Cook with garlic.,
Make a garlic tea.,
Use a garlic supplement.",How to Cure a Cold With Garlic1," A recent study looked at the effectiveness of garlic in 146 people over a three month period. Those that took a garlic supplement had 24 occurrences of cold symptoms, as opposed to 65 occurrences in those that did not take garlic. Also, those that took garlic had 1 day less of cold symptoms.In another study, those that took garlic had fewer symptoms of a cold and felt better sooner, possibly because a subset of immune cells were increased in those people taking 2.56 g of a garlic supplement daily.Most researchers believe that sulfur-containing compounds in garlic, allicins, are responsible for the anti-common cold effects.However, there are a number of other elements in garlic, such as saponins and amino acid derivatives, that are thought to play a role in reducing the viral load, though it is not clear how they might do this.;
, Many may be concerned about the smell of garlic. The same substances that appear to be effective against the cold virus are the ones that are also responsible for the smell. So, in order to help alleviate your cold symptoms, you are going to have to deal with the smell.


The good news is that you should be staying home from work and school and staying away from other people. You should also be resting and drinking plenty of fluids. All this means is that while the garlic may smell, for the most part, only you and your loved ones will be around. This seems like a small price to pay for getting better sooner with fewer symptoms!

, Always start with fresh garlic if possible. Peel the “paper” off the garlic and use a garlic press or the side of a knife blade to crush the garlic. Eat about 1 raw garlic clove every 3-4 hours. Just peel and eat!If you are not a fan of the taste, wash the garlic down by mixing it with orange juice.
You can also add it to lemon water. Add the garlic to a mixture of 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and 6-8 ounces of water and stir.Raw garlic can also be added to honey water. Honey has both antibiotic and antiviral properties. Add 1-2 tablespoons of honey to 6-8 ounces of water and stir., While raw garlic appears to be the best, cooked garlic still contains allicins that are thought to be effective. Peel and either crush or mince the garlic cloves. Then let the crushed/minced garlic sit for 15 minutes. This allows enzymatic activity to “activate” the allicins in garlic.Use 2-3 cloves of garlic for every meal during a cold. If you are eating light, add the crushed/minced garlic to your chicken or vegetable broth and heat it as you normally would. If you are eating normally, try cooking garlic alongside your vegetables or add garlic to rice as it cooks.
You can also add the crushed/minced garlic to tomato or cheese sauces, once you are feeling better. Rub the crushed/minced over meat or poultry and cook the meat and poultry as you normally would.

, The hot liquid can also help with decongestion. Bring 3 cups of water and 3 cloves of garlic (cut in half) to a boil. Turn off the heat and add 1/2 cup of honey and 1/2 cup of fresh lemon juice with the seeds and the rind included. These contain a significant amount of vitamin C and antioxidants.Strain the tea and sip throughout the day.
Refrigerate leftover tea and reheat as needed.

, This can be a good method for those that are very opposed to the taste of garlic. To help reduce the symptoms of your cold, take 2-3 grams of garlic a day in divided doses."

Understand the common cold.,
Identify the symptoms of the common cold.,
Treat the common cold.,
Assess whether the illness is severe enough to warrant a visit to the doctor.",How to Cure a Cold With Garlic2," The common cold is usually caused by a rhinovirus. Rhinoviruses cause upper respiratory infections (URIs) most commonly, but they can cause lower respiratory infections and sometimes, pneumonia. Rhinoviruses are most prevalent March through October.


The incubation period is usually short, only 12-72 hours after exposure to the virus. Exposure usually occurs by being in relatively close proximity to someone who already has a cold and who coughs or sneezes., Nasal dryness or irritation is often the first symptom. Sore throat or an irritated, itchy throat is another common early symptom.


These are usually followed by nasal discharge, nasal congestion, and sneezing. These usually get worse over the next 2-3 days after the first symptoms.The nasal discharge is usually clear and watery. It may become thicker and greenish-yellow.
Other symptoms include: headache or body aches, watery eyes, facial and ear pressure from congested sinuses, loss of sense of smell and taste, cough and/or hoarseness, vomiting after coughing, irritability or restlessness, and a low-grade fever may occur, usually in infants and preschool children.
The common cold can be complicated by ear infections (otitis media), sinusitis (inflammation of the sinuses), chronic bronchitis (lung inflammation with congestion and coughing) and worsening of asthma symptoms., There is no current cure for the common cold. Instead, you should focus on alleviating the symptoms. The medical recommendations include:Get plenty of rest.
Drink lots of fluids. These fluids can include water, juices, and clear chicken or vegetable broths. Chicken soup IS actually very good for the common cold.Gargle with warm salt water. This will help make a sore throat feel better.
Use cough drops or throat sprays if you have a severe cough that is not allowing you to get enough rest.
Take over-the-counter pain or cold medicines. Make sure to follow the directions on the packaging.

, Most of the time, there is no need to see a physician. If, however, you or your child experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor:A fever with a temperature higher than 100.4 degrees F. If your child is younger than 6 months old and has a fever, call your doctor. For children of any age, if the fever is 104 degrees F or greater, call your physician.
If the symptoms last more than 10 days
If the symptoms are severe or you experience unusual symptoms, such as severe headaches, nausea or vomiting or difficulty breathing.

Do a gargle.,
Steam it out.,
Elevate your head.,
Do a bit of yoga.,
Try a hot pack.,
Use a humidifier at night while you are sleeping.",How to Clear Chest Congestion1," Gargles aren’t always the most appealing, but they help to break apart mucus in your airways. Mix half a cup of warm water with 1-2 tablespoons of salt, and a pinch of turmeric. Stir the mixture to dissolve the salt a bit, and then take a swig. Gargle it as far down your throat as you are able for 1-2 minutes, 3-4 times a day.;
, Similar to drinking hot liquids, the heat and moisture of steam help to break up and dissolve mucus deep in your lungs and throat. Take a hot shower, or fill a bowl with very hot water. Place your face over the bowl and a towel over your head to trap in the steam. Hold your face there for as long as you are able, and breath deeply as you do.


You can choose to add in a few drops of peppermint or eucalyptus essential oil, which may aid in breaking up the mucus.

, This tip applies primarily to sleeping; keeping your head elevated will help promote drainage of mucus, rather than a build-up overnight. Use several pillows to try to keep your head raised a bit higher than your torso.

, Exercise may be the last thing on your mind when you’re sick, but certain yoga positions can help to open up your airways and drain out mucus. Try the reclining bound angle pose, in which you lay a pillow/bolster along the length of your spine on the floor. Lie down on the pillow so that your torso/head are raised above your legs, and then bend your knees. Lay your knees/legs flat on the ground with your knees still bent and the soles of your feet touching.


Maintain this pose for 10-15 minutes for the best results., Applying a hot pack or steaming hot cloth on your throat and chest will help soothe congestion and warm the airways externally. Lie down with your head elevated, and allow the heat to soak in through your skin for 10-15 minutes. It may be helpful to follow this up with a steam treatment to empty your body of the liquefied mucus.

, This can help to open your nasal passages so you can breathe much easier. On certain models there is a slot on front where you can add nasal medication for extra power.

Keep well hydrated.,
Drink plenty of Gatorade and juice to help increase your electrolyte production.,
Drink tea.,
Make an herbal congestion clearer.",How to Clear Chest Congestion2," Drinking plenty of water when you are ill is a must, but is especially helpful in clearing out chest congestion. Not drinking enough liquids will cause the mucus in your chest and throat to coagulate and thicken, making it stickier and harder to get rid of. Drink water (warm is preferable) throughout the day to thin out the mucus in your body.

, When you are sick your body is working very hard to kill your infection and this can significantly hamper electrolytes without restoring them.

, Hot liquids in general help to dissolve the mucus that causes chest congestion, but tea offers a double punch by adding in helpful herbs and spices that can ease chest pain and congestion. Brew up a cup of peppermint, ginger, chamomile, rosemary, or ginseng tea to drink several times a day. Add a bit of honey for sweetness and extra mucus-fighting power.

, Add a little saffron to a cup of milk. Stir and heat it up. Add a teaspoon of honey and a few drops of lemon juice. Drink while very hot and stir every few minutes."
"
Avoid problem foods.,
Eat beneficial foods.,
Try garlic and lime soup.",How to Clear Chest Congestion3," Although food doesn’t seem to be directly related to mucus and phlegm, there is a correlation between the two. Dairy products, salt, sugar, and fried foods all increase mucus production. Cut these items out of your diet until your chest has cleared. 

, On the flip side, there are certain foods that can help to clear out the mucus in your chest and lessen its production. Eat spicy foods, citrus fruits, garlic, and ginger for easy chest congestion relief. In particular, asparagus and pineapple have shown to have chest-clearing benefits as well.

, Both ingredients can help to clear congestion. Add soda crackers to the mix to help even more.Add juice from 3 lemons to a cup of very hot water.
Crush some garlic (1- 2). Add this to the water.
Add some salt and a lot of crushed black pepper.

",How to Clear Chest Congestion4," Expectorants are medications that break apart mucus and make it easier to cough up and expel from your body. There are many over-the-counter expectorants available at drug stores, but you can go to your doctor for a prescription as well.


Expectorants aren’t safe for children younger than six years old, so check with your doctor for a child-safe alternative.

, Suppressants are used to minimize coughing, but unfortunately they can thicken mucus in your chest. Avoid taking a suppressant or suppressant/expectorant combo, as you may worsen your chest congestion. Remember that coughing is normal and healthy when you have chest congestion, so you don’t need to minimize/stop it.


If your coughing is really making your uncomfortable, try taking ginger cough drops instead of a suppressant. The ginger will help to break up your mucus while the cough drop will help to soothe a sore throat. Strong eucalyptus flavored ones can also be soothing.

, These thick creams give off a strong scent that helps you to breathe easier. Although it may not help with breaking up the mucus, it should make breathing much easier. Place this over-the-counter remedy on your chest before you go to sleep and it should open up some of the passageways., Used at the first sign of a cold such as sneezing or a fever, this oral spray can help attack your congestion and cold and you will hopefully feel better faster.

See your doctor to get prescription medication.,
Use an inhaler.",How to Clear Chest Congestion5," If symptoms do not improve with any of these methods, inquire with your doctor about an antibiotic shot, nasal spray, pills or prescription vitamin therapy to clear up stubborn or deep chest congestion. As the old adage goes, it's better to be safe than sorry.

, Ask your doctor about inhalers or nebulizers with which you can administer your own breathing treatments. These are necessary primarily for bad cases of chest congestion, but if you are sick and tired of dealing with mucus you can try one out at any time.

It is a complicated and intricate network that helps prevent infections and limits the effects of those that you do catch.Because it is such a complex system, scientists have not been able to prove direct links between lifestyle changes or taking vitamins or supplements to enhancing your immune system.Scientists are studying things that may boost your immune system, but there are no definite answers yet.There are two types of immunity: humoral and cell mediated immunity. Humoral involves the production of antibodies and fights infections outside of the cell, like bacteria. Cell mediated immunity fights intracellular organisms, such as viruses and cancer. Cell mediated immunity fights the common cold.
Put simply, cells that originate in your bone marrow relocate to all areas of the body to help fight off infection.This includes your skin; lymphatic system; spleen; mucosal tissues like those in your mouth, nose, and gut area; your thymus gland; and your blood stream.Basically, any possible way a germ can enter your body, cells are there to help fight off a possible infection.;
, The very best single thing that you can do to help your immune system be as strong as possible is to make everyday changes to live an overall healthy lifestyle. Some of the steps you can take include the following:Avoid smoking or quit smoking. This includes avoiding secondhand smoke as much as possible.Control your alcohol intake. If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation. Excessive and repeatedly heavy alcohol use adds stress to many organ systems in your body, making it harder to provide the needed balance to help prevent infections.Exercise regularly. Try to select an exercise routine that you enjoy so you are more likely to stay with it.Maintain a healthy weight. If you are overweight or obese, take steps to lose weight. Talk to your doctor if you need help with a diet plan, a referral to a nutritionist, or even medication that can help you get started towards your weight-loss goal.Control your blood pressure. High blood pressure leads to cardiovascular disease, which compromises organ function and blood flow. This can interfere with your immune system’s ability to work effectively in your blood stream, which is one of the ways diseases can enter your body.Get enough sleep. Feeling overly tired and having trouble just making it through every day puts added stress on your entire body, including your immune system.Get any medical screenings that are recommended for your age group. Recognizing problems as early as possible strengthens your body’s ability to help fight off unwanted diseases.While there are no screening tests for viral infections like the common cold, routine screenings for other diseases helps to keep your immune system strong to fight off all the germs you are exposed to every day., Maintaining a balanced and healthy diet provides the tools your immune system needs to be as strong as possible.Include a balance of vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds, whole grains, healthy fats, and protein sources such as lean meats.Focus on the quality of the food you eat. Pay attention to the type of carbohydrates as opposed to focusing on the quantity of carbohydrates. For example, the carbohydrates found in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and beans, are healthier than others.Drink plenty of water and avoid consuming sugary beverages.Use healthy oils in food preparation, such as olive and canola oil.Create a healthy plate at every meal. A healthy plate contains mostly vegetables—the greener the better—fruits of all colors, whole grains such as whole grain breads or pastas, and protein sources like fish, poultry, beans, and nuts.Limit the amounts of refined grain products, red meats, and avoid bacon, cold cuts, and other processed meats., Vaccines are one way to boost your immune response to specific viruses and diseases.Participation in the recommended vaccinations provide short- and long-term benefits when you are exposed to those germs later on.Some vaccines contain very weakened parts of the actual microorganism that the vaccine is intended to protect you from. This type of immunization is called ""artificially acquired immunity.""Some vaccines last your whole lifetime, others require boosters, and some you need to get each year, like the flu vaccine. Follow your doctor's instructions on getting the immunizations you need., If you do not think you are getting enough nutrients from your diet, consider taking a multivitamin with minerals each day.Talk with your doctor before making any changes to your existing medication regimen, including adding or altering vitamin and mineral products.
Taking a multivitamin with minerals helps to ensure you are getting an adequate daily intake of vitamins as well as micronutrients in case your daily diet is not what it should be.
Taking large doses of any one vitamin or mineral is not recommended. Large doses of zinc especially are not recommended and can cause an upset stomach.There is evidence that consuming adequate amounts of the micronutrients helps to maintain the natural function of your immune system.These include selenium, zinc, iron, copper, folic acid, vitamins A, B6, E, and C., Selenium is a mineral that has antioxidant properties It is found in foods like Brazil nuts, liver, shellfish, tuna, beef, and chicken. It is being researched for its potential to help your natural immune system fight off the progression of different types of cancer.The research is not related to viral infections like the common cold, but the work is helping scientists to better understand possible ways to boost the immune response to different diseases.
Selenium helps the cells in your body with normal metabolism and has been identified as possibly having anti-inflammatory properties considered useful in fighting some diseases, such as some forms of arthritis.Most people get enough selenium from their diet. There is no need to take supplemental selenium unless your doctor feels you are deficient and recommends that you do so.
The recommended daily dose is about 55mcg., Taking vitamin A has proven helpful when there is an actual deficiency, but most people get enough vitamin A from diets that contain sweet potatoes, carrots, dark green and leafy vegetables, fish, and fruits.


There is no evidence to suggest taking vitamin A is beneficial in helping to fight infections in people that are not vitamin A deficient.Vitamin A plays a role in the treatment of some infections that involve mucosal membranes, which is one way common cold viruses enter the body.Vitamin A influences the production of certain types of T cells. T cells are an important part of how your body’s immune system works to fight infections., Both of these B vitamins have been identified as playing a role in fighting off infections.Natural sources of vitamin B2 include dark green and leafy vegetables, dairy products, and nuts. Natural sources of vitamin B6 include seafood and poultry.


Vitamin B2, also called riboflavin, has been shown to enhance the immune system in animal studies. Research in humans is ongoing.Vitamin B6, known as pyridoxine, causes the immune system to be suppressed in people that are deficient in this vitamin.Large doses of pyridoxine are not recommended. Supplements are only suggested in low to moderate doses and should be taken by people that are considered deficient.Excess amounts of vitamin B6, or pyridoxine, may actually help cancer tumors to grow.
Avoid taking large amounts of vitamin B6 unless your doctor advises you to do so., Obtain vitamin E naturally through a diet that includes dark, green, leafy vegetables and nuts.


Vitamin D has been shown effective in treating tuberculosis (doctors have long found exposure to sunlight helpful in treating TB), because it triggers an antimicrobial response to the disease. Scientists are researching whether or not the Vitamin D produced by sunlight has the same affect on other diseases like the common cold.Vitamin E has been shown to boost the body’s response to certain vaccines. More work is needed to clearly understand this finding.In people over the age of 65, higher than normal vitamin E doses were given following hepatitis B and tetanus vaccines. The vitamin E improved the performance of the vaccines.So far, the results are limited to those two vaccines only, and only in people over age 65. Work in this area is ongoing., It is important to have enough zinc in your diet, but too much zinc can actually interfere with the immune system.Taking zinc within the first 24 hours of developing cold symptoms may help to reduce the severity and the duration of a cold.Do not use intranasal zinc products. Research has linked the intranasal use of zinc to severe side effects, including the loss of the ability to smell.Taking zinc orally can cause gastrointestinal problems, including nausea.Taking zinc for long periods of time can cause some types of mineral deficiencies.Zinc can be obtained by consuming shellfish, lean beef, and liver.

, Herbal products and the claims they make are not regulated by the FDA. In addition, the companies are not required to show evidence that supports their claims.Having said that, there is some good preliminary evidence to support the possible benefit of some herbal products.Talk to your doctor before making any changes to your existing medication regimen. This includes adding or changing herbal products. Herbs are drugs that have side effects and have the potential for serious drug interactions.

, North American ginseng root has been rated by a division of the United States National Library of Medicine as being possibly effective in preventing colds.Taking 200mg twice a day during the cold and flu season may help to prevent catching colds or possibly even the flu.The study suggests this may be effective in adults ages 18 to 65. The researchers go on to report that it may not help to prevent the first cold of the season, but may help to prevent further colds., Some evidence suggests that garlic may have some ability to help fight infections.Laboratory work has shown garlic to be effective against bacteria, fungal, and viral infections like the flu and the common cold.
While this work is promising, human research is yet to show efficacy in controlled scientific studies., There is clear research that now supports the work done by “good” bacteria that lives in the gut in helping your immune system to function properly.Probiotics do support good bacteria, but the direct scientific link between taking probiotics and improving your immune system is still not established.Take care to choose probiotic products carefully as they are not regulated and they are not all the same., Products that contain herbs like aloe vera, echinacea, and licorice root, claim to help fight infections.Many of these agents can be harmful and scientific evidence to support their claims of efficacy specific to improving your immunity is lacking.This does not mean the claims are not true, but there is little evidence to support the claims.Echinacea has been written about many times, claiming to help with the prevention of colds. Echinacea may shorten the duration of your cold;however, researchers at Harvard suggest using echinacea with caution.In addition, echinacea can be dangerous. People with allergies to ragweed have suffered serious allergic reactions when taking echinacea, including some episodes of anaphylactic shock.There is little evidence that aloe vera does anything to alter the immune response. Topical application for various skin conditions has been shown to be helpful, but there is no evidence to support the use of aloe vera in preventing colds.Licorice root has been used in Chinese medicine for many years; however, it is usually combined with other herbs and ingredients. The specific claims of efficacy for licorice root have yet to be scientifically validated.Talk to your doctor before using licorice root since it can interact with many commonly used prescription medications. Do not use licorice root for an extended period of time., Follow good personal hygiene habits and use common sense to control your exposure to germs that can cause infections like the common cold.In addition to adopting healthy lifestyle habits and maintaining a healthy diet, avoiding contact with unwanted germs is the next most effective step in helping your immune system to keep you healthy., The best way to prevent catching a cold is to keep your hands clean and wash them frequently.Always wash your hands after using the bathroom, assisting a child to use the bathroom, and changing a diaper.Be sure your hands are clean before you begin food preparation. Wash your hands frequently as you prepare your meal., Keep surfaces as clean as possible, especially those used to prepare food.Keep door knobs, sink handles, mats used for napping by children, and bathroom surfaces clean.Disinfect surfaces using EPA-approved products. The websites for both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Environmental Protection Agency provide more information.The CDC and the EPA publish information on agents that are approved as disinfectants for commercial, hospital, and residential use.Examples of residentially approved products include two familiar brand names, Lysol® products and residential cleaners made by Clorox®, among many others., If you are around someone that is sick, be aware that their germs are likely on their hands.Pay attention to objects touched by the sick person and properly clean the objects as soon as possible to control the spread of germs.Do not hug, shake hands with, or kiss, someone with an infection., Avoid using fabric or cloth towels when several people need to dry their hands after washing.Using hand sanitizer is a good way to clean germs from your hands without the need for a towel., Exposing your child to other children at an early age is not necessarily a bad thing, as this helps to strengthen their immune system.To prevent some colds, the flu, and other infections, choosing classes with smaller numbers of children enrolled may help to limit your child’s exposure to an excessive amount of germs.Breastfeeding an infant is key in boosting the child’s natural immune system, even years later."

Call a doctor if the person is agitated, confused, or experiencing hallucinations.,
Get medical care if there is blood in their stool, urine, or mucus.,
Seek medical care if the person’s immune system is already weakened by another disease like cancer or AIDS.,
Discuss other serious conditions that could cause a fever with your doctor.,
Treat the fever at home if it is under 103 and you are over the age of 18.,
Treat the fever with rest and fluids if your child does not display any severe symptoms.",How to Check a Fever Without a Thermometer," The most common way to check for a fever without a thermometer is to feel the person's forehead or neck to see if it feels hotter than usual.Use the back of your hand, since the skin on your palm isn't as sensitive as these other areas.
Do not feel their hands or feet to check for a fever, as these can feel cold when a person’s body temperature is in fact high.
Keep in mind this is the first step to figuring out if something might be wrong, but it can't accurately tell you if someone has a dangerously high fever. Sometimes a person's skin can feel cool and clammy when they have a high fever, and sometimes their skin might feel very hot even though they don't have a fever.
Make sure to check the person's skin temperature in a room that isn't too hot or cold, and don't check right after the person has been sweating due to exercise.;
, A fever will usually cause the skin on the person’s cheeks and face to turn red. However, this may be more difficult to notice if the person has darker skin., A fever is often accompanied by lethargy or extreme fatigue, like moving or speaking slowly or a refusal to get out of bed.Children with fever may complain of feeling weak or tired, refuse to go out and play or have a loss of appetite.

, Body aches in the muscles and joints also often happen at the same time as a fever.


Headaches are also commonly experienced by people along with fever.

, When a person has a fever, it's easy for him or her to become dehydrated. Ask the person if they are very thirsty or if their mouth feels dry.


If the person has urine that is bright yellow, this could be an indication that he or she is dehydrated and may have a fever. Darker color urine than normal is also an indication of more serious dehydration.

, Nausea is a key symptom of a fever and other maladies like the flu. Pay close attention if the person feels nauseated or is vomiting, and can't keep food down.

, As the person’s body temperature goes up and down, it’s common for the person to shiver and feel cold, even when everyone else in the room feels comfortable.The person may also alternate between feeling hot and cold as the result of a fever. As your temperature goes up and down it is common to shiver and feel very cold even when those around you are feeling comfortable.

, A febrile convulsion is a kind of shaking fit that happens either just before or while a child has a high temperature. If a fever is over 103, it may also cause hallucinations.About 1 in 20 children under 5 years old will have a febrile convulsion at some point. Although it can be upsetting to watch your child experience a febrile convulsion, it does not cause permanent damage to your child. To treat a febrile convulsion:Place your child on their side in a clear space or area on the floor.
Do not try to hold your child during the fit and do not try to put anything in your child’s mouth during the fit, as they will not swallow their tongue.
Stay with your child under the convulsion stops after 1-2 minutes.
Lay your child on their side in a recovery position while they recover.

, This may be a sign of a more serious condition. Call 911 for an ambulance and stay with your child, keeping them on their side in the recovery position.You should also get immediate medical attention if the febrile convulsions are accompanied by:Vomiting
A stiff neck
Breathing problems
Extreme sleepiness

, If your child is between 6 to 24 months old and their fever is 102 or above, then call your child’s doctor. If your child is 3 months old or younger and has a fever above 100.4, then you should call the doctor.Give the child lots of fluids and encourage them to try to rest., These could all be symptoms of Meningitis, a life threatening and highly contagious disease., These could all be signs of a virus or a bacterial infection like pneumonia., These are also signs of a more serious infection., The fever could be a sign their immune system is under attack or experiencing other complications or conditions., Fevers are caused by a variety of different maladies.Ask your doctor if the fever might be an indication of the following illnesses:


A virus
A bacterial infection
Heat exhaustion or sunburn
Arthritis
A tumor that's malignant
Certain antibiotics and blood pressure drugs
Immunizations like the diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis vaccines

, The fever is your body way of trying to heal or recover and most fevers go away on their own after a few days.


A fever can be brought down by the right kind of treatment.
Drink plenty of fluids and rest. Taking medication is not necessary, but it may increase your comfort level. Use an over-the-counter fever reducer like aspirin or ibuprofen.Call your doctor if your symptoms last more than 3 days and/or more severe symptoms develop.

, Children and teens should not take aspirin as it is linked to a condition called Reyes’ disease.As well, if your child has a temperature under 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.9 degrees Celsius), they can likely be treated at home.
Visit the doctor if the fever persists over 3 days and/or more severe symptoms develop.

Get the flu shot every year.,
Wash your hands frequently.,
Use hand sanitizer if you can’t wash your hands.,
Don’t touch your face.,
Cover your coughs and sneezes.",How to Avoid Getting the Flu in Winter1," Every person over the age of 6 months should get a flu shot every year, usually in the early fall before flu season begins.There are a few different flu shots available, so ask your doctor or pharmacist which vaccine is right for you. Get your flu shot at a doctor’s office, clinic, pharmacy, college health center, or even in some schools and workplaces.


Last year’s shot won’t protect you from this year’s flu - get a shot every year.
Talk to your doctor before getting the shot if you’re allergic to eggs, have ever had Guillain-Barré Syndrome, or are not feeling well the day you are supposed to get the shot.;
, Wash your hands any time you cough, sneeze, or blow your nose, after using the restroom, before eating or preparing food, after caring for someone who is sick, after changing a diaper, and after touching garbage. Use proper hand washing technique:Wet your hands with clean, running water (hot or cold). Turn off the water tap, then apply soap to your hands.
Rub your hands together to lather up the soap. Lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers, up to your elbows, and underneath your fingernails. Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds, then rinse the soap off under clean, running water.
Dry your hands using a clean towel or an air dryer.

, If you don’t have access to soap or clean, running water, use hand sanitizer at times when you would otherwise wash your hands. Your hand sanitizer should be made of at least 60% alcohol. Place some sanitizer in the palm of your hand and rub your hands together, rubbing the product over your whole hands and fingers until your hands feel dry.Hand sanitizers are not as good at removing germs as washing your hands. Wash your hands whenever you have the option.
Hand sanitizers don’t work well if your hands are greasy or visibly dirty.
Keep hand sanitizer out of reach of children – do not let children swallow it.

, Avoid touching your face, eyes, mouth, or nose unless you wash your hands first. Illness is spread easily this way. Carry a small bottle of hand sanitizer in your purse, briefcase, or backpack to use first if you need to touch your face.

, Sneeze and cough into a tissue, then throw the tissue away. This is cleaner than sneezing into your hands, and can help prevent the spread of flu.If you don’t have a tissue with you, sneeze or cough into the crook of your elbow.

Try rinsing with a Neti Pot.,
Try grapefruit seed extract supplements.,
Eat spicy foods.,
Use an air humidifier.,
Try nasal strips.,
Stay hydrated.,
Avoid airborne nasal irritants.,
See if your pet is the culprit.",How to Solve Your Sinus Problems1," Warm saline water rinsed through your sinus cavity is known as “nasal irrigation” and can help dissolve mucus and ease nasal congestion.Be sure to use clean saline water each time you Use a Neti Pot, and disinfect it thoroughly after each use., If you think your sinus problems might be the result of a sinus infection, then you might benefit from taking grapefruit seed extract supplements. There is no scientific evidence that this method works, but some believe grapefruit seed extract has powerful antibiotic properties, and its high vitamin C content may help fight infection.Sinus infections need to be diagnosed by a doctor. Classic symptoms include a thick/white discharge, nasal congestion, tooth discomfort, and facial pain or pressure that is made worse when the person leans forward or someone taps on his sinuses.Be aware that both viruses and bacteria can cause sinusitis. Bacterial infections need to be treated with antibiotics and viruses do not respond to treatment. There is no good way to differentiate between the two, so try waiting a few days to see if the infection improves on its own or with home remedies. If not, see a doctor for treatment.

, As anyone who eats spicy foods knows, enough spice can cause a runny nose. If you’re experiencing congestion, try eating spicy foods to loosen and thin out the mucus in your sinuses. Cayenne pepper and horseradish are good options., Dry air causes nosebleeds and sinus pain and pressure. Invest in a humidifier for your home. For best results, you need to sit or sleep near your humidifier. Don’t keep it across the room, where it won’t do you any good.Avoid making your home too humid, which can promote the growth of mold and dust mites, both of which are bad for people with nasal allergies. Less than 50% humidity is ideal., Nasal strips are sticky cloth strips that go over the bridge of the nose and physically hold nasal passages open to relieve stuffy noses. These are available in any drugstore or convenience store. They typically come in different sizes, so choose the size that best fits your nose.

, Drinking water helps lubricate mucous membranes and inhaling steam helps hydrate dry nasal passages and relieve congestion. Try inhaling the steam from a hot shower or from a pot of hot water.Be careful to avoid burning yourself with the steam. If you opt to use a pot of hot water, drape a towel over your head to trap the steam. This enables you to get the benefit of the steam while keeping your face far enough away from the heat source to avoid a steam burn., Dust, pet dander, pollen, mold, and ragweed are all potential allergens. Other nasal irritants are cigarette smoke and strong perfumes or colognes. Avoid smoking and strong perfumes, and be sure to dust your home frequently to minimize indoor allergens., Do you tend to get congested or have a sneezing fit when you cuddle or play with your dog or cat? If you think you might be allergic to your pet, avoid letting him or her sleep with you at night and give frequent baths to reduce the build-up of pet dander.Frequently vacuuming your carpets or sweeping and mopping hard floors will also help minimize the indoor allergens from your pet's fur."

Avoid people who are sick.,
Take precautions around sick family members.,
Clean your home and workspace regularly.,
Sanitize your phone.,
Change your hand towels often.",How to Avoid Getting the Flu in Winter2," If possible, avoid being around someone who has the flu. Stay away from sick friends or neighbors until they’re well. Stay out of crowds during the peak of flu season, in possible – being in public transportation, auditoriums, and places where people congregate make it easy for flu to spread.Stay home from work or school if you’re sick so you don’t contaminate others. You can return to school or work 24 hours after your fever returns to normal, but continue to practice good hand washing hygiene.

, If someone in your household is sick, consider sleeping in a different room from them if you usually share a bedroom. Be sure to wash your hands after you interact with them, and clean any cups, cutlery, or dishes they use thoroughly.


People can still be contagious for up to a week after they’re feeling better., Use disinfecting sprays or wipes to clean surfaces that can harbor flu germs.Clean your bathrooms, bedroom surfaces, wood and glass tables, office desks, and other areas that you use or touch often. Keep a container of disinfecting wipes at your office, and wipe down your desk, phone, and keyboard every morning before you start work.

, Phones harbor many germs because you use them so often and they sit around in lots of places, exposed to viruses. Use a disinfecting wipe or slightly soapy rag to carefully clean your phone every other day during flu season.


Of course, do not submerge your phone in water.

, Because you will be washing your hands more frequently, you will need to change your communal towels more often so that they do not remain damp and become a vector for disease. Replace the towel every couple days or if it is damp when you go to reuse it. Keep hand towels separate so that each family member has their own towel.

Sleep 7-9 hours a night.,
Eat a nutritious diet.,
Drink enough water.,
Stay active.,
Decrease your stress level.",How to Avoid Getting the Flu in Winter3," Getting adequate rest helps your immune system perform at its best.Aim to get 7-9 hours of sleep every night. Try techniques to improve your sleep habits:


Set a regular bedtime and wake up time.
Exercise regularly (but not within 3 hours of bedtime so it doesn’t keep you up).
Avoid caffeine after 4pm.
Avoid napping during the day.
Relax before bed with a warm bath or reading.
Save your bedroom for sleeping – don’t watch TV in bed. Sleep in a cool, dark room.

, Eating a nutritious and varied diet helps your immune system work. Think about eating a “colorful” diet – one high in fresh fruits and vegetables of many different colors. This can help you get lots of vitamins and nutrients to keep your body healthy., Stay hydrated to maintain your overall health and avoid getting sick.In general, men should drink around 13 cups of water and other fluids daily (about 3 liters), and women should aim for 9 cups (2.2 liters).Drink more if you sweat a lot. Water, juice, and tea count towards your fluids.

, Aerobic workouts are those that increase your heart rate and breathing rate. Walking, slow jogging, biking, and swimming are good options. Aim to get at least 30 minutes of aerobic activity at least 5 days per week for optimal health. This won't stop the flu, but it can keep you healthy and make recovery easier.You may have to get creative to exercise during the winter. Get a gym membership, go dancing, use workout videos at home, find an indoor pool – do what you can to stay active in the winter.

, The stress hormone cortisol negatively affects numerous body systems – including your immune system.Try yoga, meditation, deep breathing, taking a walk – anything that helps you relax. If you have a stressful lifestyle due to work or family, practice mindfulness meditation or learn stress management skills. While it won't stop

Apply salve under your nose.",How to Cure a Cold Without over the Counter Medicine1," It's important to drink water during a cold since it can liquefy sticky mucous in your airway, making it easier to expel and helping with decongestion. You should try to drink at least 8-10 glasses of water each day.


If drinking water bores you, you can add lemon to the water to make it more interesting. Not only does it improve the taste, but lemon contains lots of vitamin C which supports a stronger immune system.;
, Freshly made chicken soup is very effective in clearing your airways. It helps by sending steam to your lungs that can dissolve and liquefy secretions. Chicken soup is a delicious way of managing your cold., Rest is the most effective way to naturally recover from a cold, as the body’s ability to repair damaged cells and restore immunity is increased during sleep.


Rest is very important within the first 72 hours of illness. This is the crucial time frame within which your body needs rest to support faster recuperation.
It is recommended that you sleep for 8-10 hours per night when recovering from a cold.

, Sometimes, colds develop as a result of too much stress, which weakens the immune system. Therefore, it's a good idea to take a couple of days off work when you come down with a cold to rest and de-stress.


Once you're back at work, it is important to set aside at least one day a week where you rest and don't worry about work. This will give your body time to reset and get ready for the week ahead.

, If you are suffering from an itchy or sore throat, gargling with warm salt water can help you to feel better.


Salt attracts water, so as you gargle the saline solution it draws excess fluid from the inflamed tissue of the throat. Salt can also attract irritants and toxins and drains them from your throat.
Take ½ teaspoon of salt and dissolve it in an 8-ounce glass of warm water. Stir until the salt is completely dissolved. Gargle at least three times a day or as needed.

, If you are a smoker, it's a good idea to quit or at least take a break for a while. Not only does smoking cause a myriad of negative health effects, it can also prolong and aggravate your cold symptoms.


The smoke from cigarette contains at least 4000 toxins, which irritate the respiratory tract and cause breathing difficulties.
Quitting can be very difficult - it requires a strong sense of willpower and a good support network. For more information on how to quit smoking, see this article.

, As much as possible, blow your nose rather than sniffling mucus back into your airways. This will help to clear your head and allow you to feel less stuffed up.


However, it's important that you blow your nose properly. When done the wrong way, you can send some of the secretions and germs into your ear, potentially causing earaches or decreased hearings.
The best way to blow your nose is to press a finger over one nostril then blow gently until one nostril is clear. Do not force it or blow your nose too hard just to drain mucus out of your airway, as cause your nasal passages to become even more inflamed.

, There’s a reason they call it a “cold”. Your body is more effective in battling viral infections in a warm environment. This explains why you sometimes have fever when you are sick, as your body increases its temperature in order to kill pathogens.


You can stay warm by increasing the temperature of your room. You can also stay near a fireplace, put on an extra coat, and avoid getting wet.
Try having a steamy bath. The steam will moisturize your airway and liquefy mucus. It will also add warmth to your chest and back that can dissolve secretions in the lungs.

, Get a mentholated salve and apply it under your nose. This can open up your nasal passages and deliver instant relief from breathing difficulties due to phlegm and mucus.


Look for salve that has menthol, camphor, or eucalyptus as its main ingredient. The menthol effect of this salve will help you to relax and breathe easier.

Talk to your general practitioner.,
Have a visual inspection of your nasal cavity.,
Take an allergy skin prick test.,
Have an allergy blood test.,
Undergo a CT Scan.",How to Solve Your Sinus Problems2," Tell your doctor what is bothering you in detail. Have you always had sinus issues or is this a new problem for you? Do you find that you feel better or worse at a certain time of the day? How are you currently finding relief? Be specific about your symptoms because the more details you provide your doctor, the better equipped they will be to help your particular condition.


Other questions your doctor may ask: Do you have drainage? If so, how much and how frequent? What is the color and consistency? Do you feel facial pain or fullness? Reduction or loss of smell?
If any of the following are present, you may have a condition more serious conditions than sinus congestion that needs immediate treatment: high fever, double or reduced vision, swelling around the eyes, pain when moving eyes, severe headache, stiff neck that is painful to move, or significant or recurrent nosebleeds.

, Before your doctor suggests medications or other procedures, they will likely perform a visual test. Looking into your nasal passages with a lighted scope will let your doctor see any irritation or surface level problems with your nasal passages.


If necessary, your doctor may refer you to an ENT (ear, nose, and throat) doctor.

, If your doctor recommends this test, they will prick your skin with small needles containing various allergens. If you show an allergic reaction to any of the prick points, then that will let your doctor know that you are sensitive to that particular allergen. This is helpful because it will let you know that you need to avoid pollen, for example, while you might be able to tolerate other kinds of potential allergens., For an allergy blood test, the idea is similar to that of a skin prick test. If your doctor recommends this test, know that the key difference is that rather than pricking your skin, your doctor will draw vials of blood to test for allergen sensitivities. This test is less accurate than skin prick tests, but it is still useful and widely used.


Allergy blood tests are often used in children and others who might have complications or problems with the skin prick test., To get a clear image of what might be wrong with your sinuses, your doctor might recommend a CT scan. These scans generate an image of your sinuses, so your doctor can see if your issues are being caused by a physical problem like a deviated septum. If your doctor sees no physical problem, then they can rule out physical causes of your sinus problems.

"
Try eliminating dietary irritants.,
Try condition-specific over-the-counter medicines.,
Try prescription medicines.,
See a specialist.,
Consider surgery as a final option.",How to Solve Your Sinus Problems3," An allergy test may reveal that you are allergic to certain foods, which you should then eliminate from your diet. Alcohol is also an irritant and can cause inflammation leading to a stuffy nose. It is a commonly held belief that dairy increases mucus production — but this is not true. It can, however, thicken mucus, making it more difficult to expel.

, If home remedies don’t work for your condition, you can try using OTC sinus medicine to treat your particular condition. Be sure that the medicine you choose is designed for your sinus problem.


For example, if you have seasonal allergies, you might try an antihistamine medicine. For a cold your best choice would be decongestant medicine., If neither over-the-counter medicines nor home remedies have worked well for you, you can ask your doctor about prescription options. Your doctor might recommend a prescription nasal spray or a stronger antihistamine for severe congestion due to allergies., If you talked to your general practitioner and you still aren’t getting the relief you would like from your sinus problems, make an appointment with an ENT (ear, nose, and throat) specialist. ENT doctors specialize in sinus issues and can recommend more advanced procedures and tests to try.

, If you have a serious problem with your breathing, then your doctor might recommend surgery. Procedures to correct physical problems like a deviated septum or narrow nasal passages can provide relief when no other techniques have worked.


Although these procedures are not extremely invasive, they are still major surgical procedures, so ask your doctor about the risks and recovery time for your procedure.

, Anything high in sugar is a big no when it comes to managing your cold. Sugar, especially the refined and artificial kind, can really aggravate symptoms. Avoid ice cream, carbonated drinks, soft drinks, chocolate, and other high-sugar foods.

, Alcohol can dehydrate your body by getting rid of water. It can also weaken your immune system by penetrating cells and affecting its function. Therefore, it's best to steer clear of alcoholic beverages when recovering from a cold.

, This type of fat promotes inflammation in the body. With increased inflammation, your immune system will have a hard time dealing with a cold. Saturated fats can be found in foods with preservatives, junk foods, deep fried foods, pork meat, and others.

Avoid or take precautions in the endemic region.,
Take care around West African residents and travelers.,
Steer clear of multimammate rats.,
Support good “community hygiene” in areas where the virus may be present.,
Avoid contact with the secretions or excretions of the possibly infected.,
Ensure proper healthcare procedures.,
Get the facts.,
Recognize the symptoms.,
Know the treatments.",How to Avoid Lassa Fever," Other than relatively limited cases of travelers carrying the illness with them, Lassa fever is almost entirely contained within a section of western Africa centered on Ghana and stretching from Guinea to Nigeria (see the map at http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/lassa/outbreaks/index.html). If you do not spend time in this region, or come into contact with secretions or excretions of an infected person, your current risk of contracting Lassa fever is extremely low.Remember that Lassa fever is a contagious viral infection, though, and that it could spread beyond its current footprint at any time. So don’t panic, but practice reasonable caution.
If you are in the endemic zone, pay attention to any warnings posted by governmental or health organizations, steer clear of unsanitary conditions and infected persons, and utilize the other precautions discussed in more detail in this article.;
, People are not considered contagious if they don’t present symptoms, and simple skin-to-skin contact will not transmit Lassa fever, so there is no reason to completely avoid people who have recently been in the endemic region. You may want to avoid unnecessary contact with the bodily fluids of such persons, however, especially if they present any possible signs of illness.If a person who has recently been in the endemic region presents with flu-like symptoms or signs of a gastrointestinal illness, it would be prudent to avoid contact and have that person seek a medical evaluation.

, The rodent mastomys, more commonly known as the multimammate rat, is Lassa fever’s “animal vector” — the primary transmitter to humans. They are found in large numbers throughout the endemic region and, like any rat, they thrive in locations where there is accessible human food or trash. The rats are carriers of Lassa fever, but not symptomatic.The virus is usually transmitted through contamination of food or surfaces by rat urine or droppings. Eating the rodent, which is not unheard of, may also transmit the virus.
Steering clear of rats and rat excrement is good practice at all times, but you should take particular care within the endemic region. Avoid areas where there is accessible food or trash, because there is a good chance the rats are there, even if you don’t see them.

, The rats that carry Lassa fever are, like their rodent cousins everywhere, too numerous and crafty to be eradicated. The best alternative is to create inhospitable conditions for them, for instance by storing food securely, keeping trash secured and away from living areas, cleaning household floors and surfaces regularly, and possibly by keeping cats around.Keeping your own area clean will do little good if your neighbor’s place is a rodent hotel, however. Organizations that are battling Lassa fever regularly promote “community hygiene” programs in an effort to make entire areas less hospitable to rodents.

, Casual contact with a person infected with Lassa fever carries no determinable risk of transmission, but avoiding contact with her bodily fluids is essential. Use extreme caution if you are in contact with people who may have Lassa fever, and never try to care for them yourself.In one of the rare cases of Lassa fever in the U.S., a traveler who returned from western Africa died in New Jersey in May 2015. As part of the precautions taken, anyone who had been in close proximity to the victim was monitored for 21 days.

, When a person who may have Lassa fever seeks medical attention, proper transmission prevention measures must be taken. The patient needs to be kept in isolation, and anyone in contact with him must use barrier protections like masks, gloves, gowns, and goggles. Proper sterilization of surfaces and equipment is likewise required.The person who died of Lassa fever in New Jersey in 2015 failed to respond accurately about recently traveling to the endemic zone, and as a result was sent home from the hospital initially. This probably contributed the patient’s death and put others at unnecessary risk. Never withhold information that may indicate you have Lassa fever; you are not doing yourself or others any favors.

, Lassa fever is named for the town in Ghana near where it was first identified as a unique viral illness in 1969. It is spread by contact with infected rats or objects contaminated by them, or person-to-person through transfer of secretions or excretions. There are typically 100,000 to 300,000 identified cases of Lassa fever annually in the endemic zone of western Africa.While often compared to the Ebola virus because of overlaps in outbreak zones, Lassa fever is less readily communicable and has a far smaller fatality rate (about one percent of infected persons, compared to 70% for Ebola). That still counts for some five thousand deaths per year, and Lassa fever should by no means be underestimated.

, Some 80% of Lassa fever cases are mild, and may present few symptoms. Milder cases can present like the flu or a gastrointestinal problem — fever, malaise, weakness, headaches, nausea, diarrhea, etc. More serious cases can present with hemorrhaging of the eyes, nose, gums, etc.; respiratory distress; repeated vomiting; facial swelling; severe pain in the chest, back, or abdomen; or neurological problems like hearing loss, tremors, or encephalitis.The incubation period is typically six to 21 days, and the illness usually lasts for one to four weeks. In fatal cases, the cause of death is usually multi-organ failure.
Deafness occurs in about 25% of all cases, regardless of severity otherwise. Of these instances, the hearing loss reverses itself about half of the time, usually in one to three months.

, There is no current vaccine to prevent Lassa fever, although work is underway. There is also no cure, although early treatment with the antiviral drug ribavirin often proves effective. Otherwise, treatment involves addressing symptoms and providing fluids and oxygen.Isolation of infected patients during treatment is always advised. Barrier protections and other infection-control procedures are necessary.
The fact sheet provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offers a handy summary of Lassa fever. It is available at http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/lassa/pdf/factsheet.pdf.

Flush your nose with saline solution.,
Try an over-the-counter nasal spray.,
Avoid substances and behaviors that could make the nasal tear worse.",How to Treat a Nasal Tear1," Due to the nasal tear, your nose may be very dry. There may also be a crust that forms around the hole in your septum, leading to nosebleeds and increased dryness. You can keep your nose moist by using a saline solution to flush out your nose. You can do this with a neti pot or with a saltwater nasal spray.Keep in mind flushing your nose with saline solution will only offer temporary relief for dryness, nosebleeds, and nasal congestion. To really address the issue, you will likely have to see your doctor.;
, You can also try using OTC nasal spray to help keep your nose moist and clean. Look for a saltwater (saline) nasal spray or nasal spray for dryness and irritation. Follow the dosage instructions on the package to ensure you use the nasal spray correctly.Try to avoid nasal sprays with the preservative benzalkonium chloride (BKC), which can be damaging to protective cells in the nose.Overuse of decongestant and steroid nasal sprays can cause nasal tears, so you should avoid these. If you are already using a lot of nasal spray and your nasal issues are not getting better, you should see your doctor for a diagnosis.

, Stop using any substances, such as recreational drugs, that could make the nasal tear more severe. You should also stop picking your nose, especially if it is a chronic habit, as it can make the nasal tear worse.If you work with industrial chemicals, you may want to consider cutting back on the amount of time you spend in this environment, as exposure to industrial chemicals can lead to nasal issues, including nasal tears.

Stay hydrated.,
Use a Neti pot.,
Use steam.",How to Sleep with a Stuffy Nose1," To help relieve nasal stuffiness, you need to let the sinuses drain as much as possible. This is easier with thin mucus, which makes it easier to blow the mucus out and then easier to breath. To help thin the mucus, drink as much water as possible. During the day, drink at least nine to 13 8-ounce glasses of fluids., A Neti pot is used to help rinse mucus from your nose. To help you sleep, do this about one hour before bedtime.To use a Neti pot, fill it with a store-bought saline (salt) solution. Then, bend forward over a sink, turning your head to one side and putting the tip of the pot right against your nostril. Slowly pour the solution through the top nostril as you breathe through your mouth and wait for the solution to come through your lower nostril. It should take a few seconds. Repeat on the other side by turning your head to the opposite side.


After you are done, gently blow your nose to clear out all the solution and mucus.
You can make your own saline solution using either distilled or boiled water (never use tap water that hasn't been boiled for at least a minute). In a separate bowl, add one cup of very warm distilled water. Do not use water that is too hot because it can damage the delicate nasal tissues. Add 1/2 teaspoon of finely ground unprocessed sea salt or table salt to the water.Stir in the salt to make it dissolve.

, Using steam can help clear your sinuses before you go to sleep and can also help treat the underlying inflammation or infection. Steam can also help open up the nasal passages and help thin out the sometimes thick mucus and allow the mucus to drain out of the sinuses.


Fill a 1-quart pot with water and boil for a minute or two. Remove the pot from the heat.
Cover your head with a large, clean cotton towel and place your head over the steaming pot, keeping your face at least 12 inches away from the water. Close your eyes. Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth for five counts and then in and out through your mouth for two counts.
Repeat for 10 minutes or as long as the water is still steaming.
Try to blow your nose during and after the treatment. You can do this every two hours or as often as your schedule permits.Add an essential oil to the water for an added bonus to the steam. Add one to two drops of any of the following essential oils: spearmint, peppermint, thyme, oregano, lavender, tea tree, or sage.
If you don’t have the essential oils, substitute ½ teaspoon of dried herb per quart of water. Once you add the herbs, boil for another minute, turn off the heat and move the pot to a comfortable area and begin steaming."

Discuss your symptoms with your doctor.,
Allow the doctor to do a physical exam of your nose.,
Let your doctor run tests.",How to Treat a Nasal Tear2," If your symptoms do not improve with home care, you should go see your doctor for a diagnosis. You may want to see an otolaryngologist (commonly known as an ENT physician) who specializes in diseases and disorders of the ears, nose, throat, and related areas of the head and neck.Start by describing your symptoms to your doctor so they can get a sense of your condition. You may experience nosebleeds, difficulty breathing, or nasal whistling, where a whistling sound happens when you try to breath in and out of your nose. Be forthcoming about your symptoms so your doctor can make a proper diagnosis.For example, your doctor may ask you, “When did you first notice issues with your nose?” “What kind of symptoms are you experiencing?” “How long have you had these symptoms?” “What do you think is the cause of these symptoms?”

, Your doctor will then examine your nose externally and internally. They will be looking for a hole in your nasal septum, any tissue buildup on a wound in your nose, or any crusting inside your nose.The doctor may need to do an rhinoscopy or a nasal endoscopy to determine the location of the hole in your nose. This requires the insertion of a very small camera and light into your nose.
The physical exam can be done in the doctor’s office. You will need to remain still and calm during the physical exam so the doctor can do a thorough check.

, The doctor may also run tests on your urine and run a blood test to determine if there are any diseases or conditions that are causing your nasal tear. They may also do a biopsy of septal tissue in your nose to test for any fungal or bacterial infections.If the doctor suspects drug use, they will screen you for certain drugs to determine if this may be the cause of the nasal tear.

"

Ask your doctor about a nasal plug.,
Talk to your doctor about a septoplasty.,
Discuss the recovery process for a septoplasty with your doctor.",How to Treat a Nasal Tear3," If you want to avoid having surgery on your nose, your doctor can try plugging your nasal tear with a special button made of soft plastic. The nasal button can help to reduce crusting and nosebleeds. It can also help to stop the whistling sound you may make when you breath through your nose due to the nasal tear.Speak to your doctor about this option as well as any side effects of the procedure before you go through with it.

, A septoplasty is a surgical procedure that will help to close the hole in your septum. During this procedure, the doctor will take tissue from another part of your body, such as inside your nose, and sew it into the hole. They can also use the tissue to create a flap that will cover the hole in your septum.You will be under general anesthesia during the procedure. The doctor may also use a local anesthetic to numb your nose during the procedure.

, If you do opt for a septoplasty to correct your nasal tear, make sure you are aware of the recovery process before the surgery. You will need to keep gauze in your nose for 48 hours after the surgery. You will likely experience pain and bleeding from your nose. The doctor will give you pain medication to manage your symptoms as you recover.During your recovery, you will need to avoid decongestant nasal sprays, smoking, and medication that contains caffeine.
If the hole is very large in your septum, there is a risk it may open up again, even after the surgery. You may then require another surgery to repair the hole again.
After surgery, there will be swelling which may make it difficult to breathe through your nose.
Avoid forceful nose blowing or insertion of any objects (including fingers) into the nose.

Choose an essential oil.,
Add essential oils to the Neti pot.,
Use a diffuser.,
Make a chest rub.,
Bathe in the essential oils.",How to Sleep with a Stuffy Nose2," Many essential oils are thought to have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties and may help treat sinus infection and reduce swelling. If you reduce the swelling in your nose, you will be able to breath easier at night, which will help you sleep better with a stuffy nose. You can mix and match the oils to find the best blend for you but make sure you are not allergic to the oil by testing it on your skin first. Also, keep in mind that some essential oils are toxic if misused.Choose an aroma you like, making sure any essential oil you buy comes from a reputable company with some guarantee of purity. Use equal numbers of drops of each oil when combining. Some essential oils used commonly for stuffy noses are:Eucalyptus
Peppermint
Lavender
Tea tree
Clove
Chamomile
Menthol

, To amp up your Neti pot solutions, you may want to use essential oils. Make sure the oil you use is pure grade and that you aren't allergic or have an adverse reaction to it. Mix in one drop each of frankincense, rosemary and eucalyptus oil to the Neti pot solution., Choose an oil from the list that is thought to aid stuffy noses. Add three to five drops of essential oils to the water in the diffuser. About an hour before you try to sleep, sit as close as possible to the diffuser.


The humid air and the essential oil with help relieve the stuffiness in your nose, which will help you sleep.If the issue persists, try sniffing the air from the diffuser as often as you can throughout the day to help your sinuses more.

, You can make your own chest rub with essential oils that helps with stuffy noses. Mix three drops of eucalyptus oil, two drops of peppermint oil, and two drops of thyme oil in a tablespoon of carrier oil, such as almond oil.You can also replace any of those oils with additional oils from the list that help stuffy noses.
The rub will open up your sinuses, which will help you sleep better.

, Add about 12 to 15 drops of your essential oils into a full bath. The bath should be warm and comfortable. Soak for about 20 minutes and breathe in the oils to help clear your sinuses.

Add ½ teaspoon of baking soda. The baking soda will help lessen the sting of a very sore nose.
Pour into a spray bottle. Spray one or two squirts into each nostril as needed. Repeat this only four to five times a day., One common cause of stuffy nose is allergies. If these are causing you to have a stuffy nose, especially at bedtime, try taking an antihistamine before bed. It may also have the added bonus of causing you to get sleepy, which will also help you sleep better even if your nose is still stuffy.


Many antihistamines cause drowsiness.Look for a non-drowsy antihistamine if you need to take it during the day. Do not drive or operate heavy machinery until you know how the antihistamine affects you.

, If your stuffy nose is caused by allergies, you may want to to try a nasal steroid spray to reduce inflammation. When you use these sprays you will experience quick relief, but you'll need to use the spray continuously to get the full benefit.Most nasal steroid sprays need a prescription, but there are current two available over-the-counter — Flonase and Nasacort.
If you have seasonal allergies, start using a nasal steroid spray at the beginning of the season to lessen your symptoms.When spraying the spray into your nostril, you'll want to point it toward the outer-wall of the nostril, not straight up or toward the inner-wall (septum).Side effects may include dryness or stinging, sneezing, and throat irritation. If you experience a headache and nosebleeds, call your doctor right away., While you are sleeping, prop up your entire upper body. This can help drain your sinuses and keep them from getting stuffy. If you can, put some blocks under the head of the bed to raise the whole bed.


If you can't find any way to clear your sinuses, this will also help you sleep. Keeping your head up will ease sinus congestion to help you sleep., To cut down on stuffiness due to dry air, keep your bedroom humidified. To do this, use either a humidifier or keep a bowl of water near your head. The water will evaporate during the night and help keep your sinuses damp.

By warming and moistening the space, your sinuses won't have to produce as much moisture and your nose will not run., The air may be warm enough, but if it's too dry it may still trigger a runny nose. You can use individual room humidifiers or have a whole-house humidifier installed.

, This runny nose remedy will keep your nasal passages moist and help prevent you from over-producing mucus., It is not recommended to use this on a regular basis, but it okay to use now and then if you have important things to do in the colder weather and you don't want your runny nose to get the best of you. For instance, if you are a competitive skier, you may want to use a nasal spray before your race.What it does is prevent fluid build-up for a little while, allowing you to complete your activity (such as the race) without worrying about your nose running.However, it can sometimes cause more of a runny nose after the nasal spray wears off, so this is why it is not recommended to use on a daily basis.If Dristan or another over-the-counter nasal spray is insufficient, see your doctor about the option for a stronger prescription corticosteroid nasal spray., Something like Sudafed (or anything with ""pseudoephedrine"" in the ingredients list) should work well. You can speak to the pharmacist for advice if you would like help choosing one.Taking this type of medication will notably decrease the amount of mucus production in your nose, alleviating symptoms of runny nose from the cold.
However, once again it is important not to use this frequently, as it can worsen your runny nose when the medication wears off. Therefore, only use it if there is something important you want to do in the colder weather, and it is important to you not to have your nose run for that period of time.

, When your nose runs, it may be due to sickness (which will likely be accompanied by other symptoms of a ""cold,"" such as sore throat, cough, etc), being upset (when we cry, excess water from our tears drains through the nose), or cold weather (as our nasal passages are designed to heat the air before it reaches our lungs, and in order to do so your nose produces extra fluid in the cold weather).It may also be related to allergies, irritants in your environment (such as smoke), or a side effect of certain medications.

, When you breathe through your nose, your sinuses warm and moisten the air by swirling it around the mucous membranes that line the passages. This prevents you from irritating your lungs and throat with air that is cooler than your body temperature.Water is a by-product of this process and the excess runs down the back of your throat and out your nose.Your sinuses perform this function year round, but because of the temperature difference in cooler weather (especially in wintertime) it is more pronounced in the cold., Therefore, they are nothing to get overly worried about. They are so common, in fact, that sometimes it is called ""skier's nose"" due to the fact that nearly 100% of competitive snow sport athletes complain about runny nose!A runny nose from the cold is NOT related to an illness (and not related to the ""common cold."")Although many people believe there is a link between cold weather and ""catching a cold,"" this is thought to be due to spending more time indoors where people's germs are more readily passed to one another (and is not thought to be related so much to the cold outside)."

Get vaccinated against H1N1.,
Avoid H1N1 patients.,
Boost your immune system.,
Disinfect surfaces.,
Stay informed about H1N1.",How to Avoid H1N11," You are most likely to contract H1N1 during flu season. The CDC warns that every flu season is different and thus vaccinations are tailored for the season. Flu season is characterized between October-May (in the US). During that time, you should receive a flu vaccine, especially if you are 65 or older.


As of 2013, the H1N1 vaccine has been combined with the ""Influenza A"" vaccine. The influenza A category is made up of the most common strains of the flu.H1N1 vaccines usually stay in your system for about sic months, so vaccinate regularly.;
, Viruses spread through microorganisms that you can come in contact through your mucus membranes (eyes, nose, mouth). You are susceptible to picking up the H1N1 virus from already infected people.


Avoid sick people in public places like at work or on public transit. You can wear a face mask to help protect yourself and to keep yourself clean by frequent hand washing.

, Your immune system is your body’s defense mechanism. It fights off viral and antigen invaders and keeps you healthy. Therefore, it is important to keep your immune system happy and healthy to fight off viral infections such as H1N1. To boost your immune system, follow these tips.Exercise for at least 30–60 minutes per day.
Limit stress by taking yoga or by meditating.
Eat a well-balanced diet.This will make sure you are getting the essential nutrients to stay healthy.
Get adequate sleep. Most adults need between seven to nine hours of sleep each night. Sleep deprivation can not only affect your immune system but also predispose you to contracting H1N1., There are a number of commercial disinfectant products. You can use them to wipe down commonly touched surfaces such as keyboards, doorknobs, counter-tops, phones, writing utensils, etc. Look for disinfects that contain:


Alcohol — Look for Ethyl alcohol at high concentrates (70-80%) and Isopropyl alcohol (20% concentration).Chlorine and chlorine compounds — Search for chlorine compounds such as household bleach. For example, Chlorox wipes are available in individual wipes.

, Health organizations such as the CDC and WHO have information on their websites about H1N1 and seasonal flu strains. They often have information about how to protect yourself and your loved ones. They provide contact information, vaccine information, and pandemic and crisis support."

Wash your hands.,
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.,
Avoid sharing utensils or drinks.",How to Avoid H1N12," This simple activity is the best way to reduce the spread of H1N1 and germs in general. It is quick, simple, and very effective! Be sure to use soap and water. Follow this easy routine: wet, lather, scrub for 20 seconds, rinse, and dry. Wash your hands before and after activities that include the following:Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before eating.
Before and after caring for someone who is sick.
Before and after treating wounds/cuts.
After using the restroom.
After changing or cleaning children.
After blowing your nose or sneezing.
After touching your face.
After handling pets.
After touching garbage.

, Touching your face is an easy way to spread H1N1. Your eyes, nose, and mouth have mucus membranes and are susceptible to germs.If you do have to touch your face, be sure to wash your hands before and after doing so.

, Avoid sharing food and drinks with other people. It is easy to pass microorganisms through saliva. Do not share your glass with someone, and avoid sharing your plate of food."

Note the rapid onset of symptoms.,
Watch for fever.,
Listen for a cough.,
Recognize aches and pains.,
Feel for stomach distress.",How to Avoid H1N13," Onset symptoms occur within two to three hours with H1N1 virus. This is generally faster than other flu strains or viruses., You have a fever if your body temperature rises above its normal range of 98.6°F (37°C).It is important to note that not all people who get H1N1 get fevers. However, there are a number of symptoms of having a fever. Some of which may include the following:


Sweating.
Shivering.
Headache.
Muscle aches.
Loss of appetite.
Dehydration.
General weakness.

, A cough happens when something is irritating your throat or airway. Be wary if your cough persists or you cough up discolored or bloody mucus.If you have H1N1, your cough will be dry or non-productive. This means you should not be coughing up mucus or blood.If you do cough or sneeze, it is important that you limit the spread of germs. Cough (or sneeze) into the inside of your elbow to limit the spread of germs.
You may experience shortness of breath due to your cough.
Note that you will not experience a sore throat. While a sore throat is the most common symptom of a viral infection, patients with H1N1 generally do not report a sore throat., Pain or stiffness may be a symptom of H1N1 and is the most common symptom of H1N1. These pains may also be a sign of a fever. You might feel fatigue or aches in both your head and body.

, While common symptoms of illness on their own, nausea and diarrhea can be a sign of the flu. This is known as viral gastroenteritis and is your body’s way of trying to rid itself of irritants. If you have diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting, you may have the flu."
"
Treat your fever.,
Stay home from work or school.,
Rest.,
Recognize worsening symptoms.",How to Avoid H1N14," To treat a fever, put a cool, damp washcloth on your forehead. Wash your body with cool water; this will help lower your body temperature and make you feel better. You can also take 650 mg of acetaminophen every six to eight hours (not to exceed 3000 mg in 24 hours) or 400–600 mg of ibuprofen (not to exceed 3200 mg in 24 hours).If your child is under three years old and has a fever, you should take her to the doctor.
If your kidneys or liver are compromised, speak with your doctor before taking acetaminophen or ibuprofen.

, Since H1N1 is spread through microorganisms, you should avoid contact with other people for at least twenty-four hours after you start to notice symptoms.Cancel plans and stay home while you recover. Try and stay as isolated as possible in your home to avoid getting other members of your household ill.


If you do have to go out in public while you are sick, wear a face-mask or cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue or the inside of your elbow to avoid spreading germs.

, Your body is trying to fight off this illness. Strenuous activity can make you feel worse and prohibit healing. Rest as much as possible if you think you are getting the flu or even already show symptoms.

, Generally, you do not want to go to the emergency room if you have H1N1. Doctors are, often, unable to help H1N1 infections and you run the risk of infecting other people in the waiting room. However, if you or your child has any of the following symptoms, go to the doctor or the ER. Trouble breathing/fast breathing.
Blue skin color.
Not waking up or interacting.
Fever with rash.
Pain or pressure in chest/abdomen.
Sudden dizziness.
Confusion.
Severe or persistent vomiting.

Wash your hands frequently.,
Keep well hydrated.,
Keep your allergies under control.,
Avoid exposure to irritants.,
Don't give your child a bottle while lying down.,
Maintain a strong immune system.,
Reduce your stress levels.,
Flush with saline solution preventatively.",How to Prevent Sinus Infections," Most viral and bacterial infections are spread by touching someone who is infected and introducing the germs directly into your mouth, nose or eyes. Infectious microorganisms can live for hours in body secretions such as saliva and mucus. As such, be cautious touching people who are obviously ill during common cold season (sneezing, coughing, runny nose) and make sure to wash your hands frequently to reduce the risk of a sinus infection.


To wash your hands properly, first wet them with water, then apply soap and scrub for at least 20 seconds. Make sure you wash between your fingers, under your nails, and both the front and back of your hands. Then rinse and dry your hands on a clean towel.
Avoid touching your face when you're out in public, particularly your eyes, nose and mouth.
Always wash your hands before eating, especially if you eat with your hands (such as pizza or hot dogs).
Don't go overboard on the hand sanitizer, because it can promote the growth of antibacterial-immune microorganisms.;
, In order to function normally and be able to keep microorganisms at bay, the mucous membranes of your sinuses, nose and throat need to be moist. When they get too dry, they are much more susceptible to irritation, inflammation and infection.Therefore, keep yourself well hydrated by drinking at least eight 8-ounce glasses of purified water per day — it'll keep your mucous membranes moist and keep you hydrated.


Avoid colas and energy drinks — they can promote dehydration because caffeine is a diuretic (triggers more urination). Limit coffee and black tea intake.
During the winter months, your sinus membranes can become very dry due to the extreme aridity of your home. Adding moisture to the air via a humidifier may help prevent sinusitis.Make sure the air is a cold, not warm — warm humidified air can cause bacterial growth in the humidifier, making you feel worse.

, Another risk factor for coming down with a sinus infection is having allergies.Allergic reactions to pollen or other irritants can cause a stuffy and runny nose, which is not sinusitis, but it can trap viruses or bacteria in your nasal passages and increase the risk of infection. Thus, if you have allergies or hay fever, avoid exposing yourself to the triggers or keep them under control with medications — typically over-the-counter antihistamines / decongestants.


Be careful not to over-use antihistamines for your allergies because they can cause your mucus membranes to get too dry.Check with a physician before starting or stopping medication.
An allergic reaction and a sinus infection can cause similar symptoms (stuffy nose, difficulty breathing, watery eyes, sneezing), but sinusitis is invariably more painful, causes a mild fever and leads to greenish or gray mucus discharge from the nose.

, In addition to allergens, there are many chemical irritants that can trigger irritation and inflammation in your nasal passages, which makes them more susceptible to getting infected.As such, try to avoid common chemical irritants such as cigarette/cigar smoke, dust, bleach, most cleaning agents, environmental pollutants and asbestos particles. Wearing a mask when you know you will be exposed to these irritants may help, as it can be difficult to avoid them completely.


Cigarette smokers develop more respiratory infections (upper in the sinuses and lower in the lungs) than non-smokers.
Secondhand smoke, in particular, is a significant risk factor for sinus and lung infections in children.Never smoke around children, who are unable to understand the risks.
Pet fur and dander can aggravate allergies.
Remember to dust and vacuum your home regularly, so your nasal passages don't get irritated.

, Another major risk factor for sinus infections in young children (infants) is bottle feeding, especially while they lay on their backs.The milk or formula can easily get into the nose, nasal passages and sinuses, which not only increases the risk of choking, but it also provides nourishment to bacteria. Any bacterial in the infants' sinuses feed on the milk sugar and rapidly flourish, leading to an infection.


Always feed your baby/infant/child while he is sitting upright in order to prevent food from going places it shouldn't.
Although 90% of sinus infections in adults are caused by viruses (often the common cold), only about 60% are viral in infants and children.The other 40% are bacterial, which readily take advantage of feeding mishaps.

, For any type of infection, true prevention depends on a healthy and strong immune response. Your immune system consists of specialized cells that search for and attempt to destroy disease-causing microorganisms, but when it's weakened and malfunctioning, viruses and bacteria can proliferate in mucus membranes and lead to sinus infections much easier.As such, focus on ways to keep your immune system strong in order to naturally prevent sinus infections and other infectious diseases.



Getting more sleep (or better quality sleep) (at least 7.5 to nine hours), eating more fresh fruits and veggies, practicing good hygiene, keeping well-hydrated and getting regular exercise are all ways to boost immunity.Pay attention to dietary factors. Your immune function will also benefit by cutting down on refined sugars (soda pop, candy, pastries, cakes, cookies, ice cream, milk chocolate), cutting back on alcohol and quitting smoking.
Supplements that can boost your immune system include: vitamins C and D, zinc, selenium, echinacea, olive leaf extract and astragalus root.To go one better than supplements, get your vitamins from your diet in the form of oranges, papayas, grapefruit, and leafy greens.

, Being over-stressed is another major factor for getting sick, especially catching viral and bacterial infections. Moderate-to-severe stress, especially when it's constant (chronic), weakens your immune system significantly.As noted above, weakened immunity allows potentially pathogenic germs to take advantage and grow out of control, which can overwhelm tissues such as mucus membranes. Consequently, reducing stress levels from your work and personal life is important for preventing infectious diseases such as sinus infections.


Effective stress-relieving practices include meditation, yoga, tai chi and deep breathing exercises.
Sometimes changing jobs and/or personal relationships are the best forms of stress relief. Talk to a licensed counselor if you need advice and guidance.
In addition to emotional stress, immunity is negatively impacted by physical stressors, such as being overweight, not eating well (malnourishment), dealing with other diseases (diabetes, chronic infections) and exposure to toxins.

, Spraying some saline solution (a pinch of salt in some warm distilled water) into your nasal cavities can help keep them moist and deter the growth of pathogenic microorganisms.Most viruses and bacteria either die or can't reproduce in salty conditions. Saline nasal sprays can also help wash away mucus build-up.Speak with your doctor before attempting to cleanse your sinuses.
Put some saline solution in a spray bottle and spray it into your nostrils, but make sure you sniff / snort it up into your sinuses. Consider doing this a few times weekly during the cold / flu season (between December and February in the U.S.) for prevention.
As an alternative, put saline solution into a Neti pot and pour it into your nasal passages through your nostrils. Neti pots look like small tea pots and are commonly used in India and Asia to clean / disinfect nasal passages. Search the internet for how-to videos.

Choose an irrigation device.,
Use safe water.,
Buy or make a saline solution.,
Take sanitary precautions.,
Fill your irrigation device.,
Get into position.,
Irrigate the sinuses.,
Switch sides.,
Clear your sinuses.",How to Flush Sinuses," There are many different kinds of nasal irrigation devices on the market today. These devices are available at most pharmacies, naturopathic stores, and online. They range in size, shape, and longevity (some are disposable), but each essentially serves the same purpose: to flush out your sinuses. Common irrigation devices include:


Neti potsBulb syringeSqueeze bottle;
, Most homes with indoor plumbing have tap water that is safe to drink. However, some sources of tap water contain low levels of microorganisms like bacteria, amoeba, and other protozoa. While these organisms are typically safe to drink, as stomach acid kills them on contact, they should not be used on thin membranes like the inside of the sinus.Unsafe tap water used for nasal irrigation can lead to bacterial infections and amoebic meningitis, a severe condition that is usually fatal.Distilled or sterile water is ideal. These can be purchased in most stores, and should specifically say ""distilled"" or ""sterile"" on the label.You can create sterile water at home. Boil tap water for three to five minutes, then cool until it is lukewarm. Do not use hot water, as this can cause serious and painful burns.Water that has passed through a filter with an absolute pore size of less than or equal to one micron is safe to use. These filters are small enough that they can trap microorganisms, rendering the tap water safe to use. You can buy these tap filters at many hardware stores or online.Find out more about these filters at the Center for Disease Control website.

, You can purchase over-the-counter saline solutions designed for nasal irrigation at most drug stores and pharmacies. However, you can just as easily make your own saline solution at home.


Measure three teaspoons of salt. You should only use kosher, canning, or pickling salt. Do not use salt with iodine, anti-caking agents, or preservatives, as these can irritate the nasal and sinus cavities.In a clean bowl or container, mix the salt with one teaspoon of baking soda.Add 8 ounces (1 cup) of lukewarm water that is either distilled, sterile, boiled and cooled, or properly filtered.Stir until the salt and baking soda are dissolved in the water. Use this mixture to fill your irrigation device.Make sure you are using a sterile instrument to stir the mixture.

, It's important that you take safety precautions whenever you handle, clean, and store your irrigation device. This will help prevent bacteria and other germs from contaminating your irrigation device and potentially entering your sinus cavity.Wash your hands with soap and warm water before handling or using your irrigation device. Dry your hands with a clean, disposable paper towel.Wash the irrigation device using distilled, sterile, or boiled and cooled tap water to ensure that the device does not become contaminated while washing. Let the device air dry, or wipe the inside dry with a clean, disposable paper towel., Whether you are using a neti pot, a syringe bulb, or a different irrigation device, ensure that the device has been properly cleaned. Fill the device with a saline solution that has either been store bought or made at home using sterile water., Once you've drawn water into your irrigation device, you'll need to get in place. Lean over a sink to avoid spilling water everywhere (especially water that has been through your sinus).


Tilt your head sideways over the sink.Some experts recommend tilting your head at a 45 degree angle to facilitate the best flow of water without any getting into your mouth.When you're ready, press the spout of your irrigation device gently into the nostril that is closer to the ceiling (the ""upper"" nostril, when your head is tilted). Do not shove the spout deep inside the nose or against the septum, as this may cause discomfort or injury., Once you're in position and have inserted your irrigation device, you may begin to irrigate the nose. Proceed slowly and carefully, especially if this is your first time irrigating your sinuses.


Breathe through your mouth. Do not under any circumstances attempt to breathe through your nose, as this may cause water to go into your lungs and could present a choking hazard.Slowly raise the handle of your irrigation device. If you are using a syringe bulb, you may now begin to gently squeeze the saline solution out. If you are using a neti pot, simply let the water pour slowly into the nostril., Once you've irrigated from one side, you'll need to repeat the entire procedure for the other nostril. Switch the angle of your head to put the other nostril ""above"" the one you just irrigated., Once you've drained the pot on both sides, exhale through both nostrils before you attempt to inhale. You may also wish to blow your nose to remove all the excess solution and mucus/debris."

Irrigate your nose.,
Try a neti pot.,
Use a humidifier.,
Drink fluids.,
Eat something spicy.,
Try acupressure or manual massage.,
Exercise.,
Keep your head elevated.",How to Get Rid of Sinus Congestion1," Fill a one-quart pot with water. Boil the water on the stove for a minute or two or until it is steaming vigorously. Then remove the pot from the heat and place on a heat resistant mat on a table. Drape a large, clean cotton towel over your head and then place your head over the steaming pot. Close your eyes and keep your face at least 12 inches away from the water so that you don't burn yourself. Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth for five counts. Then reduce the inhales and exhales to two counts. Do this for 10 minutes or for as long as the water is still steaming. Try to blow your nose during and after the treatment.Keep any children away from the pot while it is boiling and while it is steaming. Try to do a steaming treatment when there aren't any children around.
You can use this technique frequently, up to every two hours. You can do a steam every two hours or as often as you like. Try placing your face over the steam coming from a hot tea or bowl of soup when you're at work or out and about.You can also add herbs and essential oils (one to two drops) to your steaming water. Spearmint or peppermint, thyme, sage, oregano, lavender, tea tree oil, and black lavender oil have either antibacterial, antifungal or antiseptic properties.;
, Taking a long, hot shower works very similarly to the steam treatments described above. The hot water from the shower creates warm, moist air that is useful in clearing out blocked nasal passages and relieving sinus pressure. Try blowing your nose naturally. The heat and steam will help moisten and liquify the secretions in the sinuses to better facilitate their evacuation.You also achieve a similar beneficial effect by placing a warm compress on your face to help open up your nasal passages and relieve any pressure you might be feeling in your sinuses. Warm a moist washcloth in the microwave for two to three minutes. Always take care not to burn yourself., Mix eight ounces of warm water with 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Using a bulb syringe purchased at the drugstore, irrigate your nostrils with this homemade saline rinse to help loosen and liquify your nasal secretions and relieve congestion. Try doing two sprays in each nostril.Use water that is distilled, sterile, or already boiled and cooled. Always rinse the instrument after each use and let air dry before next use.

, A neti pot is miniature tea pot-shaped device that has become popular and gained support from the medical community as a way of cleansing your sinus passages. The neti pot works by flooding warm water through one nostril and out the other. You simply fill the “teapot” with warm water and tilt your head to allow the water to pour into your right nostril and drain out the left. Then, do the other side.It is important that you use water that is distilled, sterile, or already boiled and cooled. Always rinse the neti pot after each use.
There have been some reports of rare amoebic infections via the neti pot. This can be avoided by using water that meets the above criteria., To help improve the health of your sinuses, place a humidifier in your bedroom while you sleep. A humidifier produces steam and moist air, which will help clear out the nasal passages.When your nasal passages are blocked, you need to focus on keeping your nasal passages and sinuses moist. Although many people think that if you have have a runny nose, that dry air is the trick, dry air only further irritates the membranes in your nasal passage.
Humidifiers are especially good during the wintertime because the air in most homes is very dry due to central heating.
Even placing a hot water bottle near the ear may have a similar effect and help to draw out ear fluid.

, Make sure that you drink lots of water (at least 8 full glasses a day) because this will thin out your mucus and can help prevent sinuses blockages, and thereby ease pressure.Thinned out mucus is much more likely to drain. Whenever you feel the beginnings of sinus pressure, make a concerted effort to stay hydrated.Warm tea can also be useful because it has a similar effect to steam, and the warmth will allow the nasal secretions to flow out.

, Hot salsa, peppers, hot wings, horseradish, and other spicy foods can get your nasal secretions flowing and thereby help to relieve the pressure in your sinuses. The nose is best blown when the secretions are moist and fluid. That is why remedies that generate this are effective.For sushi lovers, try wasabi. The spicy topping will temporarily relieve sinus pressure and help clear your sinuses.

, Apply gentle pressure using your index and middle fingers, rotating in a circular motion over the forehead (frontal sinus) and the bridge of your nose and behind your eyes (orbital sinus) as well as under the eyes (maxillary sinus). Do this for several minutes and then blow your nose right after.You can also apply an oil, such as rosemary or peppermint, as you massage that may open up your sinus passages. Just don't let the oil get into your eyes.

, Exercise is a natural decongestant. Getting your heart rate up just enough to break sweat can help clear your nasal secretions. If you can do some aerobic exercise, such as running or cycling for even 15 minutes, you may experience some relief.You can even try moderate exercise, such as going for a brisk walk.

, When you go to sleep at night, place a couple of pillows beneath your head so that it is elevated. This will make breathing easier and keep the sinus pressure from building up."

Use a nasal steroid spray.,
Take antihistamines.,
Use decongestants.",How to Get Rid of Sinus Congestion2," Intranasal steroids, such as fluticasone (Flonase) and triamcinolone (Nasacort), which is now available over-the-counter, work by reducing inflammation in the nose. Nasal steroid spray has the benefit of having no major side effects like those caused by many oral decongestants and antihistamines, such as drowsiness and dry mouth. Note, however, that it takes a few days for the steroid to build up to its full effect; this means that you will not experience immediate relief.If you're using Flonase, the typical dosage is one spray per nostril twice daily.
There are also other nasal steroids available with a prescription, such as mometasone Furoate (Nasonex).
Potential side effects include indigestion, nausea, and headaches.
New guidelines have suggested that intranasal steroids should be the first line of treatment for sinus congestion., Some people find antihistamines useful, particularly in longer-lasting occurrences of sinus infections, because they can ease nasal congestion. Oral antihistamines include diphenhydramine (Benadryl), cetirizine (Zyrtec) and Loratadine (Claritin). Note, however, that some older antihistamines can have serious side effects for the sinuses, including the drying up of the mucous membranes of the nasal tissue and thickening the secretions, and can also cause drowsiness.Take 25 milligrams of Benadryl every eight hours as needed for congestion. This drug may prove difficult to tolerate due to its side effects of drowsiness and “fogginess.""
Take 10 mg of Zyrtec once daily. Children older than six years of age may take this as well, in doses of 5-10 mg per day, depending on weight. Consult the instructions. This medication may cause some drowsiness.
Take 10 mg of Claritin once daily. Second generation antihistamines such as this one have a much improved side effect profile and are less likely to cause drowsiness.You could also try a prescription antihistamine nasal spray such as azelastine (Astelin, Astepro) or olopatadine hydrochloride (Patanase).

, Using an over-the-counter decongestant or medication can help relieve pressure in your sinuses by unblocking the nasal passages. You can get them in the form of nasal sprays or as oral medication and they can be purchased at most pharmacies. Consult your doctor before using any nasal decongestant sprays or oral decongestants and always be sure to follow any instructions on the label.Nasal decongestant sprays should not be used for more than 3 days at a time. Longer term use has been linked to ""rebound"" swelling of the nasal passages. Oral decongestants, such as Sudafed or Bronkaid pills, however, can be used for up to two weeks without supervision by a physician.
While the ""rebound"" swelling is less common with oral decongestants, some people experience palpitations or a rise in blood pressure.
Avoid nasal sprays containing zinc. These have been linked to permanent loss of the sense of smell (though this is rare).

Have multiple smoke and gas detectors in your home.,
Use an electric stove.,
Label the food in your refrigerator.,
Label chemicals in your home.,
Practice good hygiene.",How to Live With Anosmia1," You are twice as likely to be exposed to an undetected fire or gas leak because you have anosmia. Using detectors and sensors can prevent this from happening. Place a smoke detector in any room that you sleep in or that may have a fire.Propane detectors, natural gas detectors, carbon monoxide and gasoline detectors can be purchased at marine electronic stores, recreational vehicle dealers, or your local gas company.
The type of detector you use will depend on the energy sources in your home. For example, if you have a gas stove, you will need a gasoline detector instead of a propane detector.
Keep a fire extinguisher handy, especially in the kitchen.
Have your gas appliances serviced each year by a professional.;
, An electric stove is safer for you than a gas stove. You will not have to worry about gas leaks. If you must use a gas stove, make sure it has an automatic pilot light. You can also prepare your food using other methods that do not require gas.Try preparing your food on the grill.
Use an oven that has automatic shut-off features.

, As soon as you go grocery shopping, label the foods with the date that you purchased them and the date that you open them. This will help you avoid eating expired food since you cannot smell the food to see if it has gone bad. Eating spoiled food can be unsafe and give you stomach problems.Always check expiration and use by dates on food before you eat it.
If you are ever in doubt, it is best to throw the food away instead of taking the risk.
If you live with another person who can smell, ask them to check your food before you eat it.

, Label all of the chemicals in your home such as bathroom and kitchen cleaners, pesticides, hair products, etc. Always read the label before you use them as well. Some chemicals should only be used in well-ventilated areas and you cannot rely on your sense of smell to determine if the chemical is toxic., You may be self-conscious about body odor because you cannot smell yourself. Having good hygiene can eliminate some of this.Brush and floss your teeth twice a day. Shower or bathe at least once a day and wear deodorant. Also, wear breathable fabrics like cotton to keep your body cool.


If you have a good friend, ask them to smell you.
If you are sweating a lot or it is hot outside, you may need to shower more frequently or have an extra change of clothes.

Choose foods with strong flavors.,
Focus on other aspects of taste.,
Do not forget to eat.",How to Live With Anosmia2," The smell of food contributes to the taste of food as well. Your food may not taste as good because of your anosmia.Eating foods that are heavily seasoned can help make up for this. Herbs, spices, and marinades can help enhance the flavor of your food.If possible, marinate your food overnight for the best results. If you cannot marinate overnight, 10 minutes is enough to see improvement.
A dry rub can be used on meats instead of a marinade. Rub the meat or fish with a mix of herbs and spices before you cook it.
Avoid seasoning with too much salt as this can lead to high blood pressure.

, You can make your food more interesting by eating different textures and colors of food. Try to incorporate multiple colors, textures, and flavors in each of your meals.

See a doctor.,
Do smell training.,
Take prescription medications.",How to Live With Anosmia3," A healthcare professional can help diagnose you and determine the cause of your anosmia. Anosmia can be a result of nasal-sinus disease (e.g.chronic rhinosinusitis, nasal inflammation), viral upper respiratory infections (e.g. colds), head trauma, or neurological disorders (e.g. Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson’s Disease, etc.) The treatment options available to you will depend on the cause of your anosmia.Anosmia can be permanent or temporary.
It is hard to predict if you will or will not respond to treatment.
Upper respiratory infections are the most common cause of anosmia.
It is best to see an otolaryngologist because they specialize in ear, nose, and throat disorders., Smell training twice a day may improve your sense of smell. During smell training you will expose yourself to different odors twice a day.You will use four essential oils (e.g. Rose, Lemon, Cloves, and Eucalyptus) for your training. They can be purchased at health or beauty stores. Place a few drops of the oil on a test stick or cotton pad and allow it to sit for 2 minutes. Hold the pad/stick an inch from your nose and slowly inhale the fragrance. Do this twice and then rest for 5 minutes. After five ,minutes, move on to the next scent.Do smell training when you wake up in the morning and before you go to bed.
You may not smell anything at first, but keep trying.
It usually takes at least a week, before you notice any results.
If you cannot get essential oils, you can choose some other strong, non-toxic odors such as perfume, coffee grounds, or flavor extracts for your smell training.
Smell training is most effective if you start within 12 months of losing your sense of smell., If your anosmia is the result of a upper respiratory infection, you can be treated with oral corticosteroids. It is best that you take these medications as soon as possible. The majority of people will regain there sense of smell, but it may take two or more years.If your anosmia is a result of head trauma, recovery takes much longer and may not happen at all.

Prepare the water.,
Add natural salt and baking soda.,
Gently spray the solution into your nose.,
Repeat as needed.",How to Make a Nasal Rinse1," Pour 1 cup (237 ml) of distilled water into a clean container. If using refrigerated water, allow it to sit out at room temperature until it becomes lukewarm.


You must use purified water. Distilled water is ideal, but if you only have tap water, you should boil it first to remove any potentially harmful bacteria or other additives. Allow boiled water to cool to lukewarm temperatures before use.;
, Add 1/2 tsp (2.5 g) natural salt and 1/2 tsp (2.5 g) baking soda to the purified water. Shake or stir well to combine completely.Only use natural salt, like sea salt, pickling salt, or canning salt. Do not use table salt since it has too many additives that could irritate your sinus passages.
The baking soda is technically optional, and you can exclude it while making the solution if desired. Baking soda enhances the solution's ability to thin mucus, however, making it more effective.

, Use a soft rubber bulb syringe to spray some of the prepared solution directly into your nose.Fill the syringe with your prepared saline solution, then insert the tip of the syringe into your right nostril.
Tilt your head downward over a sink and rotate it to the left. Carefully squeeze the bulb to flush your nostril with the solution, aiming for the back of the head and not the top.
Breathe normally through your mouth. If done correctly, the solution should come out of your left nostril or mouth after several seconds.

Look for sinus congestion and pain.,
See if you have discolored sinus discharge.,
Take note of a cough.,
Distinguish sinusitis due to chronic allergies.,
Seek medical care.,
Take minerals.,
Ingest vitamin C. Ingesting a large amount of vitamin C naturally enhances your immune function.,
Use a neti pot.,
Try echinacea.,
Try allergy medication.",How to Find Out if You Have a Sinus Infection," There are many common symptoms of a sinus infection. One of the main symptoms is sinus congestion. This is typically connected with sinus pain as well. This pain occurs in the areas on and around your nose and is due to the pressure from the inflamed sinus cavity. This pressure often causes headaches.There may be pain when you move your head forward or when you touch the areas overlying your sinus cavities. The maxillary sinuses, which are under your eyes, may be painful or uncomfortable as well when pressed or tapped.
The symptoms can seem very similar to the common cold. The major difference is that, with a cold, you will have congestion, but the sinus pain and pressure will not be as severe.;
, One of the other major signs of a sinus infection is discolored sinus discharge, or snot. The color of the discharge will be green, yellow, or blood-tinged. This is due to the virus in your system, which causes the snot to change colors.


It will also likely be thick and might be hard to blow out.
This is another major way to distinguish a sinus infection from a common cold. The nasal discharge you experience with a common cold is abundant and there is a lot of it, but it is clear. The discharge with a sinus infection will always have a cloudy and colored appearance., Along with the nasal symptoms, you may develop a cough as well. The nasal discharge often drains into your throat and lungs, which is called a post-nasal drip. You may feel the sensation that it is draining to the back of your throat. This drip can cause a cough that may or may not be productive, which means that it produces phlegm.


You may also develop a low grade fever.
This cough will not be set in your lungs. A sinus infection does not cause mucus to be created in your lungs. The cough you develop with a sinus infection is the way your body reacts to post-nasal drip. It is simply trying to expel the phlegm that travels to your lungs., You can develop a sinus infection as a result of your allergies. The same pathogenesis that cause sinusitis is present with allergies, which sets the stage for the symptoms of the infection. For this type of sinus infection, you may have sinus pressure and pain for days leading up to the onset of the infection. The change in color of your snot notes when your sinus issues change from allergies to an infection.


Chronic allergy sufferers may also have nasal polyps, which impede drainage and predispose you to infection., The duration of the symptoms is the most important factor in determining if you need to visit a healthcare provider. If you have been suffering from the symptoms of a sinus infection for more than seven days and the symptoms have not gotten better, you need to seek medical attention. There is a higher likelihood that you could develop a build up of bacteria in your sinuses, which can cause a secondary infection. This will make your condition much worse and cause you more discomfort and pain.


Bacterial sinusitis presents as a cold with intense sinus pain and pressure that will not go away.
The treatment will vary depending on your doctor. There is a bit of controversy over whether antibiotics are helpful for sinus infections since there is no proof that they help with viruses. Viruses that cause sinusitis include rhinovirus, parainfluenza, and influenza.
If your symptoms last for under a week, you do not need to see a healthcare provider. Up to 70% of those infected with sinusitis recover without the use of medication or without seeing a doctor.If your doctor is concerned about an intracranial infection or orbital cellulitis, she may order a CT scan. This will allow her to see your sinuses for diagnosis.
She may prescribe oral administration of decongestant such as pseudoephedrine, or the use of mucolytics and antihistamine medications.
If you fail to improve with these measures, you will often be prescribed an antibiotic, such as amoxicillin or augmentin.
Follow up with your doctor as necessary.

, There are some treatment and preventative methods that can help you when you have or think you might be getting a sinus infection. When you first suspect a sinus infection or cold is coming on, start taking zinc as quickly as possible. Studies show that zinc taken within 24 hours of the beginning of cold symptoms greatly decrease the duration of the symptoms.


Studies show that a dose between 75 mg-150 mg daily will shorten the duration of a cold by 42%.You can get zinc in a lozenge form over the counter at most drugstores. Try common brands such as Cold-EEZE. To use, dissolve the zinc lozenge in one cup of water and drink every one to three hours for your total daily dose.

, This can help fight the symptoms of your sinus infection. Multiple studies show that 2000mg of vitamin C daily provided great benefits in reducing not only duration but severity of the symptoms.


You need to get at least 1000 mg daily to help fight the symptoms. You can also ingest even more than 2000 mg because no side effects have been reported when more than the recommended daily amount is consumed. You can get more vitamin C every day through citrus fruit and leafy green vegetables. You can also buy over the counter supplements in powder, tablet, and chewable form.

, When you start to feel your nostrils inflame, you can use a neti pot to help with the symptoms. A neti pot is a miniature teapot shaped device that cleanses your sinus passages by flooding warm water through one nostril and out the other. To use, fill the pot with warm water that is around 120 degrees. Tilt your head to the side to allow the water to pour into your right nostril and drain out the left.


It can be dangerous to use a neti pot if used incorrectly. If you breathe during a nasal douche, it can introduce bacteria into your nasal cavities and possibly lead to pneumonia.
There have been some case reports of rare amoebic infections in areas with unclean water inhabited by this parasite, in which the fecal parasite was introduced via poor sanitation. This is not a problem in areas with appropriate water sanitation.If you are worried about the safeness of your water, boil it for at least ten minutes and then let it cool to the recommended temperature before using.

, You can take echinacea to help shorten the duration of your symptoms. There have been multiple studies done that prove that echinacea works in these situation. Although there is no research-based consensus on the dosage needed per day, most medical professionals suggest that three tablets of 176-300 mg should be taken daily for one week when you have symptoms of a sinus infection., There are many different over-the-counter allergy medications that are helpful when you suffer from sinusitis due to chronic allergies. These come in tablet and nasal spray. Try tablet medications such as Claritin and Zyrtec. Take 5-10mg per day. You can also try nasal sprays such as Flonase, which is a non-addictive steroid based nasal spray that was once by prescription only but is now available over the counter.


There are other nasal sprays available, but they have negative side effects. Neo-synephrine nasal decongestant spray carries a rebound addictive property, in which congestion will worsen if product is not used daily."

Prepare a basic saline solution.,
Add something to soothe irritation.,
Try various antiseptic additives.,
Carefully consider using essential oils.,
Use the solution to flush out your nasal passageways.,
Repeat as needed.",How to Make a Nasal Rinse2," Combine 1 cup (237 ml) distilled or purified water with 1/2 tsp (2.5 g) natural salt and 1/2 tsp (2.5 g) baking soda. Shake or stir the ingredients together in a clean container.


Distilled water is ideal, but if you opt for tap water, boil it first to remove any impurities. Allow the water to cool to lukewarm temperatures before use.
Only use sea salt, pickling salt, canning salt, or other unprocessed non-iodized salt. Do not use table salt.

, Natural anti-inflammatory additives can help minimize the inflammation causing your stuffy nose and may reduce any stinging caused by the nasal rinse itself.


Ghee is one possible anti-inflammatory. Add 1 tsp (5 ml) to the saline solution and mix well.
Warm milk and glycerin can also be used to make the rinse more soothing. Add 1 tsp to 1 Tbsp (5 ml to 15 ml) of either option to the rinse.
Xylitol can also make the solution sting less. Additionally, it can help kill candida, making it helpful if you are battling a sinus infection. Add 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) to the solution.

, If you're dealing with sinus troubles caused by viruses and bacteria, adding something with natural antiseptic properties can help your body fight off infection.


Apple cider vinegar, colloidal silver, grapefruit seed extract, and raw Manuka honey are all natural remedies believed to have antiviral and antibiotic properties. With any of these additives, start by only mixing in one to two drops. Using more can increase stinging or cause further complications.
Alternatively, you could try using 1/4 to 1/2 tsp (1.25 to 2.5 ml) hydrogen peroxide.This can be especially helpful if you are diagnosed with an actual sinus infection, but you should not use hydrogen peroxide with any other antiseptic additive. It is also recommended that you use hydrogen peroxide with xylitol powder to help minimize the irritation it can cause., Certain essential oils can help clear or soothe your nasal passageways, but since many are so concentrated, they can also cause burning and further irritation.


Eucalyptus, peppermint, frankincense, and rosemary are all safe and may help relieve sinus pressure and associated pain.Only use one at a time, however, and mix in no more than one drop with a standard batch of saline solution.
Do not use oregano oil. Even in small amounts, oregano oil will be too strong and will likely cause severe irritation or pain.
As a general rule, it's best to only use essential oils you're already familiar with. Use pure essential oils, and do your research to verify that a particular oil is safe to use internally.

, After preparing the solution, draw it into a clean bulb syringe. Insert the tip of the syringe into your nostril and carefully squeeze the solution through your nasal passageways.


Tilt your head downward over a sink and rotate it slightly to the left.
Insert the tip of the filled syringe into the right nostril, aiming it toward the back of the head.
Squeeze the bulb to spray the solution into your nostril. After several seconds, the solution should run out of your left nostril or mouth.
Repeat the same procedure for the left nostril.

, Repeat this procedure two to four times daily. Continue for up to seven days, or stop sooner if your symptoms subside.


Clean the syringe in between each use.
Typically, saline solution can be held for three days if kept in a covered container at room temperature. Discard the solution earlier if it turns cloudy or smells strange.

Try warm milk.,
Prepare triphala decoction.,
Consider goldenseal decoction.,
Flush your sinuses as usual.,
Repeat as needed.",How to Make a Nasal Rinse3," Warm milk can be used as an additive to standard saline solutions, but you can also use it as a stand-alone nasal rinse if your nose is dry or otherwise irritated.Use pasteurized whole milk. Raw milk is more likely to contain bacteria and other impurities that could cause or worsen a sinus infection. Reduced percentage milks are usually safe, but the decreased amount of milk fat can reduce the soothing properties of the milk, making it less effective as a nasal rinse.
Carefully warm 1 cup (250 ml) of milk in a small saucepan on the stove, stirring frequently. Do not allow it to boil since it may start breaking down, thereby becoming less effective. Bring the milk up in temperature until it roughly matches average human body temperature, 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius).

, Triphala is a natural compound valued for its astringent and anti-inflammatory properties, and it's commonly used in traditional Ayurvedic medicinal practices.


As an astringent, the supplement should help reduce bleeding of the nasal passages. Its anti-inflammatory properties may also help reduce stuffiness and nasal swelling.
Combine 1 tsp (5 ml) of triphala powder with 1 cup (239 ml) of warm, distilled/purified water. Steep for five minutes before straining the solids out. Use only the liquid tea for your nasal rinse.

, Goldenseal is another herb commonly used in natural medicines. It's believed to have astringent and antimicrobial properties.


Goldenseal may help prevent or fight certain nasal infections due to its antimicrobial properties, and its astringent properties can reduce nasal bleeding.
Mix 1 tsp (5 ml) goldenseal powder with 1 cup (239 ml) of warm, distilled/purified water. Steep the powder for five minutes, strain, and use the liquid tea as a nasal rinse.

, Choose and prepare one of these nasal rinse remedies. Draw the rinse into a clean bulb syringe, then insert the tip of the syringe into your nostrils and carefully spray the solution directly into your nose.


Keep your head tilted forward over a sink or shower as you use the rinse.
Insert the tip of the filled syringe into one nostril and tilt your head in the opposite direction. Once you squeeze the rinse into your nose, it should drip out of the other nostril or out of your mouth.
Repeat the same procedure for both nostrils.

, If necessary, repeat the procedure twice a day for up to seven days. Stop sooner if your symptoms subside before the week ends.


Keep the syringe clean in between each use.
Discard any warm milk you do not use during the first rinse. Triphala or goldenseal decoction can be saved at room temperature for 24 hours if kept in a sealed container.

Make an appointment with your doctor if symptoms last longer than ten days.,
Talk to your doctor about taking an over-the-counter (OTC) decongestant.,
Ask your doctor about taking OTC painkillers to help ease sinus pain.,
Discuss allergy medications with your doctor.,
Ask your doctor about antibiotics for bacterial infections.,
Talk to your doctor about prescription steroidal medicines for severe sinus infections.",How to Feel Better with a Sinus Infection1," If you have a runny or stuffed nose, do not automatically assume it is a sinus infection. Typically, home care of over the counter antihistamines, rest, hydration and cold remedies can be utilized to help your body recover. The unnecessary prescribing of antibiotics is causing bacteria to no longer respond to antibiotics, rendering them ineffective. To avoid this, allow yourself time to rest and recuperate before contacting your doctor. If necessary, your doctor can evaluate your condition and prescribe medicines to help you recover and feel better. Seek help if you experience any of the following symptoms:Sinus congestion that lasts for more than 10 days
A fever of 102°F (38.9°C) or higher
Symptoms that improve and then worse at or around the 6th day of your illness;
, Ask your doctor for recommendations on what over the counter medicines might help to ease your symptoms. Sinus infections are often accompanied by mucus buildup and congestion, medicines that fight these symptoms can help you get relief. These medicines are available in both pill form and as a nasal spray.


Popular decongestant pills include phenylephrine (Sudafed PE), pseudoephedrine (Sudafed 12 Hour).Generic versions of these medicines will work just as well as long as they contain the same ingredients.
Don't use nasal sprays, such as Afrin, for more than three days unless directed — this can actually increase congestion., Painkillers (or analgesia) won't usually fight the direct cause of the sinus infection, but they can help with painful aches and sinus pressure. Always follow the directions on the label with these medications — they can be dangerous if taken in very high doses. Don't rely on OTC painkillers for more than about a week and a half without consulting with a doctor.Ibuprofen is an especially good choice because it's also an anti-inflammatory. This means that it can reduce the swelling in the sinus passages, helping to relieve mucus buildup and pressure.
Other good OTC painkillers include acetaminophen (paracetamol) and naproxen sodium.
Only take recommended dosages of these medications. Overdoing it with these medications can cause serious issues, such as kidney or liver problems.

, Sinus infections can have a wide variety of causes. For instance, some sinus infections aren't the result of a disease, but instead a reaction to substances in the air that the sufferer is allergic to. Luckily, there are medicines available to fight allergy symptoms and make you feel better:


Most OTC medicines used for allergies belong to a type of drugs called antihistamines. Examples include diphenhydramine (Benadryl), Brompheniramine (Dimetapp), and Loratadine (Claritin).
If you have a sinus infection and you haven't ever been tested for allergies, it can be a wise idea to schedule an allergy test with your doctor. This can prevent you from wasting time with solutions that don't work for you.

, Antibiotics are a type of medicine that kills harmful bacteria in the body. If your doctor believes that your sinus infection is caused by bacteria, she or he may prescribe you some antibiotics to fight it. Do not take antibiotics that were not prescribed for you and do not take old antibiotics that were prescribed for a different condition.


If you are given antibiotics, it is important to follow your doctor's instructions as you use it. Don't stop taking it if you feel better before you're done with the medicine — always take the full course of antibiotics. This can cause the bacteria to adapt to that antibiotic, which will keep it from working in the future.
Keep in mind that the use of antibiotics to treat sinus infections is controversial among doctors, so some doctors may not be willing to prescribe them., In some cases sinusitis may be severe or chronic in nature, and not due to bacterial infection. In these cases, your doctor may prescribe you a type of medicine administered through nasal spray which includes a corticosteroid. These drugs help fight inflammation in your sinus passages, improving the flow of mucus and relieving pressure.Brands include Nasacort and Flonase.

Drink hot liquids..,
Apply a warm compress.,
Eat spicy foods.,
Get a humidifier.,
Suck on lozenges that contain zinc.,
Stay hydrated.,
Get enough sleep at night.,
Use gentle, soothing tissues for a runny nose.,
Irrigate your nasal passages with a neti pot.,
Consider herbal supplements.",How to Feel Better with a Sinus Infection2," Hot liquids help loosen and break down mucus in your sinus packages. This can relieve the painful ""pressure"" feeling that often comes with sinus infections. Plus, the warm sensation of the liquid can help soothe sore throats and stimulate blood flow for quicker healing. Good choices include:


Tea: Many find that honey, ginger, and lemon are especially soothing.Hot chocolate
Soup: Something thin like chicken noodle soup is usually best.
Hot water on its own or with lemon and/or honey
Try to avoid drinks with caffeine in the afternoon or evening as these can make it hard to get to sleep as well as can be dehydrating. A good night's rest is especially important when you're sick.

, Using a warm compress on the bridge of your nose. The warmth from the compress will help to make you feel better and it should also make it easier for you to blow your nose.


Place a washcloth in a bowl of hot water or place it under hot running water. Be careful not to burn yourself.
When the cloth reaches a comfortable temperature, place it across your nose and allow it to sit there until the heat is gone. Recline in a chair or lay down so that the cloth will stay put.

, Some foods (generally ones that are spicy or pungent) are great for ""opening up"" your sinuses. This will lead to mucus production and a runny nose in the short term, but it should help clear your head and reduce your discomfort. Good choices include:


Foods with plenty of red/cayenne pepper.
Foods with hot sauce (sriracha, etc.) added.
Especially ""minty"" or ""cold""-tasting foods like peppermint, spearmint,
Horseradish.

, A humidifier will help to keep the air moist as you sleep, which will help to make you more comfortable. You may also want to consider adding a few drops of eucalyptus oil to your humidifier. Doing so has been shown to have decongestant, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, which should help to clear your sinuses and aid in prevention of a sinus infection., Sucking on lozenges for a sore throat may also help to you’re your nasal passages and help you feel better. Lozenges that contain zinc may also help to shorten a cold if you start taking them within the first 24 hours of symptoms.Use these lozenges as needed to keep an irritated throat feeling good.


Be careful about the number of lozenges you take. While they can provide comfort in small amounts, taking them in large doses or for more than five days can lead to an upset stomach or an unpleasant taste in the mouth., While hydration is always important, it's extra-important when you're feeling sick. Try to keep a bottle of water handy at all times and take sips throughout the day. The more you drink, the better your body will be able to help you fight your infection.


In addition, water helps moisten the mucus membranes, lessening congestion and discomfort., When you're sick, you should aim to get quality rest — and plenty of it. Sleep is a vital part of your body's natural recovery cycle that can't be ignored. It's your body's time to rest and ""repair"" itself. When you're not getting enough, it becomes hard for your body to deal with diseases and infections that are affecting your health. If you can, set your normal bedtime back two hours and your wake-up time ahead one (unless you're still going to school or work) to ensure you get lots of rest. If you have a hard time getting to sleep due to your sinus infection, try some of the following strategies:Use a nasal strip to open up your air passages.
Take a shower before bed (the steam will help open your sinuses) as well as help relax you.
Sleep semi-upright so that mucus drains out of your head. Try to prop up your whole upper body, not just your neck, as this is uncomfortable and can actually close your airway.
Use a mentholated medicine (like Vick's,peppermint essential oil, eucalyptus etc.).

, Nothing makes a sinus infection worse than a raw, irritated nose from over-wiping. If your sinus infection is causing a runny nose, invest an extra dollar or two in a box of extra soft tissues. Select a product with lotion or cooling agents built in. These can soothe and moisturize your nose as you wipe, preventing discomfort.

, Nasal irrigation is the process of pouring a saline solution into one nostril so that it drains out the other. As it passes through your sinuses, it can help to moisten and clear sinus infections.If desired, you can use nasal irrigation as an occasional method of clearing your sinuses quickly. However, studies suggest that if used too often it can actually be counterproductive, so try to limit your usage to periods of between one and three weeks.See below for instructions:


Warm 4-8 oz of distilled or sterilized water on the stove or microwave. It is crucial to use clean water for nasal irrigation — using dirty water can introduce harmful microbes to the sinuses. If in doubt, you can always boil water, then allow it to cool.
Add the water to a nasal irrigation pot or bottle. Neti Pot is the most famous brand, but similar alternatives exist.
Add premixed saline mixture to water. This is usually sold alongside the pot or bottle itself. Follow the directions on the packet to mix the saline.
Irrigate in each nostril, turning your head and allowing the water to drain out of the opposite nostril and into the sink.

, A wide variety of so-called ""natural"" cures are sold online and in brick and mortar stores for treating sinus infections. These supplements are made from small amounts of herbs and claim to offer relief from painful sinus symptoms without the chemicals in traditional medicines. While some swear by these remedies, there is a general lack of scientific evidence for the effectiveness of most herbal supplements. In addition to this, these remedies aren't usually held to the same standards of quality control as ""real"" medicines, so use them with caution.


You can find herbal supplements online with a quick search engine query. Just a few remedies that are claimed to help with sinus infections are:

Eucalyptus (in bathwater)
Peppermint oil (in bathwater)
Garlic (eaten)
Echinacea (in tea)
Turmeric (in tea)


Be very careful with supplementation as they are not monitored by FDA for purity and efficacy.

Drop a few ice cubes in a plastic bag, wrap it in a paper towel, and hold them against your closed eyelids for five to 10 minutes.

, Believe it or not, something as simple as the sun's rays can have a major effect on the way you feel. Humans need vitamin D (which is created when the skin takes in sunlight) for a variety of important body processes, including the functioning of the immune system.In addition, sunlight has been found to help fight depression, which can be a big benefit if your sinus infection has left you feeling miserable.As long as it's not overcast, you can usually get sun no matter what it's like outside. If it's winter, sit by a sunny window with a good book. If it's a bit warmer outside, trying sitting on the porch or in the yard, even if you have to bundle up a bit.

, When you're sick with a sinus infection, you often just plain don't feel good. This can carry over to your mood as well. One great way to feel better with a sinus infection is to have someone give you a massage. It's hard to feel bad when you're getting a massage — the gentle pressure relaxes you, elevates your mood, and helps you forget about your symptoms (at least for a moment).


You can also try giving yourself a facial massage. This is an especially good option if your sinus infection is causing painful pressure behind your face. To do this, use your fingers to gently press on the spot between your brows just above your nose. Press and rub for about one minute. Next, slowly move your fingers around your face, rubbing as you go. Start at your forehead, then gradually move down to your temples, cheeks, and jawline.

Determine how long you are sick.,
Figure out how often you are getting sick.,
Look for persistent yellow mucus.,
Check for nasal problems.,
Check for bad breath.,
Decide if you have chronic fatigue.",How to Distinguish Sinusitis from Similar Conditions1," One way to tell the difference between sinusitis and another condition, such as a cold, is to look at how long they last. A sinus infection will last between seven to ten days, or even longer. During this time, you will not see your symptoms improve.A common cold will only be around for four to ten days, with symptoms getting better as the days go by. The worst symptoms happen within three to five days.
Sinusitis commonly occurs due to a cold, so your condition may start out as a cold and turn into a sinus infection.;
, Colds and sinusitis are extremely similar and sometimes happen at the same time. However, colds go away after a week and don’t often come back. Sinusitis is often a recurring condition.If you are getting sick every month or two, you probably are dealing with sinusitis.

, Another common sign of sinusitis is thick yellow mucus. This will cause you to be stuffed up or have difficulty breathing, and when you blow your nose, you’ll blow out thick yellow mucus.Colds will have clear discharge at first, then it changes to a thicker consistency and turns white, yellow, or green. This only lasts a few days before it clears up.

, Another side effect of sinus infections are various nasal problems. These problems stem from the narrowing or swelling of the sinuses. You may have trouble breathing through your nose. The inside of your nose may feel swollen or blocked even if there is no mucus. Some of these problems may occur with a cold, but if these nasal problems last for longer than four to seven days, you more than likely have sinusitis.You may experience a decreased sense of smell or sense of taste.
Because of these nasal problems, you may have trouble sleeping.
When you have a cold, you may sneeze due to your nasal problems. Sneezing is not a common symptom for sinusitis.

, Because of the infection in your sinuses, sinusitis can cause you to have bad breath. You may also have postnasal drip that tastes bad, which means you have a persistent bad taste left in your mouth.Both colds and sinusitis can cause sore throats, which may lead to bad breath. Sore throats are more common with colds, though.

, Because of the amount of mucus and congestion in your head, you may feel more tired than usual. Your head may even feel like it’s too heavy to lift most days. You may wake up feeling tired despite getting enough sleep, and you may be more irritable than usual.Colds can make you feel tired or achy, but sinusitis can make you feel tired for weeks.

Locate the pain.,
Feel for tenderness.,
Watch for sensitivity.,
Examine the duration.",How to Distinguish Sinusitis from Similar Conditions2," Sinus infections generally cause severe headaches, which can get confused with migraines. These headaches are felt around the sinuses. This includes around or behind the eyes, the cheeks, and the bridge of the nose. It gets worse when you bend over or cough.


Migraines pain can be more widespread, in the top or bottom of the head, and even in the neck. Sinus headaches generally don’t affect the neck.

, Headaches due to sinusitis cause tenderness of the face. This is because the sinuses are swollen and tender. Gently press your fingers along your face around your nose, including your cheeks and above your eyes. Sinusitis causes this to be sore or swollen.You may also feel pain or tenderness in the jaw or your teeth.This area of your face may also be redder than usual.
The pain for a migraine is usually a throbbing pain in the temples or back of the head, and generally not a tenderness of the face., Migraines are often accompanied by sensitivities to stimuli. This may include being sensitive to bright lights or sunshine. Any sound may make your headache worse. You may find it difficult to keep your eyes open and need to lie down to help the pain go away.This sensitivity may be accompanied by feelings of nausea or vomiting. The pain or the lights and sound may trigger you to feel sick to your stomach.
Sinusitis doesn't generally cause any sensitivity or reaction to stimuli. Sinusitis usually gets worse if you cough or hang your head down., Migraine headaches have a very specific duration, whereas a sinusitis headache is more unpredictable or chronic. Migraines last for a few hours and then go away after taking headache medication. Symptoms will go away with a migraine, whereas your face will still be sore even if the sinus headache has subsided.Migraines are generally a recurring problem. They have a very similar pattern, last around the same amount of time each time, exhibit the same symptoms, and go away with the same treatment.

"
"
Check for allergy symptoms.,
Determine if the symptoms start from exposure.,
Pay attention to when the symptoms disappear.",How to Distinguish Sinusitis from Similar Conditions3," Sinusitis and allergies both cause cough, headaches, fatigue, and congestion. However, if you are suffering from allergies, you may have more specific symptoms. For example, you may experience more sneezing without the accompanying congestion.Allergies also commonly cause itchy and watery eyes and a scratchy, itchy throat.
Any discharge from allergies is clear while the discharge from sinusitis is green or yellow.Allergies usually don’t cause fevers, pain in the face, or bad breath., Sinusitis sometimes gets confused with allergies. You may experience the same kind of stuffiness, mucus, sinus pressure, or sinus headache. To know it is caused by allergies, decide if you were exposed to an allergen.Common allergens include smoke, pollen, strong fragrances, and pet dander.

, Sinusitis hangs around for two weeks or more. Allergy related sinus problems will go away more quickly. As soon as the allergen is removed, your symptoms will go away soon afterwards. If you have seasonal allergies, the symptoms will start and end around the same time every year.If you are exposed to the same allergen all year round, like pet dander or smoke, you may have constant symptoms all year round.

Use a humidifier.,
Try a stove top steam treatment.,
Sip a hot cup of tea.,
Avoid dehydration.",How to Keep the Nose Moist to Prevent Nosebleeds1," You can use either a cool water humidifier or a vaporizer. When the air is very dry, any increase in humidity will help prevent a nosebleed. Moistening the air at night will also make it easier to breathe and to sleep.If you don’t have a commercial humidifier, you can make one by putting a pot of water on the radiator/heating in the winter. The water will slowly evaporate over time, increasing the humidity in the air.;
, Boil a pot of water, then put it on the kitchen table with a thick cork pot coaster or pot holder underneath to protect the table from the heat. Lean over the pot, being careful not to burn yourself, and inhale the steam. You can also use a towel to make a tent over the pot and your nose. This will maximize the amount of steam you inhale.


You can also get steam from a hot shower or bath, but the hot water can also be dehydrating, which is counterproductive. Run a hot shower and wash yourself quickly so that your skin doesn't dry out, but then step outside the stream of water or even outside the bath and inhale the steam.

, Drink slowly and inhale the steam. This will both be soothing and relaxing for you, and it will help moisten your nasal passages.


It will work with all types of tea, soups, and hot drinks. Choose something you enjoy to make it as pleasant as possible.
Drinking tea, soups, and other liquids will also help you to stay hydrated.
If you have access to a kitchen at work or school, you can use this method away from home.

, Staying hydrated will also help your body to keep your skin supple and moist. It is easy to forget to drink enough water in winter when it is cold. But even a dry cold is dehydrating.The amount of water you need will vary based on your activity level and the climate you live in. If you have a heating system that produces a dry heat, you may need extra water in winter. Look out for these symptoms of dehydration:Headaches
Dry skin
Feeling lightheaded
Infrequent urination or urinating dark or cloudy urine

Blow your nose sparingly.,
Drink honey and lemon tea.,
Use a nasal decongestant.,
Flush out your sinuses.,
Take an expectorant.,
Use essential oils.,
Take a hot bath or shower.",How to Treat a Cold1," Your natural instinct may be to blow your nose when it feels blocked, but the jury's still out on whether this is actually a good idea or not. Some studies have shown that forcefully blowing your nose can actually lead to a build-up of pressure and trapped mucus in your sinuses, which may become infected.On the other hand, some experts claim that it is important to blow your nose when you're suffering from a cold, as this rids the body of surplus mucus, helping you to decongest.As a compromise, try to only blow your nose when absolutely necessary.


Whatever you believe, make sure to blow your nose gently to avoid excess pressure and use the recommended blowing method, which involves pressing one nostril shut with your finger, while blowing very gently to clear the other, then repeating on the other side.You should avoid sniffing and snuffling as much as possible, as this only draws the mucus back into your head.If you have to be out of the house, be prepared and carry a handkerchief or tissues at all times.
You should always wash your hands after blowing your nose to prevent spreading the cold virus.
Frequent blowing can irritate your skin - use some soft, good quality handkerchiefs to avoid irritating your skin. Use moisturizer on your nose if you need to.
Avoid using paper tissues or Kleenex; they irritate your nose more than cloth handkerchiefs.;
, This is a simple yet effective cold relief remedy that has been around for a long time. To make the honey and lemon tea, boil some water, pour it into a mug, stir in 1 1/2 tablespoons of lemon juice and two teaspoons of honey. The honey will help soothe your sore throat, while the lemon helps to clear up a blocked nose. The vitamin C is also good for fighting infections generally.


The tea should take effect immediately and should ease cold symptoms for at least a few hours.
For optimum feel-good factor, drink this tea while curled up in a comfy chair in front of a roaring fire. You will feel a lot better very soon. Nasal virus thrive in cool temperatures, which is why they thrive in your nose out in the cold air or wind. Studies in Israel showed that breathing warm air reduced cold symptoms. Holding a warm hand over a cold nose for half an hour, breathing through the mouth, can also give the cold-loving virus a set-back.

, Nasal decongestants can provide immediate relief from congestion, by reducing inflammation of the nasal passages and slowing mucus production. Nasal decongestants are available in both tablet and sprays and are sold over-the-counter at most pharmacies.Just be aware that overuse of nasal decongestant sprays (over 3 to 5 days) can actually worsen mucus production, potentially trapping bacteria., One treatment for nasal decongestion which has become very popular in recent years is the practice of flushing out the sinuses with a Neti pot. The Neti pot contains a saline solution which is poured in one nostril and out the other. This thins the mucus in the nasal passages, allowing it to be flushed away. The saline solution can be purchased at most drug stores, or you can make your own.To use a Neti pot, lean over a sink and tilt your head to one side. Insert the spout of the pot into the nearest nostril and pour in the saline solution. The salty water should flow in one nostril and out the other. By reclining and tipping your head back, it can flow into sinuses too.
Once the water stops dripping, gently blow your nose, then repeat on the other side., Consider taking an expectorant medication which helps to clear decongestion by thinning mucous and loosening phlegm, freeing up your airways and allowing you to breathe more easily.Expectorants come in liquid, powder and capsule form and are available over-the-counter.
Side effects of expectorants include nausea, dizziness, drowsiness and vomiting. If you experience any of these symptoms you should contact your doctor immediately., Essential oils such as peppermint, eucalyptus, clove and tea tree oil can help to clear the nasal passages and make breathing easier. There are several ways you can use essential oils. One way is to add a drop or two of your chosen essential oil to a bowl of warm water. Soak a clean face cloth in the water, wring it out, then use it to cover your face and let it sit there for a couple of minutes. Try to inhale deeply and you should feel a noticed improvement in your breathing in just a couple of minutes.


You can also mix a drop or two of essential oil into a little petroleum jelly to make your own vapor rub to massage onto your chest or feet before bed.
Alternatively, you can add a drop or two to your pajamas or to a hot bath, making it easy to inhale the vapors.

, The steam from the hot water will help to clear your nasal passages, while also encouraging relaxation. If the heat leaves you feeling a little dizzy, consider putting a plastic chair or stool in the shower.


If you have long hair, use a blow dryer to minimize losing your body heat after the fact.

Moisten your mucous membranes with nasal saline spray.,
Apply a saline gel.,
Soothe irritated membranes with aloe vera gel.,
Do not apply Vaseline, mineral oil, or other fat-based products (like coconut oil) to the inside of your nose.",How to Keep the Nose Moist to Prevent Nosebleeds2," The active ingredients are simple: just salt and water. You can purchase it over the counter without a prescription. Then, if your nose feels dry, give it a quick spray.If it is just salt and water, it is safe, won't irritate your mucous membranes, and shouldn't cause side effects.This is excellent in winter during flu season. You can bring a small bottle of saline spray with you to use at work and in the car. You can use it three times a day if you need to.Some commercial saline sprays have preservatives in them which may irritate your membranes; however, the preservatives also prevent the growth of bacteria and other contaminants. Check the ingredients on the packaging. If it contains preservatives or ingredient other than salt and water, then be very careful not to use it more often than recommended by your doctor or the manufacturer's instructions.
If you want to use preservative-free saline, find one that uses a no back flow method or has a more acid pH to decrease bacteria.
You can make a homemade saline solution, but it can be difficult to get the proper balance of salt to water, which can lead to dry sinuses. But, if you have no other choice, you can try making your own saline. Add a teaspoon of salt to a quart of water. Then boil it for 20 minutes to sterilize it., While it may be tempting to use an antibiotic ointment like Neosporin, you should avoid overuse of antibiotics. Most colds and flus are cause by viruses, not bacteria, so the antibiotics will have no effect. Instead, spread a thin layer of a saline-based gel to the inside of your nose to keep it moist.Use a clean cotton swab to apply the ointment. Lightly coat the Q-tip with ointment and then apply it to the inside of your nostrils. Do not use so much that it gives you the sensation of a stuffy nose.

, This method is excellent when you have sensitive membranes after a cold. Aloe vera contains vitamins that will help heal and nourish your skin. Use a clean cotton swab to apply it. You can get aloe vera in two ways:


Purchase an over the counter commercial mixture. This can also be applied at work or school.
Cut open the leaf of an aloe plant you may have in your house. If you chose this method, cut the leaf open the long way and use the cotton swab to apply the gooey gel that you find in the leaf.

, If you inhale small amounts of it into your lungs it can cause pneumonia.If you do use a fat-based product, do not do so before bed. Remain upright for several hours afterwards. Do not smear it further in your nose than 1/4 of an inch.Do not apply fat-based products to the nasal membranes of children. They are particularly vulnerable to pneumonia.

Take simple measures to stop the bleeding.,
Go to the emergency room if your nosebleed could be a symptom of something serious.,
Get an exam.",How to Keep the Nose Moist to Prevent Nosebleeds3," Most nosebleeds aren’t dangerous and will stop within a few minutes. You can make it happen faster by:Putting pressure on the bleeding nostril. Squeeze the nostril shut and breathe through your mouth. The pressure will help the blood clot and stop bleeding. You may need to do this for 10 minutes or more. You can press a tissue into your nostril to help absorb the blood.
Sitting up to keep your head above your heart. Don’t lie down or tip your head back because this will cause the blood to drip down the back of your throat. If you swallow too much blood, it may give you an upset stomach.
Apply a cold pack to your nose to cause the blood vessels to constrict. If you don’t have an ice pack ready, you can use a package of frozen veggies and wrap them in a towel.
You can also apply a cold pack to the neck at the same time to help constrict the vessels going to the head.

, This might be the case if:You were recently injured or in an accident.
Your are losing a lot of blood.
You can’t breathe.
It doesn’t stop after 30 minutes of pressing on it.
The person bleeding is under 2.
You get nosebleeds multiple times a week.

, The most frequent causes of nosebleeds are dryness and nose picking. If neither of those apply to you, your doctor may look for an underlying medical reason. There are a wide variety of possible sources, such as:Sinusitis
Allergies
Taking aspirin or blood thinners
Medical conditions that prevent your blood from clotting
Exposure to chemicals
Cocaine
A cold
Deviated septum
Overuse of nasal sprays
An object lodged in your nose
Rhinitis
An injury
Drinking alcohol
Polyps or tumors in the nose
Surgery
Pregnancy

Take some time off.,
Visit your doctor.,
Drink enough warm fluids.,
Get extra rest.,
Gargle with warm salt water and baking soda.,
Turn on a humidifier or vaporizer.,
Stay warm.,
Take over-the-counter cold remedies.,
Avoid smoking.,
Eat chicken soup.",How to Treat a Cold2," Try taking two to three days off from school or work. This helps limit other people's exposure to the virus and also helps you conserve energy to fight off the illness. Staying at home will save you the discomfort of being sick in a place of productivity and give you easy access to all the blankets, hot drinks and other comforts that you'll need to get well again. Also there's less chance of you catching any other illnesses, which is especially important when your immune system has already taken a blow.

, Try telling your doctor about your problem and ask about any medication for you to take. If they offer medicine, be sure to take it on the prescribed basis (most often this will be daily or twice-daily). Specialists for medication will help. They do not offer medicine for all things, usually a cold will go away within 3-7 days. If it is over 7 days, visit your local doctor., Staying hydrated will reduce the effects of many symptoms such as headaches and sore throat, while also preventing dehydration. Hot teas and soups are a good way to increase your liquid intake, while also helping to relieve sinus congestion and reduce inflammation in the nose and throat. Drink enough fluids to quench thirst. Getting enough fluids when you're sick is important, but getting too many may actually force your liver and kidney to work overtime in order to process it.Drink a little more than normal when you're sick, but don't feel like you need to drink 12 or 15 glasses a day.
A good indication that you are drinking enough fluids is that your urine will be almost clear.The deeper yellows imply higher concentrations of waste in your body that are not dissolving and diluting enough - so raise your fluid intake.
Avoid coffee at all costs. It contains caffeine that can run your body into even deeper symptoms of a cold.

, Your body needs all of its resources to fight the cold virus.If you do not give your body the rest it needs, you will do nothing but make yourself feel worse. Take frequent naps and don't overexert yourself with physical activity. Try to keep your head raised while sleeping, as this will assist with the drainage of your nasal passages.Try propping your head up with an extra pillow or cushion in bed - even if it feels a little strange. If your head feels like it's at a funny angle, try placing the second pillow between the sheet and the mattress, or under the mattress itself, so it feels less noticeable.

, Gargling salt water helps to moisten the throat and fight infection, as salt is a natural antiseptic. Try adding a teaspoon of salt to a glass of warm water and stir to dissolve. You can add a little baking soda to help take the ""zing"" from the salt away. Gargle this solution up to four times a day to temporarily relieve a sore throat. Just make sure the water is not too salty or that you don't do this too often or it could dry out your throat and make symptoms worse. If it's too salty, it will really hurt delicate membranes, your clue to add more water to the mix. Some pain, about as much as getting any water up your nose, is to be expected.

, Using either a humidifier or vaporizer in the room you are resting in can make you more comfortable by keeping the air moist.This is especially helpful if your nasal passages or throat are dry and irritated. Keep in mind that although humidifiers might help soothe your throat, they probably don't help relieve cold symptoms or shorten the duration of the cold.


Some studies have suggested that humidifiers and vaporizers may do more harm than good. That's because humidifiers can spread pathogens, mold, and toxins, in addition to causing nasty burns. Use your own judgement to decide if using a humidifier is right for you., It is important to stay warm during your illness, as a cold can leave you feeling weak and shivery. Wear plenty of layers during the day and cover up with extra blankets when sleeping or resting in bed or on the sofa. Staying warm will not get rid of a cold, but it will help you to feel more comfortable.


It is a long-standing idea that you can ""sweat out a cold"", but there is little scientific evidence to back this up. Although many runners swear a good run early in the symptoms and the cold never happens.

, These medicines cannot cure a cold, but they can certainly help to relieve symptoms such as headaches, congestion, fever and sore throat. Just be aware that all over-the-counter cold medications have common side effects including nausea, upset stomach, and dizziness. Make sure that you understand the risks associated with any medication you take and consult your doctor if you are currently taking prescription medications for other conditions.


Analgesics (pain killers), including acetaminophen, aspirin, and ibuprofen, may be helpful if your cold is accompanied by muscle aches, headaches or fever.Do not give aspirin to children or teenagers because it is linked to Reye's syndrome.Antihistamines are a common ingredient in many OTC cold and allergy medications, and help to control runny nose and watery eyes.
Cough suppressants, also known as antitussives, stop the body's reflex to cough. Only take them when your cough is dry and non-productive.A productive cough that helps your body eliminate mucus is good and should not be suppressed. Do not give OTC cough medications to children under 4 years old.
Only take over-the-counter medications that contain decongestants if your nasal passage is swollen, making it hard to breathe. They shrink the blood vessels in your nose to open your airway. Antihistamines can make you more comfortable, and will also make you drowsy so you sleep better while ill.
Thin the mucus from your cold with an expectorant so that you can cough it out if it is too thick or heavy to move.

, Tobacco use can temporally weaken the immune systemand increase the severity of many cold symptoms. You should also avoid coffee, caffeinated tea, and soda.

, There has been some scientific evidence to suggest that chicken soup slows down the movement of certain white blood cells which cause the symptoms of a cold.Additionally, the hot liquid from the soup may help clear the nasal passages and soothe your throat.


You should also consider adding a dash of red cayenne pepper to your soup as the heat from the spice will help to clear your head.

Take a supplement.,
Eat garlic.,
Try zinc.,
Eat raw honey.,
Get lots of vitamin C. Consider taking a vitamin C supplement, drinking orange juice and eating fruits with a high vitamin C content, such as oranges, kiwis and strawberries.,
Try echinacea.,
Take elderberry syrup.,
Stop the spreading of pathogens.Don't allow others to eat or drink from anything you have come in contact with, and change your pillow cases every day or two while you're feeling ill.",How to Treat a Cold3," Taking a supplement packed with essential vitamins and nutrients is an easy way to boost your immune system. You can take individual supplements such as a vitamin C or zinc tablets, or you can find a multivitamin which has everything in one. If you're not a fan of fish, you can still get the benefits of all the essential fatty acids fish contains by taking an Omega-3 supplement, which has been proven effective in fortifying the immune system.


A large array of supplements can be found at drug stores, supermarkets and health food stores.
Taking an immune-boosting supplement probably won't get rid of your cold any faster, but it will help you to avoid getting sick again.

, Garlic promotes the well-being of the heart and immune systems with antioxidant properties and helps maintain healthy blood circulation.One of garlic’s most potent health benefits includes the ability to enhance the body’s immune cell activity.Try crushing fresh garlic clove with a teaspoon of honey and quickly chew and swallow it.

, New research suggests that if you start taking zinc within one day of getting symptoms, you will probably recover one day sooner than expected and experience less severe symptoms., Honey is a natural immune booster, which also contains anti-viral properties. It has the added bonus of being very soothing on a sore throat, which is great news for cold sufferers. You can eat a spoon of honey on its own, or stir it into hot water or tea to make a soothing drink.

, Although the effectiveness of vitamin C in stopping colds is widely disputed, many vitamin C proponents advise the use of vitamin C daily to reduce the duration of a cold., Echinacea is an herbal supplement which many claim as an effective immune booster and anti-viral. Although its cold-busting properties are disputed by experts, some studies claim that echinacea can both decrease the likelihood of developing a cold, while also reducing the duration of a cold.Try taking a couple of capsules of echinacea as soon as you feel the first symptoms of a cold coming on.

, Elderberries are another great natural immune booster, so try taking a spoon of elderberry syrup - which can be found at most health food stores - every morning, or add just a few drops of elderberry extract to your morning juice.

, This will limit your chances of spreading the infection, as well as help remove the pathogens from your environment.


Wash your hands after you blow your nose. While this will not help you, it will reduce the likelihood of the virus being transmitted to someone else.Avoid human contact as much as possible. During all stages of a cold, the cold virus (usually rhinoviruses, or coronaviruses) can be easily communicated to other people.Staying home from work or school is the “nice” thing to do. If you must work, limit physical contact with people, try not to touch things and wash your hands often. This will lower your chances of getting sicker.

Take acetaminophen or ibuprofen.,
Avoid combining medications for children.,
Take aspirin only if you are over 18.Aspirin is an effective fever reducer for adults, as long as you take only the recommended dosage.",How to Reduce a Fever1," These drugs are available for purchase over the counter and effectively reduce fevers temporarily.They can help both children and adults feel more comfortable as their bodies heal.


Consult a doctor or pharmacist before administering (child- or baby- formulated) medication to any child under the age of two, and never give ibuprofen to a baby under six months of age.Do not take more than the recommended dosage. Pay special attention to the dosage you give to children. Don't place medicine bottles within reach of children, since ingestion of more than the recommended dosage can be dangerous.
Take acetaminophen every 4 to 6 hours, but do not exceed the recommended dosage on the package.Take ibuprofen every 6 to 8 hours, but do not exceed the recommended dosage on the package.;
, Don't give children more than one over-the-counter medicine at the same time for treatment of other symptoms. If you give your child a dose of acetaminophen or ibuprofen, do not also give them cough medicine or any other type of other medicine without consulting your doctor first. Certain medicines interact with each other in ways that can harm your child's health.For infants over 6 months, children, and adults, alternating between acetaminophen and ibuprofen is safe. Usual dosages are acetaminophen every 4-6 hours and ibuprofen every 6-8 hours, depending on the dose.

, Never give adult aspirin to children, since it can cause Reye's syndrome, a potentially fatal disorder."

Drink plenty of fluids.,
Rest as much as possible.,
Wear light, breathable clothing.,
Eat food as usual.,
Try herbal remedies.,
Take a lukewarm bath.,
Never use rubbing alcohol to reduce a fever.",How to Reduce a Fever2," Keeping your body hydrated is important during a fever, since the increased body temperature can cause dehydration.Drinking water and other fluids helps your body expel the virus or bacteria that's causing the fever. However, you should avoid caffeine and alcohol because these can lead to further dehydration.


Green tea may help reduce a fever and boost your immune system.If you are experiencing nausea or vomiting along with the fever, avoid fruit juices, milk, very sugary beverages and carbonated beverages. These drinks can make you feel sick or cause vomiting.Try replacing solid food with soup or broth to help rehydrate your body (but watch the salt content). Popsicles are also a great way to consume fluids that will also help cool your body down.
If you have been vomiting, you may have an electrolyte imbalance. Drink an oral rehydration solution or a sports drink with electrolytes.Children under age one who do not regularly consume breast milk or who are on a nursing strike during an illness should take a rehydration solution containing electrolytes, such as Pedialyte, to make sure they're getting the nutrients they need., Sleep is the body's natural method for recovery from illness; in fact, having too little sleep can even make you sick.Trying to fight through and keep going may even raise your body’s temperature.By making sure you get plenty of sleep you allow your body to spend its energy fighting infection instead of something else.


Take the day off of work, or if your child is sick, have him or her stay home from school. The extra sleep your child will get is a sure way to a quicker recovery, and the source of the fever might be contagious, so it’s best to keep her home. Many fevers are caused by viruses that remain highly contagious as long as the fever is present., Don't cover yourself or your child with blankets and layers of clothing. You may feel chilled, but your body's temperature won't be able to start dropping if you're covered with warm blankets or clothes. Dress yourself or your child in a thin but cozy set of pajamas.Do not try to “sweat out” the fever by bundling up a feverish person.

, Even though the old expression says “starve a fever,” that is not good advice. Continue to nourish your body with healthy foods for a quicker recovery. The old standby chicken soup is a good choice, because it contains vegetables and protein.If you don’t have much of an appetite, try replacing solid food with soup or broth to help rehydrate your body.
Eat foods with a high water content, such as watermelon, to help you stay hydrated.If you have nausea or vomiting with your fever, try to stick to bland foods such as saltine crackers or applesauce., Some herbal remedies may help reduce a fever or support your body’s immune system as it fights whatever is causing the fever. However, herbal and natural remedies can interfere with medications and other medical conditions, so you should consult with your doctor or pharmacist before taking any.Andrographis paniculata is widely used in traditional Chinese Medicine to treat colds, sore throats, and fevers. Use 6 g a day for 7 days. Do not use andrographis if you have gallbladder or an autoimmune disease, are pregnant or trying to become pregnant, or take blood pressure or blood thinning medications such as warfarin.
Yarrow may help reduce fevers by encouraging sweating. If you have ragweed or daisy allergies, you may experience an allergic reaction to yarrow. Do not take yarrow if you also take blood thinning or blood pressure medications, lithium, stomach acid reducers, or anticonvulsants. Children and pregnant women should not use yarrow. You may find that adding yarrow tincture to a warm (not hot) bath helps reduce fever.Despite its name, feverfew doesn’t actually work very well to reduce fevers., Drawing a lukewarm bath, or a relaxing shower, is an easy and comfortable way to reduce a fever. A lukewarm or room temperature dip is usually just the right temperature to cool your body without throwing off your equilibrium. It can be particularly helpful right after taking fever medication.Do not give yourself or your child a hot bath. You should also avoid cold baths, which can lead to shivering that can actually increase internal temperature. If you do want to have a bath, the only appropriate temperature is lukewarm, or just above room temperature.If your child has a fever, you can bathe him or her with a sponge dipped in lukewarm water. Gently wash your child's body, pat him or her dry with a soft towel, and dress your child quickly so he or she doesn't get too chilled, which can lead to shivering, which heats up the body.

, Rubbing alcohol baths are an old remedy people used to use to bring fevers down, but they cause the body temperature to drop dangerously quickly.Rubbing alcohol can also lead to coma if consumed, so it is not appropriate for use or storage around small children."

Let the fever run its course.",How to Reduce a Fever3," There are several different types of thermometers, including digital and glass (mercury) models.The most common way to take a temperature for an older child or an adult is to place a digital or glass thermometer underneath your tongue to measure your body’s heat, but there are several other thermometers that use alternate methods for temperature taking.



Digital thermometers can be used orally or rectally (see below) or under the armpit (though this reduces the accuracy of the reading). The thermometer will beep when the reading is complete, and the temperature displays on a screen.

Tympanic thermometers are used inside the ear canal, and they measure temperature with an infrared light. The downside to this style of thermometer is that a buildup of earwax or the shape of an ear canal can skew the accuracy of the reading.

Temporal thermometers use an infrared light to measure the temperature. These thermometers are great because they are quick and least invasive. To use this type of thermometer, you slide the thermometer from the forehead to the temporal artery, right above the top of the cheekbone. It can be difficult to master proper placement, but taking several readings can improve the accuracy of the reading.

Pacifier thermometers can be used for babies. These are similar to oral digital thermometers, but perfect for babies who use pacifiers. The peak reading is displayed when the temperature is measured.

, After selecting a thermometer, take your temperature according to the method that the thermometer is made for (either orally, in the ear, on the temporal artery, or rectally for a child (see below). If you have a fever above 103 °F (39 °C),you have a baby over 3 months with a fever over 102 °F (39 °C), or you have a newborn (0-3 months) with a fever over 100.4, call the doctor immediately., The most accurate way to take a child’s temperature is through her rectum, but you should use extreme caution so that you do not perforate the child’s bowel. The best thermometer for rectal temperatures is a digital thermometer.


Place a small amount of petroleum jelly or ky jelly on the thermometer probe.
Lay your child on her stomach. Get another person to help if necessary.
Carefully insert the probe one-half inch to one inch into the anus.
Hold the thermometer and child still for about one minute, until you hear a beep. Do not let go of your child or the thermometer to avoid injury.
Remove the thermometer and interpret the reading on the screen.

, If the fever is relatively low grade (up to 102 degrees for an adult or a child over 6 months), reducing it entirely is not necessarily recommended. Fevers are produced by the body as a sign that there's another issue going on, so making it go away can mask a deeper problem.


Aggressively treating a fever can also interfere with your body's natural method of getting rid of a virus or infection. A lower body temperature might produce a more habitable environment for foreign bodies, so it can be better to let the fever run its course.Letting the fever run its course is not recommended for individuals who are immunocompromised, taking chemotherapy drugs, or who have had a surgery recently.Instead of trying to get rid of the fever, take measures to make you or your child more comfortable during the course of the fever, such as rest, drinking fluids, and staying cool."

Recognize the symptoms of a fever.,
Call the doctor if the fever is high.Adults should go to the doctor with a fever higher than 103 °F (39 °C).,
Call the doctor if the fever lasts more than a few days.,
Know when to seek immediate medical attention.",How to Reduce a Fever4," Not everyone’s normal body temperature is exactly 98.6 °F (37.0 °C). A variation from your normal body temperature of a degree or two is normal.Even a mild fever is usually not cause for concern.The symptoms of a mild fever include:


Discomfort, feeling too warm
General weakness
Warm body
Shivering
Sweating
Depending on the cause of the fever, you may also see any of the following symptoms: headache, muscle aches, loss of appetite, or dehydration.

, Children's bodies are more sensitive to the effects of fevers than adults’ bodies are. Call the doctor in the following cases:You have an infant under three months old with a fever over 100.4 °F (38.0 °C)
You have a baby three to six months old with a fever greater than 102 °F (39 °C).
You have a child of any age with a fever greater than 102 °F (39 °C)
You or another adult have a fever of 103 °F (39 °C) or higher, particularly in conjunction with excessive drowsiness or irritability.

, A fever that lasts more than two or three days may be a sign of a deeper problem that needs to be treated separately. Don't try to diagnose yourself or your child; go to the doctor to get it checked out. You should see the doctor if:The fever stays longer than 24 hours in a child under 2
The fever stays for 72 hours (3 days) in any child over 2
The fever persists past 3 days in an adult

, If the fever is accompanied by symptoms that indicate other problems, or when the person with the fever has extenuating circumstances, you need to contact a doctor, regardless of how high the fever is. Here are some circumstances in which you should seek immediate medical attention:The person has difficulty breathing
A rash or spots develop on the person’s skin
The person exhibits listlessness or delirium
The person has unusual sensitivity to bright lights
The person has any other chronic condition such as diabetes, cancer or HIV
The person has recently traveled to another country
The fever has resulted from an overly hot environment such as being outside in extreme heat or being in an overheated vehicle
The person with the fever complains of other symptoms like sore throat, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, ear pain, rash, headache, blood in the stool, abdominal pain, trouble breathing, confusion, neck pain, or pain with urination
The fever is lowered, but the person is still acting sick
If the person has a seizure, call 911

"
Wash your hands frequently.,
Get plenty of restful sleep.,
Get a flu shot.,
Practice good hygiene.,
Talk with your doctor before taking supplements.,
Take probiotics.,
Take echinacea.,
Get plenty of vitamin D. Though research is ongoing, vitamin D is thought to have a beneficial effect on the immune system.People who are deficient in vitamin D are more susceptible to infection.Your body synthesizes vitamin D from sunlight, but if you have little exposure to sunlight, you may need to supplement with food or pills.,
Consider vitamin C when you are sick.,
Distinguish between symptoms of the common cold and the flu.,
Learn about disease transmission and risk factors.,
Know when to get medical attention.",How to Avoid Catching a Cold or Getting the Flu," It's easy to pick up germs from door handles, grocery shopping carts, public transportation, and anything else that might be handled by other people. Get in the habit of washing your hands with warm water and soap or antibacterial soap. Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds (sing ""Happy Birthday"" to yourself twice) before rinsing and drying your hands. This is especially important to do after being around someone who's already sick.When leaving a public bathroom after washing your hands, take care to push the door open with your foot or use a paper towel to open the door.;
, As an adult, you should get between seven to nine hoursof quality, uninterrupted sleep every night to prevent disease. This will improve the function of your immune system and help your body cope with stress and emotional control. It's important to establish a regular sleep cycle. In fact, studies have shown a higher rate of cancer among people whose sleep/wake cycle is disrupted (like night shift workers).Teenagers should get eight to 10 hours of sleep, school-age children may need between 10 and 13 hours, and toddlers need between 11 and 14 hours of sleep.If you suffer from insomnia, the poor quality of sleep affects how you function during the day and can keep your body's immune system from properly fighting off disease., While no vaccine exists for the common cold, it may be available in the future.Fortunately, a flu vaccine is created every fall for the upcoming flu season. It's highly recommended that you get the vaccination to prevent getting the flu.Every fall, the Centers for Disease Control creates the annual flu vaccine based on the flu strains they believe will be prevalent that season. Getting the shot doesn't mean you won't get the flu, but it does reduce your chance of catching the flu.

, Get in the habit of not touching your eyes, nose or mouth. These are easy ways to spread germs. You should also clean and disinfect areas of your home that get a lot of use like the bathroom, kitchen, and door knobs.General recommendations, stay home until symptom free or 24 hours without fever. Not only will this give you a better chance to rest, but it may prevent the spread of disease to others., Many dietary supplements are not studied as rigorously as prescription medications, so there is little to no scientific proof that they work — most evidence is anecdotal. In addition, they are not regulated by the FDA.This means there is no assurance of the strength of the supplement or the purity of the ingredients, which can make it difficult to figure out proper dosage . As such, you should always discuss supplements with your doctor before you begin taking any.


Some supplements may interact negatively with other medications or even other supplements, which could potentially have life-threatening effects.It is possible to take too much of a supplement, including vitamins.
For example, let's consider zinc supplementation. For disease prevention, you should take 50mg of zinc a day. If you're already ill, take 150mg to 175mg in order to reduce the duration and severity of a cold. A major study showed that rates of pneumonia dropped significantly when zinc supplements were added to the study group's diet.Zinc is an essential trace element that your body needs to fight infection. Since zinc deficiency is widespread, it's important to add it to your diet.
You can also get zinc from eating oysters, lobster, beef, wheat germ, spinach, and nuts.

, Talk with your doctor about adding a specialized probiotic supplement to your diet. Probiotics are microorganisms naturally found in your intestines. Studies have shown that they can improve your immune system and may decrease the duration and severity of colds.While you can take oral probiotic supplements, the following are also good sources of probiotics:Sauerkraut, curtido, or kimchi
Kvass, kefir
Yogurt
Aged cheeses (like Roquefort or Gruyere)
Kombucha
Pickles
Miso

, Take 300mg of echinacea by mouth for one week if you're already feeling ill. While some believe that taking echinacea can prevent colds or the flu, other studies argue against its effectiveness.Another study has suggested that echinacea decreases the duration of a cold by half a day to four days.If you're unsure about whether to add echinacea, ask your doctor to advise you.

,


Good food sources of vitamin D include egg yolks, oily fish (such as salmon, tuna, and sardines), and fortified foods like milk, soy milk, and orange juice.Dietary recommendations for vitamin D intake for ages 9-70 years of age averages around 600 units per day.

, Though it has long been considered a ""must"" for boosting your immune system, there is actually insufficient evidence to prove that vitamin C prevents colds or improves your immune system.There is, however, some evidence to suggest that taking vitamin C while sick with the common cold can slightly decrease the duration of illness., Both the cold and flu can cause coughing, sore throat, and, in some cases, fever. Fever (over 100.4°F or 38 °C) as a cold symptom is more common in children, while fevers due to flu are usually greater than 101°F or 38.3°C. If you have a cold, you may also experience nasal congestion and runny nose. On the other hand, if you have the flu, you may notice body aches (myalgia), headaches, and shaking.The symptoms of a cold usually last one week on average. If they last longer or worsen, you may be developing a secondary infection like an ear infection, sinus infection, or bronchitis.

, The common cold is easily spread by coming into contact with infected mucous (passed orally or nasally). It only takes a few days for the disease to incubate, making it likely that adults will get approximately one cold a year, while children under two will get six colds a year. The flu is also spread through direct contact with infected secretions or airborne droplets that are passed through normal breathing or coughing. For example, you might get it by inhaling the disease around an infected person who's coughing.It is important for everyone to practice ""respiratory etiquette,"" which includes covering your mouth and nose with sneezing, excellent hand hygiene, and staying home when sick. Infected people should consider wearing a mask to prevent spreading the illness.
Flu season typically lasts from late fall through the end of winter.
You are at an increased risk of getting a cold if you are under physical or mental stress, or have a child or elderly adult who attends daycare or lives in a skilled nursing facility.

, If you have cold symptoms that worsen or don't improve after ten days, get a medical examination. You may be experiencing a secondary infection. If you have flu symptoms and are at risk for complications, you should see your doctor. Risk factors for flu complications include:Being over 50
Being under two
Being pregnant
Having a weakened immune system (from chemotherapy, HIV/AIDS, have received an organ transplant, or other medical treatments)
Having signs of pneumonia (such as labored breathing, chest pain, coughing up green or yellow mucus, and fever)"
"
Drink plenty of water.,
Try herbal teas, ginger ale or sports drinks.,
Drink some hot chicken broth.,
Try pain relievers and anti-inflammatory drugs.,
Try over the counter antihistamines and decongestants.,
Try gargling salt water to relieve the symptoms of a sore throat.,
Try zinc or vitamin C supplements within the first 24 hours of symptoms.,
Get a good night's sleep.,
Avoid exercise while you are sick.,
Avoid going out, to work, or to school while you are sick.",How to Recover from a Cold," It is important to stay hydrated while you have a cold. Staying hydrated will help to relieve congestion.
You will need to keep up your fluid intake while you are sick. Your body loses fluids during mucus production and from fevers.
Try to drink at least 8 to 10 glasses of water a day.;
, These are other alternatives to water. Hot drinks like herbal teas can help relieve the symptoms of a sore throat. The steam can help to reduce congestion temporarily as well.
Sports drinks help you replace lost sodium and electrolytes.
Ginger ale can help settle an upset stomach if you are experiencing that type of symptoms.
Try ginger brew, it removes the inflammation and cools down your nasal cavity and also soothes your throat.
Avoid drinks with caffeine and alcohol. These will cause further dehydration.

, This is a generations old home remedy, but scientists have recently discovered it has some proven benefits for relieving cold symptoms. Chicken broth can help to temporarily speed up the movement of mucus through the nose, relieving congestion.
Chicken broth can also act as an anti-inflammatory, reducing the inflammation in the nasal passages which leads to congestion.
You might try adding some cayenne pepper to the chicken broth. Spicy foods can also help to loosen up nasal congestion.

, These are available over the counter and can help to relieve some of the symptoms of a cold such as sore throat, headache, and fever. Common pain relievers are acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Follow the dosing instructions carefully.
Don't exceed the maximum dose in a 24 hour period.
Don't give acetaminophen to children under the age of 3 months old.
Avoid giving aspirin to kids recovering from flu-like symptoms. This causes a minimal risk for Reye's syndrome, a rare but life threatening condition.
Avoid over medicating. Taking too much acetaminophen can cause liver damage.

, These medications work differently to relieve cold symptoms. Decongestants work to relieve swelling in the nasal passages to allow mucus to drain.
Decongestants come in pill form or in nasal sprays.
Adults shouldn't use decongestant nasal sprays for more than a few days at a time. Prolonged use can damage mucus membranes.Children shouldn't use nasal sprays.
Antihistamines may relieve sneezing and runny noses from colds.
Antihistamines may cause drowsiness. Avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until you know how they will affect you.

, This can provide temporary relief from throat pain and scratchiness. Mix 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of salt into an 8 ounce glass of water.
Use warm water.
Gargle the water in the back of your throat. Repeat as necessary.

, Zinc supplements are a popular home remedy for recovering from and preventing colds. Zinc treatments are only shown to be effective if started within the first 24 hours of symptoms.
Studies are conflicting as to the extent of the benefits of zinc for reducing or shortening cold symptoms.
Zinc nasal sprays should be avoided. The FDA has linked at least 3 of these products to permanent or prolonged loss of smell.
If started at the onset of a cold, vitamin C might help to shorten the duration of a cold.
However, vitamin C won't help most people recover from a cold if started later.

, Getting enough rest can help you feel better and recover faster when you have a cold. Try to get at least 8-10 hours of sleep.
This is especially important during the first 72 hours of a cold.
Sleeping can be challenging when you have cold symptoms due to congestion.
Try running a humidifier in the room while you sleep. This can help keep your nasal passages moist and prevent further congestion.
You can also try drinking chamomile tea to help you sleep.
Over the counter sleep aids and antihistamines can also make you drowsy and help you sleep.

, You shouldn't exert yourself as you will become tired more quickly when you have a cold.Withhold exercise for at least 48-72 hours.
When you start exercise again, avoid intense workouts. Your body is just getting over a virus and needs to recuperate.
While you are sick, it can be helpful to get fresh air though. Try sitting outside if the weather is warm and you don't have allergies.

, Stay home and rest if possible. If you have a fever or a cough, it is best to avoid exposure to others.
If you are drowsy from medications, you should also stay home.
If you must go to school or work consider wearing a mask to prevent infecting others, especially if you work with or are near people who have chronic illnesses or compromised immune systems.

Learn the basic differences.,
Recognize the differences in reproduction.,
Determine whether the organism has a beneficial effect in the body.,
Determine whether the organism meets the criteria for life.,
Identify the bacterial and viral causes of common illnesses.,
Use this simple chart to learn the basic differences between bacteria and viruses.,
Look for the presence of a cell.,
Check the organism's size.,
Check for ribosomes (and no other organelles).,
Monitor the organism's reproductive cycle.",How to Know the Difference Between Bacteria and Viruses," There are key differences between bacteria and viruses in size, origins, and effects on the body.Viruses are the smallest and simplest life form; they are 10 to 100 times smaller than bacteria.
Bacteria are single-celled organisms that can live either inside or outside other cells. They can survive without a cellular host.Viruses, on the other hand, are only intracellular organisms, meaning that they infiltrate the host cell and live inside the cell. Viruses change the host cell's genetic material from its normal function to producing the virus itself.
Antibiotics cannot kill viruses, but can kill most bacteria, with the exception of bacteria that have become resistant to the antibiotic.Misuse and overuse of antibiotics have led to antibiotic resistance. Antibiotics are becoming less effective against potentially harmful bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria are highly resistant to treatment with antibiotics, but can be killed by some.;
, Viruses must have a living host to multiply, such as a plant or animal. Meanwhile, most bacteria can grow on non-living surfaces.Bacteria have all the ""machinery"" (cell organelles) needed for their growth and multiplication and usually reproduce asexually.
By contrast, viruses generally carry information - for example, DNA or RNA, packaged in a protein and/or membranous coat. They need the host cell's machinery to reproduce. The ""legs"" of a virus attach onto the surface of the cell and then the genetic material contained inside the virus is injected into the cell. Put differently, viruses are not really ""living"", but are essentially information (DNA or RNA) that float around until they encounter a sufficient host.

, Though it may seem hard to believe, many, many tiny organisms live within (but are distinct from) our bodies. In fact, in terms of pure number of cells, most people are roughly 90% microbial life and only 10% human cells.Many bacteria exist peacefully with our bodies; some even perform very important tasks, like making vitamins, breaking down waste, and making oxygen.For example, much of the process of digestion is done by a type of bacteria called ""gut flora."" These bacteria also help maintain pH balance in the body.While people are familiar with ""good bacteria"" (such as gut flora), there are also ""good"" viruses, such as bacteriophages, that ""hijack"" the bacteria's cellular mechanisms and cause cell death.Researchers from Yale have designed a virus that may help defeat brain tumors.Most viruses, however, have not been proven to perform any functions that are beneficial to humans. They typically only cause harm.

, Though there is no precise, formal definition of what constitutes life, scientists agree that bacteria are undoubtedly alive. On the other hand, viruses are a bit more like zombies: they're not dead, but they're definitely non-living. For example, viruses have some characteristics of life, like having genetic material, evolving over time through natural selection, and being able to reproduce by creating multiple copies of themselves. However, viruses don't have a cellular structure or their own metabolism; they need a host cell to reproduce. In other respects, viruses are basically non-living. Consider the following:


When they have not invaded another organism's cell, viruses are essentially dormant in every way. No biological processes occur within them. They can’t metabolize nutrients, produce or excrete wastes, or move around on their own. In other words, they are very similar to inanimate material. They can stay in this ""non-living"" state for long periods of time.When the virus comes in contact with a cell that it can invade, it latches on and a protein enzyme dissolves part of the cell wall so that it can inject its genetic material into the cell. At this point, as it hijacks the cell to make copies of itself, it starts to show one important characteristic of life: the ability to move its genetic material into future generations, producing more organisms that are like itself., If you are suffering from a disease and you know what it is, figuring out whether you are being affected by bacteria or a virus can be as simple as looking up information about your illness. Common illnesses caused by bacteria and viruses include:



Bacteria: Pneumonia, food poisoning (commonly caused by E. coli), meningitis, strep throat, ear infections, wound infections, gonorrhea.Viruses: influenza, chickenpox, the common cold, Hepatitis B, rubella, SARS, measles, Ebola, HPV, herpes, rabies, HIV (the virus that causes AIDS).
Note that some illnesses, like diarrhea and ""head colds,"" can be caused by either type of organism.
If you don't know what your illness is exactly, it is harder to tell the difference between bacteria and a virus because the symptoms for each can be difficult to distinguish. Both bacteria and viruses can cause nausea, vomiting, elevated temperatures, fatigue, and general malaise. The best (and sometimes only) way to determine whether you have a bacterial or viral infection is to see your doctor. Your doctor will perform lab tests to determine what kind of infection you have.
One way to confirm whether you have a virus or bacteria is to assess whether your current antibiotic treatments are effective. Antibiotics such as penicillin will only help if you have a bacterial infection, as opposed to a viral infection. This is why you should not take antibiotics unless your doctor has prescribed them.
Most viral infections and diseases, including the common cold, do not have cures, but there are anti-viral drugs that can often help manage or limit the symptoms and severity.

, Though there are more differences than the ones listed here, these are among the most important.

, In terms of structure, bacteria are more complex than viruses. Bacteria are what is known as unicellular. This means that each bacteria is made up of only one cell. By contrast, the human body contains many trillions of cells.Viruses, on the other hand, do not have any cells. Viruses are made up of a protein structure called a capsid.Though this capsid contains the virus's genetic material, it lacks the features of a true cell, such as cell walls, transport proteins, cytoplasm, organelles, and so on.In other words, if you see a cell through the microscope, you know you're looking at bacteria and not a virus.

, One of the quickest ways to tell the difference between a bacterium and a virus is to determine whether you can see it with a regular microscope. If you can see it, it is not a virus. The average virus is about 10 to 100 times smaller than run-of-the-mill bacteria. They are so small that you cannot see a virus under a normal microscope, only its effects on cells. You need an electron or other extremely high-powered microscope to see viruses.Bacteria are nearly always far bigger than viruses. In fact, the very biggest viruses are only just as big as the very smallest bacteria.Bacteria tend to have dimensions of one to several micrometers (1000+ nanometers).By contrast, most viruses have sizes of less than 200 nanometers, which means you won't be able to see them with most everyday microscopes.

, While bacteria have cells, they are not complex ones. Bacteria lack a nucleus and any organelles except for ribosomes.You can spot ribosomes by looking for small, simple organelles. In cell drawings, they are usually represented as dots or circles.By contrast, viruses lack all organelles, including ribosomes. In fact, besides the outer protein capsid, some simple protein enzymes, and genetic material in the form of DNA/RNA, there is not much else in the structure of most viruses.

, Bacteria and viruses aren't like most animals. They don't need to have sex or exchange genetic information with other organisms of the same type to reproduce. However, this is not to say that bacteria and viruses have the same reproductive strategies.


Bacteria practice asexual reproduction. To reproduce, a bacteria replicates its own DNA, elongates, and splits into two daughter cells. Each daughter cell gets one copy of the DNA, making them clones (exact copies). You can usually watch this process occur under a microscope.Each daughter cell will grow and eventually divide into two more cells. Depending on the species of bacteria and the external conditions, bacteria can multiply very rapidly this way. You can watch this process occur under a microscope and in this way tell a bacterium from a regular cell.
Viruses, in contrast, can't reproduce on their own. Instead, they invade other cells and use their internal machinery to make new viruses.Eventually, so many viruses are made that the invaded cell bursts open and dies, releasing the new viruses.

Recognize the symptoms.,
Keep in mind that many people do not show symptoms.One of the major challenges of recognizing a Zika infection is that most infected people have no symptoms at all.

,
Consider timing.,
See a doctor for a blood test.",How to Recognize Zika1," Zika symptoms are often mild and they only last for around a few days to one week. Symptoms of the Zika infection may include:Fever
Nausea and/or vomiting
Headache
Muscle and joint pain
Red eyes (conjunctivitis) and/or pain behind the eyes
A rash;
,, The Zika virus is transmitted by a bite from the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is the same type of mosquito that can also carry Dengue Fever and Yellow Fever.The time-frame for developing symptoms is usually three to 12 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito.If you develop symptoms of Zika, they will occur within this time-frame. However, keep in mind that a lack of symptoms does not mean that you do not have Zika.

, The only sure way to determine if you have Zika is to have a blood test. Zika has symptoms that are similar to dengue fever and chikungunya, so even a doctor cannot diagnose you without performing a blood test."

Be aware of life-threatening severe symptoms.",How to Prevent and Prepare for H1N1 (Swine Flu)," In order to maintain optimal health and well-being, you should make sure you're getting enough sleep. Quantity and quality of sleep is intrinsically connected to our physical and mental health. Sleep has an essential restorative effect on our body and, in fact, a lack of adequate sleep is linked to impaired immune function. During the third phase of the sleep cycle, our bodies' natural T and B lymphocytes (a form of white blood cell) produce “cytokines,” chemicals which target and kill viruses and bacteria.Research has determined that ideally people should get between seven and eight hours of uninterrupted sleep per night; those who sleep less or more than the recommended amount were may be a greater risk for the development of adverse medical conditions and diseases.;
, Medical experts and researchers recommend doing aerobic exercise (exercise that gets your heart rate up and makes you sweat) at least three times per week in increments of 30 minutes. Aerobic is defined as working in such a manner as to achieve your target heart rate for this period. Some of the best and most enjoyable aerobic exercises include running, cycling, and swimming.


To calculate your target heart rate for aerobic exercise, subtract your age from 220 and multiply by .70.For example, if you are 20 years old, your target heart rate would be 140. You check this while exercising, by placing your index and middle finger into the groove of your neck and feeling for your carotid pulse and counting the number of beats for one minute.
Pick an exercise you enjoy. If you like what you're doing, you're more likely to continue with the regimen.

, Currently, we are discovering more and more the value of phytonutrients in preventing illness, both in preventing free radical cellular damage to increasing immunity through immune mechanisms and production of cytokines that ward of viral and bacterial invaders. Eat three balanced meals a day, including plenty of fruits and vegetables, complex carbohydrates, and protein. Follow the guidelines at United States Department of Agriculture to make sure you are getting the essential vitamins, nutrients, and minerals your body and mind need to stay alert and healthy and keep your immune system strong. A diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables containing Vitamins A and C as well as zinc is recommended to ward off viral infections like influenza.Eat a healthy breakfast. Breakfast really is the most important meal of the day, so take the time to eat healthy carbs like oatmeal, proteins like lean turkey or ham, and a healthy portion of fruits and vegetables.
Make time for healthy snacks that will keep your energy high throughout the day. Carry an apple, banana, or bag of almonds. Avoid snacks that will make you feel unhealthy and lethargic, like a sugary snack or a soda.
Minimize your caffeine and sugar intake. Caffeine and sugar may give you a temporary boost but often result in energy and mood crashes later on.

, Obesity has been found to be an independent risk factor for contraction of the HINI virus.Whether someone is overweight or obese is determined by using the body mass index (BMI), an indicator of body fatness. BMI is a person's weight in kilograms (kg) divided by the square of the person's height in meters (m). A BMI of 25-29.9 is considered overweight, while a BMI greater than 30 is considered obese.To lose weight, reduce the number of calories you intake and increase the amount of exercise you do. This is the best way to lose weight. Always be sure to consult your physician and potentially also a registered nutritionist before beginning any weight loss or diet-and-exercise program.
You can also make a concerted effort to watch portion sizes and to eat slowly and stop when you're full.
Note that if you're eating healthily and exercising but are still gaining weight, it may be a good idea to have a physical to rule out any hormonal abnormality that is affecting your metabolism.

, Consider taking some vitamin and mineral supplements in order to boost your immune system, particularly in the winter, which is the height of flu season. Good options include:



Vitamin D - Vitamin D plays a significant role in immune function. Take 2000 mg every day. This is especially important for those who live in cold weather regions, where snow and darker days keeps them from receiving adequate Vitamin D from the sunshine.

Vitamin C - Vitamin C has been shown to play a key role in our bodies' ability to fight infection. Dietary sources of Vitamin C, such as fruits and vegetables, are ideal, although it can be difficult to find fresh produce in the winter months in some regions. Consider taking a supplement of 1000 mg per day; this is the recommended minimum. If you feel like you are coming down with a cold, research indicates that 2000 mg can have an even greater benefit in reducing not only the duration but also the severity of symptoms.Zinc - Zinc is an essential trace element and we know that it assists your body in combating infection. For example, in one study in which zinc supplementation was added to the diet of the study group, the rates of pneumonia dropped considerably.Zinc can be hard to get from your diet but can be obtained from oysters, lobster, beef, wheat germ, spinach, and cashews. In addition, consider taking a supplement of 50 mg for general wellness and disease. When you're ill, you can take a higher dosage of 150 to 175 mg.
Be sure to consult your doctor before taking supplements, as they can sometimes interact with other medications.

, If you sneeze, keep a disposable tissue in front of your mouth, and after sneezing or blowing your nose, throw the tissue away. If you don't have tissues, try sneezing into your elbow; avoid sneezing into your hands as this can transmit germs. As a general rule, avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth; this will stop the spread of germs.Wash your hands often, especially if after blowing your nose/sneezing, before you eat, and having been outside (e.g., taking public transit, touching door handles, etc.). Use a disinfectant when possible or just use soap and water.
Don't share utensils or drinks. This can contribute to the spread of disease, especially if the other person is ill.

, Specific preventive tactics are somewhat limited since the Center for Disease Control (CDC) cannot forecast the next seasonal flu strain until approximately six months prior to flu season (October through April or May) for the year in question. However, the CDC does recommend getting the flu shot as a preventive measure in anticipation of flu season. The CDC recommends anyone over 6 months of age get vaccinated. People over 65, those with chronic illness, pregnant women and the obese are at higher risk of contracting the flu and experiencing complications.H1N1 is one of the viruses included in the flu shot.
If you were previously vaccinated for swine flu in the past, this doesn't matter. You will need to be vaccinated every year. The virus mutates rapidly, so while you are immune to last year's strain, you won't be immune to the mutated strain this year.

, Influenza is spread via a “respiratory droplet” or contact with an infected person’s respiratory secretions, meaning when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and those secretions have contact with others. We do not absorb the H1N1 virus through the skin, but we often touch our nose or mouth and can then become infected. Step up your hand-washing during flu season. Wash frequently with soap and water, especially after coming into contact with others or being in public. If you come across someone else who is ill and has the flu, wash your hands immediately.Avoid getting infected by or infecting others by limiting hand-to-hand contact and other ways of transmitting germs (coughing into the air or inadvertently onto others, sharing utensils and drinks, etc.).
You can also use alcohol-based sanitizer to clean your hands after touching doors, shopping carts, handling money, or other situations where others may have contaminated the object or space with infected secretions. Studies have shown that hand sanitizer can be effective and help decrease the spread of H1N1., Face masks and respirators may help prevent some exposure to flu viruses. However, face masks should be used along with other preventive measures, such as frequent hand washing.Masks are primarily useful if you are going to the doctor’s office for a non-flu related visit during flu season as there were will likely be many sick people who are coughing and sneezing in the office. They are also useful if you have a serious chronic condition that makes you immuno-compromised, such as cancer.

, If you do feel symptoms of influenza coming on during the season, it is best to see your doctor for proper medical treatment within 48 hours. The drugs Relenza or Tamiflu are both effective in reducing the duration and intensity of symptoms if started within 48 hours of symptoms.

, The symptoms of H1N1 are very similar to those of the common flu and include fever (greater than 100°F or 37.8°C), cough, sore throat, body aches, headache, chills and fatigue. Diarrhea and vomiting can also be symptoms of H1N1. There's no way to tell if you have the swine flu unless a respiratory specimen is taken within the first four to five days and sent to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (or equivalent).Note that vomiting is more common in children and that diarrhea is only seen in 17% of patients.

, Pandemics can rouse panic, so it's important that you know some basic information about what could happen and how you can prepare for it.A vaccine for pandemic flu has been released in limited quantities; as a result, you may have to wait in long lines to receive the vaccine. This is why you should try to get it as early in the year as you can, once it becomes available to the public.
People will have little or no immunity to pandemic flu since it is a new virus to humans. With seasonal flu, people have some immunity built up from previous exposure to the viruses.
If a pandemic flu virus spreads rapidly, being prepared to stay at home will help slow down the virus because you'll minimize your exposure to infection (and other people's exposure to you, if you become sick)., Store non-perishable foods, bottled water, over-the-counter drugs, health supplies and other necessities. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recommends having a two-week supply. These supplies can be useful in other types of emergencies, such as power outages. Have basic, over-the-counter health supplies such as a thermometer, facemasks, tissues, soap, hand sanitizers, medicine to relieve fever, and cold medicine., Think about, anticipate and plan for what you will do in the following cases:Schools are dismissed: Consider childcare needs. Plan home learning activities and exercises. Have materials, such as books, on hand. As for students, take valuable items from lockers, such as iPods and textbooks. If the school is closed, you wouldn't want such items left behind.
You or family member becomes sick and requires care: Plan to stay home for at least 10 days when you are sick with pandemic flu. Staying home will keep you from infecting others. Make sure others in your household also stay home when they are sick. During a severe pandemic, stay home—even if you're not infected—if someone in your household is sick with pandemic flu. Make plans for how to care for people with special needs in case the services they rely on are not available.
Transportation networks are disrupted: Think about how you can rely less on public transportation during a pandemic as this typically is a time when you have considerable contact with potentially contaminated surfaces and people and thus risk infection. For example, store food and other essential supplies to reduce shopping trips. Consider other ways to get to work or, if you can, work at home.

, Ask your employer about how business will continue during a pandemic. The U.S. Department of Health & Human Services offers a Business Pandemic Influenza Planning Checklist; or you can Develop a Risk Management Plan that accounts for the possibility of a flu pandemic. Find out if you can work from home, or if your employer will consider virtualizing the workforce. Plan for the possible reduction or loss of income if you are unable to work or your place of employment is closed. Check with your employer or union about leave policies.


Reduce exposure at work by using virtual workforce technologies. Use email, web conferencing and Pixetell enhanced documents to maintain effective business interactions without shaking so many hands.

, Identify sources you can count on for reliable information. If a pandemic occurs, having good information from reputable and knowledgeable sources will be critical. Reliable, accurate, and timely information is available at PandemicFlu.gov and at the World Health Organization's swine flu webpage.


Telephone sources include the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Hotline at 1-800-CDC-INFO (1-800-232-4636). This line is available in English and Spanish, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. TTY: 1-888-232-6348. If you do not live in the U.S., check if there is an equivalent hotline in your area.
Look for information on your local and state government websites. Review your state's planning efforts and those of your local public health and emergency preparedness officials.
Listen to local and national radio, watch news reports on television, and read your newspaper and other sources of printed and web-based information.

, Do not go to the hospital or doctor, or else you might spread the virus to other patients. Call your doctor first, explain that you think you might have the swine flu, and follow any instructions you are given. Read the CDC guidelines on care; in most cases, the flu should pass in about 10 days. However, there are a number of conditions whereby infected people should seek emergency care as soon as possible, including if they are:Exceptionally ill with flu-like symptoms
Chronically ill
Immune-suppressed
Elderly or very young (under two years of age)

, These more severe symptoms are an indication of flu complications. If you experience any of the following, you should get emergency medical care:Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
Pain or pressure in the chest or abdomen
Sudden dizziness
Confusion
Severe or persistent vomiting
Note that emergency warning signs in children are different and include: fast breathing or trouble breathing, bluish skin color, not drinking enough fluids, lethargy, not waking up or interacting, increased irritability, fever with a rash.

Be aware of potential complications of Zika.The biggest risk of a Zika infection is not the infection, it is the potential complications that can develop as a result of the infection.,
Recognize symptoms of GBS.GBS has been linked as a potential complication of the Zika virus, but there is not yet a proven link between the two.,
Watch for signs of microcephaly in newborns.Microcephaly in newborns has also been linked to the Zika infection in pregnant women (who then pass it on to their fetus in the womb).,
Keep in mind that there is no cure or vaccine for Zika.However, GBS is treatable, so see a doctor as soon as possible if you think you have GBS.",How to Recognize Zika2," Although complications only develop in a small minority of people, they can be severe. The two main complications that are suspected to be linked to the Zika virus are:


Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), which is a neurological condition that can lead to potential paralysis.
Microcephaly, which is a birth defect that develops when women who are pregnant become infected with Zika. Infants born with microcephaly have an abnormally small head and may have developmental delays as well. Some infants may even die as a result of this birth defect.

, Still, it is important to know the signs and symptoms of GBS if you have Zika. GBS is an autoimmune disorder that may occur following a viral infection such as Zika. It affects your nervous system by damaging the nerve coverings. Symptoms include:Numbness in the lower extremities such as the feet, lower legs, and hands
Difficulty moving
Numbness and/or paralysis that gradually moves upwards
Difficult breathing if the paralysis moves to the chest area

, Microcephaly refers to an abnormally small head. This condition can lead to developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and, in severe cases, it may even lead to death.


When your baby is born, the doctors will take routine measurements of head circumference (both at birth, as well as at progressive intervals throughout your baby's growth). It is through abnormally small head circumference measurements that a doctor may diagnose your baby with microcephaly.
Microcephaly is defined as a head circumference of less than 42cm at full growth.Doctors can use age-based growth charts to determine whether your baby's head circumference fits into the normal range at each developmental stage.
If your baby is diagnosed microcephaly, it may be a sign that you have recently been infected with the Zika virus.

, Microcephaly cannot be treated, but there are support strategies that may help your child reach as many developmental milestones as possible.

Undress a bit.,
Set the temperature to a comfortable level.,
Cool yourself down with water.,
Take over-the-counter medications.,
Get plenty of rest.",How to Get Rid of a Fever1," Although you might feel cold when you have a fever, your body temperature is actually too high, and you will need to lower it in order to feel warmer. Allow your body to release excess heat by wearing only a thin layer of clothing and covering up with a thin blanket or sheet if necessary.Piling on sweatshirts and blankets can actually be dangerous if you have a fever because it can raise your body temperature even more.;
, Keeping the room temperature excessively high may prevent your body from releasing its excess heat, but your room should also not be too cold. Shivering is your body's way of naturally increasing its internal temperature, so if your room is so cold that you are shivering, you will only be making your fever worse.If your room is hot and stuffy, open a window or turn on a fan.

, Dampening your skin is a great way to lower your body temperature, but you should make sure that you are careful not to make yourself too cold. Apply a damp towel to your forehead and extremities or sponge yourself down with some warm water. The water should always be lukewarm to prevent your body from shivering in response.Sponge baths are ideal for children who have a fever.
You may have read that applying rubbing alcohol to the skin can help reduce a fever, but the alcohol can be absorbed into the skin, leading to alcohol poisoning, so stick with water!

, If your fever is making you uncomfortable, you can take over-the-counter fever reducers, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen. Make sure to follow dosing instructions carefully.Acetaminophen can help reduce fever as well as the aches and other side effects in the body. If you have any liver problems, do not take acetaminophen without talking to your doctor first.
Aspirin can also be used to reduce fevers in adults, but it should never be given to children, as it has been linked to a serious disease called Reye's syndrome.Keep in mind that these medications might make you feel better, but they will not treat the underlying cause of your fever. If you suspect that you have some kind of bacterial infection, it is extremely important that you see your doctor and take all of your prescribed medications.

, Help your body in its battle by getting extra sleep and spending as much time lounging around as you can. This does not mean that you have to stay in bed all day, but try to avoid exerting yourself.Staying home from school or work is probably a good idea, both because you need your rest, and because you want to avoid passing on a contagious virus or bacterial infection to your classmates or coworkers.

Stay hydrated.,
Eat right.,
Try a liquid diet.",How to Get Rid of a Fever2," A fever can easily cause you to become dehydrated, which can lead to various other symptoms. You will feel better and increase your body's ability to fight off your illness if you drink plenty of fluids.The amount of water your body needs will depend upon many different factors, including your weight and activity level. Most people should drink between nine and 13 cups of water each day.Water is best, but you can also drink juices, diluted sports drinks (1 part water to 1 part sports dink), or an oral electrolyte solution like Pedialyte.

, Eating foods that are rich in nutrients and easy for your body to digest will help you stay strong and fight off illnesses. Try to eat plenty of fruits and vegetables and avoid junk food.Lean proteins and healthy fats from sources such as olive oil are very important.
Eating foods that naturally contain probiotics, such as yogurt, may help your body fight off illness.
You can also try supplementing your diet with multivitamins for general health, or with Vitamin C and Omega-3 fatty acids for immune strength and decreased inflammation. Be sure to discuss all supplements with your doctor, especially if you are taking any medications.

, You don't have to stick to an entirely liquid diet, but try incorporating more liquid foods into your diet in order to promote hydration and easy digestion. Popsicles and soups are two great options."
"
Drink infused tea.,
Take homeopathic medicines.",How to Get Rid of a Fever3," There are many herbs that are believed to help your body fight off infection and reduce inflammation. Try buying a tea with beneficial ingredients, or creating your own infused tea by steeping whole herbs in water or mixing in powdered herbs. The following ingredients are all thought to be beneficial when you have a fever:Green tea
Cat's claw
Reishi mushroom
Milk thistle
Andrographis

, For fevers that don't require antibiotics or other medical attention, you may want to try treating your symptoms with homeopathic remedies. Even though these medicines are natural, you should check with your doctor to make sure they are safe for you, especially if you are taking other medications. The following ingredients are sold as natural fever remedies:Aconitum
Apis mellifica
Belladonna
Bryonia
Ferrum Phosphoricum
Gelsemium

Assess your symptoms.,
Take antibiotics.,
Know when a fever is too high.,
Get treatment for chronic conditions.,
Get immediate treatment for fevers caused by environmental factors.",How to Get Rid of a Fever4," In order to determine the best way to get rid of your fever, it is important to know what is causing it. Make note of all the symptoms you are experiencing. If you have any symptoms that cannot be explained by a common virus, such as a sore throat or earache, see a doctor for a diagnosis.Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms such as confusion, difficulty moving or breathing, blue lips or nails, seizures, stiff neck, or severe headaches.
A high fever in a child can trigger a febrile seizure, which is usually harmless and generally does not indicate a more serious health problem; however, you should take your child to the doctor as soon as possible following her first febrile seizure. Call an ambulance if the seizure lasts longer than a few minutes. Otherwise, drive your child to the emergency room as soon as the seizure is over., If you are diagnosed with a bacterial infection, such as strep throat or a urinary tract infection, your doctor will prescribe an antibiotic medication to help treat it. Take your medication as directed and your fever, along with your other symptoms, should disappear within a few days.Don't take antibiotics if you have a virus, such as the flu or a common cold. The medication will not be effective in treating the virus.
Take your antibiotics as prescribed until they are gone —even if you start feeling better. This ensures you truly eradicate the bacteria and prevents antibiotic resistance in the future.

, Fevers are usually nothing to worry about, but they can be dangerous if they run too high or if they persist for too long. Seek medical attention right away if you are worried that you or your child might have a fever that is too high.For children three months and younger, seek medical treatment for a fever of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher.
For children between three and 12 months of age, seek medical treatment for a fever of 102.2°F (39°C) or higher.
For older children and adults, seek medical treatment for a fever of 105°F (40.6°C) or higher that does not readily subside with treatment.
A prolonged fever over 107.6°F (42°C) can cause the body to start shutting down and may lead to brain damage if not treated.
You should also seek medical treatment for any fever that persists for longer than 48 to 72 hours, or longer than 24 to 48 hours for children under the age of two.

, Fevers can also be caused by chronic autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, such as lupus, vasculitis, and ulcerative colitis. The best way to treat these kinds of fevers is to work with your doctor to create a plan for treating your underlying condition.If you have any chronic medical conditions, you should contact your doctor whenever you get a fever.
A fever may also be the first sign of a serious disease, such as cancer, so be sure to see a doctor if you have a persistent fever.

, If you experience a fever after exposure to extreme heat, you may be suffering from hyperthermia or heat stroke. In this case, your body needs to be cooled down as quickly as possible.Other symptoms of hyperthermia include weakness, nausea, confusion, dizziness, and an altered mental state.
People with hyperthermia usually need to be treated at a hospital, so get emergency medical help right away.
While waiting for medical treatment, you can attempt to lower your body temperature by removing excess clothing, applying cold water to your skin, moving to a cool, well-ventilated location, and drinking lots of cool fluids.

Wash your hands.,
Cover your nose and mouth.,
Steer clear of crowds.,
Sanitize shared spaces.,
Clean the places you use the most often.,
Maintain good oral health.",How to Prevent a Cold or the Flu1," One of the easiest and most effective measures to prevent colds and the flu is by washing your hands thoroughly and frequently.This reduces the proliferation of bacteria and the cold or flu virus from common spaces or surfaces.Make sure you wet your hands before applying soap to your hands. Scrub your hands vigorously for 20 seconds, making sure to get under your nails, between your fingers, and the front and back of your hands.Rinse your hands under running water and dry them on a clean towel.Rub on a hand sanitizer if you can’t locate any soap and water.;
, Put your hand or tissue over both your nose and mouth whenever you cough or sneeze.Covering sneezes and coughs minimizes the risk of spreading your germs and the viruses.


Consider coughing or sneezing into the crook of your elbow, which may help avoid contaminating your hands and spreading germs to others.
Throw away the used tissue immediately and then wash your hands.You may also want to wash your hands after coughing or sneezing into them.

, The cold and flu are very contagious and generally spread where crowds of people congregate. Steering clear of crowds or packed spaces may minimize your risk of contracting either virus.Wash your hands after touching surfaces in crowded places. Door handles (especially restroom door handles), for example, are surfaces on which cold and flu viruses can linger.
If you feel ill, stay home for at least a day to reduce your risk of spreading your cold or flu to others, or making your case worse by catching something else.Avoid touching your face, especially your mouth, nose, and eyes.
Choose a daycare for your child that has clear policies on keeping sick children at home and exhibits good hygiene practices., The cold and flu viruses can spread easily on shared surfaces and spaces, especially in bathrooms and kitchens. Disinfecting these areas can help prevent the cold and flu viruses from spreading..


Focus cleaning on common spaces such as the toilet, bathroom sink, kitchen counters, and the kitchen sink. Disinfect door handles, too.
Use any type of surface disinfectant available commercially, though you may want one that provides broad protection against different strains of viruses, germs, and bacteria such as Lysol.

, These include your bedroom, kitchen, dining room, sitting room and bathrooms.

, A lack of proper oral hygiene can make it easier for microbes to enter the body. ."
"
Get vaccinated.,
Recognize that there is no cold vaccine.,
Avoid contact with sick individuals.,
Use your own items.,
Try alternative medicines.",How to Prevent a Cold or the Flu2," Although there is no cure for the flu, you can get vaccinated against the virus every year. This can strengthen your immunity against the condition during cold and flu season. Speak to your doctor about whether getting the flu vaccination is a good option for you.


You must get the flu vaccine every year. Your vaccine from the previous year does not carry over into the new flu season.
Anyone from the ages of six months to those over 65 years of age can receive a flu vaccine.(Over 65 can take Pneumococcal vaccine (Pneumovax) as well, which will vaccinate against Pneumonia.)
Be aware that some soreness is normal at the injection site.You may also be able to get the vaccine in the form of a nasal spray. Unlike the shot, this actually delivers a weakened version of the virus to your body, so you must have a strong and healthy immune system to use the nasal spray. If you are going through chemotherapy or are immunocompromised (from an organ transplant or a disease like HIV), you are ineligible for the spray.In addition, if you are regularly around someone who is immunocompromised, you should not use the spray.
Report any side effects such as fever, soreness or body aches to your doctor, especially if they are persistent.Obtain a copy of the Vaccine Information Statement. Anyone who gets a flu shot must receive a copy of this statement, which explains the type of vaccine you received as well as how it keeps you safe and eliminates flu epidemics., Unlike influenza, there is no vaccine for the common cold. The best way to prevent it is by adopting good hygiene habits and taking care of your overall health.Maintain a healthy diet, exercise regularly, wash your hands and so on.

, Try and avoid close and/ or prolonged contact with anyone you know has a cold or who exhibits signs of a cold. This may keep any bacteria or virus from invading your system and getting you sick.Try and kindly excuse yourself from situations with sick persons. For example, if a friend or colleague is speaking with you or wants to go out, simply say something like, “I’m so sorry, I need to excuse myself because I have a prior commitment.”
If the sick person lives with you, try and not share the same space as long as the person is sick.

, Make sure to not share items with anyone who is sick. This can minimize the risk of bacteria or virus invading your system.Consider using disposable utensils such as cups and forks while someone in your home is sick.
Label items to minimize the risk of contamination.
Wash any utensils about which you are unsure using hot water or, preferably, a dishwasher., Some people believe in the benefits of alternative medicine to prevent and relieve colds and the flu. Although there is no definitive scientific evidence that vitamin C, Echinacea, or zinc can prevent or relieve a cold or the flu, you may find these remedies work for you.


Despite popular myths to the contrary, there isn’t much evidence that taking Vitamin C can prevent a cold or nip one in the bud.Taking Echinacea at the first sign of a cold may decrease the severity and duration of your symptoms.Studies on Zinc have shown that it can reduce symptoms of a cold if taken within a day of symptoms starting.Avoid intranasal zinc, which may permanently damage your sense of smell."

Keep your body hydrated.,
Sip chicken soup.,
Avoid alcohol and cigarettes.,
Soothe your throat with saltwater.,
Use lozenges or sprays.,
Take pain medication.,
Get enough rest.",How to Prevent a Cold or the Flu3," Drink enough fluids to replace any you through a fever or producing mucus.Keeping yourself hydrated can help you feel better and minimize the risk of getting more sick.Women need at least nine cups of liquid daily to keep their bodies hydrated, while men need at least 13.Have water, juice, broth, or non-caffeinated sodas or teas.Stay away from caffeinated drinks including coffee and tea because they can dehydrate you and exacerbate symptoms., Studies now show that the longtime home remedy of chicken soup can help keep a cold at bay and relieve symptoms.Sipping chicken soup may help you nip a cold in the bud or help minimize your symptoms of a cold and flu.Even the steam from the hot soup can help alleviate symptoms.


Eat chicken soup to help relieve the congestion that accompanies cold and the flu.Chicken soup can prevent dehydration.Be aware that chicken soup acts as an anti-inflammatory to your system. It also temporarily increases movement of mucus through the nose, which in turn limits the amount of time the virus is in the lining of your nose., Alcohol and tobacco products may make a cold or the flu worse. Eliminating or limiting these products may reduce the duration of your symptoms and help prevent complications., Gargling with a simple saline solution may help a sore throat.Although the benefits are temporary, you can use this remedy as often as you need it to combat inflammation.Dissolve 1/2 a teaspoon of salt in an 8 oz. glass of warm water to make the saline solution.
Swish a mouthful of saltwater for 30 seconds at least twice a day. This can also help relieve any inflammation in your throat related to the cold or flu., Mild analgesics can relieve a sore throat. Products such as lozenges and sprays containing eucalyptus or camphor can also relieve any cold- or flu-related congestion.Use throat lozenges or apply sprays every two to three hours.Avoid chewing or swallowing throat lozenges because they can numb your throat and cause swallowing difficulties., You may have body aches with a cold or the flu. Take an over the counter medication to help relieve any pain, which may also help you relax and more quickly recover from a cold or the flu.


Take acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or naproxen sodium to relieve body aches.

, Making sure that you allow your body to rest can relieve your symptoms and help you more quickly recover from a cold or the flu. Stay home from work or school, especially if you have a fever. Getting enough rest also minimizes the risk of you infecting family members, friends, or colleagues.Get at least 8 hours of sleep per night and take naps, which can help your immune system fight any developing cold or flu viruses.Sleep in a bedroom that is comfortable, warm, and slightly humid (use a humidifier) to help relieve congestion and coughing."
"
Reach for fluids.,
Make the fluids warm.,
Try saltwater.,
Consider steam — in some cases.",How to Stop Coughing in 5 Minutes1," As with any illness, staying hydrated is your first line of defense against coughing. If your cough stems from a dry throat, a little hydration might be all you need. Even if your cough is caused by something else, drinking plenty of fluids is never a bad idea.If your throat is raw or irritated from coughing, be sure to avoid beverages that might irritate it further, such as acidic juices like orange juice.
Be careful with dairy, too. While the notion that milk makes more mucus is a myth, milk — particularly whole milk — might coat your throat and make you feel as though you have more phlegm. On the other hand, if your cough is caused by irritation or dryness, cold dairy products might be soothing.When in doubt, always choose water.;
, For certain coughs, such as ones caused by congestion or sinus drainage, warm liquids can be even more effective than cold or room temperature ones.


Whether it’s the perennial favorite of herbal tea with honey or just hot water with lemon, “ny warm liquid can help break up mucus in your airways,” according to the American Lung Association’s chief medical officer., Particularly in cases of cold- or flu-related coughs, salt water is your friend.


Either gargling with salt water or using a saline-based nasal spray can help kill the viruses or bacteria causing the postnasal drip that’s making you cough along with giving some short-term relief by flushing mucus out of your throat.

, Conventional wisdom often dictates that steam from a shower or a humidifier can help combat a cough; however, that’s only the case if your cough is due to dry air.


If you’re coughing because of congestion, asthma, dust mites, or mold, among other causes, moist air could actually make your cough worse."
"
Stay upright.,
Keep the air clean.,
Keep the air still.,
Try breathing exercises.",How to Stop Coughing in 5 Minutes2," Being horizontal can cause mucus to drain into your throat.


When sleeping with a cough, for example, you should prop up your head with pillows to prevent sinus drainage from pooling in your throat, causing you to cough., Stay away from dirty air, including cigarette smoke.Particulates in the air could either be the source of your cough or worsen one that has other causes.


Strong fragrances, such as perfumes, can cause some people to cough, even if they’re not irritating to others., Avoid wind, ceiling fans, heaters, and air conditioners, because moving air can make coughs worse.Many cough sufferers believe that blowing air makes their cough worse, either by further drying their airways or by producing additional tickling sensations likely to trigger a cough.

, While most breathing exercises are aimed at those with chronic conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, they can be used by anyone struggling with a cough.


You can try “controlled coughing” or “pursed lip breathing,” among other techniques. In pursed lip breathing, for example, you begin by taking a deep breath through your nose and counting to two. Then, while pursing your lips as if you’re about to whistle, you slowly exhale to the count of four."
"
Reach for the medicine.,
Sooth your throat.,
Try menthol products.,
Know when to see the doctor.",How to Stop Coughing in 5 Minutes3," If your cough persists, consider trying anti-cough medicines.


Cough medicines usually combine two ingredients: an expectorant, which loosens mucus, and a suppressant, which blocks the cough reflex. Check the labels to pick the one that’s best for your cough.Your doctor may be able to prescribe a cough syrup containing codeine, which can be a very effective cough suppressant. Be sure to follow the dosage instructions exactly as outlined by your doctor, as codeine has the potential to become habit-forming.

, Consider sucking on throat lozenges, eating frozen treats (such as popsicles), or gargling with salt water to sooth your throat if your cough has inflamed it.Many cough medicines contain a mild anesthetic to decrease the cough reflex. Likewise, cold items, such as popsicles, are thought to work by temporarily numbing the throat., Whether in the form of lozenges, ointments, or vapors, menthol has been shown to alleviate coughing.Menthol raises the ""cough threshold,"" which that in increases the severity of sensations necessary to trigger a cough., If your cough is accompanied by shortness of breath, bloody mucus, severe pain, or a fever above 100.4°F (38°C) among other severe symptoms, consider seeing a doctor."
"
Keep yourself hydrated.Staying properly hydrated while sick helps your body to continue functioning properly.,
Get plenty of rest.,
Limit the amount of physical activity you do while you have bronchitis.,
Use a humidifier.Turn the humidifier on at night and sleep with it running.,
Avoid irritants.,
Take cough medicine only when needed.An over-the-counter cough syrup should only be used if the cough becomes so disruptive that it interferes with your daily life.,
Use an expectorant.,
Do some research on herbal remedies.",How to Get Rid of Bronchitis1," You should drink 8-oz (250 ml) of fluid every one to two hours.


Staying hydrated helps to loosen congestion and maintain proper bodily functions.If your doctor has restricted your fluid intake due to other medical complications, you should follow his or her instructions concerning hydration.
Much of this fluid should be water or other low-calorie drinks to prevent yourself from taking in too many calories.
Clear broth, diluted sports drinks, and warm lemon water with honey are other good options. Warm drinks have the additional benefit of soothing throats that are sore from excessive coughing.
Do not consume drinks with caffeine or alcohol. These drinks are diuretics and cause dehydration.;
, Strive to get as much sleep as possible. You should aim to get at least seven hours of sleep per night, but if your illness prevents you from sleeping through the night, you should at least rest by lying with your head down or propped up.


Sleep is a vital part of maintaining strong immune function.Without enough rest, your body will be unable to fight the virus.

, Basic tasks are usually fine, but you should avoid moderate or active exercise. This degree of activity can trigger coughing fits and wear away at your body's immune system.

, Breathing in warm, moist air will loosen mucus in the airways, making it easier to breathe and reducing the severity of your coughs.


Clean the humidifier based on the manufacturer's instructions. If you fail to clean the humidifier, bacteria and fungi can grow inside the water container and distribute itself in the air. Bacteria or fungi in the air can complicate the bronchitis.
You could also sit in a closed bathroom with hot water running out of the shower for 30 minutes. The steam produced by the water will work in the same way as the vapor produced by the humidifier.

, Pollution and cold air can make the condition worse. While you probably can't eliminate exposure to all pollutants, there are some you can easily avoid.



Stop smoking and do not place yourself around others who do smoke. Smoke is a major lung irritant, and smokers are the most likely to develop chronic bronchitis.
Wear a mask when you anticipate being exposed to paint, household cleansers, perfume, or other strong, potent fumes.
Wear a face mask outside. Cold air can restrict your airways, worsening your cough and making it difficult to breath. Wearing an outdoor face mask will warm the air before it reaches your airways.

, Under ordinary circumstances, you want your cough to be as productive as possible to prevent excess mucus from sitting in your lungs and causing further infection. For that reason, cough syrups and similar suppressants should not be used consistently throughout the length of the illness.


Cough syrups are usually suppressants. They suppress or restrict coughs, and as a result, you will cough less and produce less phlegm.
If you cannot sleep due to a cough or if you are coughing so much that it becomes painful, you can alternate a cough suppressant with other medication to provide temporary relief.
It is recommended that you consult with your doctor before taking a cough syrup, but these medicines can be obtained without a prescription.

, An over-the-counter expectorant will cause you to cough up more mucus. The risk of developing pneumonia or other severe infections is increased in patients with bronchitis due to the amount of excess mucus produced. Use of an expectorant is often recommended in order to expel this excess mucus, especially if you have non-productive coughs.

, Be sure to talk to your doctor prior to taking any. there is no scientific evidence that herbal remedies are effective treatments for acute bronchitis, but they have been shown to not be harmful; however, some preliminary studies have shown that South African geranium (Pelargonium sidoides) demonstrated positive results. One study has shown that people recover faster when taking this remedy as opposed to taking a placebo.Common colds can lead to bronchitis, so taking herbal remedies that help prevent colds can also help prevent bronchitis. Some herbals remedies that have been studied that have shown some promising results include; echinacea (300 mg three times daily), garlic, and ginseng (400 mg/day)."

Know when to see the doctor.,
Discuss antibiotics with your doctor.,
Find out about prescription bronchodilators.,
Consider checking into pulmonary rehabilitation.If you have chronic bronchitis, you may need long-term therapy to strengthen your weakened lungs.",How to Get Rid of Bronchitis2," If your bronchitis symptoms last for more than one week without any sign of improvement, make an appointment with your physician. Additionally, if your symptoms are getting progressively worse, consult your doctor.


Schedule an appointment with your doctor if your cough persists for over one month.
Call the doctor as soon as possible if you begin coughing up blood, having difficulty breathing, developing a fever, or feeling especially weak or ill.You should also schedule an appointment if your feet begin to swell, as congestive heart failure can cause backup of fluid into the lungs, resulting in a chronic cough. Sometimes people mistake this for bronchitis.
Contact your doctor if you begin coughing up a bad-tasting fluid. This is usually caused by stomach acid coming up from the stomach and dripping down into the lungs during sleep. A doctor will prescribe an acid-reducing medication to deal with this particular type of bronchitis.

, A doctor may prescribe an antibiotic if he or she suspects that a bacterial infection is setting in. Be aware that there is no concrete evidence that antibiotics are helpful in the resolution of acute bronchitis if it is viral, not bacterial.Under normal circumstances, a doctor will not prescribe an antibiotic. Bronchitis is most commonly caused by a virus and antibiotics only fight bacterial infections.
If you begin coughing up more mucus or if that mucus becomes thicker, you may have a bacterial infection. This is when your doctor will usually prescribe an antibiotic as the appropriate treatment. These antibiotic treatments usually last anywhere from five to 10 days.

, These medications are usually used to treat asthma. They might be prescribed if your bronchitis makes it difficult to breathe.


A bronchodilator generally comes in the form of an inhaler. The medicine is sprayed directly into the bronchial tubes, where it opens the tubes and clears out mucus.

, Pulmonary rehabilitation is a special breathing exercise program. A respiratory therapist works with you one-on-one, designing an exercise plan that will slowly build up your lung capacity while helping you to breathe more easily.

Understand bronchitis.,
Understand bronchitis treatment.,
Know the symptoms of bronchitis.,
Know the risk factors for bronchitis.",How to Get Rid of Bronchitis3," This condition can affect all ages and does not affect any gender more than the other. Bronchitis is characterized by inflammation of the bronchi and bronchioles due to an infection or chemical irritant.It results from either a bacterial, viral, or chemical catalyst.


This article will deal with the more common acute bronchitis, as chronic bronchitis is a separate medical condition that usually requires professional medical treatment. Acute bronchitis is a very common disease, in fact most people have had experience with it at some point. Almost all acute bronchitis cases resolve on their own at home with proper care, rest, and time., This disease goes away on its own and requires no treatment with antibiotics, though a cough may linger for weeks beyond the disease. Treatment of acute bronchitis focuses on alleviating symptoms and resting in order to allow your body to take care of itself and to recover.There is no definitive test for identifying bronchitis.Doctors will usually diagnose bronchitis based on what symptoms you are presenting.
Treatment and recovery from acute bronchitis usually occur at home completely unless further infections or complications set in.

, People presenting with acute bronchitis will usually describe a recent onset of cough. This occurs in the absence of other conditions such as asthma, COPD, pneumonia, or the common cold.The typical cough of bronchitis is initially dry and unproductive. This can progress to a productive cough as the bronchitis progresses. Throat and lung pain can occur from constant and intensely forceful coughing to relieve irritation.In addition to a red throat (infected pharynx), most people present with additional symptoms: difficulty breathing (Dyspnea), inspiratory or expiratory wheezing, fever over 101.1°F (38.3°C), and fatigue.

, In addition to common symptoms, there are many risk factors involved that can increase the likelihood of bronchitis. These include: very young infants or very elderly people, air pollutants, smoking or secondhand smoke, environmental changes, chronic Sinusitis, bronchopulmonary allergy, HIV infection, alcoholism, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)In healthy individuals, bronchitis is a self-limiting disease (meaning that your body can recover on it’s own without any specific treatment). In fact, most medical guidelines do not recommend antibiotics. If you have several lingering symptoms for more than a month and if you have any questions or concerns, consider visiting your doctor for a laboratory and/or imaging workup and professional treatment."

Sleep on an incline.,
Have a hot shower or bath before bed.,
Avoid sleeping under a fan, heater, or air conditioner.,
Place a humidifier in your bedroom.,
Wash your bedding at least once a week.,
Keep a glass of water on your bedside table.,
Try to breath through your nose when you sleep.",How to Stop Coughing at Night1," Prop yourself on pillows before you go to sleep and try to sleep on more than one pillow. This will prevent all the postnasal drainage and mucus you swallow during the day from backing up in your throat when you lay down at night.You can also place wooden blocks under the head of your bed to raise it by 4 inches. This angle will help to keep acids down in your stomach so they won’t irritate your throat.
If possible, avoid sleeping on your back as this can put strain on your breathing at night and cause you to cough.Sleeping on an incline with increased number of pillow is the best way to cure a cough from congestive heart failure (CHF) at night. The water collects in the lower lung fields and does not affect breathing.;
, Dry airways can make your coughing worse at night. So, immerse yourself in a steamy bathroom and soak up some moisture before bed.If you have asthma, steam can make your cough worse. Do not try this remedy if you have asthma.

, Cold air blowing on your face at night will only make your coughing worse. Move your bed so it is not under an air conditioner or heater. If you keep a fan on in your room at night, move it to a spot opposite of your bed., Humidifiers can help keep the air moist, rather than dry, in your room. The steam opens airways and allows for better air flow. This moisture will help to keep your airways moist and less prone to coughing.Keep the humidity levels at 40% to 50%, as dust mites and mold thrive in damp air. To measure humidity in your bedroom, pick up a hygrometer at your local hardware store.

, If you have a persistent night cough and are prone to allergies, keep your bedding clean. Dust mites, tiny creatures that eat dead flakes of skin, live in bedding and are a common allergy trigger. If you have an allergy or asthma you may be at risk for dust mites. Make sure to wash you sheets and try using sheet covers for the bed.Wash all your bedding, from your sheets and pillowcases to your duvet cover, in hot water once a week.
You can also wrap your mattress in plastic to keep dust mites away and your bedding clean.

, This way, if you wake up with a coughing fit during the night, you can clear your throat with a long sip of water., Before you go to sleep, think of the proverb: “The nose is for breathing, the mouth is for eating.” Train yourself to breath through your nose as you sleep by doing several rounds of conscious nose breathing. This will put less stress on your throat and hopefully lead to less coughing at night.


Sit up straight in a comfortable position.Relax your upper body and close your mouth. Rest your tongue behind your bottom teeth, away from the top of your mouth.
Place your hands on your diaphragm, or your lower belly area. You should try to breath from your diaphragm, rather than from your chest area. Breathing from your diaphragm is important because it helps your lungs with gas exchange and it massages your liver, stomach and intestines, working the toxins out of these organs. It will also relax your upper body.
Take a deep breath in with your nose and inhale for two to three seconds.
Exhale through your nose for three to four seconds. Pause for two to three seconds and breathe in again through your nose.
Practice breathing like this through your nose for several rounds of breaths. Extending your inhales and exhales will help your body get used to breathing through your nose, rather than your mouth.

Take over the counter cough medicine.,
Use cough lozenges.,
Talk to your doctor if your cough does not go away after seven days.",How to Stop Coughing at Night2," Over-the-counter cough medicine can help in two ways:An expectorant, like Mucinex DM, helps to loosen mucus and phlegm in your throat and airways.
A cough suppressant, like Delsym, blocks your body’s cough reflex and reduces your body’s urge to cough.
You can also take basic cough syrup, or apply Vick’s Vapor Rub on your chest before bed. Both medicines are known to help reduce coughing at night.
Read the label of the medicine before you use it. Ask your pharmacist if you are not sure which type of over-the-counter cough medicine is right for your cough.

, Some cough drops use a numbing ingredient, like benzocaine, which can help to calm down your cough long enough to help you fall asleep., If your nighttime cough gets worse after several treatments or remedies or after seven days, see your doctor. Causes of a cough at night include asthma, the common cold, GERD, taking ACE inhibitors, a viral syndrome, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, or cancer. If you have a high fever and a chronic night cough, see your doctor as soon as possible.The evaluation of a chronic cough begins with a good history and physical. The doctor may want to order a chest x-ray to see if there is underlying pathology. Other tests for GERD and asthma may be necessary. These include pulmonary function testing for asthma and possibly an endoscopy for GERD.
Depending on your diagnosis, your doctor may prescribe a decongestant, or a more serious medical treatment. Cheratussin with Codeine is the most commonly prescribed cough suppressant. If you already have a more serious medical issue that causes you to cough at night, such as asthma or persistent colds, talk to your doctor about specific medication you can take to treat this symptom. Dextromethorphan, morphine, guaifenesin, and gabapentin may be prescribed.
Talk to your doctor if you are taking an ACE Inhibitor, since coughing can be a side effect. They can put you on an ARB instead, which has the same benefits, without the side effect of coughing.
Some coughs, especially if they are persistent and chronic, can be a symptom of a more serious illness, like heart disease, tuberculosis, and lung cancer. However, these diseases usually also come with other more pronounced symptoms, like coughing up blood or a history of existing heart problems."

Have a spoonful of honey before bed.,
Drink licorice root tea.,
Gargle salt water.,
Steam your face with water and natural oils.",How to Stop Coughing at Night3," Honey is a great natural remedy for an irritated throat, as it coats and soothes the mucous membranes in your throat. Honey also has antibacterial properties, thanks to an enzyme added by bees. So if your cough is due to a bacterial illness, honey can help to fight off bad bacteria.Take 1 tablespoon of organic, raw honey one to three times a day and before bed. You can also dissolve honey in a cup of hot water with lemon and drink it before bed.
For children, give them 1 teaspoon of honey one to three times a day and before bed.
You should never give children under the age of two years honey due to the risk of botulism, a bacterial infection.

, Licorice root is a natural decongestant. It soothes your airways and loosens mucus in your throat. It also soothes any inflammation in your throat.Look for dried licorice root at your local health food store. You can also buy licorice root in tea bags in the tea aisle of most grocery stores.
Steep the licorice root in hot water for 10 – 15 minutes, or as specified on the tea bags. Cover the tea as it steeps to trap in the steam and oils from the tea. Drink the tea one to two times a day and before bed.
If you are on steroids or have problems with your kidneys, do not consume licorice root.

, Salt water can ease discomfort in your throat and clear out any mucus. If you are congested and have a cough, gargling salt water can help to dislodge any phlegm in your throat.Stir 1 teaspoon of salt in 8 ounces of warm water until it is dissolved.
Gargle the salt water for 15 seconds, being careful not to swallow any of the salt water.
Spit the water out in the sink and gargle again with the remaining salt water.
Rinse your mouth with plain water once you are done gargling.

, Steam is a great way to absorb moisture through your nasal passages and prevent a dry cough. Adding essential oils like tea tree oil and eucalyptus oils also gives you anti-viral, anti-bacterial, and anti-inflammatory benefits.Boil enough water to fill a medium sized heat proof bowl. Pour the water into the bowl and let it cool for 30 – 60 seconds.
Add three drops of tea tree oil and one to two drops of eucalyptus oil to the bowl of water. Give the water a quick stir to release the vapors.
Lean your head over the bowl and try to get as close to the steam as possible. Not too close though, as steam can burn your skin. Place a clean towel over your head, like a tent, to trap the steam. Breath in deeply for five to 10 minutes. Try to steam with essential oils two to three times a day.
You can also rub essential oils on your chest or your child’s chest to prevent coughing at night. Always mix essential oils in organic olive oil before applying it to your skin, as essential oils should never be applied directly to the skin. An essential oil chest rub will work as well as Vick’s Vapor Rub but will be free of petrochemicals and all natural. For children younger than 10, check the label on the essential oils for safety notes or warnings."

Recognize that coughing is usually important.,
Drink plenty of fluids.,
Eat more fruit.,
Take a hot shower or bath.,
Loosen the congestion with percussive techniques.,
Learn a new coughing technique.,
Stop smoking.,
Wait it out.",How to Treat a Cough1," If you're still in the middle of the illness that's causing your cough, most doctors will be reluctant to ""treat"" it because it's serving an important purpose, which is clearing out your airway. If the cough feels like it's deep in your chest, or if you're consistently coughing up phlegm or mucus, accept that what's happening is a good thing. Your body has an innate ability to help itself get well.


If you’ve had a cough for more than 8 weeks, this is considered a “chronic cough.” You should see your physician to see what might be causing this cough. Common causes of chronic cough include asthma, allergies, chronic sinus infections, GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), congestive heart failure, emphysema, lung cancer, or tuberculosis. Some medications such as ACE inhibitors may also include cough as a side-effect.;
, Having a cough makes you lose fluids from increased breathing rate and coughing, and if your cough is accompanied by a fever, you lose even more fluids. Drink water, eat broth-like soup, or sip on non-citrus fruit juice. Staying hydrated will keep your throat from feeling irritated, thins your mucus secretions, and helps you feel better in general.Men should drink at least 13 cups (3 liters) of fluids daily. Women should drink at least 9 cups (2.2. liters) of fluids daily. Plan to drink more when you’re sick.Avoid carbonated drinks and citrus juices - they may irritate your throat more.Studies have shown that warm fluids help loosen mucus secretions and can help relieve coughs, as well as other common symptoms that co-occur such as sneezing, sore throat, and runny nose.Drink some warm broth, hot tea, or even coffee.
To loosen congestion and reduce coughing, drink warm lemon water with honey. Mix 1 cup warm water with the juice of half a lemon. Stir in as much honey as you like. Sip the warm beverage slowly.Do not give honey to children under the age of one due to the risk of botulism exposure., Studies have shown that eating a diet high in fiber, especially fiber from fruit, can help reduce chronic cough and other respiratory symptoms.Fiber from whole fruit is more effective than fiber supplements in reducing coughs. Fruits such as apples and pears also contain flavonoids, which may help improve overall lung function.High-fiber fruits include raspberries, pears, apples, bananas, oranges, and strawberries., Inhaling the steam from a hot shower or bath can help moisturize your airways and clear feelings of congestion.This can help soothe the urge to cough.Start a hot shower, close the bathroom door, and put a towel between the bottom of the door and the floor. Spend 15 to 20 minutes inhaling the steam as it builds up in the bathroom.
You can also use a steam inhalation treatment. Bring a pot of distilled water to just under a boil. Carefully pour it into a heat-safe bowl and place it on a level, stable surface such as a table or countertop. Lean your face over the bowl, making sure not to burn yourself with the steam. Lay a light cotton towel over your head and breathe deeply, inhaling the steam.

Be sure to keep children away from the hot bowl and water, as they might burn themselves. It may be better to have children sit in a closed bathroom with a hot shower running and have them inhale steam that way.


Remember, dry secretions don’t move, but moist secretions are much more easily cleared from your lungs and airways.

, If you're at home and you have a partner who can help, use a chest percussion technique to help clear the chest congestion. This works particularly well in the morning and just before bed.Sit with your back supported by a chair or wall. Have your partner cup his or her hand by bending the fingers at the knuckles. Ask your partner to clap over your pectoral muscles quickly and firmly. Stay in this position for 5 minutes.
Lie on your stomach with a pillow under your hips. Bend your arms at the elbow and hold them to the sides. Ask your partner to use a cupped hand to clap firmly and quickly over your shoulder blades and upper shoulder area. Stay in this position for 5 minutes
Lie on your back with a pillow under your hips. Hold your arms down and to the sides. Ask your partner to use a cupped hand to clap firmly and quickly over your pectoral (chest) muscles. Stay in this position for 5 minutes.
The “clap” should make a hollow sound. If it sounds like a “slap” instead, ask your partner to cup her/his hand more.
Never clap over the spine or kidney areas.

, If your throat is strained and irritated from nonstop coughing, try the “Huff Cough” technique to head off a coughing fit.Deflate your lungs by exhaling as much as possible. Next, inhale slowly to take a deep breath. Keep your mouth open and loose, like an “O.”
Contract your upper abdominal muscles to cause a short “mini-cough.” Inhale a short breath, and repeat with another mini-cough. Take an even shorter breath, and give another mini-cough.
Finally, give a large, forcible cough. You should feel phlegm being released. The tiny coughs help move mucus towards the upper part of your air passage so you can expel more of it with a last, big cough.

, Smoking is a culprit behind many coughs. In fact, it’s the most common cause of chronic cough.It’s also terrible for your health. Quitting smoking can help relieve a cough and allow your body to begin repairing damage.After you quit smoking, you may notice that you actually cough more than usual for the first few weeks. This is normal, because smoking inhibits the function of the cilia (tiny hairs) in your lungs. In addition, smoking causes chronic inflammation in your airways. When you quit smoking, the cilia function better and the inflammation begins to clear. Your body can take up to 3 weeks to adapt to this recovery.Quitting smoking reduces your risk of lung cancer, heart disease, and stroke. It also reduces the severity of respiratory symptoms such as coughing over the long term.Quitting smoking can also benefit others, who can experience many health problems from exposure to secondhand smoke.

, Most minor coughs should subside in 2-3 weeks. If it persists or is frequent or severe, visit your doctor. Long-term coughing could be the sign of another illness. You should see a doctor immediately if you have underlying medical conditions that could complicate a cough (such as asthma, lung disease, or immune deficiencies) or if you experience any of the following symptoms:Thick phlegm that is green or greenish-yellow that persists for more than a few days or is accompanied by face or head pain or a fever
Pink or bloody phlegm
Choking
Wheezing or “whooping”
Fever above 100.5F for more than 3 days
Shortness of breath or chest pain
Difficulty breathing or swallowing
Cyanosis, or bluish color to lips, face, fingers, or toes

Stir some into some hot tea for comforting cough relief.You can also eat a spoonful of honey before bed to help calm coughs.You can safely give honey to children aged 2 or older. Honey has been found to be as effective as dextromethorphan in children.However, you should never give honey to infants under 12 months. This can cause infant botulism, a serious type of food poisoning.Studies have shown buckwheat honey to be helpful.Honey harvested from your local area can also help fight allergens common where you live., A saline spray can help loosen the mucus in your nose or throat, which may decrease your cough. You can purchase commercial saline sprays or make your own.


To make your own saline solution, combine 2 teaspoons table salt with 4 cups of warm water. Stir until thoroughly dissolved. Use a neti pot or nasal syringe to irrigate your sinuses.Use this spray when you feel congested, especially before bed.
Try using the spray before you feed infants or young children.

, Warm saltwater gargles help moisturize your throat, which can quiet coughs.You can make a quick saltwater gargle at home:Mix ¼ tsp to ½ tsp of kosher or pickling salt with 8 ounces of warm distilled or boiled water.
Take a large sip of the mixture and gargle for one minute. Spit out the gargle. Don’t swallow the saltwater.

, Peppermint’s active ingredient is menthol, which is a good expectorant. It can help loosen phlegm and relieve coughing, including dry coughs.Peppermint is widely available in commercial preparations, essential oils, and herbal teas. You can also grow your own peppermint easily.

, Eucalyptus has an active ingredient called cineole, which acts as an expectorant to help relieve coughs.You can often find eucalyptus in commercial preparations, cough syrup, lozenges, and ointments. Eucalyptus oil is usually available at health shops and pharmacies.


Don’t consume eucalyptus oil by mouth; it can be toxic when ingested. Rubbing a little under your nose or on your chest can help you feel less congested, which can help fight the urge to cough.
You can try a eucalyptus cough syrup or lozenge to help fight coughing spells.
Brew a eucalyptus tea by steeping a few fresh or dried eucalyptus leaves in hot water for 15 minutes. Drink this tea up to 3 times a day to help soothe a sore throat and calm coughs.
Do not use eucalyptus if you have asthma, seizures, kidney or liver disease, or low blood pressure.

, Chamomile tea is a very popular for people who don’t feel well. It can help treat chest colds and help you sleep.You can also purchase chamomile oil at health food shops and pharmacies.


Add chamomile oil to a steam inhalation bath to help you relieve a cough. You can also add chamomile oil to a “shower bomb” to help clear your congestion and soothe coughs.

, Ginger can help calm coughs.Make a hot ginger tea to help soothe a chronic cough.Make a hot ginger cinnamon tea by simmering ½ cup thinly sliced fresh ginger, 6 cups water, and 2 cinnamon sticks for 20 minutes.

Strain and stir in 2 tablespoons honey. Drink to relieve coughing.Do not ingest thyme oil, as it is toxic. You should consult with your doctor before using thyme if you also take blood-thinners.

, This is Althea officinalis, not the puffy white marshmallows that you put into hot cocoa. Marshmallow leaf and root are available at many health food stores. Taking marshmallow supplements can help reduce a cough caused by ACE inhibitors.Brew a hot marshmallow tea. When combined with water, marshmallow leaves and roots produce mucilage, which coat your throat and help reduce the urge to cough.Brew a few dried leaves or roots in hot water for 10 minutes. Strain and drink the tea.

, Horehound is a natural expectorant and has been used to treat coughs since ancient times. You can take horehound in a powdered or juice supplement, or brew a tea from horehound root.To brew a horehound tea, steep 1-2 grams of horehound root in 8 ounces of boiled water for 10 minutes. Strain and drink up to 3 times per day. Horehound is very bitter, so you may wish to add honey.
Horehound is sometimes found in hard candies or lozenges. These can be good to suck on if you have a persistent cough.

Take a commercial expectorant.,
Take an antihistamine for an allergy-related cough.,
Try a decongestant.,
Use cough suppressants when appropriate.,
Coat your throat.",How to Treat a Cough3," Your doctor may want to see you if you have a persistent or serious cough. If you go to the doctor, he or she will likely ask you about the duration and characteristics of your cough. He or she will examine your head, neck, and chest, including listening to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope, and may take a nasalor throat swab. Rarely, a chest x-ray,blood test, or breathing treatment may be necessary in the office.


Be sure to take any medications as prescribed by your doctor. In the case of antibiotics for a bacterial infection, be sure to take the entire course of antibiotics until they are gone, even after you begin to feel better.

, You should speak with your doctor before taking any medications, particularly if you have chronic medical problems, have medication allergies, take other medications, or you are administering medication to a child under the age of 12. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should also consult care providers before taking any medications.


Be aware that studies don’t consistently show benefit for many OTC cough and cold medications.

, Expectorants can help clear secretions from your upper and lower airways. The best ingredient to find in an expectorant is Guaifenesin. After you take it, try to make your coughs as productive as possible, and spit out anything that comes up.Expectorant that contain guaifenesin include Mucinex and Robitussin., Antihistamines may be helpful with allergy-related symptoms such as coughs, sneezing and runny nose.


Antihistamines that may help you include Loratidine (Claritin), Fexofenadine (Allegra), Cetirizine (Zyrtec), Chlorpheniramine, and Diphenhydramine (Benadryl).
Be aware that antihistamines make most people sleepy, particularly Chlorpheniramine, Benadryl, and Zyrtec. Claritin and Allegra generally cause less sedation. Try taking any new antihistamine before you go to bed and do not drive or operate heavy machinery until you know how you will react to it.

, There are many decongestants available, but the two most common are pseudoephedrine and phenylpropanolamine. Be aware that if you have thick secretions and just take a decongestant, your secretions may become very thick.


You may have to get medications with pseudoephedrine from the pharmacist. Sales restrictions necessitate these medicines being kept behind the counter at the pharmacy. Be sure to ask your doctor whether these medications are safe for you to use.
If you are trying to clear thick secretions and are having a great deal of congestion, your best bet is to combine an expectorant (Guaifenesin) with a decongestant.

, If your cough is productive, don’t use a cough suppressant. However, if you have a persistent dry cough, a cough suppressant may be helpful.


Over-the-counter cough suppressants commonly have the ingredient Dextromethorphan, but they aren’t always effective. For a severe persistent cough, see your doctor. She will need to rule out more serious causes and may prescribe a prescription strength cough medicine (Typically containing Codeine).

, Making your throat feel as if it's ""coated"" in a substance can reduce your urge to cough non-productively (that is, you're no longer coughing up mucus or phlegm).Take an over-the-counter cough syrup.
Suck on a lozenge or cough drop. The gel-like substance inside the lozenge can coat your throat and minimize coughing. Even hard candies can help.
Do not give lozenges, hard cough drops, or candy to children under the age of 4. Young children may choke on them.Choking is the 4th leading cause of accidental death in children under age 5."

Use a humidifier.,
Remove irritants in the environment.,
Sleep with your head elevated.",How to Treat a Cough4," Adding moisture to the air can help calm a cough.You can purchase humidifiers at most department stores and pharmacies.


Clean your humidifier regularly with a bleach solution. Because of the moisture, humidifiers can rapidly promote mold or mildew growth if they’re not kept clean.Warm or cool humidifiers are equally effective, but cool mist humidifiers are safer for use around young children.

, Dust, airborne particles (including pet fur and dander), and smoke all irritate your throat and can cause coughing. Make sure you keep your environment free of dust and debris.If you work in an industry where there’s a lot of dust or airborne particulate, such as construction, wear a face mask to avoid inhaling these irritants., To help you avoid feeling as though you’re choking on phlegm, elevate your head with a few extra pillows when you lie down or sleep propped up.This can help reduce coughing at night.

Stay hydrated.,
Keep your throat healthy.,
Utilize the air.,
Take medicine.,
Talk to your doctor.",How to Stop Coughing1," Lovingly called postnasal drip, the stuff that comes out of your nose and trickles down your throat, ultimately irritating it, can be helped by drinking water. This thins out the mucus, making it more manageable for your throat.Unfortunately, this doesn't mean eggnog. Water, as always, is best. Stay away from carbonated drinks and juices with high acidity levels--they may irritate your throat even more.;
, Though taking care of your throat doesn't necessarily mean taking care of your cough (that's often a symptom in itself), it will help you feel and sleep better.

Try lozenges or cough drops. They numb the back of the throat, decreasing the cough reflex.






Drinking warm tea with honey helps soothe the throat in a similar manner. Make sure it's not too hot though!






1/2 tsp of ground ginger or apple cider vinegar with 1/2 tsp of honey is not an uncommon tactic, but it is medically unsupported.

, Create an environment that goes easy on your throat. If you change your environment, your symptoms may lessen.

Take steamy showers. They can loosen the secretions in your nose, making it easier to breathe.






Invest in a humidifier. Putting moisture back in the air if it's dry can help ease the pain.






Remove irritants. Perfumes and scented deodorizing sprays are harmless on the outside, but some people are sensitive to them and can develop sinus irritation from the exposure.






Of course, smoke is the ultimate culprit. If you are around someone who smokes, remove yourself. If you smoke, your cough is probably chronic and above being deemed just a nuisance.







, If nothing else is working, medicine it is. Your best bet is to consult a doctor; there are a number of different medications to discern between.

Consider decongestants. They work their miracles by lessening the amount of mucus your sinuses produce and shrinking your swollen nasal tissues. When it comes to the lungs, they dry up the mucus already present and open up the airway passages. You can find them in pills, liquids and sprays. But if you have hypertension, be careful: They can raise blood pressure. And if you go overboard with them, they can make everything too dry, giving you a dry cough. Consider cough suppressants. If you can barely get a wink of shut eye because your chest hurts so bad, you may want to go for cough suppressants like Delsym, DexAlone, and Vicks Formula 44. Use them only at night though.Consider expectorants. If your cough is thick with phlegm, it helps to take a cough expectorant such as guaifenesin--found in Humibid, Mucinex, Robitussin Chest Congestion, and Tussin. These thin out the mucus and the pretty part is you'll be able to cough it up.Do not give over-the-counter drugs to children under the age of 4, says the FDA. They can cause serious side effects.

, A simple cough may not warrant a visit to a healthcare professional, but if it lingers or is the side effect of a bigger problem, it's best to consult someone who can properly diagnose you.


Regardless of the duration of your cough, if you are coughing up blood, experiencing chills or fatigue, see your doctor immediately. They will be able to determine the cause of your cough--asthma, allergies, the flu, etc.

Take mucus-thinning medications.,
Use a saline nasal spray.,
Suck on cough drops to get rid of your cough.,
Combat allergies with over-the-counter antihistamines.,
Try ‘new generation’ antihistamines.",How to Stop a Cough from Post Nasal Drip1," Mucus-thinning medications are also known as expectorant medications. This sort of medication causes the mucus to become thin and move up from your throat and into your mouth (you can then spit it out). It increases the amount of mucus you have, but thins it out so that your body—in particular the ciliated hairs in your throat—have an easier time getting out of your throat. When the mucus is removed, your cough will stop.Guaifenesin, which also referred to as glyceryl guaiacolate, is one of the most common mucus-thinning medications available.;
, Saline just means saltwater. Nasal sprays send a mist of saline water directly up and into your nose. Saline nasal sprays and nasal irrigation devices flush out excess mucus, allergens and irritating substances from your nasal passages and throat. When all of these things get flushed out of your body, your cough will stop., A cough drop contains ingredients like benzocaine, eucalyptus oil, menthol, peppermint oil, spearmint or honey. All of these ingredients soothe irritated nerves and mucous membranes in your throat. When these nerves and membranes are soothed, your cough impulse will go away.


There are many different kinds of cough drops out there. You can purchase them over-the-counter at your local pharmacy.

, If your post nasal drip is caused by allergies, as most post nasal drips are, you should take antihistamines to reduce your allergy symptoms. Your body produces histamine when it thinks your body is being attacked by something. While this is good if your body is actually being attacked, allergies are caused by your body mistakenly thinking something like pollen is trying to attack your cells. Antihistamines stop your body from wrongly producing histamine.Chlorpheniramine: This antihistamine is usually taken as a 4 mg tablet. As an adult, you can take a maximum of 24 mg a day. Children should only take 12 mg a day. This sort of antihistamine may cause drowsiness.
Diphenhydramine: This antihistamine is most commonly known as Benadryl. Generally you should only take one tablet of this antihistamine in a 24 hour period. Benadryl can cause serious drowsiness in some people.

, New generation antihistamines have less side effects than the older antihistamines listed in the previous step. However, some people have found that they are less effective—it all depends on your own personal allergies. Try them out and see if they work for you.Desloratadine: This antihistamine comes in both tablet and syrup form. It is non-drowsy so you can take it and still function. It is non-drowsy because it does not delve deeply into your body and affect your central nervous system, as older generation antihistamines do.
Fexofenadine: This antihistamine also remains outside the central nervous system. It comes in tablet form.

See a doctor.,
Quit smoking.,
Take medication.,
Up your fluid intake.",How to Stop Coughing2," If your cough has lasted longer than a month, your subacute cough may be turning into a chronic cough.You may have a sinus infection, asthma, or gastroesophageal reflex disease (GERD). Knowing the cause of your cough is the first step to treating it.






You're doctor may put you on an antibiotic if you have a sinus infection. He or she may also suggest a nasal spray.
If you have allergies, you'll obviously be told to avoid those allergens as much as possible. You cough could diminish easily if this is the case.
If you have asthma, avoid conditions that make it flare up. Take your asthma medications regularly and avoid all irritants and allergens.
When acid from your stomach gets into your throat, that's GERD. There are medications your doctor can prescribe for you to relieve your pain. Apart from that, wait 3 or 4 hours after you eat before you go to bed and sleep with your head adequately elevated to lessen your symptoms., There are many programs and resources out there to help you kick the habit and your doctor can help. He/She can refer you to a program or expose you to new, effective methods.


If you are around second-hand smoke, know that that could be an explanation for your cough. Remove yourself as often as possible.

, Coughs are generally a symptom -- therefore, cough medications are only taken when the actual problem isn't known. If you have a chronic cough, though, that's a slightly different story. Only take medications if your doctor okays it. Here are your options:


Antitussives are prescription cough suppressants. These are generally the last thing to be recommended and only are so when nothing else works. OTC cough suppressants aren't backed up by science, for the record.
Expectorants loosen up mucus and as a result you cough it up.
Bronchodilators are medicines that relax your airways., Though the cause of your cough won't go away, you'll feel significantly better.


Drink mainly water. Carbonated or overly sugary drinks can irritate your throat.
Warm soups or broth can help ease the pain of an aching throat, too.

"
"
Avoid certain medications.,
Practice healthy throat habits.,
See a doctor.",How to Stop Coughing3," The FDA states that most OTC medications can cause side effects in children under the age of 4. Keep this in mind when treating your child's cough.


Cough drops should not be used for children under the age of 2. They are dangerous and considered a choking hazard at this age.

, Making things easier on the throat lessens the side effects of your child's cold or flu. Take steps to minimize their symptoms.


Offer plenty of fluids. Water, teas, and juices are fine (breast milk for babies as well). Stay away from sodas and citrus drinks that may irritate the throat.
Sit in a steamy bathroom for around 20 minutes and put a humidifier in their bedrooms. These methods may clear the nasal passageways, reduce coughing, and make for easier sleep.

, If your child is finding it difficult to breathe or the cough has lasted longer than 3 weeks, seek a medical professional immediately.


If the child is under 3 months old or the cough is accompanied by fever or other symptoms, this is especially important.
Take note if the cough happens at roughly the same time every year or is caused by something specific--it may be allergies.

Grab a saucepan.,
Boil ingredients slowly until the butter melts.,
Pour the mixture into a cup.,
Sip slowly!,
Watch the cough subside.,
Make sure you keep yourself warm.",How to Stop Coughing4," Heat about 200 ml (1 cup) of full cream milk.


Add one flat tablespoon (15 grams) honey and about one good teaspoon (5 grams) of butter or margarine. Stir once initially.

, This forms a yellow layer on the top.


The yellow layer is fine--don't feel the need to stir it up again.

, Allow to slightly cool before giving to children.

, Make sure you drink the yellow part, too.

, It should stop or lessen significantly within an hour of drinking this mixture.


This coats the throat, numbing it. Note that the cold or flu (the cause of the cough) will not go away.

, A cold body is more prone to illness.


And if you have dry coughs, drink lots of water!

"
"
Gargle with salt water.,
Try inhaling steam to clear your sinuses.,
Up your intake of ginger.,
Eat more garlic.,
Drink echinacea tea.",How to Stop a Cough from Post Nasal Drip2," Mix a tablespoon of regular salt in a glass or warm water. Take some of the mixture into your mouth and swish it around or gargle it so that it reaches the back of your throat. Spit it out and repeat with the rest of the salt water mixture. The salt water will help to dislodge mucus from the back of your throat.Do this once in the morning and once at night.

, Inhaling steam can help soften dried mucus and throat linings. It also acts as a natural decongestant that widens your nasal passageways, making it easier for you to breathe. Steam can also help to loosen secretions in your throat, which reduces the likelihood that you will cough.To create a steam inhaler at home:


Boil water. Place the boiled water in a large bowl. Cover your head with a towel and put your head over the bowl of hot water. Make sure that the towel covers your whole head and the bowl. The towel keeps the steam from escaping and dispersing. Inhale the steam until the water cools down.
You can also take a hot shower. Keep all of the windows and doors closed so that it becomes super steamy in your bathroom.

, Ginger has anti-inflammatory properties that can reduce swelling in your throat that is caused by mucus irritation. When the swelling in your throat goes down, you will be less inclined to cough.To consume more ginger:


Drink ginger tea, take ginger supplements, or add more raw ginger to your meals.

, Garlic contains allicin, which helps to combat colds and other respiratory issues. If your cough is caused by a cold, garlic is a good natural way to fight the cold because it can help to kill the virus causing the irritation in your throat.To consume more garlic:


Eat two to four raw garlic cloves a day. You can also take garlic supplements, or add more garlic to your meals.

, Echinacea contains alkylamides, which are known to reduce the duration of colds and other respiratory infections. Echinacea also prevents your nasal and throat passageways from drying out, which means that they are less likely to become irritated.


You can increase your intake of echinacea by drinking echinacea tea, taking supplements (in tablet form) or using echinacea tinctures.

Stay hydrated.,
Remove all dust and other allergens from your room.,
Set up a vaporizer or humidifier in your room.,
Consume less dairy.,
Quit smoking and avoid being around cigarette smoke.,
Elevate your head and shoulders with a pillow when sleeping at night.,
Wash all of your bedding.",How to Stop a Cough from Post Nasal Drip3," Drinking plenty of water each day can help to loosen up the mucus in the back of your throat. Water also helps to thin out the mucus and helps your body to flush it away. Drinking plenty of water also keeps your throat moist; when your throat becomes dry, it is more likely to become irritated and make you cough.Try to drink 8 to 12 glasses of water a day, though you should drink more if you are physically active.

, If you have allergies and are dealing with a chronic cough, you should thoroughly clean your house and room to remove any allergens that could be causing your cough. When are surrounded by allergens, your body produces more mucus, which in turn makes you cough more.


Bathe your pet every other day. Pets, especially those who are furry, can accumulate dust that can contribute to your allergies.
Clean your house at least once or twice a week.
Vacuum carpets and rugs once or twice a week.
Open your windows in the morning to let some fresh air into your house, but close them halfway through the day so that you can keep allergens out.

, Dry air can make your throat irritated. It can also dry out the mucus in your throat, which can irritate your throat further. If you live in a dry climate, install a vaporizer or humidifier in your room to keep the air more moist.Clean your humidifier every week to make sure that it is not blowing dust and other allergens into your room.

, Dairy products can make the mucus in your throat thicken, which in turn can make your cough worse. While dealing with your cough, try to avoid eating or drinking dairy products. You can resume consuming these dairy products after your cough clears up.Avoid products like:


Milk, cheese, half-and-half, yogurt, and ice cream.

, Cigarette smoke contains certain chemicals, like nicotine, that irritate the mucous membrane in your nose and throat. When the membrane becomes irritated, it produces more mucus, which in turn can cause a cough. To stop or avoid a chronic cough, quit smoking.


You should also try to avoid secondhand smoke, as it can have the same effect on your mucous membrane.

, When you sleep, mucus has a tendency to accumulate in the back of your throat, which can lead to a cough. When you elevate your head by propping it up with a pillow, the mucus drains out of your throat more easily.


Try to prop your head and shoulders up so that you are in an almost-sitting position. While this might not be the most comfortable way to sleep, it will help you to get rid of your cough.

, Wash all sheets, mattress covers and pillowcases with hot water. These fabrics often collect dust and other allergens when they are not washed often. Washing them will remove these allergens and thus will help to reduce the amount of mucus in your throat that is causing you to cough.

Drink more water.,
Take a hot shower.,
Turn on a humidifier or vaporizer.,
Gargle with warm salt water.,
Elevate your head while you sleep.,
Avoid throat irritants.,
Get plenty of rest.,
Stop smoking.,
See your doctor.",How to Quiet a Cough Naturally1," Especially in dry surroundings, simply drinking some water can help reduce a nagging cough.Water will help soothe the throat irritation causing the cough. Water will also keep you generally hydrated, which can thin any mucus in your throat that are responsible for the cough.


Healthcare professionals recommend that men drink around thirteen cups of water each day and that women drink around nine.;
, Breathing in moist air is another way to lubricate your throat and reduce a cough. If you’re having a coughing fit before bed that’s keeping you awake, take a hot, steamy shower and take deep breaths of the moist air.This can also help thin any secretions in your throat or simply soothe throat irritation.

, If your throat dries out during the night, and you wake up coughing, then you can also try sleeping with a humidifier or a vaporizer running to increase the moisture in the air while you sleep.Eucalyptus oil is an expectorant, meaning that it loosens phlegm, which is often the cause of coughing.You can try adding some eucalyptus oil to your vaporizer to help keep your throat clear at night as well.
Make sure you thoroughly clean the unit on a regular basis. Using a humidifier without cleaning it can result in the growth of mold and other bacteria in the unit that then gets spread around when it’s running., Salt water is another method to help thin and loosen any mucus in your throat that’s causing you to cough. The salt water will also have a soothing effect on your throat if it’s sore due to coughing. Tilt your head back and gargle with the solution for one minute.This is also a good way to help reduce coughing caused by postnasal drip, which is the sensation of mucus at the back of your throat.Be sure to spit the salt water out. Don’t swallow it.

, Another way to help reduce a dry cough is to elevate your head more while you sleep.Place an extra pillow or two behind yourself to keep your head up during the night.

, Exposure to smoke, dust, fumes, and other pollutants can also cause coughing as the pollutants irritate your throat and lungs.Keep the air filters in your home up to date, dust often (especially on top of ceiling fans), and avoid areas outside your home where you’re likely to breathe more pollutants.


Keeping houseplants is another great way to reduce indoor pollutants in your home.

, Though not a direct method for reducing a cough, getting plenty of rest can help shorten the duration of your cough. Most cases of acute cough are due to cold and flu viruses, which your immune system will fight off on its own. You can help boost your immune system by getting plenty of rest if a cold or flu is responsible for your cough., Most smokers begin to develop a chronic cough that is even referred to as a “smoker’s cough.”The cough is because the cigarette smoke irritates the throat and lungs. By quitting smoking, you can help get rid of a smoking-related cough.

, If your cough doesn’t subside after several weeks of home treatment and natural remedies, then you should see your doctor.It may mean that the underlying condition of your cough simply requires actual medical treatment. You should see your doctor even sooner if your cough also includes:A fever above 100°F (38°C)
If you cough up blood; pink-tinged phlegm; or thick, greenish-yellow phlegm
If you begin wheezing or experiencing shortness of breath
If you have a violent cough that leads to a “whooping” sound due to gasping for air."

Try honey.,
Eat ginger.,
Try taking elderberry extract.,
Have some peppermint tea.,
Take marshmallow root.,
Eat some fresh thyme.,
Use eucalyptus.",How to Quiet a Cough Naturally2," Use medicinal honey if possible (Manuka honey from New Zealand is recommended), but any organic honey will have antibacterial and antiviral properties.In one study, honey performed better than dextromethorphan (a common cough suppressant)You can try two teaspoons or more before bed to quiet your cough.Do not give honey to children under the age of one due to the possibility of infant botulism.Adding fresh lemon to the honey may also help. Lemon has a high level of vitamin C, which helps immune system function.Though it may not fight the cough directly, it will help arm your body to fight off a cold or flu.

, Ginger has been shown in studies to open up airways to allow the greater flow of oxygen.It is particularly useful as an alternative therapy for asthma, making it a great natural option to help relieve chronic cough in asthma sufferers.

, Some studies have indicated that elderberry may work as a decongestant and reduce swelling in mucus membranes.If your cough is due to cold and flu symptoms, then elderberry may be a natural option to help break up mucus contributing to your cough.


Never give an elderberry product to a child without first consulting your doctor., Peppermint and its main active ingredient—menthol—are both effective at reducing congestion.It thins and loosens mucus, making it great for quieting a cough caused by congestion. However, it has also shown to be calming for dry coughs as well.If you don’t like actually drinking peppermint, you can also try placing one or two teaspoons of the dry herb in boiling water, covering your head with a towel, and breathing in the vapors from the herb.

, Marshmallow root is another herb traditionally used to treat a cough. While studies of the herb in humans are minimal, it has been shown to soothe mucous membranes with signs of irritation from asthma and coughing.As a throat irritant itself, coughing often creates a vicious cycle of more coughing. By soothing your throat, the herb can help shorten the duration of an acute cough.


Marshmallow root is available as a tea, in supplements, or as a tincture that you add to water.Always follow manufacturer directions.
Dosages have not been safely tested in children, so consult your child’s pediatrician before giving the child this herb., Two studies have suggested that you can use thyme to relieve cough and treat acute symptoms of bronchitis.If you pick up an herbal supplement containing thyme, follow the manufacturer’s instructions.


Thyme oil should not be ingested as it’s considered toxic.Thyme may additionally increase your risk of bleeding. Consult your doctor before taking thyme, especially if you’re on a blood thinner., Eucalyptus is used in many over-the-counter cough drops and lozenges, but you can also use it as an herb without the other chemicals in the commercial products.In addition to use in teas, you can also find eucalyptus oils and extracts that you can apply directly to your nose and chest to help loosen phlegm and relieve cough.Do not ingest eucalyptus oil directly because it is toxic.Always check with your child’s pediatrician before using a product containing eucalyptus, including ointments applied to the chest or nose, which should never be used on children under the age of two.Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should also avoid using eucalyptus."

Drink turmeric milk.",How to Stop a Dry Cough at Night," Keep a glass of water by your bedside so you can easily stop a cough if you wake up in the middle of the night. Drinking water can soothe your throat and keep the mucus from thickening in your throat (which causes you to cough).You should also be drinking lots of fluids during the day. If you get tired of water, you can drink fruit juices or herbal teas.;
, If you're losing sleep at night, your body still needs rest in order to recover. Try to take a nap during the day to catch up on some sleep and prevent becoming overtired. If you can't take a nap, just take some time to rest.Consider taking time off work if you can. Giving your body a chance to relax can help you heal faster.

, Humidifiers introduce moisture into the air which can stop you from coughing. You can purchase and use a humidifier or place bowls of water around your room, especially near heat sources. The water will evaporate and increase the humidity in the air.For a similar effect, you can take a hot, steamy shower before bed to help thin out mucus and breathe in moisture.

, Stir 1/2 teaspoon of sea salt (or table salt) into a glass of warm water until it dissolves. Gargle the mixture and spit it out. You can also gargle with warm chamomile, sage, or blackberry tea to soothe your throat and prevent coughing.Gargling before bed can reduce swelling in your throat so you're less likely to cough. And the salt can give you minerals (like zinc, selenium, and magnesium) that help your immune system.

, Acid reflux is a common cause of nighttime coughing, and can be triggered by specific foods. Notice if you experience coughing at night after eating common trigger foods, such as fatty or fried foods, tomato sauce, alcohol, chocolate, mint, garlic, onion, or caffeine.If you notice a connection, avoid those foods and speak to your doctor about acid reflux.

, If you start coughing in the middle of the night, use an over-the-counter throat spray that contains phenol. Throat sprays can quickly stop coughs by coating and soothing your throat. You can also slowly suck on cough drops or lozenges, although you should take care not to fall asleep before the drop has dissolved since it could be a choking hazard.Look for cough drops or lozenges that contain menthol eucalyptus. This can numb your throat and stop the cough.

, A first-generation antihistamine (Benadryl, Tavist, and Chlor-Trimeton) can reduce the symptoms of a common cold like runny nose. It does this by reducing the mucus in your sinuses which could also help prevent mucus buildup in your throat. One of the main side effects of first-generation antihistamines is drowsiness which makes it a good choice for preventing coughing at night.Antihistamines are primarily used to treat symptoms of allergies.

, If you are on an ACE inhibitor or other medication that you suspect is the reason for your cough, talk to your doctor about changing the medication or the dosage. Since coughing is the most common side effect for ACE inhibitors, your doctor may switch you to an angiotensin receptor blocker which doesn't have the coughing side effect.If you suspect a different condition is causing your cough, make sure you have the correct diagnosis and are being treated. If the cough doesn't go away after treatment, you might need to get a second opinion about the specific cause of your cough, as it may be caused by GERD (acid reflux), allergies, and even some heart conditions.

, If you don't see any improvement to your cough after trying home remedies for a week or two, call your doctor. You should also get immediate medical attention if you notice any red flag symptoms including:Coughing up thick and/or greenish-yellow phlegm
Wheezing or a whistling sound at the beginning or end of the breath
Any odd sounding coughs or difficulty catching your breath (especially at the end of a cough)
Fits of uncontrolled, violent coughing with difficulty breathing
Fever of over 100 degrees F (38 degrees C)
Shortness of breath

, Gently warm one cup of honey and stir in 3 to 4 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice. Stir in ¼ to ⅓ cup water while heating the cough syrup over low heat. If you want, you can add 1.5 inches of fresh grated ginger since ginger has expectorant properties that can thin out mucus. Remove the syrup from heat and refrigerate it till you need to use it. To use the syrup, take 1 to 2 tablespoons.Studies have shown that honey is more effective at treating coughs than some commercial cough suppressants and it has antibacterial and antiviral properties.
Do not give honey to any child under 12 months of age because honey is associated with a risk of infant botulism.

, You can use peppermint as a steaming treatment. Add 1 to 2 teaspoons of dried peppermint to 2 cups of boiled water. Drape the back of your head with a towel and lean over the steaming water. To keep from scalding yourself, stay about 12 inches away from the water. Breathe in deeply through your nose and mouth until the water is no longer steaming.You can also drink peppermint tea. Peppermint contains menthol which thins mucus and acts as an expectorant.
Peppermint is considered safe for children and adults, but avoid using it if you're nursing since it can reduce your supply of milk. You should also avoid peppermint if you have stomach issues, as it can make symptoms worse.

, Although more research is needed, people have long used marshmallow root to stop coughs. Drink a marshmallow root tea by steeping 1 to 2 teaspoons of the dried herb in 1 cup of water for about 10 minutes. You can also use marshmallow root in a steam treatment so you can breathe in the herb.Marshmallow root is an herb that can relieve throat irritation and reduce inflammation. Always test for an allergic reaction by trying a small amount of tea or steam and waiting 30 minutes. If you don't notice additional irritation, you can use the herb.

, Thyme is a popular natural remedy for lung conditions like bronchitis. It acts as a cough suppressant and can be made into a tea. To drink thyme, steep 1 to 2 teaspoons of dried thyme in 1 cup of boiled water for 10 minutes. You can also use it as a steam treatment. Although thyme is considered safe to use, ask your doctor before using thyme if:You're taking hormone medications
You take blood thinners
Note that you should never take thyme oil by mouth since it's toxic.

, Ginger root has been used for centuries as a cough suppressant and to increase salivation (which can relieve a dry throat). The easiest way to use ginger is to cut off a small, quarter-sized slice of fresh ginger root and simply chew it. This can be useful if you need to quickly stop your cough in the middle of the night.You can also drink a purchased ginger tea or make your own by boiling fresh ginger in water for several minutes.

, Turmeric is a spice that has been traditionally used to treat cough and other respiratory illnesses. To make turmeric milk, mix ½ teaspoon of turmeric in one glass of warm milk (or soy or almond milk). You should also grind a little black pepper into the drink to help your body absorb the turmeric better.Drink a glass of turmeric milk during the day if your cough is bothering you. You should also be sure to drink a glass before bed since this can soothe your throat before sleeping.

Get plenty of rest.,
Stay hydrated.As with any acute infection, your body loses water as it works to fight it off; therefore, it is key to drink plenty of fluids.,
Use over-the-counter medications as needed.Examples include Dextromethorphan and Guaifenesin.These can be purchased over-the-counter at your local drugstore or pharmacy.,
Try lozenges.Sucking on lozenges can help to alleviate a cough — particularly a cough that is dry and tickling in nature.,
Seek emergency medical help if your cough is severe.,
Ensure that your vital signs are stabilized.If it is an emergency situation, and you are in distress because of your cough (which may be compromising your ability to breathe), the doctor will work to stabilize you before proceeding with further treatment.,
Tell your doctor about how the cough began.Once you are stable enough to answer questions and to engage in conversation with your doctor, he will want to elicit the history of your cough.,
Describe the characteristics of your cough.Your doctor will also inquire into the characteristics of your cough.,
Watch for any other signs and symptoms.It is key to discuss any other symptoms that you have noticed alongside your cough.,
Share your medical health history.Finally, as your doctor works to diagnose the cause of your cough, it is key that he is aware of your medical history and any other health conditions that you may have.,
Ask your doctor for a physical exam.In addition to evaluating your vital signs (and assessing whether or not you could benefit from immediate help such as supplemental oxygen), your doctor will also listen to your chest with a stethoscope.,
Receive a chest x-ray.A chest x-ray is another highly beneficial investigative tool when it comes to determining the cause of your acute cough.,
Have an ECG (electrocardiogram), if needed.,
Talk your doctor about a CT scan.,
Get a sputum sample taken.Given that the most common cause of an acute cough is an infection, your doctor may collect a sample of your sputum for analysis in the lab.,
Opt for spirometry.,
Receive breathing support as needed.If your cough is causing respiratory distress (significant trouble breathing), you may need oxygen supplementation.,
Take antibiotics if you have an infection.If you have an infection, such as acute bronchitis or pneumonia, you may benefit from antibiotics.,
Ask your doctor for blood thinners if you have a blood clot in your lung (a pulmonary embolism).If you are diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism as the source of your acute cough, you will be given blood thinners — at first intravenously, and then orally — for treatment.,
Take medications to treat heart failure, if you have it.If decompensated heart failure is the cause of your acute cough (as it can lead to a sudden buildup of fluid in the lungs, called pulmonary oedema, which causes a wet and productive cough), your doctor will treat this accordingly.,
Increase your dose of inhaled medications if you have a COPD exacerbation.If you have a COPD exacerbation, you will likely need increased amounts of inhaled bronchodilator medication (such as Ventolin) and inhaled corticosteroids (such as Flovent).,
Treat other causes of an acute cough based on the underlying cause.Clearly, the treatment plan for an acute cough depends entirely on the underlying cause of the cough.",How to Treat an Acute Cough," As with any illness, the more time you can give your body to rest, the faster you will likely recover from the infection. Most acute coughs are caused by the common cold or the flu, and taking time to rest can enhance your immune function and your ability to fight off the bug.


If you cannot get time off work, see if you can cancel other commitments to give your body more rest.
Get extra sleep if this is at all possible in your schedule. Sleep is one of the best ways to boost your immune function.;
, Drink at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water per day.


It can also be helpful to use a humidifier — which vaporizes water into the air — to ease symptoms of your cough.
The steam from a hot shower can also help to clear your airways and to improve your cough., Note that using OTC cough medications is only useful if your cough is caused from an acute respiratory infection, such as the common cold or the flu.


Over the counter cold and cough remedies are generally not recommended for children under six years old, and their effectiveness in this age group has not proven to be effective.

, Lozenges can be purchased at most grocery stores, or at your local drugstore or pharmacy.

, The first thing to do if you have an acute cough is to determine whether you need to go into the Emergency Room, or whether it is okay to wait to see your family doctor. Indications to go straight to the Emergency Room include:


Shortness of breath compromising your ability to breathe
A fever indicating a possible infection
Other underlying health issues that leave you immunocompromised (such as having HIV/AIDS or an organ transplant)

, She may offer you:


Supplemental oxygen
A bronchodilator, which is a medication that will relax the bronchi and bronchioles in your lungs
Positive airway pressure, such as a CPAP or BiPAP machine
In rare cases, ventilatory support

, He will ask you questions like:


When did your cough begin?
Have you had a cough like this before?
Is your cough getting better or worse?
Does it come in episodes, or is the cough constant?

, Things she may ask about are:


Is it a productive cough?
Is there blood in your cough?
Is there a wheezy aspect to your cough?

, Things to tell your doctor about include:


Chest pain — and whether this radiates anywhere else in your body
Shortness of breath
General fatigue
Lightheadedness, dizziness, and/or fainting
A fever

, Let your doctor know if you have a history of:


Diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or ongoing heart disease
Ongoing respiratory disease prior to the onset of your cough
Acid reflux (GERD) or symptoms of heartburn, indigestion or frequent sour tastes in your mouth
Allergic rhinitis (hay fever), which can cause a cough due to post-nasal drip
A condition that compromises your immune system (such as HIV/AIDS or an organ transplant)

, The stethoscope can detect crackles in your lungs when there is fluid buildup (such as in cases of pulmonary oedema or pneumonia). Your doctor will also look for other signs on physical exam, including:


An elevated ""JVP"" (jugular venous pressure, which assesses the amount of blood in your neck veins) — this can indicate whether there is fluid buildup such as in congestive heart failure and/or pulmonary oedema.
Signs of hypoxia (oxygen deprivation) by assessing the circulation in your hands, and around your tongue and the inside of your cheeks (these areas show it more quickly if you are deprived of oxygen).
Other abnormal breath sounds, such as wheezing or stridor (a harsh, vibrating sound) or decreased air movement.

, A chest x-ray may show signs of an enlarged heart, such as in congestive heart failure. It may also show fluid buildup in the lungs. It will show pneumonia if you have it, and it can also detect lung cancer.


If the x-ray alone is inconclusive, your doctor may request that you proceed with a CT scan to look at your lungs in more detail.
However, in many cases, the x-ray alone is sufficient to make the diagnosis and to begin a treatment plan.

, Some causes of an acute cough (such as heart-related causes, or a pulmonary embolism — a blood clot in the lung) can be ruled in or ruled out via an ECG. This is a quick and easy test to obtain so, if your doctor suspects a heart-related cause or a pulmonary embolism as the reason for your acute cough, you will likely receive this investigation.

, Your doctor may decide to do a computed tomographic (CT) scan of your chest, which can provide your doctor with more detailed images of your lungs than an x-ray. This can be used to rule out serious afflictions.

A PE (pulmonary embolism, which is a blood clot in the lung that can lead to an acute cough) can be ruled out with a CT scan.

, This can reveal if there is an infection present, and also what type of microbe is growing there so that the antibiotic treatment can be specifically targeted to the bacteria that has infected you (if it is indeed bacterial).

, Spirometry is a type of lung function test. It can be used to diagnose asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), among other things. A COPD ""exacerbation"" is a common cause of an acutely worsened cough, so this is something that your doctor may wish to consider in the diagnostic process.


Chronic bronchitis and emphysema are types of COPD.

, In more severe cases, you may need positive airway pressure (such as a CPAP machine or a BiPAP machine) or, rarely, ventilator support.


Bronchodilators such as albuterol are also used in the event of bronchospasm.
It is key to ensure that you are getting adequate oxygen delivery before proceeding with further treatment.

, This is not true in all cases (it depends upon the risk level of your infection, and whether it is believed to be bacterial). Your doctor can guide you as to whether antibiotic treatment is needed in your case.


Note that, in a viral infection (or an infection caused by any microorganism other than bacteria), antibiotics will be of no benefit.

, An example of an IV blood thinner is Heparin. An example of an oral blood thinner is Warfarin (Coumadin). The purpose of blood thinning medications is to prevent any further formation of blood clots (or growth of the current blood clot), and to allow your body's natural mechanisms to dissolve the clot that is currently there.


Note, however, that if your pulmonary embolism is severe — leading to a severe cough and debilitating shortness of breath — you may need ""clot busting"" drugs to break the clot apart, or a surgical intervention to remove the clot.

, You may need:


Diuretics
Venodilators
Blood pressure medications
Medications to reduce your cardiovascular risk factors
Treatment of the underlying cause of your heart failure

, You may also need to begin oral steroids (such as Prednisone) for a short period of time, to get your cough and shortness of breath under control.


Systemic and inhaled steroids are also used in acute bronchitis and bronchiolitis.
If the cause of your COPD exacerbation is a respiratory tract infection, you may also need antibiotics.

, A more rare cause is:


Cardiac tamponade, which is when blood pools around your heart leading to compression of the heart, fluid build-up in the lungs, and a resulting wet and productive cough accompanied by chest pain and shortness of breath.
The treatment for a cardiac tamponade is ""pericardiocentesis"" (a needle inserted into your chest cavity to remove the blood that has pooled around your heart).
In the event that the cough is due to acid reflux, H2 blockers or PPI's may be helpful to relieve symptoms, and also lifestyle changes (avoiding spicy and acidic foods, elevating head of bed for sleep).
If the cough is due to allergic rhinitis, nasal corticosteroids may prove helpful as well as oral antihistamines.

Breathe in sharply and close your throat.,
Try doing a huff cough.,
Try doing a fake cough.,
Breathe in cold, dry air.",How to Make Yourself Cough1," Changing the way you breathe in and out, combined with restricting your airflow, can induce a cough. Take in a deep, sharp breath to dry out your mouth and throat. Tighten your throat and try to exhale. Tighten your stomach and push air out while keeping your throat restricted. This can help induce a cough.;
, A huff cough is a gentle, low pressure cough that is useful for individuals who do not have the lung capacity to perform a normal cough. These include patients with cystic fibrosis or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), among others.To do a huff cough:


Slow down your breathing by exhaling for a count of 4.
Breathe in about 75% of a normal inhalation.
Shape your mouth into an O and try to keep your voice box open.
Contract your abdominal muscles to force air up through your mouth. You should make a soft “huff” sound.
Inhale a quick, shallow breath and make another “huff” sound.

, When you start making a coughing sound on purpose to simulate a cough, a real cough might follow. To do a fake cough, start by clearing your throat. Force air out of your throat by tightening your abdominal muscles and pushing air up and out of your mouth.

, Winter air is often cold and dry, and can contribute to increased coughing. Cold, dry air can eliminate water vapor from your throat and mouth, which can cause a spasm in your airway. This might make you cough, especially if you are prone to asthma.Take big, deep breaths in the cold air. Make sure the air reaches down into your lungs.

Breathe in steam from boiling water.,
Inhale citric acid.,
Breathe in aromatic oil of mustard.,
Cook up chili peppers.,
Suck mucous back into your throat.,
Inhale an allergen like dust or smoke.,
Take a big sniff of a foul smell.",How to Make Yourself Cough2," Boil water in a kettle and pour it into a bowl. Put your face over the bowl, being careful to avoid getting burned. Breathe deeply and quickly to draw the vaporized water into your lungs. It will condense in your lungs, whereupon your body will mistake it for water in your lungs. Your body will try to expel the water by coughing., Citric acid has been used in a number of medical trials as a tussive agent (something that causes the cough reflex). Put citric acid such as orange or lemon juice in a nebulizer to produce a mist that you can then inhale into your lungs. This should induce a cough.,, An older medical study indicates that oil of mustard can be inhaled to induce coughing. Put a few drops of aromatic oil of mustard in a bottle. Sniff the bottle and you will begin to cough., Chili peppers contain a compound called capsaicin, which can irritate your mouth, throat and airways. When you have exposure to capsaicins by cooking chili peppers, some of the molecules become airborne. You may inhale them and cause irritation in your throat and lungs, which, for many people, causes a coughing fit., , If you have a cold and your nose is runny or plugged, bring the phlegm back into your mouth and throat to induce a cough. This will contribute to a postnasal drip, which is when mucous seeps into your throat through your nasal passages.Postnasal drip will contribute to your cough, potentially prolonging it.

, Deliberately inhaling allergens such as dust, pollen or smoke will likely make you cough, especially if you are sensitive to them. Hold your face over a feather duster and open your mouth. Breathe in a quick, deep breath.


Alternately, ask someone to blow cigarette smoke in your face. Breathe in through your mouth to bring the smoke into your lungs. If you are not a smoker, this may cause you to cough. If you are a smoker, this may not be very effective. However, remember, even if you're a smoker, the smoke can be dangerous for you.

, The lungs have a means of detecting odors and irritants that cause a coughing reaction, such as toxic chemicals or bad smells. The lungs are imprinted a sort of “memory” so that they protect themselves. This is why you often have a sudden and violent response, such as gagging and coughing, to irritants and odors.Find something that smells really awful, like rotting food or feces. You may have a reaction to the smell that includes gagging and coughing.

Use a cough stimulator.,
Apply pressure to the chest.,
Use fentanyl to induce a cough.",How to Make Yourself Cough3," This type of device is typically used for quadriplegic individuals who do not have the ability to cough on their own. The device is implanted under the skin near the neck or upper chest, and sends electronic pulses to the neck’s phrenic nerves. This causes the diaphragm to contract, simulating a breath inhalation. Continuing these pulses will cause minor spasms to initiate coughing., A caregiver can help a disabled patient to cough by pressing firmly on the torso just below the ribcage. At the same time, the patient should exhale or try to cough. The pressure should induce a sort of cough that will, for example, help clear lungs during a chest infection.The caregiver must apply very careful pressure so as to not cause injury to the patient.

, Fentanyl is a pain medication administered as an anesthetic by a health care professional. An intravenous injection of fentanyl tends to induce coughing in the patient.,This is only used when a patient is undergoing anesthesia for a medical procedure and would not be a common method of inducing a cough.

Keep hydrated.,
Gargle with salt water.,
Take a cough suppressant.,
Use cough lozenges.,
Eat fruit.,
Avoid allergens.,
Use a humidifier.,
Use honey.,
Use benzonatate (Tessalon Perles, Zonatuss).",How to Heal Chronic Cough1," Drink plenty of water. In general, it's recommended that men drink about 13 cups (3 liters) of water a day, and women drink about 9 cups (2.2 liters) of water a day.Not only will the fluids help soothe your throat, calming irritation that is causing you to cough, but they can also help thin the secretions in the throat., This is an age-old remedy for coughs and sore throats. Though it won't treat the chronic cough, it can help reduce any swelling and provide some relief.Mix 1 teaspoon of salt into 8 ounces of warm water. Gargle with this mixture every few hours.

, A cough suppressant works to block the cough reflex. It's important to note that a suppressant will not treat the main cause of the cough but may provide some relief, particularly if your cough is interfering with your sleep.For a long time, codeine was seen as the ""gold standard"" cough suppressant drug because it decreased activity in the part of the brain that brings about coughing. However, recent studies have suggested that codeine is not effective in suppressing coughs. Furthermore, there is an addictive potential to codeine and not all providers or patients are comfortable with this.A common cough suppressant is dextromethorphan (e.g., Triaminic Cold and Cough, Robitussin Cough, Delsym, Vicks 44 Cough and Cold). Be cautious with using over-the-counter cough medicines. Always talk to your doctor before using, and only use the dosage and follow the directions as specified.
Do not give cough medicines to children under the age of four.If your cough is productive, meaning it brings up mucus or phlegm, don't use a cough suppressant., Most throat lozenges, such as Halls or Fisherman's Friend, have medicine in them that works to numb the throat to provide a soothing effect.


You can purchase lozenges or ""cough drops"" (as they are commonly known) with eucalyptus or mint, which can further help clear out and sooth your airways.Do not give any lozenges to children under the age of 4, as they pose a choking hazard., Scientific research suggests that incorporating more fruit can help prevent a chronic cough thank to its high amounts of fiber and flavonoids.Research has shown success with apples, pears, and grapes, but you can also try other brightly colored fruits including blueberries, cherries, oranges, and strawberries.

, If you suspect your cough is caused by allergies, make an effort to avoid those allergens. Common allergens include pollen, dust, grass, scented soaps or perfumes, and animal dander.You can also take an antihistamine or decongestant to provide relief from an allergy-related cough.

, Using a humidifier overnight may assist you in keeping a moist environment which can alleviate dry air and help your airways stay clear. Warm or cool damp, misty air can help sooth a swollen throat and also provide some relief from a scratchy, hoarse throat.If you don't have a humidifier, you can also try putting a shallow pan of water in your bedroom overnight. This will add moisture to the air.
You could also take a hot shower. Following the same idea as the humidifier, the steam from the shower assists in clearing secretions from the nasal passages.

, Honey is a well known treatment for long-standing coughs. Studies have shown that honey is as effective at battling night-time cough as the cough suppressant dextromethorphan, with none of the side-effects.You can add a teaspoon of honey to hot tea to help soothe a throat that is sore from constant coughing.Do not give honey to children younger than 1 year old., A non-narcotic cough suppressant, benzonatate is believed to help alleviate cough symptoms by reducing the cough reflex in the lungs, thus relieving the chronic cough. Commonly prescribed forms of benzonatate include Tessalon Perles and Zonatuss.Tessalon Perles are non-habit forming capsules, and should be taken as directed by your doctor. This medication must be swallowed as a whole. Do not take more than is directed, as it could cause serious side effects.You may want to discuss using Tessalon Perles with your provider since it can interact with other medical conditions, including pregnancy and the taking of other medications."

Visit your doctor.,
Treat asthma.,

Take antibiotics if you have an infection.",How to Heal Chronic Cough2," If your cough does not go away, you should make an appointment with your doctor. She will be able to determine the source of the cough and treat it accordingly.


Although it can be difficult to pinpoint the underlying cause of the cough, it is essential to do since in most cases, a chronic cough disappears once the underlying condition is addressed and treated. The three most common causes of a chronic cough are asthma, postnasal drip, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). These three causes are the reasons for 90% of all cases of chronic coughs.Most doctors will begin by taking your full medical history and conducting a physical examination. In general, physicians will try treating one of the common underlying conditions of coughs and only if those treatments are unsuccessful will they conduct additional testing, including X-rays, CT (Computerized tomography) scans, bacterial tests, lung function (spirometry) tests, etc.Your doctor will also ask you what medicines you're taking. Sometimes, prescription medications can cause a cough. ACE inhibitors, used to treat high blood pressure, are common culprits behind chronic coughs.In the case of a child, the doctor may initiate testing, including a chest X-ray and spirometry test, if the history and physical exam don't reveal a clear cause., A cough that is caused by asthma may come and go depending on the time of year, but can also develop if you've recently had an upper respiratory infection, also known as the common cold. An asthma-related cough can also worsen if you're out in the cold or are exposed to certain chemicals or fragrances. In addition there is also a type of asthma known as ""cough-variant asthma"" that is typified by the hyperactivity of the airways due to pollutants and often in conjunction with seasonal allergies.


Most physicians will recommend that you use an inhaler with corticosteroids to treat asthma, such as Flovent and Pulmicort. These inhalers reduce inflammation and expand your airways. Inhalers are only available by prescription so you'll need to talk with your doctor directly.Generally, these inhalers are taken twice daily. The user must follow a certain procedure for the inhalers to be effective: take a deep breath out, then take a deep inhale while squeezing the pump of the inhaler. Rinse your mouth out after use to avoid potential thrush from the steroids remaining in your oral cavity.
If you have asthma, your doctor will prescribe bronchodilator medications such as Albuterol that relax muscles in the airway (thus averting a coughing spasm) and help increase air flow to the lungs. These are generally inhaled every 4 to 6 hours, as needed.However, inhaled steroids remain the foremost treatment for asthma that causes a predominant coughing pattern.
If you have a cough due to asthma, your doctor may also prescribe montelukast (Singulair), which can help treat coughing and other symptoms.

, This is a very common condition in which stomach acid leaks back into your esophagus, the tube that connects your stomach and throat, and irritates your esophageal lining. This irritation can eventually result in a chronic cough. The cough in turn worsens GERD, so a vicious cycle eventually develops if you do not seek treatment for GERD. If you are also experiencing indigestion or heartburn frequently, then GERD is a likely cause of your cough.To treat GERD, you can take either acid blockers or Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs). Acid blockers (also known as H2 blockers) reduce the production of stomach acid. The most widely recommended H2 blocker is ranitidine, or Zantac, which can be obtained OTC or with a prescription. Ranitidine can be taken orally in tablet form. In general, most H2 blockers are to be taken 30 to 60 minutes before eating (but only twice per day maximum).PPIs work by blocking a chemical system called the hydrogen-potassium adenosine triphosphatase enzyme system, which produces stomach acids. They reduce the production of acid and also increase the tone of the lower esophageal sphincter, thus preventing the acid from traveling into your upper airway and triggering a cough.One PPI, Prilosec, is available over the counter, whereas others, including Aciphex, Nexium, Prevacid, Protonix, and stronger Prilosec, require prescription. PPIs should not be used for longer than 8 weeks, unless directed by your doctor.For more ways to treat GERD, including dietary tips, see Treat Acid Reflux Naturally. Common suggestions include avoiding ""trigger"" foods like fatty or fried foods, drinking more water, and eating smaller meals throughout the day., Postnasal drip occurs when the mucus from your nasal passages and sinuses drips down the back of your throat. This can trigger your cough reflex. This condition is also called upper airway cough syndrome.The standard treatment for postnasal drip are antihistamines, such as Claritin, Zyrtec Xyzal, Clarinex, and decongestants (such as Sudafed tablets or liquid and Neo-Synephrine and Afrin nasal sprays). They can be found over-the-counter in your local pharmacy. Follow any directions on the label and do not use more than the recommended dosage because these medications can have side effects, including dizziness and dry mouth. You may want to consult your doctor before use, especially if you have medical problems such as high blood pressure or take other medications.More recently, Flonase and Nasacort, which are inhaled corticosteroids, were released for over-the-counter use. They are not addictive and should not be confused with a nasal decongestant spray.

, Smoking is the most common cause of chronic bronchitis, which can cause a chronic cough. Chronic bronchitis results in the long-term inflammation of your bronchial tubes, which are your major breathing airways. These changes can become permanent if you do not seek treatment or stop smoking. In addition to a chronic cough, chronic bronchitis can also cause wheezing and an inability to breath deeply and clearly.Smoking also irritates coughs from other sources, and can cause serious issues such as lung cancer.
Most people with chronic bronchitis either smoke or used to be smokers.
It's also important to avoid second-hand smoke, as this can trigger a chronic cough even if you aren't a smoker.

, If environmental allergens are causing your chronic cough, an over-the-counter allergy medicine can greatly help relieve your symptoms.Antihistamines (e.g., Claritin, Zyrtec, Tavist, Clarinex, and Xyzal), decongestants (Sudafed, Neo-Synephrine, Afrin, and Visine) and combination decongestant and antihistamine medications (Allegra-D or Zyrtec-D) are standard treatment for allergies.Antihistamines work to block the substance histamine in your cells, the production of which is your body's response to an ""attack"" by an allergen on your immune system. Histamine is what causes redness, itching, and swelling. Note that although some antihistamines may cause drowsiness, there are newer ones the market that are explicitly labelled as non-drowsy. Take as directed.Decongestants help to alleviate congestion and are usually recommended for use alongside antihistamines. Nasal spray and eye drop decongestants should be used only for a couple of days at a time because can worsen symptoms. Tablets and liquids can be used for longer. Follow the dosage and directions as specified on the bottle or box.Nasal corticosteroid sprays, such as Flonase and Nasacort, can be very effective in reducing nasal allergy symptoms and reducing allergy-related cough., If you are suffering from bacterial pneumonia, bacterial sinusitis, bronchitis, tuberculosis, or pertussis (whooping cough), your doctor will prescribe the correct kind and dosage of antibiotics according to your particular needs.Be sure to complete the full course of antibiotic treatment. For example, if your doctor prescribes a 10-day treatment, make sure to take the antibiotics as specified for the full 10 days even if you feel like your symptoms have been improving.

Use an alternate method of making honey and lemon cough medicine.,
Consider adding garlic to the honey and lemon cough medicine.,
Consider adding ginger to the honey and lemon cough medicine.,
Consider adding licorice to the honey and lemon cough medicine.,
Use glycerin as a substitute for honey.",How to Make Cough Medicine with Lemon Juice1," Gently warm up one cup of honey over low heat. Add 3-4 tablespoons of freshly squeezed lemon juice to the warm honey. Add ¼ to ⅓ cup water to the honey-lemon mixture and stir while continuing to heat on low. Refrigerate the mixture. When you need the cough medicine, take 1-2 tablespoons as needed.


Medicinal honey, such as Manuka honey from New Zealand, is recommended but any organic honey will have antibacterial and antiviral properties.Lemon juice contains high levels of Vitamin C-- the juice of 1 lemon contains 51% of the daily Vitamin C requirement. Lemon juice also has antibacterial and antiviral properties.It is believed that the combination of Vitamin C and the antimicrobial properties make lemon useful for coughs.Do not give honey to any child under 12 months of age. There is a small risk of getting infant botulism from bacterial toxins sometimes found in honey. There are less than 100 cases of infant botulism in the US every year and most babies recover fully, but better to be safe!;
, Cut a washed, whole lemon into thin slices (along with the skin and the seeds). Add the slices to one cup of honey. Heat over low heat for 10 minutes with constant stirring.


Break up the lemon slices as you stir.
Once finished cooking, strain the mixture to get the leftover lemon slices out and then refrigerate.

, Garlic has antibacterial, antiviral, antiparasitic and antifungal properties.Peel 2-3 cloves of garlic and chop them as finely as possible. Add it to the honey-lemon mixture before you add water. Heat on low flame for about 10 minutes. Then add ¼ to ⅓ cup water to the honey-lemon mixture and stir in while heating over the low flame.


Refrigerate the mixture. When you need the cough medicine, take 1-2 tablespoons as needed.

, Ginger is often used to improve digestion and to treat nausea and vomiting, but it has also been traditionally used as an expectorant. It can help a cough by thinning out mucus and phlegm and as a bronchial relaxant.Cut and peel about 1.5 inches of fresh ginger root. Finely grate it and add to honey-lemon mixture before adding water. Heat on low flame for about 10 minutes. Then add ¼ to ⅓ cup water, stir the mixture, and then refrigerate.
Refrigerate the mixture.
When you need the cough medicine, take 1-2 tablespoons.

, Licorice is also an expectorant. It is mildly stimulating, so it helps to produce phlegm and thereby remove it from the lungs.Add 3-5 drops of Licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) essential oil or 1 teaspoon of dried licorice root to the honey-lemon mixture before you add water. Heat on low flame for about 10 minutes then add ¼ to ⅓ cup water to the mixture while continuing to heat over the low flame.

, If you don’t have, don’t like, or can’t use honey, substitute glycerin. Heat ½ cup of glycerin with ½ cup of water over low heat. Then add 3-4 tablespoons of lemon juice to the mixture. Add ¼ to ⅓ cup water to the glycerin-lemon mixture and stir while continuing to heat over the low flame. Refrigerate the mixture. When you need the cough medicine, take 1-2 tablespoons as needed.


Glycerin has “generally recognized as safe” (GRAS) status with the FDA. Pure glycerin is a colorless and somewhat sweet vegetable product that is used to make all sorts of ingestible products and personal care products.Because glycerine it is hygroscopic-- it takes up water-- it can be helpful in small amounts to reduce any swelling in the throat.
You should get natural glycerin (and not the synthetic or man-made form).
Be aware that glycerin is used to treat constipation, so if diarrhea becomes a problem, reduce the amount of glycerin used (¼ cup glycerin with ¾ cup water in the basic recipe).
Prolonged and excessive ingestion of glycerin can increase blood sugar and blood fat levels."

Eat smaller meals.",How to Get Rid of a Wheezing Cough1," Gargling with salt water can help to reduce some of the swelling in your throat and this can help to reduce coughing.You can gargle with salt water every couple hours throughout the day to help with your wheezing cough.


To gargle with salt water, take about ¼ to ½ teaspoon of sea salt and dissolve it in one cup of warm water. Then gargle with the saltwater solution for about 30 to 60 seconds. Spit out the salt water after you are done.;
, Cough drops can help to silence a wheezing cough, but keep in mind that cough drops will not cure a wheezing cough.Look for cough drops that contain menthol, which has a cooling effect on your throat and breathing passages.


You can suck one lozenge every couple of hours to help silence your wheezing cough temporarily.

, Keeping the air moist in your home can also be helpful for a wheezing cough. Humid air helps to loosen up mucus and reduce coughing.You can run a humidifier when you are home to prevent the air from becoming too dry.


You can also try adding a few drops of essential oil to the humidifier to increase the benefits of the steam. Some good essential oils to add to a humidifier include eucalyptus, peppermint, ginger, and camphor.
If you do not have a humidifier, then taking a warm shower will help to moisten your nasal passages and calm down your wheezing cough as well. Try taking a warm shower before bed to help you relax and reduce coughing while you sleep.

, Rest is essential for recovery from any type of illness, so plan to get lots of rest. You may need to take a day or two off of work to allow yourself enough time to rest. Try to get at least eight hours of sleep every night while you are recovering.


You can also supplement your sleep by taking naps if you need to.

, Environmental irritants can also contribute to a wheezing cough sometimes. If you think that environmental irritants such as pollution, chemicals, and smoke may be aggravating or causing your wheezing cough, then you may want to wear a mask when you are exposed to these irritants.Cigarette smoke can be especially irritating when you have a wheezing cough.If you are smoker, then you should to try to quit smoking to get rid of your wheezing cough. Talk to your doctor about smoking cessation medications and programs that may help support your efforts to quit smoking.

, If your wheezing cough is a side effect of GERD, then eating smaller meals throughout the day may also help to get rid of it.Avoid eating large heavy meals and opt for smaller nutritious meals instead to help reduce the side effects of GERD and get rid of a wheezing cough associated with your GERD.


Make sure that you do not eat too close to bedtime either. Try to stop eating about three to four hours before bedtime as well."

Understand the possible causes of a cough.,
Decide whether you should see a doctor for your cough.,
Assess whether a child needs to go to the doctor for a cough.,
Decide whether a cough needs treatment.",How to Make Cough Medicine with Lemon Juice2," The most common for acute coughs are: the common cold, influenza (better known as the flu), pneumonia (an infection in the lung(s) by bacteria, viruses or fungi), chemical irritants, and whooping cough (also known as pertussis is a highly contagious bacterial lung infection).The most common causes of chronic coughs are: allergic reactions, asthma, bronchitis (an inflammation of the bronchi or air tubes in the lungs), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and post-nasal drip (mucus drips into the throat from the sinuses causing an irritation with a reflex cough).


There are other less common causes of cough including other lung disorders such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), which includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis.Coughs can also be due to side effects of medication. This is particularly the case with a class of blood pressure medications-- the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. A cough may be the side effect of other illnesses including: cystic fibrosis, chronic and acute sinusitis, congestive heart failure, and tuberculosis.

, Try home remedies for 1-2 weeks. For most coughs, these should provide enough relief for you to recover. If there is no improvement after 1-2 weeks, however, make an appointment with your physician for a full diagnosis and to determine your best course of action.Also, make an appointment with your physician if during that 1-2 weeks you experience: any fever of more than 100 degrees F for more than 24 hours, coughing up greenish-yellow thick discharge (this can indicate a serious bacterial pneumonia), coughing up mucus with streaks of reddish or pinkish blood, vomiting (particularly if the vomit looks like coffee grounds-- this may indicate a bleeding ulcer), difficulty swallowing, or difficulty breathing, wheezing or feeling short of breath.

, There are some illnesses that can incapacitate children more quickly and some illnesses that children are especially prone to get. Because of this, you need to assess their coughs differently. With children, call your physician immediately if they experience any of the following:Any fever over 100 degrees F.
A barking type of cough-- this may be croup (a viral infection of the larynx (voice box) and trachea (windpipe, breathing tube). Some children may also experience stridor, which is a high-pitched whistling or gasping sound. If your hear either of these types of sounds, call your physician right away.
A wheezy, gurgling type of cough that may sound raspy or whistling. This could be bronchiolitis, potentially caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSC).
A whooping sound when your child inhales, which is likely whooping cough.

, Remember that coughing is the body’s natural way of getting rid of bacteria, viruses, or fungus-filled mucus, and that is a good goal! However, if your or your child’s cough is not allowing you to rest or sleep, or is causing any difficulty in breathing, it is time to treat that cough. You need adequate rest and sleep when you have a cough, so that is where remedies can be useful.


You can use many home remedies as much and as often as you want. They will also help keep you hydrated, which is very important as your immune system and body recovers.

Use a humidifier.,
Inhale steam.,
Apply a warm towel.,
Use a saline spray.,
Use a neti pot.,
Gargle salt water.,
Consider oil pulling.,
Blow your nose correctly.",How to Decongest Naturally1," Dry air can aggravate your sinuses and make it harder for mucus to drain from the nasal passages, which prolongs congestion. Using a humidifier in your bedroom or living room adds moisture to the air to prevent dehydration, help clear your sinuses, and soothe your throat. Aim for the right humidity. The air in your home should range from 30% to 55% humidity.


If the humidity is too high, mold and dust mites may thrive, both of which are common causes of allergies. Mold also causes an unpleasant smell and can discolor surfaces. If the humidity falls too low, it may cause dry eyes as well as throat and sinus irritations. The simplest way to measure humidity is with a gauge called a humidistat, which can be purchased from most hardware stores.
Both portable and central humidifiers must be cleaned thoroughly. Otherwise, they tend to become contaminated with mold and bacterial growth that may be blown through the house. Stop the humidifier and call your healthcare provider if you develop any respiratory symptoms that you feel are related to the use of a humidifier.;
, Steam helps loosen mucus while also washing away any foreign matter like dust or pollen that came into contact with your nasal passages. For a quick steam treatment, you can heat up a pot of distilled water just shy of boiling. When it starts producing quite a lot of steam, remove the pot from the heat. Place a towel over your head and lean over the pot, closing your eyes and breathing deeply for about 5-10 minutes.


The water should be around 175-185 degrees F (80–85 degrees C)., A warm towel applied to the forehead or neck may help relieve sinus headaches caused by inflammation and congestion in the nasal passages. Heat opens up blood vessels, which increases blood flow and supplies oxygen and nutrients to reduce pain and relax sore muscles. To use this method, soak a small, clean towel in lukewarm water for 3–5 minutes, then wring the water out. Apply it to your forehead or neck for 5 minutes. Dip the rag back in the water and place it again. Do not apply heat for longer 20 minutes, which would be 4 rotations, unless recommended by your doctor or physician.


You can also use a hot water bottle or gel pack to apply heat compression. Do not use heat higher than 105-115 degrees F (40–45 degrees C) because it can burn the skin. People with sensitive skin shouldn’t use a temperature higher than 85 degrees F (30 degrees C).
Do not apply heat if there is swelling or fever. Use an ice bag instead.
Don’t use heat on injuries, wounds, or stitches. People with poor circulation and diabetes should practice caution when using warm compression., Saline sprays add moisture to nasal passages and help clean them of crusts and mucus. The first time you use the spray, you may have to prime it by squirting a few times into the air until a fine mist comes out. When using a pump spray, gently blow your nose into a tissue to clear it of mucus. Remove the cap and lightly shake the bottle. Tilt your head forward slightly and breathe out slowly. Hold the pump to your nostril with your thumb at the bottom of the bottle, and your index and middle fingers on top. Using a finger on your other hand to close the nostril on the other side. Squeeze the pump as you breathe in slowly through your nose. Repeat these steps for the other nostril.


If the pump spray is used correctly, the spray should not drip from your nose or down the back of your throat. Try not to sneeze or blow your nose just after using the spray. Also try to aim straight. Point the nozzle of the nasal spray container toward the back of your head. If you don't spray straight, you will waste the medicine and may cause more irritation in your nose.
If you use a pressurized canister, wash it at least once a week. When using a pressurized canister, gently blow your nose into a tissue to clear it of mucus. Make sure the canister fits snugly in its holder. Lightly shake the canister several times before using it. For this type of spray, follow the same method of use as with other sprays except you should keep your head upright.
Some nasal sprays may sting slightly or cause irritation. Look for a spray with a sodium chloride content of 0 to 3% to avoid irritation. If you have sensitive skin, a saline spray with a sodium content of 0.9% will work best. This is called a physiological saline solution.
Most saline sprays are safe to use as often as you like on a daily basis. If you experience nosebleeds, discontinue use for a few days. If bleeding or irritation continues, speak with your doctor., A neti pot is specially designed to flush the mucus from your sinuses to decongest and relieve cold symptoms for several hours. During this process, which is called nasal irrigation, a saline solution is poured into one nostril and carries mucus out the other. Start by making a saline solution using 1/4 teaspoon of kosher or pickling salt, 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda, and 8 ounces of warm distilled water around 105 degrees F (40 degrees C).


Fill the neti pot with 4 ounces of the saline solution. Standing over a sink, tip your head to one side and hold the spout of the neti pot to your upturned nostril. Pour the saline solution into one nostril and let it flow out the other. Repeat with the other nostril.
Start with one irrigation per day while you have symptoms. If you feel better, use 8-16 ounces of solution in each nasal cavity 1-2 times daily, or as often as you need.
Neti pots are available at most drug stores and health food shops., Gargling salt water helps moisturize your sinuses, allowing mucus to drain and preventing postnasal drip. It can also help soothe a sore throat. Place 1/2 teaspoon of sea salt in a glass of distilled or sterilized warm water and stir until it's dissolved. Gargle the water for 1–2 minutes, then spit it out instead of swallowing.


If the salt irritates your mouth or throat, you can also use plain, distilled warm water for gargles. Repeat every few hours., Oil pulling is an Ayurvedic remedy in which you swish oil in your mouth to remove harmful germs and bacteria from your mouth. Vegetable oil contains lipids that absorb toxins and pull them out of saliva.Take a spoonful of oil and swish it in your mouth for one minute to gain the benefits. Next, spit it out and wash your mouth nicely, preferably with lukewarm water.


If you can, try to swish the oil for up to 15-20 minutes. The longer you do it, the more benefits you receive. To make sure the oil absorbs and detoxifies as much bacteria as possible, aim to do this with an empty stomach.
Buy organic, cold-pressed oil. Sesame oil and olive oil can work, however coconut oil is the most popular because of its taste and natural antioxidants and vitamins, such as vitamin E. The medium chain fatty acids of coconut oil incorporate themselves into the membranes of viruses and bacteria, which subsequently bursts them thus killing them off. Streptococcus mutans is an acid-producing bacterium commonly found inhabiting the mouth. It is a major cause of tooth decay, as it binds to tooth enamel and damages it. Coconut oil was the only oil that killed Streptococcus mutans in a study.Oil is also a natural moisturizer and it helps prevent dehydration in the throat and mouth., While it's important to blow your nose while you have a cold to help keep your sinuses clear, don't blow too explosively. The pressure from blowing hard can impact your ears, giving you an earache on top of your cold. Be sure to blow gently, and only as often as necessary. Experts recommended that you blow by holding a finger over one nostril and gently blowing the other into a tissue. Repeat with the other nostril.


Wash your hands each time you blow your nose to avoid chances of other infections by bacteria or viruses."

Take warm showers.,
Get an indoor houseplant.,
Quit smoking.",How to Decongest Naturally2," To help you decongest, think about adding short, warm showers to your routine. A warm shower or bath that lasts for 5–10 minutes can reduce congestion by stimulating the drainage of mucus and soothing sore muscles. Keep the water temperature around 105-115 degrees F (40–45 degrees C). Make sure the water is not too hot or cold, especially if you have a fever. Lukewarm baths can also benefit children and infants with nasal congestion.


Limit your time to 5-10 minutes in the shower. People with sensitive skin should only take a warm shower once or twice a week to prevent their skin from drying out.
Keeping your body clean can also help reduce the risk of further viral or bacterial infections., For a natural humidifier, consider getting a houseplant. Due to a process called transpiration, in which water vapor is released from the flowers, leaves, and stems, plants can help regulate indoor humidity. Indoor plants also help clear the air of carbon dioxide and other pollutants such as benzene, formaldehyde, and trichloroethylene.


Good indoor plants include aloe vera, bamboo palm, weeping fig, Chinese evergreen, and various species of philodendron and dracaena., Smoking deprives the body of the necessary oxygen required to repair and build cells by narrowing the blood vessels that carry blood to the leg and arm muscles and to the brain. This can lead to many respiratory and heart illnesses, difficulty breathing, and even stroke. Cigarette smoke can irritate nasal tissue, often leading to frequent headaches and chronic coughing, also known as smoker’s cough. If you already suffer from congestion, this can increase the duration and severity of your condition.


Try to avoid secondhand smoke and other hazardous fumes which can also cause irritation and discomfort. Ask your doctor about ways to reduce and quit smoking.If you cough a lot at night, or have excess congestion at night, try to lie on the side that is least congested to breathe comfortably and allow the mucus to drain."

Have warm soup.,
Eat pineapple.,
Avoid inflammatory foods.,
Use cayenne pepper.,
Get more vitamin C. Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is an important natural antioxidant that helps promote immune function.,
Take coconut oil.",How to Decongest Naturally3," While some foods can cause inflammation, certain foods can also help reduce inflammation to help ease congestion and promote healing. A Mediterranean diet mostly consists of foods that help reduce inflammation, such as strawberries, cherries, oranges, almonds, walnuts, spinach, kale, salmon, mackerel, tuna, sardines, whole grain brown rice, quinoa, millet, oatmeal, flax seed, olive oil, and canola oil.


If you suffer from acid reflux, avoid the fruits with citric acid because they may trigger the condition, causing nausea, irritation, and occasional vomiting., Drinking warm soup produces an anti-inflammatory effect, promotes sweating, and increases movement of nasal fluids. This will help clear your nasal passages and ease congestion. The best way to benefit from this method without adding too much unhealthy sodium into your diet is to make your own broth. For a natural low-sodium chicken broth, boil skinless chicken leg quarters in 2-3 cups of water in a large pot. Add a chopped onion, a tomato, 2-3 celery stalks, 2-3 carrots, or other vegetables for flavor. You may also add herbs such as parsley or thyme. Once it is done cooking, drain the chicken and vegetables out. Drink the broth immediately.


It is important to drink the soup while it is still warm to get the most benefits. This soup should be taken 1–3 times daily until your symptoms reduce in severity or are completely cured.
If you’re using a slow cooker, cover and let it cook on low-medium heat for 6-8 hours, or on high for 4 hours. If you are using a stove or burner, heat until it is about to boil, then let it simmer on low heat for 1 hour.
If you want to make a natural vegetable broth instead, use a variety of vegetables such as onions, parsnips, carrots, celery, leeks, mushrooms, and tomatoes. Lightly brown them in olive oil or canola oil, then add 2-3 cups of water. Bring the broth close to boiling, then reduce heat to low-medium and let it simmer for 90 minutes.
Add lentils or brown rice to add texture. If you like spicy meals, add a 1/2 a chopped cayenne pepper or 1–2 teaspoons of cayenne pepper powder to the broth.
Do not throw away the chicken and vegetables after you drain them. They can be eaten., Pineapples are rich in an enzyme called bromelain, which is used in medicine for reducing the swelling and inflammation of the nose and sinuses that can lead to congestion. Eat two slices of pineapple or drink 2 glasses of pineapple juice on a regular basis to gain the benefits of bromelain. Don't eat pineapples in conjunction with potatoes or soy products. These foods contain substances that may slow down bromelain’s healing properties in the body.


If you are allergic to pineapples, don't eat them as consumption may cause your symptoms to worsen., Certain foods can slow down the body’s healing process, impair the immune system, increase body weight, and cause inflammation. This contributes to an increase in nasal inflammation, which makes congestion worse.

These properties help reduce congestion, coughs, and fevers. Cayenne also stimulates sweating to keep your body cool when you have a fever. Try adding it into each meal in order to promote these beneficial qualities and reduce your congestion.


People who are allergic to latex, bananas, kiwi, chestnuts, and avocado may also have an allergy to cayenne.
Capsaicin should not be used by people with gastric reflux, low blood sugar, or people taking blood-thinning medications. Cayenne may cause nausea and irritation in the throat of young children, so avoid giving cayenne or other peppers to children and infants., People who get enough vitamin C are also likely to have shorter colds and milder symptoms of congestion. Add vitamin C-rich foods to your daily diet. Good natural sources of vitamin C are sweet red peppers, green peppers, oranges, pomelos, grapefruit, limes, lemons, spinach, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, strawberries, raspberries, tomatoes, mango, papaya, and cantaloupe.


You can also take vitamin C as a dietary supplement. A recommended dose is 500 mg split into two or three servings daily. Since smoking depletes vitamin C, smokers may need an additional 35 mg per day., Whenever you have a cold, you can take one to two tablespoons of organic coconut oil with or without meals three times per day.

, Add the specified amount of honey to the jar so it is ready to be mixed with the the horseradish.

, After washing the horseradish root in water, use a vegetable peeler to remove the outer layer of the root, and then rub the peeled horseradish against a grater.


A microplane grater that finely grates foods will work well for horseradish.
It’s a good idea to grate the fresh horseradish in a room that is well-ventilated since it has strong fumes. As a precaution, you can also wear food-safe gloves. Preparing horseradish can make you tear up the same way you do when chopping an onion.
Store the unpeeled horseradish root in a plastic bag in your fridge.
Although it might be tempting to add more horseradish in the hopes that it will help clear up your cough faster, a little goes along way. Large amounts of horseradish can upset your stomach.

, This will increase the potency of the syrup.


Stir the mixture before consuming the syrup to ensure the horseradish is evenly incorporated into the honey.

, Take a few spoonfuls of the syrup as needed to relieve your cough.

, This recipe does not produce much syrup, but keep in the fridge since the horseradish loses its potency at room temperature.


You might need to gently warm the mixture in the microwave since the honey solidifies in the fridge.

If polyps grow larger, however, you can experience complications that will require medical attention. If you have the following symptoms, you should visit the doctor and see if you are suffering from nasal polyps.If they test you and confirm that you have polyps, there are some medical treatments they may recommend.


An excessively runny or stuffed up nose.
Decreased sense of smell and taste.
Pressure on the forehead or face.
Feeling like your nose is clogged when mucus isn't present.
Headaches.
Pain in your upper row of teeth.;
, Steroid sprays can help to reduce the size of your nasal polyps. If the polyps were small enough, they might disappear completely when treated with steroid sprays. Some steroid sprays are sold over the counter at pharmacies, but stronger varieties are available with a prescription. Talk to your doctor about using a steroid spray and see if it would work for you.Some of the common nasal sprays include beclomethasone, budesonide, fluticasone, mometasone, and triamcinolone. Nasonex is the most common brand name for steroid nasal sprays.

, Nasal drops, like nasal spray, help to shrink your polyps. Nasal drops can also clear up congestion, which can help you to breathe more easily while your polyps shrink. Most nasal drops take between 7 and 14 days to begin reducing polyps, and it is generally recommended that you continue to use them for another four to six weeks.When administering nasal drops, you should bend fully forward and downward. You should almost feel like you are about to try to stand on your head. Put the drops in your nose while your head hangs down. Keep your head down for 3 to 4 minutes after administering the drops to make sure that the drops reach your nasal cavity.

, Prednisone is an oral corticosteroid that reduces swelling and inflammation. It can help treat the inflammation in your nose and thus reduce the size of your nasal polyps. You can only get this steroid through a prescription from your doctor. Normally, you would take the steroid for 7 to 10 days., While antibiotics won't help reduce your polyps, they will treat complications that could result from polyps. If polyps block the sinuses, they can cause a sinus infection because the trapped bacteria will multiply. If you have a sinus infection from your polyps, your doctor will probably prescribe antibiotics to fight the infection., While these previous treatments will help shrink your polyps, usually the only way to get rid of polyps completely is with surgical removal. If polyps are persistent and causing significant discomfort, your doctor will probably suggest this option. To surgically remove nasal polyps, you will most likely have to get endoscopic sinus surgery. An endoscope—a long tube that has a light and video camera at the end—will be inserted in one of your nostrils and several tools will be used to remove your nasal polyps. You will be placed under general anesthesia during this operation. Usually you are well enough to go home the same day as your surgery.Remember that in some cases, the nasal polyps will return after two or three years.

, Saline (or salt water) can help to reduce inflammation in your nose and dry up mucus that is blocking your nasal passageways. Salt slows down your body’s production of adiponectin, a chemical that is associated with inflammation.You can mix a half a teaspoon (or less) of table salt into a cup of boiling water and let it cool down to body temperature. Put this mixture in a clean squeeze bottle or a neti pot and rinse out your nasal passages.

, Breathing in steam through your nose will open up your nasal passages and thin out any thick mucus secretions caused by congestion. There are a few methods for using steam inhalation.Close all the windows and doors in your bathroom and run a hot shower to create your own personal steam room.
To make your own steam inhalation setup, boil a pot of water. Pour the boiling water in a large bowl. Place a towel over your head and neck and put your face over the water bowl so that your nose is over the steam. Make sure that the towel is covering your head and the bowl so that no steam is escaping. Breathe in deeply so that you can feel the steam in your nose. Continue to do this until the water cools down.
You can add essential oils like peppermint and eucalyptus to enhance the nasal-clearing effect.

, Eating horseradish is a natural way to clear out your sinuses. Horseradish has antibacterial properties and a flavor and smell that can help to open up your nasal passages and reduce the size of your polyps. Try eating some horseradish. If you hate the strong flavor, mix it with honey.


You can mix 200 mg of horseradish (about 2 cups) with two cups of honey. Keep the mixture in your fridge. Eat one teaspoon in the morning and one at night every day until your sinuses clear up and your polyp begins to shrink.

, Both garlic and onions are known to have antifungal and antibacterial properties that help loosen up nasal glands and shrink polyps. This is because both root vegetables contain quercetin, which helps to reduce inflammation.Try to eat two cloves of raw garlic and some pieces of raw onion twice a day for a week. If you hate the flavor, you can also take garlic and onion supplements.

, This is a herb from East Asia. It is also referred to as ""Fructus Xanthii"" in the ancient Chinese traditional medicine system. It has been used to treat nasal polyps and nasal congestion for centuries. This herb has an anti-inflammatory effect on nasal polyps. It is thought that Fructus Xanthii acts by suppressing part of the inflammatory system., This is also known as or Hydrastis Canadensis.

You must also make sure that the capsicum does not get in your eyes or any open wounds you may have.

, Magnolia is a deciduous tree with bark and flowers that may shrink your polyps. The bark has mucolytic action, which means that it can break down mucus that is blocking your nasal passage. The flowers also have astringent action, which means that they can constrict the mucous membrane of your nose, reducing the size of your polyps.You should not use Magnolia if you are constipated or having digestive issues.

, When you allow your body to rest, it can fight off illnesses and infections much more easily than if it is overworked and tired. Be aware of your limits—while you might think that you can handle staying up all night to finish a report, know that your immune system will likely pay the price. Try to get seven or eight hours of sleep each night. Even just taking a break to nap when you’re tired can help your immune system function properly. , Another part of keeping your immune system healthy is making sure that you get all of the nutrients that you need. The amount of each nutrient that you need will depend on your weight, age, and health. You can talk to your doctor about a diet plan, or click here to learn more about what you should be eating.Try to fit lean protein, whole wheat carbs, unsaturated fats, non-fat dairy products, and lots of fruits and vegetables into your diet each day.
Get between 500 mg and 1000 mg of vitamin C each day. Vitamin C helps to keep your immune system strong and to function. When you don’t get enough vitamin C each day, your immune system can suffer, increasing your chances of getting sick or developing an infection.Vitamin C-rich foods include oranges, lemon, guava, kiwi, strawberries, and papaya.

Gently blow your nose.,
Use steam therapy.,
Spray warm saline solution into your nose.,
Buy and use a Neti pot for nasal irrigation.,
Use herbal oils to decongest.,
Take an over-the-counter (OTC) decongestant.,
Consider an OTC antihistamine instead.,
Ask your doctor about corticosteroid sprays.",How to Clear Nasal Congestion Quickly," Perhaps the easiest and quickest way to reduce nasal congestion is to simply blow your nose into a soft tissue.Unfortunately, it's not always possible to completely relieve congestion by merely blowing, but it's always a good starting point. Combining periodic nose blowing with some of the techniques listed below is likely the best strategy.


When blowing your nose, do it gently, otherwise you risk damaging the delicate nasal/sinus tissues and/or rupturing a small blood vessel.
Always use a soft tissue while blowing as it will prevent irritation, redness and chafing from occurring on the end of your nose and around your nostrils.
Alternatively, consider blowing your nose into a sink without using tissue. While bending over your bathroom sink, cover one nostril and blow, then switch and do the other side. Wash the sink out when you're finished.;
, Breathing in steam (warm water vapor) can be a very quick and potent decongestant because it loosens up the fluid and mucus within your nasal passages and encourages them to drain out through your nose. Inhale the warm water vapor between two to four times a day, but don't directly inhale hot steam because it can burn your nose and nasal passages and make your condition much worse.Boil an electric kettle on the floor and sit in a chair next to it with a towel draped over your head. Bend over and position yourself so the steam rises up into your face and try to take deep breaths through your nose for between five to 10 minutes.
Alternatively, take a long hot shower and breath in the warm humidity through your stuffed up nose while facing away from the water. After about 10 minutes, try blowing your nose a few times.
You can also get some sinus relief by placing a warm, steamy facecloth over your face for a few minutes or until the cloth cools down.
Although not as quick, placing a humidifier in your room at night can help decongest your nasal passages because healthy mucus membranes are meant to be moist.

, Another way of loosening up the fluid and mucus in your sinuses is to spray some warm salt water up into your nose.The warm saline mist can work like a humidifier because it moisturizes the dry tissues within your nasal passages. The salt can also help kill any viruses or bacteria that may be causing the nasal congestion. You can purchase sanitary, pre-made saline solution at the store or make your own.


Boil some distilled water and then add some sea salt while it is cooling down (about a teaspoon of salt per 8-ounces of water and maybe a pinch of baking soda too). Add the saline mixture to an empty, clean spray bottle.
While holding your head back, spray the saline solution into your nostrils then snort it up into your nasal passages. This may cause you to sneeze.
Give two to three sprays per nostril and repeat three to five times daily until the congestion fades away.
If you have a sore throat in conjunction with the nasal congestion, then spray the saline solution into the back of your throat.

, Although several methods of nasal irrigation exist, a traditional and effective one is based on the Neti pot — a ceramic or plastic vessel used in Ayurvedic medicine that looks like a cross between a small teapot and Aladdin's magic lamp.You're meant to fill the Neti pot with a saline solution (see above) and pour it up your nose and then let it drain out, which flushes out and sanitizes your nasal passages.


Once the Neti pot is filled with warm saline solution, tilt your head sideways over the sink at a 45º angle and place the spout into your top (higher) nostril. Gently pour the solution into that nostril and let it drain out the other side.
Spit out any solution that runs into your throat and then blow your nose before doing the other side.
Neti pot nasal irrigation can be done three to five times daily, just make sure to thoroughly clean it after every use.
The Neti pot has been used for centuries in India and Asia, but its becoming much more popular in the U.S. As such, it can now be found at most drugstores and pharmacies.
Always use filtered or distilled water in your Neti pot. If you use tap water, you must boil and/or filter it before use.

, There are a number of herbal oils / extracts / salves that have strong decongestant properties. These herbal products can be added to an overnight humidifier, misting machine, boiling kettle, or even applied directly to the ends of your nose around your nostrils. Common herbs used to help open up your breathing passages include menthol, eucalyptus, camphor and tea tree oil.Olbas oil is a combination of oils meant to help clear your sinuses. Most also have mild numbing and antiseptic properties also.


Approximately three to four drops of concentrated menthol, eucalyptus or camphor oil added to a humidifier is usually enough to last a few hours or so. The closer you are to the spout/vapor, the more effective it will be for relieving your congestion.
Other plant-based aromatherapy products to consider for sinus congestion are rosemary, peppermint or lemongrass.

, In general, decongestants, such as Sudafed, Mucinex and Tylenol Sinus, work by shrinking (constricting) blood vessels that cause your nose to be congested and stuffy.These drugs can be found in virtually all pharmacies and drugstores and they tend to work fairly quickly — typically within an hour. Decongestants come in pill form or nasal sprays and are meant for short-term use only (no longer than three to five days).


For appropriate dosages, read labels carefully. Ask the pharmacist or your doctor is you're unsure about dosages.
Decongestants also tend to dry out the mucus membranes of your nasal passages and sinuses, so make sure to drink lots of water — aim for eight 8-ounce glasses daily.
Decongestants can cause some unwanted side effects such as insomnia (trouble getting to sleep), increased blood pressure, headaches and sinus pain.

, Antihistamines are usually used for nasal congestion caused by allergies — they're also available as pills or nasal sprays for quicker relief.They work by blocking a chemical called histamine, which is over-produced by your body during an allergic reaction. Histamine makes the tissues in your nasal passages swell and get itchy. Many antihistamines cause drowsiness, although some newer formulations tend not to.


Do not drive or operate heavy machinery when you take antihistamines that cause drowsiness, such as brompheniramine (Dimetapp Allergy, Nasahist B), chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton), clemastine (Dayhist, Tavist) or diphenhydramine (Benadryl).If you don't want to get drowsy, then consider using desloratadine (Clarinex), fexofenadine (Allegra) or loratadine (Alavert, Claritin) instead.
For best results, antihistamines should be taken before congestion from an allergic reaction gets well established. The sooner the better.

, Steroidal nasal sprays can be very effective and fast acting for nasal congestion because they have strong anti-inflammatory properties, but some may need to be prescribed by your doctor (others, such as Flonase, are available over-the-counter). Corticosteroid sprays tend to work well for treating allergic reactions (congestion, runny nose, itching, sneezing) and nasal polyps — noncancerous (benign) growths in the lining of the nasal passage that frequently trigger congestion.Corticosteroid sprays work best when used every day, without interruption, for a preset number of days (such as one to two weeks).
Nasal corticosteroid sprays are considered safe for all adults, but not all are recommended for children, so make sure to ask your doctor.
Corticosteroids can lead to a variety of side effects, such as: dryness, burning or stinging in the nasal passages, sneezing, nosebleeds, throat irritation, headaches and increased risk of sinus infections."

Buy a nasal wash kit with salt solution or make your own solution.,
Use a bulb syringe or a neti pot.,
Stand over the sink or over a bath tub.,
Tilt your head forward with your chin to your chest.,
Alternate nostrils several times until you run out of solution.,
Use the nasal wash at once a day in the morning or at night.",How to Clean Your Nostrils1," Nasal washes are good for relieving nasal symptoms if you have chronic nasal issues or sinus problems. Washing the inside of your nose with a salt solution will reduce swelling, improve airflow, and open up your sinus passages. It will also remove mucus from your nose and help to relieve any stuffiness or congestion. Look for nasal wash kits at your local pharmacy or make your own salt solution using household products.To make your own saline solution, combine 1 quart distilled water, 1 teaspoon Kosher salt and ½ teaspoon baking soda in a clean glass jar. Stir the solution and store at room temperature. Replace the solution after a week with fresh water, salt, and baking soda.
Do not use tap water. If you don't have distilled water you can sterilize tap water by boiling it for at least one minute, then allowing it to cool back down to room temperature. This will kill harmful contaminates.;
, In order to rinse your nose effectively with the salt solution, you will need a bulb syringe or a neti pot, which is a tea pot with a long spout made for your nose.You can find bulb syringes and neti pots at your local drugstore or pharmacy.


Wash your hands well before you do a nasal rinse to prevent the spread of bacteria and germs. Then, fill the bulb syringe or neti pot with the saline solution.

, When you are using the nasal wash, you will need to stand over an area that can collect any water or mucus that drips from your nose or from the bulb syringe.Place the bulb syringe in your left nostril and gently squirt the mixture into your left nostril. Aim the stream toward the back of your head, not the top of your head. Do not inhale through your nose as you squirt. The bulb syringe should be able to get the solution into your nose without any inhalation on your part.
If you are using a neti pot, place the spout in your left nostril and tip the pot up so the solution enters your nose. If the solution does not flow out of the neti pot, lift the pot so it is positioned a bit higher than your head but do not turn your head over your shoulder. Try to keep your forehead above your chin., This will allow excess solution to drain out of your nose into the sink or bath tub. You can hold a wash cloth under your chin to help collect any excess solution. Do not swallow the solution if it gets in your mouth. Spit it out into the sink or tub.After you have cleared out your left nostril, you may should rotate your head so you are facing the sink or tub and exhale sharply through both nostrils. This will help to remove any excess mucus or water. You can also use a tissue to wipe off any excess mucus or water. However, do not press down on one nostril while blowing through the other nostril, this can put pressure on your inner ear canal.
Repeat the same process with your right nostril using the bulb syringe or the neti pot and the salt solution.

, There may be a mild burning sensation in your nose when you use the nasal wash for the first several times. This is a normal reaction to the salt in the solution and should become less noticeable with repeated use of the nasal wash.If the solution continues to irritate your nose, it may not be salty enough or too salty. Taste the salt solution to determine if it too salty (you taste too much salt) or not salty enough (you can barely taste the salt). Adjust the solution so you can taste the salt but it is not an overpowering taste.If you develop a headache after using a nasal wash, your forehead may have been lower than your chin, leading to some water draining into your frontal sinus. After some time, the water should drain out on its own.

, If your symptoms become more severe or you develop a severe infection, increase the dose to twice a day.It can be difficult for your children to use a nasal wash. Assist your child when they are using the nasal wash and make sure they do not lie down when using the nasal wash. The nasal wash is more effective when done while sitting or standing.

The type of saline mixture that works best, on the other hand, depends on the nature of your baby’s stuffy nose:


Isotonic solutions have the same salt concentration as human blood and cells.They are better for children suffering from colds or allergies.You can purchase them, or to make your own, combine 1 cup of warm water with ½ a teaspoon of salt and a pinch of baking soda.Hypertonic solutions have a higher concentration of salt than the average human blood and cells.They are better for children with chronic congestion.You can purchase them, or to make your own, combine 1 cup of warm water with 1.25 teaspoons of salt and ¼ teaspoon of baking soda.Hypotonic solutions have a lower concentration of salt than human blood and cells. They usually aren't effective at reducing nasal symptoms.;
, You will be touching both the saline and your child’s nose, and you don’t want to introduce any new germs.Wash your hands with soap and water for about 20 seconds, or the time it takes to sing ""Happy Birthday"" twice.If you can't wash your hands, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Hand-washing is always preferable, though.

, You can cradle your baby in your arm or place him or her on a flat surface. You will need to keep your child in this position for 5 minutes after delivering the drops, so make sure you're both comfortable., Hold your baby’s head back gently but firmly, as you may get some resistance. Place the tip of the dropper or spray just into your baby’s nostril, without actually touching the nose. If you are using a spray, spray once or twice into each nostril; if you are using drops, insert 3 drops into each nostril., This allows the drops to flow into the nasal passage. If your baby starts to cough, help him or her to sit up., After you use the spray or drops, your baby may sneeze, releasing mucus. Sometimes, instead, the mucus simply runs out on its own.

Hot peppers, such as jalapeno, habanero or serrano pepper
Horseradish or wasabi
Spicy ginger
Fenugreek
Onion and garlic

, A vapor rub containing menthol will temporarily clear congestion and allow you to breathe more easily for an hour or two. Rub a bit of salve on your upper lip beneath your nose and allow the vapors to work their magic.

Set the dishwasher to a low heat setting.,
Run a light wash cycle.",How to Clean a Neti Pot1," Situate the pot upside down so that water will be able to flow through it during the wash cycle. Keeping the neti pot at a distance from the force washing action will prevent it from becoming damaged. On the uppermost rack, the device will receive a more gentle cleaning.Protecting your neti pot from damage is especially important if it’s constructed of a breakable material like ceramic or features a lot of small, delicate pieces.Set the lid, along with any other removable parts, on the rack next to the pot.;
, If your dishwasher allows you to change the temperature settings, set it as low as it will go. Intense heat can melt or warp neti pots made of plastic.

Once you have released the spray, breathe out through your mouth.
If you have been instructed by your doctor to use two sprays in each nostril, repeat these steps again on the same nostril. If you are only using one spray in each nostril, repeat these steps again in the other nostril.

, It is important that you keep the applicator clean so you do not spread germs and bacteria in your nose when you use the spray. You should also keep the nasal spray covered with the dust cover to prevent tiny particles from getting into the spray.Store the nasal spray in a dry spot at room temperature, not in your bathroom where the air can be humid and moist. If the applicator becomes clogged, you can soak it in warm water and rinse it with cold water. Dry it well and store it properly. Do not use pins or a sharp object to remove the blockage as this can contaminate the nasal spray.

, Always check the nasal spray label for a list of ingredients. If you think you may be allergic to fluticasone or any other ingredients in the spray, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. If you are on any antifungal medication or steroid medications, you should tell your doctor or pharmacist. You may need to adjust your dose or be monitored for side effects of the spray. If you experience any of the following side effects, you should stop taking the nasal spray and see your doctor immediately:Headache, dizziness, nausea, diarrhea, or vomiting.
Dryness, stinging, burning, or irritation in your nose.
Bloody mucus in your nose, nosebleeds, or thick nasal discharge.
Vision issues or severe face pain.
Fever, chills, coughing, sore throat, or other signs of an infection.
Hives, a rash, or severe itching.
A whistling sound from your nose.
Swelling of your face, throat, lips, eyes, tongue, eyes, hands, feet, ankles or lower legs.
Hoarseness, wheezing, or difficulty breathing or swallowing.
If you have had surgery on your nose in the past month or injured your nose, you should go see your doctor before using nasal spray. As well, if you have sores on your nose or any eye issues, you should talk to your doctor before using any medications for your nose.

Use an aspirator in conjunction with saline drops or spray.,
Choose your type of aspirator.,
Use saline drops or spray to loosen the mucus.,
Position your baby.,
Use the aspirator to remove mucus from your baby’s nostrils.,
Repeat if necessary.,
Clean your aspirator after use.",How to Clear a Baby's Stuffy Nose2," Using an aspirator with saline drops or spray has been shown to be more effective than saline solution or an aspirator alone.The saline drops or spray thins and loosens the mucus in the nose, which the aspirator can then more easily suck out.

, All types of aspirators work, so choose the one that you feel most comfortable using and feel offers the best results.


Bulb aspirators, which are shaped like turnips, are frequently given to parents of newborns at the hospital and have been shown to be effective in improving breathing.The NoseFrida (Snotsucker) and BabyComfyNose both have filtered tubes through which the parent can suck snot from their baby's nose. Though studies of these devices are limited, they do create greater suction than a bulb aspirator and appear to be at least equally effective at reducing congestion., Using the method elsewhere in this article, apply saline drops or spray to your baby’s nostrils. This will soften and loosen the mucus.

, You can hold your baby in your lap or put your baby down on a flat surface, facing up. Choose whichever position seems most comfortable.

, The method will depend on the type of aspirator.


Bulb Aspirator – Squeeze the bulb, then insert the tip about ¼ inch into the baby’s nostril, angling the tip to the side. Release the bulb to suck the mucus out of the nose and into the aspirator. Remove it from your baby's nose and empty the contents onto a tissue by squeezing the bulb repeatedly. Repeat on the other nostril.NoseFrida or BabyComfy – Insert the tip of the device into the baby’s nostril and suck on the suction tube with steady pressure to remove snot. If using a BabyComfyNose, consider putting a tissue in the snot collection chamber to insure you do not suck up any snot.Remove the device from your baby’s and blow the contents onto a tissue. Repeat on the other nostril.

, Use saline drops or spray before each use if the mucus is very thick.

, Whether using a bulb aspirator, NoseFrida, or BabyComfy, be sure to clean it with hot, soapy water after use.


Bulb Aspirator – Put the tip in hot soapy water and squeeze to fill with soapy water. Shake, then squeeze the bulb to empty the syringe. Repeat this process with clean, hot water to clear out the soap.NoseFrida or BabyComfy – Remove the suction tube and clean the tip of the device with hot, soapy water. Rinse with hot water to remove the soap.

Steam up the bathroom.,
Moisten the air in your baby’s room with a humidifier.,
Do not try steam inhalation from bowls of hot water.,
Do not use a device that produces hot steam.",How to Clear a Baby's Stuffy Nose3," Before putting your child to bed, run the shower to steam up your bathroom. Sit or stand with your baby in the steamy room for 5 minutes. The moist air will thin and loosen mucus, helping your child to breathe.Do not take your child into the shower, as the hot water may burn him or her.

, Always use a cool-mist humidifier. Hot or warm mist could cause burns.Place the humidifier near your baby, and aim the mist away from the crib to avoid wetting the bedding.Change the water daily and clean the unit with bleach or Lysol to prevent mold growth., In the past, doctors sometimes recommended filling a bowl with hot water and letting your child inhale the steam, but studies show that this method leads to a high risk of burns. It is no longer recommended for children., Vaporizers are no longer recommended due to the danger of burns.For warm, wet air, take your child into a steamed up bathroom.

Get your baby to sneeze.,
Raise your child’s bed.,
Do not use vapor rubs for children under 2.",How to Clear a Baby's Stuffy Nose4," Tickle the tip of your baby’s stopped up nostril with a piece of soft material like a tissue or string, or blow gently into one nostril. Be sure to have a tissue ready in case you are successful.

, Raising the head of your baby’s crib can help mucus to drain down their nasal passages. Place books or boards under the legs at the head of the crib to safely raise the bed. Never place a pillow in the crib with your child., The menthol, camphorated oil, and eucalyptus oil found in vapor rubs are all potentially life threatening for babies if swallowed,inhaled,or applied to the skin."
"
Call your doctor.,
Call the doctor immediately if your baby is under 3 months of age.,
Call emergency services if necessary.",How to Clear a Baby's Stuffy Nose5," In babies over 3 months of age, call your doctor if your congested child has any of the following symptoms with a stuffy nose, which could indicate the presence of a cold or other infection:A temperature over 100.4 degrees F (38 degrees C).
Reduced urine output
Ear pain or unusual irritability
Red eyes, or greenish or yellow eye discharge
Swelling of the forehead, eyes, side of the nose, or cheek
Persistent cough
Trouble breathing
White or yellow spots on his or her throat
Nasal discharge that had a foul smell or is a color other than white or yellow
A cough that produces mucus or lasts longer than 10 days
Symptoms that last more than 3 weeks

, If your infant is under 3 months old, call your pediatrician as soon as you see signs of a cold. A cold in babies can quickly develop into something more serious, and it interferes with their ability to drink milk, leading to potential dehydration., In some cases, a cold or other infection can turn worse rapidly. If you see any of the following symptoms, call emergency services or seek immediate medical attention:Your baby coughs hard enough to make him vomit
You see changes in your baby's skin color
Your baby coughs up blood
Your baby has trouble breathing
Your baby turns blue around the lips and mouth

Use a steam treatment to loosen the mucus.,
Hydrate!,
Use a humidifier.,
Make your own nasal saline solution.,
Irrigate your nasal passage by using a neti pot.,
Exercise.,
Bathe in essential oils.,
Sleep.,
Get calm.",How to Clear Nasal Congestion2," When you have time for more than a hot shower, create a steam treatment to relieve congestion. Steam treatments have been a staple of sick, congested people the world over for centuries.


Bring 3 cups of water to boil. When it has come to a boil, remove the water from the stove top.
Let some chamomile tea steep in the water while it is cooling (optional).
When the steam is cool enough to pass over your hand without burning it, pour the water or tea into a bowl.
Being mindful of the warm steam, place your face over the bowl, cover your head with a towel, and breathe in deeply. If you cannot breathe in through your nose at first, breathe in through your mouth.

, Drink water or juice as much as possible. For quick relief from congestion, drink 6-8 cups of water. This helps build up the immune system and shrink swollen nasal passages.

, Humidifiers (and steam in general) are recommended as treatment for congestion because dry air irritates the membranes in the sinus, causing the symptoms to be more pronounced.Therefore, wet air is recommended by many doctors.


If you don't have, or don't want to buy, an actual humidifier, you can build a rudimentary one yourself using commonplace items around your home. Boil enough water to fit in a large pan, remove from the heat, and place the hot water in a safe part of your room. The steam coming from the water will humidify the room. Repeat as necessary.
When using a humidifier, a little goes a long way. You don't want conditions to get so damp that your room becomes a tropical jungle. A little moisture in the air, just enough to turn it a bit moist, is all you need.

, Salt water can serve as unmedicated saline solution. Add one teaspoon of salt to one cup of water, stirring to dissolve. With an eye dropper, deposit a few drops of the saline solution into one nostril while your head is tilted back. Blow the solution out of your nostril and repeat in the opposite nostril.

, For some, nasal irrigation may bring quick relief of sinus symptoms without the use of medications.The neti pot works by thinning out mucus and flushing it out of the nasal passage.


All neti pots come with their own set of instructions that should be followed. Typically, however, one first prepares an irrigating solution made up of 16 ounces lukewarm (and sterile) water, along with 1 teaspoon of salt. Fill your neti pot with the saline solution.
Tilt your head at a 45 degree angle and bring the tip of the neti pot to your top nostril. The saline solution will go into one nostril, travel through your nasal cavity, and come out of the other nostril. If the solution drips into your mouth, just spit it out. Blow your nose and repeat the process on the other side.
How often should you irrigate with a neti pot? People suffering from severe sinus problems or allergies found relief irrigating daily.Once symptoms get better, the recommended usage is three times per week.
In some parts of the world, water may be contaminated with naegleria fowleri, an amoeba that, if inhaled through the nose, can cause a usually fatal brain infection. The CDC recommends boiling water for at least one minute (three minutes at higher elevations) before using it in a neti pot rinse solution, or buying sterile water from a store., Although it's the last thing you want to do, moving around helps your body refresh. An easy way to clear congestion fast is to do twenty push ups, only breathing through your nose. Your brain knows its in need of more air, so it will help to stop nasal swelling and thin mucus levels.

, Certain essential oils help loosen mucus and clear the sinuses. Fill the bathtub with warm water and add ten drops of eucalyptus oil, rosemary oil, or tea tree oil. Rest in the bathtub until your nasal passages are clear and breathing becomes easier.

, While it might seem overrated, take off from work or school to stay home and sleep all day. This gives your body time to heal and begin fighting your cold. If you have trouble sleeping because of congestion, try medication, Breathe Right strips, or breathe through your mouth. (Use chapstick if you breathe through your mouth, because it could dry out your lips.)

, Stress slows the immune system down. The more stressed out you are, the longer it will take to clear out your sinuses.

Use an over-the-counter decongestant.,
Use an antihistamine.",How to Clear Nasal Congestion3," Decongestants can be purchased at your local drugstore. They come in several different varieties:


Decongestant sprays, such as naphazoline (Privine), oxymetazoline (Afrin, Dristan, Duramist), or phenylephrine (Neo-Synephrine, Sinex, Rhinall).Pill form, such as phenylephrine (Lusonal, Sudafed PE, Sudogest PE) and pseudoephedrine ( Sudafed, Sudogest).Do not take a decongestant spray for more than three days, as it may worsen symptoms. In addition, do not take oral decongestants for more than seven days without conferring with your doctor. Follow all instructions on over-the-counter decongestants.

, Antihistamines, along with other allergy medicines, are beneficial in relieving some congestion. Opt for antihistamines that also contain a decongestant so that you can treat sniffling and sneezing along with mucus and sinus pressure. Try these natural antihistamines for organic variety:


Stinging nettle. Some doctors recommend taking a freeze-dried preparation of stinging nettle, which is known for its ability to reduce the amount of histamine the body produces.Coldsfoot may be effective as a natural antihistamine. Europeans have a long history of using the plant to cure skin conditions. The leaves can either be ground up into a paste or coldsfoot extract can be ingested in pill form.
Basil may also work as a natural antihistamine. Heat a couple sprigs of basil leaves up under some steam and breathe steam in. Basil may help reassure the body that the histamines it's sending out can be reduced.

Be ready to answer several basic questions.,
Expect the first line of defense to be antibiotics and prescription drugs.,
Prepare for an endoscopy, when a camera is placed up your nose for diagnosis.,
Ask about somnoplasty to cure some chronic cases of congestion.,
Understand that your doctor will only recommend surgery in extreme cases.,
Ask about laser turbinate surgery (LTS) for minimally invasive, extra-quick decongestion.",How to Clear Nasal Congestion4," Nasal congestion has a host of potential causes, and you won't get good treatment without honest answers. Some potential questions your doctor will ask include:


Amount of time congested. If longer than seven days, see a doctor immediately.
Color of mucus
Other symptoms, including aches, fever, coughing, etc.
Any known allergies.
Whether or not you smoke., Most nasal congestion is a symptom of a cold or other infection. Accordingly, most doctors will start with drugs to fight the infection off.


Be sure to tell the doctor if you take any other drugs or medication regularly.

, It sounds uncomfortable, but topical anesthetic makes it pain-free and easy. A thin camera is snaked into your sinus to look for polyps, septum deviations, or infections. If your symptoms persists, expect this to be the doctor's first move after drugs.


The alternative, a radiologic (x-ray) study, is both expensive and impractical, but may be needed for extreme or difficult cases.

, This easy, 15-minute procedure uses heat to open up your sinuses and clear blockage. You will be put under local anesthetic and will likely be out the door within an hour.


While you will have hot needles in both nostrils, most patients hardly feel a thing.
There will be congestion for the first 1-2 weeks as you heal.
If the procedure does not work, it can be repeated several weeks later.
This is usually performed by an ENT doctor in their office, not at the hospital., If you have a major infection or blockage, you might need endoscopic sinus surgery. A rigid camera will be placed up your nose, which is used to guide a surgeon trying to remove diseased areas or opening up natural cavities.


Surgery is almost always outpatient. You will return home that day.
Pain is minimal, and you should feel as good as new within a week or less.
Revisions are occasionally necessary, though the success rate is high., Turbinates are the structures in your nose that cause congestion. Using CO2 or KTP lasers, they are shrunk down within 20 minutes. There is no packing needed and you can return to work the same day.


You may have light congestion for a week before everything clears up.
You will have mild local anesthetic -- no needles needed.
The drawback of LTS is the expense. It may not be offered at all clinics."

Blow your nose gently.,
Sit up.,
Wash out the mucus with a neti pot.",How to Decongest Your Nose2," Blowing your nose hard and fast can get rid of germs and mucus from your nostrils, but the high pressure can also force it back into your nose and sinuses. Instead, blow your nose gently to get more mucus out of your nose. Using a soft tissue, close one nostril by pressing your finger against one side of your nose, and blow gently out the open nostril., Although you may want to lay down to rest while you are sick, laying down can make it harder for your sinuses to drain. Sitting up rather than laying down will help to drain your nose. Sitting up will pull the fluid out of your nose and make it easier to clear. Try using pillows to prop your head up at night and also when you are resting., Pouring lukewarm water inside your nose can help clear the mucus buildup. Try using a neti pot, which is a container used to pour salt water through a long thin spout into the nose.


Fill the neti pot with a solution of lukewarm water and salt. This solution is meant to mimic natural body tissues and fluids.Mix about 16 ounces (1 pint) of lukewarm water with 1 teaspoon of salt to create the solution for your neti pot.To use a neti pot, tilt your head sideways over the sink and place the spout of the neti pot in the upper nostril. Breath through your mouth and gently pour the solution into your upper nostril so that the liquid drains through the lower nostril. Repeat on the other side.
Rinse the device after each use with sterile, boiled or filtered water.

Be aware that decongestant medicines and sprays can have some serious side effects.,
Consider taking an over-the-counter decongestant.,
Try a decongestant nasal spray.,
Limit the length of time that you use a nasal spray.",How to Decongest Your Nose3," If you are on any medications or if you have a medical condition, then you should speak to your doctor before trying any over the counter medicines or nasal sprays. For example, if you have an enlarged prostate, glaucoma, heart disease, high blood pressure, or thyroid disease, check with your doctor or pharmacist before use because all decongestants, including sprays, can worsen these conditions. Your doctor can advise you on what medicines are and are not appropriate for you. Keep in mind that the potential side effects of decongestants include:Irritation to the lining of your nose, which may include nosebleeds
A skin rash
Headaches
Dry mouth
Restlessness or anxiety
Tremor (uncontrollable shaking and trembling)
Problems sleeping (insomnia)
Rapid and/or irregular heartbeat
Noticing your heart beating inside your chest (palpitations)
Increased blood pressure

, Over-the-counter decongestants (those not requiring a prescription) include phenylephrine and pseudoephedrine as main ingredients. They work by constricting the blood vessels in the nose. This reduces how much blood flows through the area so that swollen tissue inside the nose shrinks and air can pass through more easily.Phenylephrine comes as a tablet, a liquid (spray), or a dissolving strip to take by mouth. Also, it is an ingredient in many cold/flu medications. Follow directions on the bottle on its use.Pseudoephedrine comes as a regular tablet, a 12-hour extended-release (long-acting) tablet, a 24-hour extended-release tablet, and a solution (liquid) to be taken by mouth. Follow the directions on the package., Nasal sprays help to clear congestion by shrinking blood vessels in your nose and reducing swelling. Ask your doctor about a prescription nasal spray or buy an over-the-counter nasal spray.To use a nasal spray canister:Gently blow your nose to clear it of mucus before using the medication.
Shake the canister before using it.
Keep your head upright and breathe out slowly. (Tilting back your head can lead to increased absorption into your body and increase side effects.)
Use your finger on the free hand to close the nostril on the side not receiving the medication.
Place the tip of the canister in your nostril and press down as you begin to breathe in slowly through your nose. Repeat these steps for the other nostril.
Try not to sneeze or blow your nose just after using the spray.

, Do not use a nasal spray for more than three days. Using a nasal spray for more than three days can lead to rebound congestion, a condition in which the congestion returns.


If your congestion lasts more than three days, use a nasal spray for the first three days then switch to an oral decongestant. Do not use both at the same time as this can increase risk of side effects."
"
Tell your doctor about all of your symptoms.,
Ask your doctor about prescription medications.,
Call your doctor if you experience any severe symptoms.",How to Decongest Your Nose4," Your doctor will take a detailed history of your current symptoms and past medical history as well as any associated symptoms/signs such as fever, headache, coughing, shortness of breath, etc.


During your exam, your doctor will look at the inside of your nose with a penlight, check your ears for any fluid buildup, touch your cheekbones and/or forehead for sinus tenderness, and feel for any swollen lymph nodes around your neck.
Your doctor may also order blood work to check the number of immune fighting cells present in your body (WBC). If they are elevated, chances are there is an infection or something causing inflammation such as allergies.
Your doctor may refer you to an ENT physician (ear, nose, and throat doctor) for the referral if further expertise or tests are needed.

, Most nasal decongestants can be purchased over the counter without a prescription. Depending on the cause of the congestion, other medications may be needed. For example, sinus infections may require antibiotics to fight bacteria, while asthma and other serious inflammation disorders may require the use of steroids.

, In some cases, congestion may become severe or be accompanied by other serious symptoms. Call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following:


Nasal congestion is lasting more than ten days.
You have a high fever, and/or it lasts more than three days.
Your nasal discharge is green and is accompanied by sinus pain (pain around your cheekbones or forehead) or fever. This may be a sign of a bacterial infection.
You have asthma, emphysema, or you are taking medications that suppress your immune system, such as steroids. This may increase the risks of infections.
You have blood in your nasal discharge or a persistent clear discharge after a head injury. The clear fluid or blood may be coming from your brain after a head injury."

Remove the lid.,
Rinse out the inside of the pot.,
Add a few drops of soap.,
Scrub the pot with a bottle brush.,
Rinse the pot again using boiled or distilled water.,
Allow the pot to air dry.",How to Clean a Neti Pot2," Take the lid off of the pot and rinse the underside with hot water. Set the lid aside on a clean towel. You’ll be cleaning this along with the rest of the pot.

Don’t neglect the clean the lid of the pot. Though it doesn’t come into direct contact with your nose, it’s possible for bacteria to infiltrate the pot as used solution is pulled back into it.

, Run a stream of hot water directly into the pot. Swirl the water around to make sure you hit the entirety of the interior. When you empty the water, pour it out through the spout. This will help flush out bacteria and traces of used irrigation solution.A preliminary rinse will wash away most unwanted contaminants and should be performed immediately following ordinary usage.

, It’s recommended that you use a mild cleanser, like liquid dish detergent or antibacterial all-purpose soap. Squeeze the soap into the bottom of the pot, then fill it up about three quarters of the way full with hot water. For best results, leave the soap solution to soak for a few minutes before scrubbing.Never use soaps containing harsh chemicals or astringent agents. Besides being hazardous to put in your body, these compounds are capable of causing structural damage to the device itself.

, Take a clean (or recently sterilized) bottle brush and insert it through the opening in the top of the pot to clean the interior. Gently scour the pot inside and out, covering as much surface area as you can. Scrubbing the pot will loosen unseen bacteria and possible buildup from the irrigation solution, while the soapy water cleans and disinfects.Rotate the neti pot as you scrub to make hard-to-reach spots more accessible.
Don’t forget to go over the inside of the lid with the brush while you’re at it.

, Flush out the spout and the area around the lid thoroughly. Refill and empty the pot repeatedly until the water is completely clear. There should be no soap solution remaining when you’re finished.Tap water may contain chemicals and other contaminants that can be potentially harmful if introduced to your sinuses.When inadequately rinsed, the soap can form a thin film over the inside of your neti pot, causing irritation to your sinuses.

, After rinsing, shake the excess water from the pot and position it upside down so that it can finish draining as it dries. And, of course, leave the lid off to prevent moisture from becoming trapped inside. When your neti pot is fully dry, it can be refilled and returned to action.If moisture becomes trapped in your neti pot, it can lead to the growth of mold and bacteria.
You can also dab the outside of your neti pot dry using a clean microfiber towel. Avoid towels made from cotton or similar fabrics—these can leave behind small fibers that will then end up in your irrigation solution."
"
Wash your neti pot after every use.,
Use the right type of water.,
Don’t share your neti pot with anyone else.",How to Clean a Neti Pot3," Get in the habit of cleaning your neti pot with soap and water as soon as you’re done with it. That way, you’ll never have to worry about residual bacteria or mineral buildup. You should also run your neti pot through the dishwasher periodically to give it a complete sanitizing.Don’t skimp on the cleaning process. A simple rinse won’t be enough to effectively clear away harmful bacteria.
Disinfecting your neti pot is key to practicing safe, responsible hygiene.

, It can be dangerous to irrigate your sinuses using regular tap water. Instead, go with distilled water or purified bottled water. You can also boil about a quart of water and use it to clean your nasal passageways after letting it cool to room temperature.All sorts of foul things, from caustic chemicals to microscopic brain-eating amoebas, have been known to lurk in water straight from the faucet.
If you’re preparing sterile water for your neti pot at home, make sure to bring the water to a steady boil for no less than one minute., Since there’s often some bacteria remaining on the spout after it’s been inside your nasal passages, letting someone else use your neti pot increases the risk of transferring these bacteria. This is true even if the device has been cleaned between uses. Play it safe and make sure your sinuses are the only ones your neti pot sees.Neti pots are like toothbrushes, loofahs or retainers—everybody should have their own.

Use black seed (black cumin).",How to Stop a Sneeze1," Catch the part of your nose above the tip and stretch it out as if you are removing your nose out of your face. It should not be painful, but simply stretch out your cartilage, stopping the sneeze.;
, Use a tissue and blow your nose when you feel a sneeze coming on. It should clear your sinuses of what caused the sneeze in the first place.

, Using your thumb and forefinger, pinch your upper lip lightly and press it upward toward your nostrils. Your thumb should head toward one nostril and your forefinger toward the other, bunching up your upper lip slightly.

, Press your tongue behind your two front teeth, where the roof of your mouth meets the gum palate or alveolar ridge. Press hard with your most powerful muscles against your teeth until the tickling sensation dissipates.

, Find a small table anywhere in your home, hold your face about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the top of the table and stick your tongue out; the sneeze should subside naturally. It takes about 5 to 7 seconds. If it doesn't work, at least, whoever's around will get a good kick out of it!

, Tickle the roof of your mouth with the tip of your tongue when you feel the sneeze coming on. Continue until the urge to sneeze dissipates. This should take 5 to 10 seconds.

, Spread the thumb of one hand away from the fingers. Using the sharp edges of the nails on the thumb and index finger of your other hand, pinch the flap of skin between the spread thumb and the fingers.

, This is a pressure point that some grab to stop a headache, and it can work with sneezes, too. With your thumb and forefinger, pinch between your eyebrows until you feel a substantial amount of pressure.

, With the side of your forefinger (hand held horizontally beneath your eyes), press into the cartilage on your nose, just beneath the bone of the bridge of your nose. This will pinch one of the nerves involved in triggering a sneeze.

, Wiggle your ear lobe gently as you feel a sneeze coming on. This can be masked as looking like you are playing with an earring or something if you're stifling a public sneeze.

,, Clench your teeth together, but try to stick out your tongue (use the muscle to push against the back of your front teeth). Push as hard as you can! The stimulation may stop the sneeze from materializing.

, You can buy this online or at your local vitamin/herb shop. Take a handful and wrap it in a cloth—handkerchief, washcloth, etc.—then roll it in your hand to break it up a little bit. Hold this next to your nose and inhale it for a few breaths. Your sneezing should clear right up!"

Gather your materials.,
Make the saline solution.,
Consider adding baking soda (optional).,
Fill your spray bottle and store the remaining solution.Once the solution has cooled to room temperature, it's ready to use.",How to Make Saline Nasal Spray1," Making a saline solution is simple because all you need is salt and water!Sea salt or table salt are both acceptable for a saline solution, but use a non-iodized salt (pickling or kosher) if you have an iodine allergy. To administer the solution nasally, you'll also need a small spray bottle. One that holds one to two ounces is ideal.


Infants and small children aren't able to blow their noses effectively. Get a soft, rubber-bulb syringe to remove nasal secretions gently and efficiently.;
, There's more to making saline that just mixing salt and water. For the salt to effectively dissolve into the water, you must raise the water temperature. Boiling the water will also kill off any potentially dangerous microbes living in the tap water. Boil 8 oz. of water, then allow it to cool until just ""very warm."" Add ¼ teaspoon of salt and mix well until the salt dissolves. The ¼ teaspoon of salt will make a saline solution that matches the amount of salt in your body (isotonic).


You may want to try a salt spray that has a greater concentration of salt than your body (hypertonic). This is useful for significant congestion with a lot of discharge. If you're having trouble breathing or clearing your nose, consider a hypertonic solution.To do this, simply add 1/2 teaspoon of salt instead of 1/4 teaspoon.
Don’t use a hypertonic solution for infants or small children younger than five years old.

, A half teaspoon of baking soda will adjust the pH of the solution. This makes it less likely to sting a sore nose, especially with hypertonic solutions with a higher salt content. Add it while the water is still warm, and mix well to dissolve the baking soda.


You can add the salt and the baking soda all at once, but adding the salt first usually results in easier mixing.

, Fill the one to two ounce spray bottle with the solution, then pour the rest into a covered container and refrigerate it. After two days, throw out any unused solution and make a new batch if necessary.

Detect your cold quickly.,
Take a cough suppressant.,
Take a decongestant.,
Take an expectorant.,
Increase your vitamin C intake.,
Go see a doctor.",How to Cure a Cold Fast1," Symptoms begin almost immediately after you’ve contracted the virus. Signs of the common cold include runny nose, sore throat, cough, congestion, slight body ache, mild temperature, and mild fatigue.If you want to have a chance of curing your cold fast, you need to act fast. After the first 12 hours of your cold, it will have spread enough to last for days. You must fortify your body’s defenses.;
, Use a cough suppressant only if you have a dry cough. Cough suppressants include dextromethorphan and codeine. However, you may need a prescription for codeine. Side-effects can include drowsiness and constipation. Dextromethorphan is available as a tablet or syrup and can come in combination with an expectorant. If you have a 'chesty' cough and are coughing up any mucus, do not take a cough suppressant, as this could increase the chances of developing a chest infection. Instead, ask the pharmacist for an 'expectorant' cough syrup.

, Nasal decongestants — either liquid or pill form — help shrink blood vessels in the nasal membranes and allow the nasal passages to open up. Phenylephrine (like Sudafed PE) and pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) are two over-the-counter decongestants proven to help with colds.


You can also get decongestants as a nasal spray over-the-counter. All it takes is one or two quick squirts and you’ll start feeling some relief. Nasal sprays contain oxymetazoline, phenylephrine, xylometazoline, or naphazoline. Use only as directed. Using it more than 3-5 times a day can actually increase that stuffy feeling.Side effects of decongestants include insomnia (sleeping problems), dizziness, and increased blood pressure. Do not use oral decongestants if you have heart issues or hypertension. Use under a doctor’s direction if you have diabetes, thyroid problems, glaucoma, or prostate issues., An expectorant is a form of over-the-counter medication which clears the sinuses by thinning mucus and loosening phlegm that may have settled in your lungs. This will allow you to breathe easier and leave you more comfortable.


Expectorants are available over-the-counter at your local pharmacy. They are usually taken in liquid form, but they can also be found as tablets and powders. Currently, the only over-the-counter expectorant available is guaifenesin. Look for this active ingredient when searching for medications. Mucinex is the most common brand name guaifenesin-containing medicine sold in pharmacies.Be aware that expectorants, like all medications, may have side-effects. Those most commonly associated with this form of medication include nausea, vomiting and drowsiness. If you experience any of these symptoms, you should stop taking the expectorant immediately., Vitamin C has long been touted for its cold-preventing properties, but did you know it can also help to shorten the duration of a cold?Up your intake by drinking orange juice and eating foods like strawberries, kiwis and leafy green vegetables, which have a high vitamin C content.
You can also take a vitamin C supplement, available in tablet form in drug and health food stores. The recommended dosage is 90 mg a day for men and 75 mg a day for women, according to the National Institutes of Health., Your body has the capabilities to fight off most colds, but a doctor can provide prescription assistance to relieve symptoms. However, do not ask your doctor for antibiotics for a cold, they will not improve your symptoms or the duration of your cold.


If you are experiencing any of the following symptoms, then you should contact your doctor immediately:
Earache/loss of hearing
Fever above 103 degrees
Fever above 101 that lasts for more than 3 days
Shortness of breath/wheezing
Bloody mucus
General symptoms that last more than 7 to 10 daysSore throat with a fever, but no cough and no runny nose. This may indicate strep throat, which should immediately be treated with antibiotics to prevent heart complications.
Cough with a fever, but no runny nose and no sore throat. These symptoms may indicate pneumonia and should also be treated with antibiotics.

Smell some spices.,
Sniff a bit of capsicum extract.,
Sniff a fizzy drink.,
Open a stick of peppermint gum.",How to Make Yourself Sneeze1," Smelling certain spices can cause you to sneeze. Try searching your cupboard for a bottle of spices, such as ground black pepper, cumin, coriander, or crushed red pepper. You can open the bottle and sniff the spices or use them in your cooking and inhale through your nose as you add them.Grinding the spices can also cause you to sneeze. Try grinding a few peppercorns with a mortar and pestle to bring on a sneeze.;
, Capsicum is naturally derived from hot peppers, and is used in both medication and pepper spray. You can purchase a bottle of some capsicum extract or look for a product that contains it already. Don’t apply the extract to the inside of your nose because it will burn. Instead, dab a cotton swab against the top of a capsicum extract bottle and hold the cotton swab in front of your nose. Inhale the scent of the capsicum through your nose.If you do not have capsicum extract, then you can also cut open a hot pepper, such as a jalapeno or chili, and dab the inside of it with a cotton swab. Then, inhale the scent of the capsicum through your nose.

, Sniffing a carbonated beverage, especially from a soda fountain, may be all the stimulation your nose needs to let loose a sneeze. Simply drinking a carbonated beverage may work, but you can also hold the cup right under your nose and inhale through your nose.This should cause you to sneeze.


Make sure that the soda is really fizzy. If it is flat, then there might not be enough bubbles to bring on a sneeze.

, Some people sneeze from smelling peppermint. If you have some mints or peppermint gum around, then try popping one in your mouth. Inhale the scent as you enjoy the gum or mint and it may cause you to sneeze.You can also try sniffing a bottle of peppermint essential oil if you have some. Just open the bottle and inhale the scent of the oil through your nose.
Sniffing mint toothpaste may also work. Just open the cap of your toothpaste and inhale the scent through your nose.

Get a tissue or handkerchief.,
Open your mouth and close your eyes.,
Press one nostril closed with your finger.,
Blow gently into the tissue through your open nostril.,
Switch nostrils and blow again.,
Wipe your nose.,
Take care of the tissue or handkerchief.,
Wash your hands.,
Help your mucus flow more easily.",How to Blow Your Nose," The type of material you blow into is a matter of preference, and completely up to you. Some people like tissues, while others prefer old-fashioned handkerchiefs. In some cases you'll have to grab whatever's in reach, since you can't always predict when you'll need to blow your nose. Here's a rundown of the different choices:


Tissues: these are made of soft paper and sometimes doctored with lotion to help soothe the skin on your nose, which can become dry and irritated after a lot of nose blowing.
Handkerchiefs: these are generally made of soft cotton, which is said to be easier on the skin than paper. Make sure to use a clean section each time you blow, and wash your handkerchiefs often, since handkerchiefs can become breeding grounds for bacteria.
Toilet paper or paper towels: use these only as a last resort. They're made of scratchier paper and sometimes treated with chemicals that are irritating to the skin.;
, This releases pressure from your face, and for some it makes the experience of blowing your nose more comfortable. Open your mouth just slightly, and close your eyes if you feel like it., It doesn't matter which nostril you start with. Choose one and use your finger to press it closed.

, Hold it to your nose and blow gently until the nostril is cleared. Remember not to blow too hard or force it; if nothing comes out, just stop blowing. It may be helpful to move the finger holding your nostril closed to different areas as you gather breath to gently blow again. Try closing your nostril up close to the nasal bone and all around the soft area of the nose.

, Cover the nostril that was open, and blow through the nostril that was closed. Again, don't blow too hard; give a gentle blow, then stop., Give the outside area a good wipe with a clean section of your tissue or handkerchief. Make sure your nose is dry and no mucous is left on the outside of your nose.

, If you used a disposable tissue, toss it out into a trash receptacle. If you used a handkerchief, fold it so that the used part is contained within the folds.

, This will prevent you from transferring germs to people with whom you might shake hands as well as surfaces you'll touch as you go about your day. Use soap and warm water, then dry your hands with a clean towel.

, If your nose feels clogged, and you're having trouble blowing, there are a few ways you can help your mucus flow so you can clear your sinuses. Instead of trying to force it out, help it gently flow by trying the following:


Drink plenty of water and warm drinks to hydrate yourself
Take a steamy shower, since hot steam helps clear the sinuses
Use a neti pot
Eat something spicy

"
"
Use a saline nasal spray.,
Get a neti-pot.,
Take oral decongestants.,
Use a medicated nasal spray.,
Take an oral antihistamine product if your sinus pressure is caused by allergies.,
Take over-the-counter pain medications.,
Apply warm compresses to your face.,
Drink plenty of fluids.,
Eat spicy foods.,
Ask your doctor about bromelain and quercetin.,
Ask your doctor about Sinupret.Several studies suggest that Sinupret (also known as BNO-101)--a proprietary formula that contains several herbs including European elder, common sorrel, cowslip, European vervain, and gentian--significantly reduces symptoms of sinusitis.Talk with your doctor to see if this herbal treatment is appropriate for you.

Recognize the difference in sinus pressure pain and a migraine.",How to Release Sinus Pressure," A saline nasal spray helps to clear your nasal passages of mucus, and to moisturize your nasal passages. Use the spray as directed, and be patient. The first couple of uses may be helpful, but it will likely take repeated uses to get the full benefit., A neti-pot is a device that resembles a small teapot. Used correctly, a neti-pot flushes out mucus and trapped irritants, and moisturizes your sinus passages. The device works by putting saline or distilled water in one nostril and allowing it to drain out the other, removing unwanted irritants and germs, and provides a moisturizing and soothing effect to the sinuses. A neti-pot can be purchased inexpensively over-the-counter., Talk to your doctor before taking over-the-counter products if you have existing medical conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes, and glaucoma. Products like these can be helpful, but they don’t work for everyone.


Oral decongestants contain the active ingredients phenylephrine and pseudoephedrine. The more common side effects caused by these products include nervousness, dizziness, feeling that your heart rate is increased, slight elevations in blood pressure, and sleep problems.Oral decongestants work by narrowing blood vessels in the nasal passages, helping the swollen tissues to shrink. This improves the flow of mucus to reduce the pressure and the flow of air so you can breathe easier.Products that contain pseudoephedrine, originally marketed as Sudafed®, can be purchased without a prescription but are kept behind the pharmacy counter due to concerns about inappropriate use.You will be asked to provide identification, like a driver’s license, and your purchase will be recorded. This is only done for your safety to control the illegal use of pseudoephedrine., Decongestant nasal sprays or drops are also available over-the-counter but should be used with caution. While these products can help to clear sinus passages and relieve the pressure quickly, using them for more than 3 days results in a rebound effect.A rebound effect means that your body adjusts to the medications being used, and the congestion and pressure returns, or is possibly worse than before, when you try to stop using them. Limiting their use to no more than 3 days prevents that rebound effect., Sinusitis, or sinus pressure and congestion, can be caused by allergies. Taking an over-the-counter antihistamine, such as Claritin®, Zyrtec®, or their generic equivalents, can help to control the allergic response and relieve the symptoms you are experiencing., Acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or naproxen may help to reduce the discomfort associated with the sinus pressure. Taking ibuprofen or naproxen may also help to reduce some of the inflammation in the nasal passages.Other symptoms that may be helped by over-the-counter pain medications include the associated headache, and discomfort often described as an ache in the teeth., Use a warm, moist, towel placed against your face to help relieve the pressure and get the mucus and air moving again.Try alternating between hot and cold compresses. To do this, place a hot towel across the sinus areas on your face for 3 minutes. Switch to a cold damp cloth or towel for 30 seconds, then return to the hot towel. Repeat this procedure, alternating between hot and cold, for 3 cycles. Repeat the treatment about 4 times a day., Drinking fluids keeps your mucus from getting thick and blocking your sinuses. Drinking something warm, like a cup of hot soup or hot tea, can help to relieve the congestion and pressure. Plus, drinking fluids can help to counteract any dryness that may be caused by over-the-counter decongestants., Some people find it useful to eat spicy foods, like chili peppers, to help reduce the discomfort associated with sinus pressure., Bromelain is an enzyme derived from pineapples, and quercetin is a plant pigment. They may help relieve inflammation, swelling, and other symptoms of sinusitis. However, because they can interact with certain medications, you should always consult with your doctor before starting these or any other herbal treatment to ensure that they are safe for you.Bromelain may increase your risk of bleeding, so people who take blood-thinning drugs may not be able to use it.
Bromelain can cause a larger drop in blood pressure when used with ACE inhibitors.
Quercetin may interact with some medications, including antibiotics.

,, Get plenty of rest and position yourself so that you can breathe. This may mean sleeping on your side, if that allows your nasal passages to open. You may benefit from sleeping in a more upright, or propped-up, position that allows you to breathe more comfortably., Pressing on specific areas of your face, located above your major sinus areas, can sometimes provide temporary relief.Pressure point areas include the area directly between your eyes, both sides of the nostrils, the bridge of the nose, under the cheeks, around your eyebrows, and the area that is centered just above your lips and under your nose. Gentle pressure, massage, or tapping in these areas may help to relieve some of the pressure., Chlorine in pools is a cause of sinusitis for many people. Other triggers may be more subtle, such as dust or pollen build up on your sheets and pillows. Regularly wash your bedding in warm or hot water to cut down on irritants that you may be breathing in while you sleepSome foods have been associated with sinus pressure and mucus build-up such as milk, cheese, and other dairy products. Other foods that cause problems include white rice, pasta and white bread. Clearly these food items do not affect everyone negatively. Try to identify any foods that may trigger your sinus pressure problems.Avoid alcohol while you have sinus pressure. Drinking alcoholic beverages can cause the swelling in your sinus passages to get worse., Moisture in the air helps to keep your nasal passages moist, and allows the mucus to move freely and relieve the pressure. Breathing dry air can cause mucus to thicken, and cause the sinuses to become irritated., Humidifiers are available in many sizes and with different features. Basic humidifiers are available as either cool-mist or warm-mist. Choose a humidifier that best meets your needs, and your budget. A humidifier increases the moisture in the air to help treat, and prevent, dry nasal passages that can lead to sinus pressure and congestion.Cool-mist humidifiers usually have a filter that needs attention every few months to avoid fungal growth. Many cool mist varieties can produce enough moisture for an entire home, and may be a safer option if you have children.Warm-mist humidifiers use a heating element that creates steam. An advantage to warm-mist humidifiers is that they kill bacteria and fungi since steam is produced in the process of adding moisture to the air., Place a small pot, partially filled with water, on a burner on your stove, and let it simmer. This is a great way to add moisture to the air, but requires added attention and a strong focus on safety. Pay attention to safety measures with this method to avoid damage and possible injury., Very carefully, place a towel over your head and position yourself above the simmering water. Then breathe in the warm and moisture-filled air to help relieve your sinus pressure. Breathing steam is an effective method of providing moisture to your sinuses, but the risk of injury may warrant trying other methods first. This requires serious attention to safety measures to avoid injury., Safely placing a heat-safe container near a radiator or other source of heat causes the water to evaporate, increases the humidity, and adds moisture to the air. The container does not need to be placed directly on top of the heat source, but close enough to allow the water to evaporate.Consider using a damp towel as your water source, and place the towel over a heat vent. When the heat is on, the dampened towel will help to improve the moisture in the air. Take care not to damage flooring, or permanently block the vent., Let the shower run using hot water. Close the shower door, the bathroom door, and the door to the adjacent room for 5 minutes. Then turn off the water and open the doors. This is a good method to increase the level of humidity in the air. This may not be for everyone, since in some areas, using more water than normal is an added monthly cost., Consider adding an indoor retractable clothesline, or support bar, to a room in your home. Drying your clothes this way increases the humidity of the inside air. Between washer loads, use dampened towels hanging from the line., Use a spray bottle to dampen the curtains, then open the windows and allow the airflow to help add moisture to the inside air. Take care not to damage fabric, and avoid opening your window if pollen, or other outdoor irritants, are part of your sinus pressure problem., The United States Geological Society recommends adding a houseplant to increase the moisture in the air. When the houseplant is watered, the moisture is transferred from the roots of the plant to the stems and pores in the leaves, and adds moisture to the room air., Even simple bowls containing fresh water, can add moisture to the air. Place small bowls or containers of water, possibly decorated with artificial flowers or glass marbles, throughout your home. Consider placing the containers near a heat source, such as a radiator.Get a fish tank or indoor fountain. Adding an appliance that contains water, like a fish tank or fountain, can help to provide moisture in the room air. In addition, they may help to provide a more relaxing atmosphere or add to your décor. These involve additional expenses, plus are dependent on personal preference., Continued sinus pressure, congestion, pain, or running a fever, may indicate that you have developed a sinus infection.When your sinuses get blocked with congestion, the mucus and bacteria that is normally produced gets trapped. If the congestion and pressure are not relieved, the trapped bacteria can lead to a sinus infection. You may also get a viral sinus infection if the congestion and pressure was caused by a cold or the flu., If your doctor determines that you have developed a sinus infection, antibiotics may be prescribed for you. Be sure you take them exactly as prescribed, and for the full duration of the prescription. Even if you start to feel better quickly, finish the prescription since the bacteria can still be lingering in your sinus passages., The discomfort that is caused by sinusitis is very similar to the headache pain caused by migraines. In fact, studies have shown that as many as 90% of people that seek medical attention for sinus pressure headaches are actually experiencing a migraine.Talk to your doctor if you have headache symptoms for more than 15 days each month, if you frequently take over-the-counter medications for headache pain, if you find the over-the-counter medications do not help, or if the symptoms interfere with your daily life, like attending work or school. These are typical warning signs of migraine headaches."

Rub your hands and fingers together to warm your fingers.,
Locate the indentation of the eye sockets.,
Apply finger pressure directly on the indentation of the eye sockets.,
Apply pressure to your cheeks.,
Stop the massage if you feel any pain.",How to Massage Your Sinuses1," Warm hands and fingers are more comforting for the sinuses than cold hands and fingers. Cold hands and fingers can cause muscle tension.


One option is to place a small amount of oil on your palm (about a quarter-sized amount). The oil helps to lessen the friction caused by your hands rubbing against your face. The scent of the oil may also help to promote relaxation. Good oils to use for a sinus massage include almond oil, baby oil, or castor oil. Just make sure to not get any of it in your eyes while you massage close to those areas.;
, The indentation of the eye sockets are located on either side of where the bridge of the nose meets the ridge of the eyebrows. When pressure is applied to this area, it can help to relieve colds, sinus congestion, frontal sinus headaches and tired eyes.Use your thumbs. The thumbs are recommended because they tend to be stronger than other fingers. For other people, using the index finger may be more comfortable. Do whatever feels the most soothing and comfortable for you.

, Do this for one minute The amount of pressure you apply should be somewhere between pleasant and firm.


Then, press your fingers into the area and move them in a circular motion for two minutes.
Keep your eyes closed as you massage this area.

, Move your thumbs, or alternatively, your index and middle fingers so that they are placed on either side of your cheek, just outside each nostril. When pressure is applied to this area, it can help to relieve nasal congestion and sinus pain.Apply firm and constant pressure on your cheeks for about a minute.
Then, move your fingers in a circular motion for two minutes.

, If there is a buildup of pressure in your sinuses, this basic massage may be felt as a little intense, and this is normal. However, if you feel any deep pain, you should stop and try an alternative remedy or consult your doctor.

Inhale warm, moist air.,
Take a hot shower.,
Give yourself a custom steam treatment.,
Get a humidifier or vaporizer.,
Hydrate heavily.,
Use a saline spray.,
Use a nasal irrigation tool.",How to Alleviate Nasal Congestion1," Inhaling steam can help to clear your nasal passageways and allow to you to breathe more comfortably.There are several ways to breathe steam safely.For an especially quick option:


Soak a clean towel in hot water and wring it out until the towel is damp.
Make sure the towel is a safe temperature.
Place the towel over your nose and mouth and breathe deeply and evenly.;
, Turn the shower on at the hottest water setting. Let it run for a few minutes to steam up the bathroom. Be sure to reduce the temperature to a safe, warm temperature before entering the shower. Breathe deeply, and relax!

, Heat distilled water to just below boiling and pour it into a container that is stable and heat safe. Secure the container by setting it on a flat surface and make sure the rising in steam is not too hot to breathe safely. Lean over the container and deeply breathe in the steam. For maximum steaminess, tent a towel over your head and the container.

, This may be an especially worthy measure to take if you’re spending time in an environment with dry air. Both add moisture to the air, which will ease congestion due to a cold or dry nasal passages.Vaporizers increase air humidity by producing steam, and some include features that allow you to vaporize menthols or other additives that may further increase your comfort.

, This is an important step, both in the short and long term. Staying hydrated can help keep your mucus thin, which can help keep your nasal passages from blocking up.As a rule of thumb, men should drink at least 13 cups (3 liters) of liquid per day, and women should drink nine cups (2.2 liters).When ill, you should be drinking even more!
Hot tea, clear broth, and hot water with lemon and honey are great beverages options, as rising steam will immediately improve breathing, and hydration is a key aspect of getting and staying healthy!Just make sure they are not so hot you burn your mouth!
Avoid beverages with alcohol, high amounts of sugar, and caffeine. These drinks can work against your body’s ability to stay hydrated., Saline spray, which is actually just salt water, will often immediately alleviate congestion-related discomfort.


Make your own saline spray with 1 teaspoon of table salt and 2 cups of warm water. Stir until salt is dissolved and apply to nostril with a nasal syringe., Some readily available options include squeeze bottles, bulb syringes, or Neti-pots. Flush the nasal passages with a sterile saline solution. This will remove thickened mucus and allergens that are the most likely culprits of nasal congestion. Make your own saline solution by mixing 16 ounces of lukewarm water with 1 teaspoon of salt. Adding a ½ teaspoon of baking soda will reduce the stinging sensation. Squirt the solution into one nostril, then let it drain through your nasal cavity and out the other nostril. Be sure to keep your mouth open and don't breathe through your nose."

Quit setting yourself up for sanitation.,
Know if you suffer from ""sun sneezing."",
Be prepared.,
Keep the allergens at bay.",How to Stop a Sneeze2," That's right -- sanitation. It's a legitimate medical disorder where you can't stop sneezing because your stomach is full. It generally happens immediately after consuming quite a large meal. So how do you avoid it? Don't eat so much.


In case you're as curious as George, it's a backronym -- Sneezing Non-controllably At a Time of Indulgence of the Appetite—a Trait Inherited and Ordained to be Named. Originally it was a portmanteau of sneeze and satiation.Now that you know it's a real thing monitor your eating activity. When do you usually find yourself sneezing?

, If you find that you sneeze when exposed to bright lights, you could have photoptarmosis or the photic sneeze reflex. It's present in a remarkable 18-35% of people and is sometimes referred to as ACHOO - Autosomal dominant Compelling Helio-Ophthalmic Outburst syndrome. The more you know, right? It's hereditary and can be treated with antihistamines if it's inconvenient.Otherwise, wear sunglasses (polarized, especially) or scarves. If bright lights (or the sun) are present, keep your eyes away and focus on something darker or more neutral. This is doubly important if you are operating a motorized vehicle.

, If you're entering a high sneeze-risk environment (say a cloud of pepper or a field of pollen), take precautions to keep your sneezing fits at bay.


Keep a tissue on hand. Often sneezing and blowing your nose go hand in hand.
Have a way to wet your nostrils. This can stop sneezing fits before they start. Though snorting water is definitely a feasible option, you may want to stick with wetting a tissue and applying to your nostrils, using your eyedrops, or sniffing the steam from a cup of coffee., For those of us that don't suffer from the completely random sneeze attack and are privy to more constant bouts, it may be more of an environmental thing. In addition to talking to your doctor, be allergy smart. A certain amount of sneezing can be prevented.


Get on antihistamines. Not only will these fight sneezing, but they'll keep the coughing, runny nose, and itchy eyes away to boot. Benadryl is known to induce drowsiness, but other medications, like Claritin, have significantly fewer side effects.Keep your windows and doors closed. This goes for your home and in your car. The less exposure you have to allergens the better. The outside needs to stay outside.If you've been outside for a long time, take a shower and change your clothes. You may have dragged in those pollen buggers with you."

Know when not to stop a sneeze.,
Sneeze healthily.,
Sneeze politely.,
Sneeze safely.",How to Stop a Sneeze3," A sneeze, known technically as a sternutation, is a major deal for the body. The typical sneeze removes air from your body at speeds up to 100 mph (160 km/h), tremendous velocities that can cause serious injury if incorrectly stifled. That's why you should never try to stop a sneeze that is in progress.


For example, do not hold your nose or block your mouth while sneezing. Doing so can cause serious injury. The force and velocity of the average sneeze, if prevented from ejection from the body, can eventually cause hearing loss and damage the blood vessels in your head, especially if you make a habit of stopping a sneeze when it's already begun.

, If you're around others, you risk spreading harmful bacteria when you let one (or two or three or maybe even four) out into the air. The ""spray"" you emit can reach up to 5 feet (1.5 m) away from you! That's a radius that encompasses a lot of people. So be careful!


If you can, sneeze into a tissue and dispose of the tissue. If a tissue isn't available, sneeze into your sleeve. If you do end up sneezing into your hands, be sure to wash them afterward. Your hands touch doorknobs, your face, surfaces, and other people constantly. And, if you happen to be away from water, carry hand sanitizer to save the day., When you're in a group of people, you'll surely be given the evil eye if you wind up for a sneeze and deliver with flying success. You're spreading germs and disrupting the flow, so it's best to sneeze as discretely as possible.


Sneezing into your elbow can diffuse the sound. If that's not an option, grab a tissue, tilt your head down, and sneeze as quietly as possible.

, If you have a broken rib, a sneeze can hurt very badly. Exhale as much air from your lungs as you can. This will reduce the amount of pressure placed on your ribs and weaken the sneeze greatly, and the pain will be less.


Really, if anything in your core hurts, a sneeze can be the last thing you want to encounter. Take the precautions listed above, but concentrate on the exhale. With little air to expel, your insides won't lurch, preventing the sneeze from having a longer-lasting effect.

Use the nasal solution whenever you feel congested.,
Consider using a bulb syringe to administer nasal spray to babies and small children.,
Suction children’s nasal secretions with the bulb syringe.Administer the nasal spray just as you would for an adult, then wait two to three minutes to let it work.,
Maintain proper hygiene after using the bulb syringe.Wipe any secretions on the outside of the syringe off with a tissue, and discard the tissue.,
Repeat this two to three times a day.,
Stay hydrated.,
Be gentle in blowing and clearing your nose.,
Have a doctor examine infants and small children.",How to Make Saline Nasal Spray2," The small bottle will make it easy to carry around in your pocket or purse. The nasal spray should loosen up the nasal secretions blocking up your nose. Blow your nose after using the nasal spray to remove the blockage.


Lean forward and angle the spray nozzle into the nostril, toward the ear.Spray one or two squirts into each nostril. Use your left hand for your right nostril, and your right hand for your left nostril.
Sniff gently to keep the saline solution from dripping right out of your nose. Make sure not to snort it back into your throat, though, as this may cause irritation in your septum.

, Squeeze out about half the air in the bulb and draw up the salt solution into the bulb. Tilt the child's head back slightly and hover the tip of the bulb over one nostril. Drop three to four drops of the solution into each nostril, avoiding touching the inside of the nostril with the tip as best you can (it can be hard to do this with a wiggling baby!). Try to keep the child's head still for two to three minutes while the solution goes to work.

, After that, you can use the rubber-bulb syringe to gently remove secretions from the child's nose. Use a soft tissue to gently wipe away any secretions that remain around the nostrils. Remember to use a new tissue on each nostril, and make sure to wash your hands before and after each treatment.


Tilt the child's head back slightly.
Press on the bulb to remove about 1/4 of the air from it, then gently insert the tip into the nostril. Release the bulb to suction nasal secretions into the rubber-bulb syringe.
Do not insert the tip deep into the child's nose. You're only removing the material in the front part of the nostril.
Try to avoid touching the inside of the nostril, as it could be sensitive and sore during illness.

, Wash the rubber bulb syringe in warm, soapy water immediately after you've finished using it. Suck soapy water in and squeeze it back out several times. Repeat with clean, un-soapy water. Swirl the water around inside the bulb to remove secretions from the walls.

, You don't want to overdo it with the rubber bulb syringe. Your child's nose is already sore and irritated. If you fiddle with it all the time, the child will only feel more pain. At most, suction nasal secretions four times a day.The best times to do this is before feeding or bed, to help your child breathe better while eating and sleeping.
If the child squirms too much, just relax and try again later. Remember to be very gentle!

, The simplest way to improve nasal congestion is to keep your body moisturized. This keeps the discharge thin and fluid, making it easier to blow your nose or drain. The discharge may drain down the back of your throat. While this is unpleasant, it's normal and healthy. Drinking hot tea or chicken soup may be especially helpful in keeping you hydrated.


Drink at least eight to ten 8 oz. glasses of water every day. Drink even more if you have a fever, or if your illness causes vomiting or diarrhea., To prevent the skin of your nose from drying too much, use Vaseline or a hypoallergenic skin lotion or cream. Apply it to a Q-tip and gently spread it around your nostrils as needed. You can also use a humidifier or just place bowls of water throughout the house. The water will evaporate and humidify the air. Rest and relax as much as possible!

, For infants, nasal congestion can be a serious problem. It can cause difficulty with both breathing and feeding. Call your physician within 12-24 hours if the nasal spray does not help.


Call your physician immediately if your infant or young child has nasal congestion along with any fever, cough, trouble breathing, or trouble feeding due to the congestion.

Consider a wide range of possibilities.,
Look for signs of viral infection.,
Take antibiotics for bacterial infection.Bacterial infections can have widely varying symptoms, including fever.,
Watch for symptoms of sinusitis.Sinusitis is a condition in which the sinuses get inflamed and swollen, causing mucus buildup.,
Determine whether your lights are too bright.Bright lights are a fairly common cause of nasal congestion.,
Get tested for allergies.Your nasal congestion may be the result of an allergic reaction you don't even know about.,
Remove irritants from your environment.,
Ask your doctor about your medications.,
Consider any hormonal changes.Hormones control many functions throughout the body and can affect many different systems.,
Get examined for anatomical problems.It may be that there are no infections, medications, or hormonal fluctuations causing your congestion.",How to Make Saline Nasal Spray3," Nasal congestion can point to many different causes. The most common causes are infections like cold, flu, and sinusitis and allergies. Environmental irritants like chemicals or smoke can also cause congestion. Some people have chronic runny nose — a condition known as vasomotor rhinitis or VMR., Viruses are difficult to treat because they live in the body's cells and reproduce very quickly. Luckily, the most common viral infections are cold and flu, which resolve on their own with time. Treatment is essentially about managing the symptoms and staying as comfortable as possible. To prevent the flu, get an annual vaccination before flu season begins.The symptoms of cold and flu include:Fever
Runny or stuffy nose
Clear, green, or yellow nasal discharge
Sore throat
Coughing and sneezing
Fatigue
Muscle aches and headaches
Watery eyes
The flu has additional symptoms: a higher fever (over 102 °F or 39.9 °C), nausea, chills/sweats, and loss of appetite

, Most bacterial infections are diagnosed clinically or occasionally by a nasal or throat culture. The doctor will be prescribe the antibiotic most likely to treat the most common bacteria. The antibiotic will either kill the bacteria or stop it from reproducing, allowing the immune system to fight the remaining infection.


Always take the full course of antibiotic treatment, even if you feel better. If you stop taking the treatment before the doctor recommends it, the infection may return.

, It can be caused by a cold, allergies, or bacterial or fungal infections. Though it can be irritating, sinusitis can usually be treated at home without medical intervention. More severe or persistent sinus infections are usually treated with antibiotics. Symptoms include:


Thick yellow or green nasal discharge, often found in the throat as well
Nasal congestion
Tenderness and swelling around the eyes, cheeks, nose, and forehead
Lowered ability to smell and taste
Coughing

, The eyes and nose are closely related, so stress on the eyes can affect the nasal cavity as well. Try dimming the lights in your home or work environment slightly to see if your nose clears up at all.

, Make an appointment to get tested for allergies at your doctor's office if you have chronic or severe nasal congestion, especially with itching or sneezing, or think you may have allergies. The doctor will perform a test in which he injects tiny amounts of common allergens into your skin. Only the patches of skin with substances you're allergic to will swell up slightly, like a mosquito bite. This will allow you to either seek treatment (oral or nasal medication, or even injections) or avoid those allergens. The most common allergens include:


Dust mites
Foods: milk, gluten, soy, spices, shellfish, and food preservatives
Pollen (Hay fever)
Latex
Mold
Peanuts
Pet dander

, Every single time you inhale and exhale, you're dragging your external environment through your nose. If the air around you is the source of your nasal irritation, you can take steps to change your environment. Common irritants include:Tobacco smoke
Exhaust fumes
Perfumes
Dry air (buy a humidifier)
Sudden changes in temperature

, You may be taking a medication to treat a condition that has nothing to do with your nose, but a side effect of that medication may be causing your nasal congestion. Provide your doctor with a list of all prescription and over the counter medications you're taking. If one of the drugs is causing your congestion, the doctor may be able to suggest alternate treatment. Congestion commonly arises from:


High blood pressure medicationsOveruse of decongestant nasal sprays
Drug abuse

, Hormonal changes and disorders can have an impact on your ability to drain your nasal passages normally. If you are pregnant, have thyroid disorder, or in any way suspect hormonal changes, speak with your doctor. He or she may be able to help you control your hormones and reduce the impact on your congestion.

, It could just be the way your nasal anatomy is constructed. Ask your general practitioner to refer you to a specialist if you are unable to get your nasal congestion under control. A specialist will be able to diagnose whether a physical abnormality is interfering with your breathing. Common anatomical problems include:


Deviated septum
Nasal polyps
Enlarged adenoids
Foreign body in the nose

This is especially common in children. This often causes a thick nasal discharge with a bad odor, and it is often only on one side of the nose.

Blow your nose correctly.,
Try using a sinus or saline irrigation container to clear your nasal passages.,
Use steam treatments.,
Take a hot shower.,
Drink hot fluids.",How to Cure a Cold Fast2," It's natural to want to blow your nose when you're feeling stuffed up, but just be careful not to overdo it. While blowing your nose can indeed help to clear the nasal passages of excess mucus, blowing too hard or too frequently can actually have adverse effects.In fact, some experts suggest that blowing your nose can lead to a build up of pressure due to trapped mucus, which causes further damage to your nasal passage.You can avoid this by blowing only when absolutely necessary, and by using the correct blowing method.
The correct blowing method involves closing one nostril with your finger, then blowing very gently to clear the other one. The same process is then repeated on the other side. Make sure to wash your hands with antibacterial soap after you blow, to avoid spreading the cold virus.Prevent your nose from becoming irritated due excessive nose blowing by using soft cotton handkerchiefs and by using a little petroleum jelly to moisturize and lubricate the nostrils., Any kind of bottle or container with a thin spout can be used with a saline solution to thin and flush mucus from the nasal passages.


Make your own saline solution by mixing half a teaspoon of kosher salt into a cup of water.
Fill the container with the saline solution, tilt your head to one side (over a sink), and insert the spout into one nostril and pour. The solution should flow in one nostril before coming out the other. When the water stops dripping, blow your nose gently, then repeat the process on the opposite side, Steam can be really useful when it comes to clearing your head. The heat of the steam loosens mucus while the moisture from the water helps to relieve dry nasal passages.Use steam in one of the following ways:Give yourself a steam facial by boiling a pot of water. Pour that water into a separate bowl and then place your face over the steaming water. Hold a towel over your head to keep the steam in. Add a couple of drops of a sinus-clearing essential oil (such as tea tree or peppermint) to maximize the sinus-clearing benefits.

, Yes, even if you're feeling under the weather, you shouldn't skip your daily shower as it can actually help to clear a cold faster. Heat the water to a high, yet comfortable temperature and let the bathroom steam up as much as possible. If the heat leaves you feeling a little weak or dizzy, consider bringing a plastic chair or stool into the shower with you.


A hot, steamy bath can work wonders for you when you have a cold - not just in terms of decongestion, but also in terms of relaxation and heat. Again, try to make the water as hot as possible. If you decide to wash your hair (either in the bath or shower) remember to dry your hair thoroughly afterwards, as damp hair can cause you to lose body heat, which is not good for a cold.

, There's nothing more comforting than a hot drink when you're suffering from a nasty cold. But beyond the comfort factor, a hot drink can actually help to clear your nasal passages and soothe a sore throat, making it the perfect cold-busting remedy.


Herbal teas, such as chamomile and peppermint, are a good option, as they are soothing and hydrating. Regular tea and coffee can help to perk you up if you're feeling groggy, but are not as good for hydration.
One traditional cold remedy which still packs a punch is a simple drink made from warm water, lemon, and honey. The warm water clears congestion. The lemon boosts the immune system and the honey soothes a sore throat. Simply add a slice of fresh lemon to a cup of warm water and add honey to taste.Chicken soup has long been the chosen sustenance of cold patients and not just because it's comforting and easy to eat. There is actually scientific evidence to back up the idea that chicken soup limits the production of certain white blood cells which contribute to cold symptoms."

Take some time off.,
Get plenty of rest.,
Stay warm.,
Drink lots of fluids.",How to Cure a Cold Fast3," One surefire way to make your cold drag on and on - for days or even weeks - is to continue with your normal routine and not give your body time to recuperate. The best way to get over a cold quickly is just to take a few days off, hold up somewhere warm and cozy, and give your body a break.


Even if you're reluctant to take time off work, just think of your co-workers - they don't want you spreading your germs around the office! You're doing them a favor by staying home.
Aside from that, the common cold is a virus which attacks and weakens the immune system, making you more susceptible to contracting other illnesses or your cold becoming worse. Therefore, staying in your home environment is the safest option, at least until you start to feel well again.

, Try to remember that your body is doing its best to fight off the cold virus and it needs all the energy it can get in order to win. Over-exerting yourself with housework, exercise, traveling, or other physical activities will just prolong the cold and make you feel worse. Ensure that you are getting at least eight hours of sleep a night and take frequent naps during the day.Even if you can't sleep, try curling up on the couch with a warm blanket and a hot drink , Use this time as an excuse to binge on multiple re-runs of Friends or read the entire Harry Potter series.
When sleeping, try to prop your head up on an extra pillow. It may feel a little strange if you're not used to it, but the raised angle will aid in the draining of your nasal passages. If it really feels uncomfortable, try placing the extra pillow beneath the bottom sheet or under the mattress on your bed, for a less severe angle., What's the opposite of cold? Warmth! (Well, sort of). Even though cold weather or ""catching a chill"" doesn't actually cause a cold (the cold virus does), staying warm during the recovery process will help. So turn up the thermostat, light a roaring fire and pile on the blankets -- you'll feel much better soon.


Despite the benefits of heat, dry heat can actually irritate inflamed nasal passages and sore throats. You can combat this by using a humidifier to add moisture back into the air. This can help to make breathing more comfortable.
Just be aware that humidifiers can spread pathogens and molds., All that nose blowing and sweating it out under heavy blankets can leave you feeling dehydrated, which can worsen cold symptoms, leading to headaches and dry, irritated throats.


Try to drink slightly more than average when you're sick - whether the fluids come in the form of hots teas, soups, water-heavy fruit and veg (watermelon, tomato, cucumber, pineapple), or just plain water.
A handy way to check for dehydration is to examine your urine. If it's very pale yellow or almost clear, you're doing okay. But if it's dark yellow, this means that there are higher concentrations of waste in your body that are not being diluted, which is a sign that you should drink more water.

Take a pain reliever/fever reducer.,
Gargle salt water to ease your sore throat.,
Take elderberry syrup.,
Eat a spoon of raw honey.,
Eat garlic.,
Take natural supplements.",How to Cure a Cold Fast4," If you have aches or a high temperature, your main two choices are acetaminophen (Tylenol) and NSAIDs (non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen). Avoid taking NSAIDs, if you have acid reflux or peptic ulcer disease. If you are already taking a NSAID for other issues, talk to your doctor before taking more. Do not take more than the prescribed amount, as indicated on the bottle. Too much of either medicine can lead to liver toxicity. You don't want to develop a worse condition while trying to fight off another., Congestion isn't the only nasty symptom you have to contend with during a cold - dry, itchy, or sore throats can be equally bothersome. An easy, natural way to deal with this is to gargle a salt solution. The water hydrates the throat, while the antiseptic properties in the salt help to fight infection. Make the solution by dissolving a teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water. If the taste is too unpleasant for your liking, add a little baking soda to take the edge off the saltiness. Gargle this solution up to four times a day. Do not swallow. , Elderberries are said to be a great natural immune booster, and are therefore very popular as a natural cold remedy. Elderberry contains flavonoids, which have antioxidant properties and may help prevent damage to the body’s cells. However, very few studies have been done in humans, so researchers don't know how effective elder may be. You can use elderberries in a number of ways:Taking a spoonful of elderberry syrup every morning. This syrup can be found in most health food stores.
By adding a couple of drops of elderberry extract (also found in health food stores) to a glass of water or juice.
Or by drinking elderberry tea - a hot beverage with elder flowers and peppermint leaves.

, Raw honey is an effective natural immune booster, which also contains anti-viral properties and soothes sore throats making it a primary ingredient in many natural cold remedies.You can eat a spoonful of the raw honey by itself or stir it into warm water or tea. Another great cure for a cold is to have a glass of milk mixed with a spoonful of turmeric powder, then chase it down quickly with a spoonful of honey. Try to source raw honey from your local area, as it will help your body to develop a tolerance for allergens native to your region.

, Garlic boasts an impressive array of health benefits, thanks to its antimicrobial, antiviral and antibiotic properties. There is some evidence to suggest that raw garlic can help to relieve cold symptoms, shorten a colds duration and boost the immune system, thus preventing future cold.Garlic can be taken in supplement form, but for the most effective results, it is best taken raw. Crush up a clove of garlic and let it sit at room temperature for 15 minutes. This allows a compound known as allicin to develop - a potent anti-bacterial agent which gives garlic most of its health benefits.
The garlic can be eaten on its own (if you have a strong stomach) or mixed with a little honey or olive oil and spread on a cracker., There are certain natural supplements which are believed to help with cold symptoms. While they won't necessarily cure the cold or stop it in its tracks, they can help it to go away faster. For example:


Echinacea is an herbal supplement which is believed to contain anti-viral properties, aiding in the treatment of respiratory infections. When taken in tablet form it is said to reduce the span of a cold, if taken as soon as the first symptoms appear.Zinc is another natural substance which scientific research has shown to shorten the duration of colds by preventing the virus from reproducing. It can be taken in tablet, lozenge or syrup form.Ginseng is an ancient cold remedy which is scientifically proven to help shorten the duration of colds, while also reinforcing the immune system. It can be taken in supplement form, or the root can be boiled in water to make tea."

Tickle your nostrils.,
Try plucking out an eyebrow hair.Some people will sneeze reflexively just from plucking out an eyebrow hair.,
Look suddenly at a bright light.,
Take a deep breath of cold air.Another good way to trigger your sneeze reflex is to take a deep breath of cold air.",How to Make Yourself Sneeze2," You can trick your nose’s defense mechanisms and trigger a sneeze by gently agitating the inside of your nostrils. The inside of your nose is extremely sensitive to irritation, so you can use a tissue to brush your nostril hairs and this may induce a sneeze.Roll the corner of a tissue into a small point. Put the point into your nostril, then turn and wiggle the tissue - it should tickle a bit.
Similarly, use a fake feather to brush the underside of your nose. You don’t even have to stick the feather in your nose to irritate it. Tickling the outside of your nose will probably make you sneeze.
Don’t stick anything, even a tissue, into your nose any further than the inside edges of your nostrils.
Never use a hairpin or other small sharp instrument to stimulate your nose hairs.

, To see if this will cause you to sneeze, get out a pair of tweezers and use them to pluck out a single eyebrow hair. This may be enough to bring on a sneeze.


Grasp the eyebrow hair near its root with the tips of the tweezers and pull the hair out quickly.

, Up to a third of people have a built in “photic sneeze reflex.” If you have this reflex, then you’ll probably sneeze if you suddenly see a bright light. To find out if you are one of these people, turn off the lights and sit in the dark for a few minutes. After waiting a few minutes to allow your eyes to acclimate to the darkness, look up at the light and turn it on.You can also close your eyes tightly while standing in direct sunlight. Block the sunlight with your hand as well. After a minute or two, remove your hand and open your eyes. Doing this may cause you to sneeze.
This works because the trigeminal nerve, which controls sneezing, runs right alongside the optic nerve. The over stimulation of the trigeminal nerve may cause you to sneeze.
Never look directly at the sun, as this can quickly damage your eyes.

, For instance, if you're inside and it's significantly colder outside, try stepping out and suddenly inhaling the cold air.


If it's not cold enough outside, try opening your freezer and leaning your face into the cold air for a few seconds.
Another way to do this is to take a hot shower, then stick your head out quickly and take a deep breath of cooler air.

Try rubbing your nose if it itches.,
Get away from allergens and irritants.,
Blow your nose or use a decongestant.,
Seek treatment for a severe cold.",How to Make Yourself Sneeze3," If you nose or the area around your nose feels itchy or tingly, then this could be the reason why you feel like you have to sneeze.Try giving your nose a quick rub with the back of your hand. This may reduce or eliminate the feeling that you need to sneeze. Press your tongue against your teeth as it confuses your mind thus avoiding sneezing action.


If the itching is severe or if it does not go away, then talk with your doctor. You might be experiencing an allergic reaction to something.

, Being exposed to allergens and irritants, such as dust mold, chemicals, and smoke can cause you to feel like you have to sneeze.If you are in an environment with lots of allergens or irritants, then do something to eliminate or reduce these substances.


Try getting an air purifier for your home if you think that dust and mold may be causing your need to sneeze.
Do not allow people to smoke in your home. Request that they go outside and try to keep your distance if you are around people who are smoking.
Use chemicals, such as cleaning agents, in well-ventilated areas. Open a window and turn on a fan when you need to use any chemicals that make you feel like sneezing.

, A blocked nasal passage can also cause you to feel like sneezing.If your nose is stuffed up, then try blowing your nose or taking a decongestant. This should help to relieve your urge to sneeze.

, If you have a cold, then sneezing is common. Treat your cold symptoms by taking cold medicine, blowing your nose often, and using cough drops to cool your nasal passages.


If the cold is severe and you are not getting relief from basic cold treatments, then call your doctor. You may need a prescription medication to help ease your cold symptoms and support your recovery.
You can also talk to your doctor about allergy testing if you think that this may be the cause of your ongoing feeling that you need to sneeze. Your doctor may recommend over-the-counter or prescription medications that can help.

Massage your frontal sinuses.,
Try massaging your ethmoid/sphenoid sinuses.,
Learn how to massage your maxillary sinuses.,
Relieve sinuses using the nose rub technique.,
Attempt to drain your sinuses through massage.",How to Massage Your Sinuses2," Your frontal sinuses are located in the region of your forehead. Rub lotion or massage oil onto your warmed hands in order to help smooth your fingers along your face without friction. Place both of your index fingers in between your eyebrows in the center of your forehead. Using a circular motion; run your fingers from in between your eyebrows out towards your temples.


Repeat this movement 10 times using a constant and firm pressure.
Make sure your hands are warm before beginning this massage. Rub your hands together to create a bit of friction and heat.

, These are your nasal sinuses. Pour a small amount of massage oil or lotion onto your hands and rub them together to warm them up. Use your index fingers to stroke along the side of the bridge of your nose in a downward motion; this will help promote drainage. When you work your way up towards the top of your nose (the bridge), make small circles with your index fingers next to the corners of your eyes.


However, do not touch your eyes, or get oil into your eyes. The oil won't harm your eyes but you may experience stinging.
Repeat this movement 10 times, all the while applying a constant and firm pressure.

, Again, apply lotion or massage oil to your hands and rub them together to warm them up. Using your index fingers, apply downward pressure on each cheek near the outside corners of your nostrils. Using small circular movements, work your fingers along your cheekbones towards your ear.


Repeat this movement 10 times. Again, you should use a firm pressure here to maximize relief.

, The technique is recommended for individuals with sinus problems, a stuffy nose, and nasal congestion. Rub oil in your hands. Use the palm of your hand to rub the tip of your nose in a circular motion, repeating this movement 15 to 20 times.Change directions and rub your nose the other way in a circular movement 15 to 20 times. For example, if you rubbed your nose clockwise for the first 15 movements, rub your nose in counterclockwise circles for the next 15 movements.

, Pour a small amount of lotion into your hands and rub them together. Using moderate pressure, use your thumbs to massage from the middle of the forehead towards your ears. Repeat this movement two or three times.


Place your thumbs on the middle of your nose and begin massaging out towards your ears. Repeat this movement two or three times.
Place your thumbs under your jaw and run your thumbs down along the sides of your neck to your collarbones.

Do a steam before or after a sinus massage.,
Fill a one-quart pot with water.,
Drape a large, clean cotton towel over your head.,
Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth.,
Steam up to every two hours.,
Add herbs to your steaming treatment.,
Take hot showers.",How to Massage Your Sinuses3," By combining the steam method described below along with the massage techniques already described, you can significantly increase sinus drainage. While increasing sinus drainage is not very pleasant, draining the excess mucus can relieve the pressure in your sinuses quickly and effectively.


Steaming is an old method of relieving sinus pressure without chemicals or drugs. The steam helps open up the nasal passages and thin out the sometimes thick mucus, thereby enabling it to drain out of the sinuses.

, Boil the water on the stove for a minute or two or until it is steaming vigorously. Then remove the pot from the heat and place on a heat-resistant mat on a table.You want the steam to enter into your nasal passages and your throat but not at the cost of potentially burning yourself.
In addition, keep any children away from the pot while it is boiling and while it is steaming. Try to do a steaming treatment when there aren't any children around.
This method is for adults only — do not try it on children.

, Then, place your head over the steaming pot. Close your eyes and keep your face at least 12 inches away from the water so that you don't burn yourself., Do this for five counts. Then reduce the inhales and exhales to two counts. Do this 10 minutes or for as long as the water is still steaming. Try to blow your nose while you're doing the treatment and then afterwards., You can use this technique frequently, up to every two hours. You can do give yourself a steam every two hours or as often as you like by placing your face over the steam coming from a hot tea or bowl of soup when you're at work or out and about., You can also add herbs and essential oils (one drop per quart of water ) to your steaming water. Some people think oils and herbs can relieve symptoms, but these claims are not backed by scientific evidence.


Spearmint or peppermint, thyme, sage, lavender, and black lavender oil are all great options to start with.If you have been diagnosed with a fungal sinus infection, add a drop of black walnut essential oil, tea tree oil, oregano or sage oil to your steaming water. These are thought to have antifungal and antiseptic properties.Test your sensitivity to the herb you want to use before doing a full steam treatment. Try each herb oil for about a minute and then take your face away from the steam for 10 minutes and assess how you feel. If you do have any adverse reactions (such as sneezing or a skin reaction like a rash), reheat the water and do the full treatment.
If you don’t have the essential oils, substitute a 1/2 teaspoon of dried herb per quart of water. For dried herbs, boil for another minute after adding, turn off the heat and move the pot to a safe area in your home and begin steaming.

, Taking a long, hot shower can have a similar effect to the steam treatment above. The hot water from the shower creates warm, moist air that is helps to clear out blocked nasal passages and relieve sinus pressure. Try blowing your nose naturally. The heat and steam will help moisten and liquify the secretions in the sinuses to better facilitate their evacuation.You also achieve a similar beneficial effect by placing a warm compress on your face to help open up your nasal passages and relieve any pressure you might be feeling in your sinuses. Warm a moist washcloth in the microwave for two to three minutes. Always take care not to burn yourself."

Take Zinc.,
Take vitamin C. Zinc and vitamin C are most effective when taken together.Recent research indicates that vitamin C does little on its own to reduce the length or severity of colds.,
Use an over-the-counter decongestant.,
Use an antihistamine.",How to Alleviate Nasal Congestion2," Zinc may prevent cold viruses from replicating and is thought to shorten the duration of your cold.You’ll benefit most from taking zinc as soon as cold symptoms appear.
Take zinc as a throat lozenge. Allowed it to fully dissolve in the mouth — do not chew or swallow.
When purchasing zinc, make sure the source is either zinc gluconate or zinc acetate.
Take 13.3 to 23 mg of zinc every two hours while symptoms persist. Do not exceed 40mg daily of zinc for more than a few days in a row.The combination of excess zinc and low copper levels can actually suppress immune system; Make sure you have adequate copper intake while using higher than usual doses of zinc.

, If, however, your body endures high physical stress, vitamin C may increase your resistance to colds.Any dosage of vitamin C over 500 mg cannot be absorbed by the body. 1,000 mg spread over the course of a day is plenty.
Do not take more than 2,000 mg of vitamin C per day.
Do not take vitamin C supplements if you have kidney disease.

, These reduce swelling, which eases stuffiness and pressure associated with congestion.Phenylephrine, phenylpropanolamine, and pseudoephedrine are especially common types of decongestants. There are several forms to choose from, including sprays and pills. Always follow the directions on the medication's packaging.


Be careful with decongestant sprays. They should not be used for more than three consecutive days. Using longer than this can lead to rebound symptoms, meaning your symptoms may return even worse than before.Limit decongestant use when pregnant. Past studies have tied phenylephrine and phenylpropanolamine use during the first trimester of pregnancy to rare birth defects.More recently, research has indicated that pregnant women can safely use over-the-counter decongestants for short-term ailments.Use only those products that are appropriate for the symptoms while pregnant and talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking medications while pregnant or breastfeeding.
Do not take decongestants while breastfeeding.Do not take decongestants if you are taking monoamine oxidase-inhibiting antidepressants.
Consult a doctor before taking decongestants if you have:Diabetes
High blood pressure (hypertension)
Hyperthyroidism
An enlarged prostate gland
Liver damage (such as cirrhosis)
Kidney disease
Heart disease (or weak blood circulation)
Glaucoma



, If a stuffy nose is caused by an irritant that leads to an allergic reaction, antihistamines will be especially effective in relieving congestion.Take care when using antihistamines, as they may cause you to become drowsy. Do not operate a vehicle while taking antihistamines if you are unaccustomed to their effects upon your body.
Do not take antihistamines if you are breastfeeding. Though antihistamines are safe during pregnancy, they may irritate your nursing baby, and may decrease the flow of breastmilk."

Find a small spray bottle.,
Choose the salt.,
Boil the water.,
Add the salt.,
Finish the spray.,
Use the spray.,
Refrigerate the leftover spray.,
Use a neti pot.",How to Cure the Common Cold Naturally3," Find a spray bottle that measures around one to two ounces. If you will be using the spray to help an infant or a small child with nasal congestion, you should also have a soft, rubber-bulb syringe to remove nasal secretions gently and efficiently.


A saline (salt water) nasal spray can be used as often as needed, and they can be used for adults, children, and infants., Saline spray can be made with sea salt or table salt. If you have an iodine allergy, or if you don’t know if you have an iodine allergy, use a non-iodized salt such as pickling salt or kosher salt.

, To start the solution, boil eight ounces of water. You can use tap or distilled water. After boiling, allow it to cool until it is only very warm., Add ¼ teaspoon of salt to the eight ounces of water. The ¼ teaspoon of salt will make a saline solution that matches the amount of salt in your body.


You may want to try a salt spray that has a greater concentration of salt than your body. To do this, add ½ teaspoon of salt instead. This may be useful if you have major congestion, have a lot of mucus, and are having trouble breathing or clearing your nose.
Don’t use a concentrated salt solution for infants or small children younger than five years old. , Once you add the warm salt, mix it well. Make sure to mix until salt is dissolved. Next, pour the mixture into the spray bottle. If you find that it hurts your nose, add ½ teaspoon of baking soda. This will help make it less likely to sting a sore nose.

, To use the spray, put the top of the squirt bottle into your nose. Then, spray one or two squirts of the saline solution into each nostril as needed.


For infants and small children, spray one or two squirts and wait two to three minutes. Then, slightly tilt the baby’s head back and use a soft, rubber-bulb syringe to gently remove nasal secretions.

, Place the leftover saline solution in a covered container and refrigerate. Always warm up the refrigerated solution before using it. After two days, throw out any unused solution.

Take a shower.,
Try wet sock hydrotherapy.,
Use steam.",How to Cure the Common Cold Naturally4," Take a shower using warm water followed by cold water. You can also just use cold water. This may reduce the duration and frequency of common cold symptoms because cold water increase your white blood cell count, which will help you fight your cold.To do this, start with a very warm water. Next, turn the water as cold as you can and start spraying, using a removable shower head, from the feet up, then from the hands in.


Be sure to also spray your back. Also spray the cold water towards your chest.
Do not use very cold water with the very young, the very old, or anyone with a debilitating disease, heart disease, implanted medical devices, or one who is pregnant, has lung disease, or is very weak. Use cool water only.
Afterwards, wrap your body in as many towels as you need to totally cover yourself. Get in bed and stay under the covers until you are dry.

, This treatment is supposed to help reduce fevers and treat colds. You need a pair of 100% wool and 100% cotton socks. Soak your cotton socks in very cold water.

Drink lots of water.,
Wear comfortable clothing.,
Lower the room temperature.,
Get plenty of rest.,
Take a fever-reducing medication.,
Take a warm shower.,
Sponge down.,
Keep your nose clear.,
Stay indoors.,
Avoid smoking.,
Reduce caffeine intake.,
Avoid alcohol.,
Do not use rubbing alcohol.,
Visit your doctor.,
Differentiate between a fever and other activities that raise body temperature.,
Determine if your child should see his or her pediatrician.",How to Cure a Fever at Home1," Aim to drink at least eight ounces of water every two hours. Your body can quickly lose moisture and get dehydrated by sweating or sneezing caused by illnesses, such as colds and flu, that are often associated with a fever. Dehydration can cause your temperature to rise and often leads to headaches, dizziness, muscle cramps, low blood pressure, and seizures.2 liters of water is the daily recommendation for the average adult.Caffeinated beverages in moderation are generally fine, but make sure they are not your only source of fluids. Get most of your daily fluids from pure water.Sports drinks are acceptable liquids for re-hydration, but use carefully. While these drinks do provide electrolytes, it is usually far more concentrated than necessary. Try diluting one part water to one part sports drink, or one glass of water for every glass of sports drink.

Rehydration solution. You do not need any commercial drinks to help re-hydrate--make your own.
For young children, consider a commercial electrolyte rehydration solution, such as Pedialyte, for young children, since these proportions have been specifically designed for children's bodies.To rehydrate children, offer at least 1 ounce per hour for infants, 2 ounces per hour for toddlers, and 3 ounces per hour for older children.;
, Wear loose, comfortable clothes when you have a fever to help your body relax and improve air circulation to help you stay cool. Remove excess clothing or blankets that can trap heat and make a fever last longer.Try one layer of lightweight clothing, and one lightweight blanket or sheet for sleep.Natural fibers, such as cotton, bamboo, or silk, often breathe better than manmade fibers like acrylic or polyester.

, High temperatures can make a fever last longer and cause excessive sweating that can lead to dehydration. The room temperature should ideally be 73–77℉.If the room is hot or stuffy, a fan may help.

, Getting enough rest helps your body heal faster by strengthening the immune system. Avoid moving around too much. Take some time off work to get even more sleep than you usually do if possible.


Studies show that sleep deprivation can weaken the immune system, increase the production of stress hormones, put you at higher risk for chronic disease, and lower life expectancy.
For more information on how to create a better sleep schedule, check out How to Sleep Better.

, If the fever is very high or causing you serious discomfort, you can take a fever-reducing medication. Several medicines target fevers: acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and aspirin, for instance. Take these over-the-counter medications as the label suggests to help bring down your fever.


Check the dosing carefully. Take the smallest dose possible to relieve your fever.
Children under 18 should not take aspirin unless specifically recommended by a doctor. It is associated with the development of Reye's syndrome, a disease that causes the brain and liver to swell., A warm shower or bath that lasts for 5-10 minutes can help stimulate sweat that keeps your body cool, soothe sore muscles, and decongest sinuses that may be blocked due to a cold.Make sure the water is not too hot to avoid increasing your core temperature, which may cause the fever to last longer.Keeping your body clean can also help reduce the risk of further viral or bacterial infections.

, If bathing facilities are not available, or does not sound appealing, use a moist towel instead. Soak small towels in lukewarm water and dab them on your forehead or under your arms. This stimulates sweat that helps keep your body cool, improves blood circulation and can reduce nasal congestion caused by a cold or flu.Using cold water, an ice pack, or taking a cold shower can induce shivers, which can increase the core body temperature, making the fever last longer.Do not apply warm towels to an injury or inflamed skin, as it can cause bleeding and further inflammation.

, If your fever is caused by a cold or flu, it’s important to keep your nose clear to breathe comfortably. Difficult breathing can increase your fever. Do not blow your nose too hard, as the pressure can give you an earache on top of the cold. Be sure to blow gently and only as often as necessary.Experts recommend that you blow by holding a finger over one nostril and gently blowing the other into a tissue.If your child or infant has a cold, help them blow their nose correctly.
Wash your hands each time you blow your nose to avoid chances of other infections by bacteria or viruses.

, Unless you’re already outdoors when your fever comes on, it is best to curl up and rest indoors where the air is dry and the temperature won't change much. If you must be outdoors while suffering from your fever, stay in the shade and limit activity., In addition to the risks of lung cancer and other respiratory diseases, smoking also suppresses the body’s immune system.Smoking thus requires the body to fight harder against viruses and bacteria, which increases body temperature. It is best to avoid exposure to cigarette smoke, nicotine, and other tobacco products until your fever has reduced.


Children (especially infants) should not be exposed to secondhand smoke, especially while they have a fever.

, Too much caffeine can be bad for you when you have a fever. Caffeine overdose can cause fevers, headaches, insomnia, diarrhea, irritability, and dizziness. Caffeine also stimulates water excretion and excessive intake can lead to dehydration.When you have a fever, try to avoid caffeine or lower your intake to 100 mg.


1 cup of brewed coffee contains 133 mg of caffeine, and 1 cup of black tea contains 53 mg of caffeine. Avoid sugary soda as well as energy and sports drinks as these can cause nausea and vomiting during a fever.
Severe cases of caffeine overdose can cause nausea, vomiting, chest pain, hallucinations, difficulty breathing, and convulsions.Do not use caffeine supplements until you recover from the fever.
Children and infants should generally avoid taking caffeine.

, You should abstain from drinking alcohol, whether it is beer, wine, or another drink when you have a fever, regardless of severity. Alcohol weakens the immune system, making it harder for your body to recover quickly., Applying rubbing alcohol on your skin makes your skin feel cooler. However, it is a very temporary sensation. This cooling effect does not help when you have a fever as it can cause shivering, which raises your core body temperature.In addition, the skin can soak up alcohol. For small children (and infants in particular), this approach can increase the risk of alcohol poisoning., Though you can treat many fevers at home, there are specific situations in which you should leave the care to the professionals.




If you have a fever between 103-105℉ that doesn’t come down with an over-the-counter medication (such as ibuprofen and aspirin) or a fever of any temperature that lasts over seventy-two hours, then you should see your doctor immediately. Other reasons to see a doctor immediately when you have a fever include:Children under 3 months with any fever
Children under 2 with a high fever, or a fever that lasts more than 48 hours
You’ve recently traveled, had a surgery or vaccine, or come into contact with known allergens or hazardous substances
You have a disease such as diabetes, anemia, cystic fibrosis, or any heart or lung diseases
You experience mild-to-moderate fevers frequently
A new rash or bruises appear on your skin without any known causes
You experience painful urination

, Physical activity, mood swings, hormonal changes, irregular or heavy eating, tight or heavy clothing, medications, and exposure to high temperatures can also increase your body temperature. If you suspect you have heat stroke, you should call 911 and seek medical care immediately, as it can lead to seizures and heart attack.


A raised temperature can occur with heat stroke, but this condition must be treated differently. If you think heat stroke might be the actual problem, then you can find more information at: How to Treat Heatstroke


, You may want to talk to your doctor for children with lower fevers than you would for an adult. Always consult a pediatrician before giving a child a medication for a fever. You should additionally seek medical care for your child if the child:Is younger than 3 months old and has a rectal temperature of 100.4 °F (38 °C) or higher
Is 3-12 months old and has a fever of 102.2 °F (39 °C) or higher
Is under age 2 and has a fever that lasts longer than 48 hours
Is not alert, cannot be awakened easily, has had fevers come and go for up to a week or more (even if they are not very high or if fever symptoms come back after they had gone away)
Does not make tears when crying or cannot be calmed down when crying
Does not have wet diapers or has not urinated in the past 8 hours
Has other symptoms that suggest an illness may need to be treated, such as a sore throat, earache, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, or a cough.

, There’s nothing more attractive to germs than trash, so be sure to take yours out often. This is particularly important if someone in the room is already sick or has a cold.


Consider having one trash can per person, to avoid spreading germs.
Don’t forget the gloves. When taking out the trash, you may want to consider wearing plastic gloves so that your hands don’t come in direct contact with the can. Regardless, be sure to wash your hands afterwards.

, Flu season is not the time to recycle your clothes. Instead of leaving your jeans on the floor for another day, put them directly into the laundry basket.


Be sure to use warm water and soap when cleaning your clothes. Always check the label first, as some clothes will shrink if washed in warm water.

, Similar to washing your clothes frequently, you also need to ensure your bedding is clean. Most flu viruses can live one to two days on nonporous surfaces, and eight to 12 hours on porous surfaces.You don’t need to wash your bedding every day, but do try to clean them at least once a week.
If you sit on your bed to study, after coming back from classes, you may want to wash them every couple of days instead.

, While it may not be mandatory at your institution, some feel the flu shot or nasal spray vaccination should be more than just an option. The vaccination can keep you from getting sick from flu. Protecting yourself from flu also protects the people around you who are more vulnerable to serious flu illness.Even if you’re not someone who gets sick frequently, think of those around you. Consider the health and safety of your roommate or fellow classmates when making a decision regarding the flu shot.
Cost doesn’t necessarily need to be a factor in your decision. Many colleges make getting vaccinated easier by offering flu clinics on campus with free or low-cost vaccines.If you have a severe allergy to one of the ingredients in the vaccine, you should talk to your doctor before getting vaccinated — you may be unable to get the shot. Ingredients may include gelatin, antibiotics, or eggs.Different flu shots are approved for people of different ages.It’s still always best to check with your parents or guardians first before getting the flu shot.
The flu vaccine is an important step toward preventing the flu, but it does not mean you definitely won't get sick. The effectiveness of the flu vaccine has been estimated to be somewhere around 10–60%. Even if you get sick, the vaccine may reduce the severity of your symptoms., The flu vaccine is the best way to prevent flu, but the next best thing is good hand hygiene.Prevent the spreading of germs by washing your hands with soap and water for at least 15-20 seconds. Do this several times a day and, though it should go without saying, after you use the bathroom.


If you’re in a situation where you can’t wash your hands with soap and water, make good use of that hand sanitizer you purchased.
Sing a short song while washing your hands. This will get you in the habit of washing your hands for the appropriate amount of time.

, You may have already wiped down your own space, but don’t forget to have your wipes on hand when you’re in a shared space. When someone is sick in an office, it takes only four hours (!) for surfaces like coffee pot handles, copy-machine buttons and the fridge door to show traces of infectious virus.The same is true at universities, so be sure to keep this in mind at the gym, in your classes and in the cafeteria.

, You may want to skip happy hour during flu season primarily because alcohol, interferes with sleep qualityand getting rest is crucial to maintaining good health. A glass of wine or a beer shouldn’t interfere with your sleep, just watch that you’re not overdoing it!


If you are drinking alcohol at a party, don’t share drinks or taste your friends’ beverage.
Make sure to label your cup in a group setting as well.

, No matter how clean they may be, remember this: Hands are veritable germ factories, so keep them away from your nose and mouth., In keeping with the theme of steering clear of your face, you may want to reconsider certain foods during flu season. Sandwiches, for example, require you to use your hands, which then come directly in contact with your mouth. Consider eating foods, which make use of utensils, such as soup and pasta.


Be aware that utensils in school cafeterias are another potential source of germs, so if the option is available, you may want to rely on plastic utensils instead.

, Given that germs can live for up to a few days on hard surfaces, be sure you remember to wear shower shoes and to bring your own shower caddy, when using communal showers. True, the floors in public showers and locker rooms usually are cleaned with strong detergents that eliminate most germs—but how frequently and thoroughly they are cleaned can vary greatly from establishment to establishment.Carrying your shower caddy back and forth from your room, as opposed to leaving it in the bathroom, will help to further prevent germs from finding their way to you.
Don't wear your shower shoes around your room when you're done showering. Leave them by the door, so that you're not bringing the germs in.

, Aerobic exercise is any activity that gets your heart pumping. It helps increase your body's natural virus-killing cells,so don’t skip the gym!


Do bring your hand sanitizer and wipes with you if you’re using the campus gym.
Consider outdoor activities, such as running or walking, if you want to avoid germs at the gym.

, Despite your best efforts, you may still come down with the flu while at school. Although you may be under a great deal of stress, plan accordingly so that you can get a full night’s rest. If you can manage it, stay home and sleep. The best information we have says complete bed rest is best., While water is the purest clear liquid that exists and can help people rehydrate during a bout of stomach flu, consider making yourself a cup of tea as well.


Make sure to drink decaffeinated tea only and try to add lemon and honey if possible, as lemon thins mucus, and honey is antibacterial.Sports drinks are another option, but sip them slowly, as the high sugar content may not react well to your stomach.

, Some people swear by nasal rinses as a means for helping to ease colds/flus. If you feel inclined to try this method, consider an in home recipe: Mix 3 teaspoons iodide-free salt and 1 teaspoon baking soda. Add 1 teaspoon of this mixture to 1 cup distilled or cooled boiled water.You can use either a syringe, squeeze bottle or neti pot when doing the rinse. The basic technique with all the devices is the same, so choosing a system is largely a matter of personal preference."

Staying hydrated will help to thin mucus from an upper respiratory infection. This may reduce the urge to cough from post-nasal drip.Staying hydrated will also help to keep your mucus membranes moist and healthy. This will help dry throat and nasal passages that are common in the winter months due to dry air. Dry mouths and throats can cause an irritation that can make you want to cough.;
, Hot drinks are soothing to a sore, irritated throat from a persistent cough. Honey is a natural cough suppressant.In fact, studies have shown that honey is as effective as cough medicine containing dextromethorphan at relieving night-time cough.Hot liquids will help to thin the mucus in your throat. Choose an herbal tea such as peppermint or eucalyptus to help loosen the mucus and relieve a cough., If your cough is associated with a cold, chicken soup can help to relieve congestion. Researchers have demonstrated that chicken broth contains certain anti-inflammatory properties that can relieve congestion.The soup will help to loosen and thin mucus that can cause irritation and coughs.
The warm soup will also help to soothe any irritated tissue in the back of your throat.

, Several herbs have traditionally been used to treat coughs. Because they may interact with other medical conditions or prescription medications, you should always ask a doctor or pharmacist about whether these remedies are safe for you to use. You can find most of these herbs at health food stores or drug stores. Consider the following:Marshmallow. Not the puffy white things you put in hot cocoa, the marshmallow plant contains a substance called mucilage that can help reduce throat irritation. It is commonly available as a tea, tincture, or capsule.Slippery elm. Slippery elm may help stimulate mucus production, keeping it thin enough to avoid irritating your throat. It is available as tablets and capsules, lozenges, tea, and extracts.Licorice root. This isn’t the candy. It is a traditional treatment for coughs and sore throats. The active ingredient glycyrrhiza can have serious side effects, so if your doctor says licorice is safe for you to use, look for deglycyrrhizinated licorice (DGL). It is available as a tincture, caplet, tea, or extract.Thyme. Thyme may help relieve coughs and acute bronchitis. Do not take thyme oil by mouth, as it is toxic. Instead, brew a tea from fresh or dried thyme leaves and sip it., Probiotics won’t directly treat your cough, but they can help relieve and even prevent colds and flu, and they may also relieve pollen allergies. Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium are strains to look for. Look for yogurts and other products fortified with probiotics. You can also take a probiotic supplement.
People with weakened immune systems or who take immunosuppressant drugs should consult with their doctors before taking probiotics.

, Spirulina is a strain of blue-green algae that may help your body fight allergies by blocking the release of histamine. This may help relieve coughs due to allergies.People with weakened immune systems or who take immunosuppressant drugs should consult with their doctors before taking spirulina.

, Irrigating your sinuses with a saline rinse may help relieve your cough by removing postnasal drip secretions that can irritate your throat. You can purchase pre-made saline rinses at most pharmacies or drug stores, or you can make your own.To make your own, combine ⅛ teaspoon of table salt in one cup of warm water. Wet a clean washcloth in the saline solution.
Hold the washcloth to your nose and inhale. Alternatively, you can use a Neti pot or irrigating syringe to rinse your sinuses.

, You can do this by taking hot showers or inhaling steam from hot water. This is a safe and very effective method for temporarily relieving congestion.Steam can help a cough by loosening secretions in the nose and airways.
This strategy can help to ease coughs from colds, but also those caused by allergies, asthma, and lower respiratory infections.
You may find adding a few drops of peppermint or eucalyptus oil to the water, or using a mentholated shower bomb, helps clear your congestion too.

, Dry air in the home can thicken nasal secretions that cause coughs. A humidifier is a machine that moistens the air in your home. This is a safe and very effective method for temporarily relieving congestion. Putting moisture back into the air can help your cough by losing the mucus in your nasal passages and chest.Don't overdo it though. Too much moisture in the air can encourage mold and fungus growth in your your home. Allergies to these may worsen a cough.
Try using the humidifier only at night. Clean the humidifier frequently so mold doesn't build up inside of the machine.

, Scented products, smoke, and allergens can cause a chronic cough. Some people notice that scented candles, lotions, and air fresheners can cause nasal irritation. This can cause mucus build up, which in turn causes a cough.Cigarette smoke is another common irritant that can cause a cough. Stop smoking, or ask others in your home who smoke to quit or do so outside.
If you have a known allergy to pets or mold, be extra vigilant about these irritants in your home. Clean damp surfaces frequently to avoid mold buildup and clean up pet hair.
Keep your environment clean and dust-free to help avoid irritation.

, These come in many flavors and varieties and will help to suppress a cough temporarily. Try coughs that contain menthol, as it is a natural cough reliever. Menthol can help to numb the back of your throat and will get rid of the irritation causing your cough.If you can't stand the taste of cough drops, sucking on hard candy can also help to relieve some of the irritation from a cough.

, Decongestants relieve nasal congestion by shrinking swollen nasal passages and reducing mucus. Decongestants will also dry up any mucus in your chest and lessen a deep chest cough.These medicines come in pills, liquids, and nasal sprays.
Look for medicines that contain phenylephrine and pseudoephedrine as the active ingredient.
Be aware that both of these medications can raise blood pressure, so people with hypertension should take care when using them.
Nasal spray decongestants should only be used for 2-3 days at a time as they can cause rebound congestion with prolonged use.

, If your cough is persistent and causing pain and irritation, a cough suppressant can help to reduce the amount of coughing. Expectorants help to thin chest and nasal mucus so it is more easily coughed up.Look for a cough suppressant that contains dextromethorphan.
Because they can cause drowsiness, only take cough suppressants at night.
If your cough is thick with phlegm, try an expectorant such as guaifenesin.

, GERD, or gastroesophageal reflux disease (sometimes known as acid reflux disease or chronic heartburn), is a very common cause of stubborn, lingering coughs.GERD keeps your stomach relaxed and allows stomach acid to flow back up into your throat through your esophagus, causing heartburn, pain, and coughing.The cough tends to be worse in the morning.


GERD, asthma, and postnasal drip are responsible for some 90% of chronic coughs.Common symptoms of GERD include heartburn, sour taste in your mouth, chest pain, trouble swallowing, cough, sore throat, and feeling like there is a lump in your throat, especially after eating., Being overweight puts pressure on your stomach, which can worsen symptoms of GERD. Ask your doctor whether you are at a healthy body weight. If not, your doctor can recommend a diet and exercise plan that’s appropriate for your health and fitness condition.Getting plenty of aerobic exercise and eating a balanced diet full of fresh fruit and vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins is a good way to maintain a healthy weight.

, Tight clothing can put pressure on your abdomen, forcing stomach acids back up into your throat and triggering a cough., Sleeping with your head elevated can help keep heartburn at bay and reduce coughs triggered by GERD. Use a few extra pillows to prop you up, or elevate the head of your bed using blocks or risers., Lying down soon after eating can trigger GERD symptoms, including coughing. Wait at least 3-4 hours after eating to head to bed. Remain upright for at least 30 minutes after a meal., GERD can be triggered by certain foods and drinks. While these may be different for everyone, common triggers include:Tomatoes
Chocolate
Alcohol
Mint
Garlic and onions
Caffeine
Fatty or fried foods

, A chronic cough lasts longer than eight weeks in adults, and longer than four weeks in children.If you can’t seem to get rid of your cough no matter what you try, or if your cough stays around for more than a few weeks, call your doctor for an appointment.Coughs may disturb your sleep and keep you from feeling rested and healthy. If your cough is interfering with your sleep and night-time cough medicine has not helped, see your doctor.

, Most coughs resolve on their own, or with a little treatment. However, in certain cases you should seek immediate medical attention for a cough. Consult with your doctor as soon as possible, or seek emergency medical attention if you have any of the following along with a cough:Blood in your saliva or mucus
Saliva or mucus that smells bad
Weight loss
Night sweats
Fever
Breathlessness
Fatigue
Chest pain

, Many cough treatments and medications may not be safe for use in children, especially infants and very young kids. Many doctors do not recommend giving over-the-counter cough suppressants to children.If your child has a persistent cough, ask your pediatrician for recommended treatments.


Humidifiers can help relieve congestion and saline rinses can help clear sinuses. These treatments are usually safe for children."

It can be very helpful right before going to bed if the cough is making it hard to sleep.


It's good for adults and children, but do not give honey to children under the age of 1 since it could increase the risk of infant botulism.You can take the honey directly. Try 1 tablespoon every few hours while your cough persists. Another option is to add 1 tablespoon or more to a glass of warm tea with lemon.
Some studies suggest that honey is as effective as a cough suppressant as dextromethorphan, an ingredient commonly used in many over-the-counter cough suppressants.;
, Licorice root tea soothes your airways, helps ease inflammation, and loosens mucus. To make it, place 2 tablespoons of dried licorice root in a mug and pour 8 ounces of boiling water into the mug. Steep for 10-15 minutes. Drink twice daily.Don't drink licorice root tea if you are on steroids or have kidney problems.
The active ingredient, glycyrrhiza, can cause negative side effects for some people. Look for DGL, or deglycyrrhizinated licorice, at your health food or drug store. It is just as effective., Thyme is used in some countries, like Germany, for a variety of respiratory ailments. Thyme helps relax throat muscles and reduce inflammation. Boil water and place the water and 2 teaspoons of crushed thyme in a cup for 10 minutes. Strain before drinking.Add honey and lemon for extra soothing properties. It may also help make the taste more pleasant.
Do not use thyme oil internally. Use dried or fresh thyme.

, If you do not have any cough drops on hand or would prefer to stay away from medicated lozenges, you can usually soothe and stop a cough by sucking on a piece of hard candy.A dry cough that produces no phlegm can be halted by nearly any piece of hard candy. Hard candy causes you to produce more saliva and to swallow more, thereby suppressing your cough.
If you have a wet cough that does produce phlegm, lemon drops tend to work well.Hard candy is an effective cough remedy for children ages 6 and older.Don't give hard candy or lozenges to children under 3, as they could choke., Turmeric is a traditional cough remedy that many people have found effective for coughs. Try mixing half a teaspoon of turmeric powder in a glass of warm milk. You can also try turmeric powder and a teaspoon of honey for dry cough.

Try tea tree oil and eucalyptus oil, both of which are known to soothe airways and open passages. They also contain anti-viral, anti-bacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties which helps fight bacteria and viruses.Boil water and place it in a bowl. Let it cool for about a minute. Add 3 drops of tea tree oil and 1-2 drops of eucalyptus oil. Stir. Lean over and cover your head with a towel to trap the steam. Breathe deeply for 5-10 minutes 2-3 times daily. Just make sure not to lean close enough to the water to burn your face on the steam.Do not take tea tree oil internally. It is toxic when ingested.

, If you're interested in an effective cough syrup that is strictly for adults only, you can mix a little whiskey into your mug of warm lemon water.While the alcohol is not likely to have any effect on your cough, it can help you relax.Mix 2 ounces (60 ml) of bourbon whiskey, 2 ounces (60 ml) of lemon juice, and 2 to 4 ounces (60 to 125 ml) of water in a microwave-safe mug.
Heat in the microwave for 45 seconds.
Whisk 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of honey into the mixture and microwave for another 45 seconds.

, If you have a cough caused by the cold or flu, you could try making a batch of this traditional Korean cold remedy. It combines dried jujubes with spices, honey, and several other beneficial ingredients.


Combine 25 dried jujubes (sliced), 1 large Asian pear (quartered and seeded), a 3-inch (7.6-cm) piece of ginger (sliced), 2 to 3 cinnamon sticks, and 3 quart (2.8 L) of water in a large saucepan. Cover and heat on medium-high until it begins to boil.

, Salt water is used to help relieve sore throats, but can also help with coughs by helping the swelling go down and dislodge phlegm. Mix 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of salt in 8 ounces of warm water, dissolve completely, and then gargle for 15 seconds. Spit out the gargle, and repeat until all the water is gone., Apple cider vinegar is a good way to get rid of a cough without drugs. You can heat it and drink it like tea with an added teaspoon of honey, or drink it cold with apple juice., Decongestants help relieve coughing by reducing nasal congestion and drying up mucus in the lungs and expanding airways. You can take decongestants in a variety of ways, such as pills, liquids, and nasal sprays.Look for pills and liquids with phenylephrine and pseudoephedrine as the active ingredients.
Excessive use of decongestants can lead to dryness and cause a dry cough.
Only use nasal sprays for 2-3 days. More than that might cause more congestion thanks to the ""rebound effect."" Your body can become dependent on decongestants if you overuse them., Try a menthol cough drops since they tend to be the most effective. These lozenges numb the back of your throat, restricting the cough reflex and putting an end to your coughing fit sooner.For moist coughs, horehound lozenges often prove helpful. Horehound is a bittersweet herb with expectorant properties, so it brings up more phlegm faster, allowing your cough to be over with sooner.

The substances they contain coat the throat, thereby limiting the coughing reflex and putting an end to your hacking.Pregnant and breastfeeding women should not use slippery elm., An over-the-counter medicated chest rub containing menthol or camphor should be able to halt most dry and moist coughs.These rubs should only be applied topically and are not safe to ingest.
Do not use medicated chest rubs on infants.

, An over-the-counter cough suppressant is best used for moist coughs that occur during the middle of the night.Cough suppressants halt the flow of cough-causing mucus and tell your brain to restrict the coughing reflex. They are a good idea if you need to stop your cough temporarily to sleep at night or for another reason, but you should not rely on cough suppressants for the duration of a cough-causing illness since they can cause mucus to stay trapped in your lungs, increasing your risk of developing a bacterial infection.
Look for a cough suppressant containing dextromethorphan, pholcodine, or antihistamines.
Be careful which medicine you use if your main symptom is a cough. Antihistamines and decongestants in cough medicines can make the mucus hard and dry, making it harder to clear from your airways.Do not give cough medicine to children under 4 years of age.

, An expectorant will thin the mucus so you can cough it up. Expectorants are great if you have a cough with thick phlegm.Do not give cough medicine to children under 4 years of age since they can cause serious side effects., Hydration is important for wet and dry coughs alike. Fluids help to thin the mucus that drips into your throat, causing the cough.Any beverage is good, except alcohol or drinks with caffeine (which can dry you out) and acidic citrus juices and drink (which can irritate your throat).Aim for the equivalent of at least eight 8 oz (250 ml) glasses of water per day while you suffer from your cough.
To treat a cough in children 3 months-1 year old: give the child 1 to 3 tsp (5 to 15 ml) of warm, clear liquid such as apple juice up to four times per day to soothe a cough.This is in addition to the fluids they drink normally, such as breastmilk or formula.

, Take a hot shower and inhale the steam. This can help loosen the congestion in the nose, which can drip down into your chest and cause cough. It also helps moisturize dry air, which can also cause coughing. At night, run a humidifier and breathe in the warm vapor.This method is helpful for coughs caused by colds, allergies, and asthma.
Humidifiers need to be cleaned out regularly. Otherwise, they may cause more harm than good. Mold, other fungi, and bacteria can build up inside the machine and get transferred into the air alongside the steam.

, You may instinctively start with large, hearty coughs as soon as a coughing fit comes on, but building up to these large coughs slowly can actually help you get rid of a coughing fit faster. This is especially helpful if you have a moist cough. When a coughing fit begins, start by taking a series of small, light coughs. These coughs will not produce much mucus. At the end of your series of small coughs, do one big cough. The small coughs move the mucus toward the top of your air passage and the large cough has enough force to bring the mucus out.Coughing in this method will prevent your throat from becoming more irritated. Since an irritated throat is more likely to cause continued coughing, making your throat less irritated should help you get rid of your cough faster.

, Chronic coughs are often caused or worsened by airborne irritants. These irritants can cause chronic sinus irritation, leading to chronic coughing due to the excess mucus. The most obvious irritant to avoid is tobacco smoke.Perfumes and scented bathroom sprays are also known to trigger chronic coughs and should be avoided at least for the duration of your cough if you want your cough to leave quicker.

Blow your nose one nostril at a time.,
Cleanse your nostrils with a saline solution.,
Use a neti pot.,
Do an at-home steam treatment.,
Use a humidifier.,
Put a warm compress on your nose and forehead.",How to Get Rid of a Stuffy Nose Quickly1," Hold one nostril closed with your thumb while you exhale gently through the other nostril, then switch.

You can also purchase saline solution in a drug store.

, The neti pot thins mucus and flushes it out of your nasal passage. Follow the instructions that come with your specific neti pot. In general, follow these guidelines for use:









Make an irrigating solution of 16 ounces lukewarm (and sterile) water, along with 1 teaspoon of salt. Fill your neti pot with the saline solution.
Stand over your sink or in the shower. Tilt your head sideways so that your forehead and chin are about level and bring the tip of the neti pot to the uppermost nostril. The saline solution will go into one nostril, travel through your nasal cavity, and come out of the other nostril. If the solution drips into your mouth, just spit it out. Blow your nose and repeat the process on the other side.If you suffer from severe sinus problems or allergies, you can try irrigating daily.Once symptoms improve, use it three times per week.
Make sure your neti pot is always clean before you use it.

Make sure you’re up-to-date with your vaccinations.",How to Cure the 100 Day Cough (Adults) Holistically1," During the first 2 weeks of pertussis you will likely think you have a cold or the flu. Therefore it can be hard to determine if you should see your doctor at this point.However, if you know for a fact that you’ve been in contact with someone else who has been diagnosed with pertussis, see a doctor immediately when symptoms begin. Otherwise the timing of a doctor’s appointment will need to be based on how you feel. If the cough gets worse, and turns into coughing fits, that may be a good time to consider seeing your doctor.;
, Pertussis is extremely contagious, and can be fatal to infants. To be safe, not just for yourself but for everyone around you, expose yourself to as few people as possible.This means you should stay home from work and school, you should not attend events outside of your home, you should not have friends over just for socializing, etc. If you have children at home, make sure you stay away from them as much as possible, and that they’re washing their hands often.

, Pertussis is caused by a bacteria called Bordetella pertussis. This bacteria can be spread from person to person via liquid droplets in the air caused by coughing or sneezing. People who have not been vaccinated, and infants, are more susceptible to the disease. In the case of infants the disease could be fatal. The bacteria is normally in your system for the first 3 weeks after you’ve been infected, and it is during this time that you can also be contagious. Your doctor may decide that an oral antibiotic may help prevent you from passing the disease onto someone else. It will also help clear up the infection faster., In general, over-the-counter cough suppressants don’t help the cough caused by pertussis, but there are alternatives your doctor may consider. Both corticosteroids and albuterol have been known to reduce coughing fits, but must be prescribed by a doctor., Vaccines in and of themselves do not offer a cure, but they help your body build the proper immunities to very serious diseases. This then helps to prevent you from getting those diseases in the future. Whether you got vaccinations as a child or not, it is still important to stay up-to-date with vaccinations as an adult. Consult your doctor to determine which vaccinations you may require."

Add the essential oils to the mixture.,
Roll small portions of the lozenge dough into small balls.,
Let the lozenges dry for at least 24 hours before storing or using.",How to Make Homemade Cough Drops," For this recipe you will need the following items: Paring knife
Zester
Saucepan
Candy thermometer
Candy molds
Airtight storage container.;
, Start by peeling the ginger with a paring knife or vegetable peeler. Fresh ginger is available at most supermarkets in the produce section.
Ginger has anti-inflammatory properties and is commonly used in cough remedies as an effective antihistamine and chest decongestant.Cut the ginger into very thin slices using a paring knife.
Use a zester to get at least 1 teaspoon of lemon zest.

, Bring this to a boil over high heat.You will know when the pot is at a full boil when you have a constant stream of large bubbles coming to the surface and a good deal of steam.
Once the pot has come to a full boil, reduce the heat to low.

, Then remove the ginger and cinnamon stick. The easiest way to remove the spices is with a strainer.
Place a strainer into a clean saucepan.
Pour the hot mixture through the strainer.
The ginger and cinnamon will be left in the strainer and the liquid will be caught in the clean saucepan underneath.

, Bring this mixture to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly. Honey has been studied in clinical trials. It has been proven to be as effective as cough syrup in suppressing coughs. You will want the sugar to dissolve.
You can tell if the sugar is dissolved if you take a spoon of the liquid and cannot see any grains of sugar in it.
Once the sugar is dissolved, you will use a candy thermometer to get this syrup to the hard-crack candy stage.

, You will use this to monitor the heat.The candy liquid will need to be heated to a high temperature in order to harden into lozenges.
It is very important that you closely watch the temperature of the syrup so it doesn't burn onto the saucepan or become too hot to form hard cough drops.
The goal temperature for hard-crack lozenges is 300-305 degrees Fahrenheit.

, It will rise quickly as you cook the liquid.As the liquid rises in temperature, it may darken. This is expected as the sugar in the syrup caramelizes.
When the candy thermometer reaches 300-305 degrees, remove the liquid from heat.
You will now add the final ingredients before pouring the mixture to cool in candy molds.

,
As you add the juice, it may cause the hot liquid to splash.
Stir completely to make sure the liquid is evenly mixed.

, You can use unflavored cooking spray to do so. Carefully pour the hot liquid into the molds.
Take care to fill only the small candy mold and not to spill too much of the liquid over the top each.
This recipe will make about 50 small lozenge sized pieces.

, This will take an hour or more.When the cough drops are cool, crack them out of the molds onto wax paper.
To crack the drops out of the candy molds, tap the mold gently on a hard surface. The cough drops should fall out.
You may have to bend the candy mold tray in order to get the cough drops out, similar to cracking ice.

, If you don't have superfine sugar at home, you can put regular granulated sugar in a food processor or blender. Process this until it is a finer consistency.Shake the jar to coat the cough drops with sugar.
This will prevent them from sticking together.
You can also use powdered sugar to coat the drops, but it tends to clump.

, You don't need to refrigerate them.Use them as needed.
Since these don't contain any of the common drugs found in cough syrups, these are ideal if you want to avoid the side effects of over-the-counter cough remedies.
The cough drops will have a pleasant, sweet taste of lemon, ginger, and cinnamon.

, There are several suggestions for herbal medicines that are effective at treating coughs and colds. Elderberry and elderflower has been used to relieve congestion. Slippery elm has been traditionally used by Native Americans to treat coughs and gastrointestinal conditions.Chamomile may be an effective treatment for coughs as it can help to reduce inflammation and mucus production.To make a strong tea, place a generous pinch of each herb into a cup of water in a saucepan.
Heat the water and herbs to a simmer on high heat, then cover and reduce the heat.
Let the tea steep for 15 to 20 minutes over the lowest heat.
Strain out the herbs and reserve 1/2 cup of the tea for the cough drops.

, You can make DIY molds rather than using candy molds to make cough drops using sugar and a baking sheet.In a 9 x 13 pan or any cookie sheet, add a few cups of powdered sugar.
Use your finger or a measuring spoon to make indentations in the sugar.
This is where you will pour the syrup for your cough lozenges.

, Start by putting the 1/2 cup of herbal tea from Step 1 into a saucepan, then add 1.5 cups of honey and 1/2 teaspoon of peppermint extract.Use a medium to medium-high heat to heat up the ingredients.
Stir constantly to make sure all the ingredients are mixed.
Clip a candy thermometer on the side of the pan to monitor the temperature.

, You will want it to get to about 300 °F (149 °C). This will allow the liquid to harden into lozenges as it cools.The mixture may get slightly foamy as it heats up.
If this occurs, give the cough drop liquid a stir.
You will be able to tell once the mixture gets near to the correct temperature as it will thicken.
This process generally takes about 30 minutes.
Once the liquid is at a temperature of 300 degrees, remove it from the heat.

, Pour slowly and carefully.Pour the hot liquid into each of the small depressions in the powdered sugar on the baking sheet you prepared earlier.
Alternatively, you can use a greased candy mold.
If you don't have a candy mold or don't want to use sugar, you can pour the liquid onto a piece of greased parchment paper. Be aware that this is the messiest way to do this.

, Try not to disturb the cough drops as they cool.Once the drops have cooled, carefully move them out of their sugar molds. If using candy molds, crack the cough drops out of the molds.
Coat the cough drops in powdered sugar.
You can store these in single layers between wax paper in the refrigerator for about 3 weeks.
You can also freeze them between layers of wax paper. If you choose to do so, they will last for several months.

, This recipe calls for slippery elm powder, cinnamon, honey, orange essential oil and lemon essential oil.You can buy slippery elm bark and the essential oils from most health food stores, herbal shops, or online herbal retailers such as Mountain Rose Herbs.
Slippery elm contains a substance called mucilage. This becomes gel-like when combined with water or honey. This can help coat the mouth, throat, and digestive tract.Native Americans used this herbal remedy for centuries to calm coughs and gastrointestinal problems.Slippery elm has not been shown to cause any medical complications, unlike other herbal supplements. Little formal research has been conducted to show how effective it is at treating medical conditions. Remember that clinical studies have shown that honey is a very effective treatment for coughs. Cinnamon may also have some effectiveness at controlling a bad cough., Stir very thoroughly to combine.If the honey is too stiff has crystallized, try warming up the jar under warm water.
This should thin the honey or reconstitute it.
Sometimes this mixture is very dry and crumbly. If this is the case, you can add two more tablespoons of honey to make it easier to work with.
When finished the mixture should resemble a soft dough. It may be sticky because of the honey.

, Use a dropper to make sure you get the right amount of drops for each.You will need 10 drops of orange essential oil and 6 drops of lemon essential oil.
Mix these into the cough lozenge mixture thoroughly.
You want to make sure they are incorporated evenly into the dough.

, These should be roughly the size of a teaspoon.Place these on a sheet of wax paper or parchment.
You can lay this on a counter or a baking sheet.
Place the lozenges in an area where they won't be disturbed.
These cough lozenges may not be very attractive but they contain effective ingredients.

, You may need to leave them longer if you live in a humid climate.To store the lozenges, wrap them in wax paper.
Alternatively, you can store them in an airtight jar.
These will last approximately 3 weeks when stored properly.
The recipe should make about 36 lozenges.

Drink a lot of fluids.,
Eat a lot of fruits and vegetables.,
Take your required vitamins.",How to Cure the 100 Day Cough (Adults) Holistically2," In general, adults should consume between 11 and 15 cups (2.7-3.7 litres) of liquid every day. This amount, however, includes the liquid (including water) that you receive from ALL sources, including food. The general guideline to ensure you’re drinking enough liquids is to not allow yourself to stay thirsty, and to have a drink with every meal. Any type of liquid can be included in this daily consumption (i.e. soup, milk, tea, coffee, soda, juice, etc.).While items like coffee, tea and soda are a form of liquid that will assist with your daily intake, you should try not to make them your only source., Fruits and vegetables, in general, contain a lot of vitamins and nutrients which can help keep you strong and healthy.When you’re sick they may also be helpful as they contain a decent amount of water and may be more appetizing than other types of foods., Ideally you should try to consume 400-1000 mg of vitamin C, 20-30 mg of zinc, and 20,000 to 50,000 IU of beta carotene per day.You can sometimes obtain these amounts based on the foods you eat, but it is not always possible. To be sure you receive enough of these vitamins and minerals every day, you can take a multi-vitamin or individual vitamins.


Multi-vitamins don’t always contain enough of each type of vitamin and mineral your body requires. Make sure to check the ingredient label to ensure a multi-vitamin has enough of what you need. If not, purchase the individual vitamins you require.
Always check with your doctor when taking vitamins and minerals, especially if you’re on other medications, to ensure there are no side effects or interactions.

You can drink 2-4 mugs of garlic tea per day.

, Hyssop is a herb that is also known for its expectorant properties, meaning it can help get rid of mucus. Hyssop leaves can be used to make a tea, which may have a similar taste to that of mint. Hyssop also has a smell similar to camphor, which is used to help unblock congested airways.Place 1 teaspoon of hyssop in a mug of boiling water and allow it to steep for 5-10 minutes.
You can drink the tea 2-4 times a day.

, Anise is the herb used to flavour black liquorice and some liqueurs. If you don’t like black liquorice or the associated liqueurs, then this is probably not an option you should try.

Swallow a spoonful of honey.,
Gargle salt water.,
Breathe in steaming water.,
Apply a castor oil chest paste.,
Eat dark chocolate.",How to Cure the 100 Day Cough (Adults) Holistically4," Medical research has found that cough syrup works no better than honey. Chances are, you may prefer the taste of honey over the taste of cough syrup. If that is the case, swallow 1 tablespoon of honey up to 3 times per day to help coat your irritated throat and slow down or stop your coughing., Mix 1 teaspoon of regular, everyday salt into a glass of warm water. Make sure the salt is completely dissolved and then take a sip and gargle. Gargle for about 15 seconds and then spit the salt water out. You can continue to gargle until you’ve used up all the water in the glass. If you have a leftover salty taste in your mouth afterwards, just rinse with regular water., Do you know that feeling of complete relief you get when you have a nice hot shower while you have a cold, and for those few brief moments you can actually breathe? This method is similar, but adds some soothing ingredients to help alleviate your cough as well. Put boiling water in a medium-sized bowl and let it cool down for about a minute. Add 3 drops of tea tree oil and 1-2 drops of eucalyptus oil and stir. Lean you face over the bowl, set yourself in a comfortable position, and just breathe! Put a towel over your head and around the bowl to help keep the vapours close to your face. You can do this for 5-10 minutes at a time, up to 2-3 times a day.You can also add 3-6 drops of your favourite essential oil to a humidifier or a bath to help relieve congestion., For this chest paste you’ll need ½ cup of cold-pressed castor oil, 1-2 cloves of garlic (crushed), 1 tablespoon of freshly grated ginger, 3-4 drops of eucalyptus oil, and ½ teaspoon of cayenne pepper. Add all the ingredients together in one bowl and mix thoroughly. Apply the finished mixture to your chest - ideally under an old t-shirt that you won’t mind getting messy.Alternatively, you can just use castor oil without any other ingredients. Put the castor oil directly onto a soft cloth on your chest, and then put plastic wrap over top of the cloth. Then you can you place a heat source over the plastic wrap for 30-60 minutes.Castor oil is an anti-inflammatory, and, according to some research, an immune booster.

, You’re sick after all, you can eat whatever you want! Eating 50-100g of dark chocolate will actually help to reduce a cough due to the ingredient theobromine. While milk chocolate also contains theobromine, it doesn’t contain as high a concentration and therefore won’t work as effectively as dark chocolate."

Apply pressure.,
Massage your earlobe for ten seconds.,
Irrigate.,
Blow your nose.,
Apply a warm compress.",How to Get Rid of a Runny Nose2," Press down ten times on the corner of your nose, pressure very gently to keep your nose from getting worse.It is believed that this pressure point can help alleviate sinus congestion and headaches that result from colds and allergies.Your nose should be almost closed each time you apply pressure to the area.


Repeat on the area just above your eyes, applying mild pressure.Repeat 10 times on each side of your face.

, Repeat on both sides.

, Use salt water to flush out the nasal passages, freeing up mucus and other debris.You can either use a syringe, neti pot, or other product designed for nasal irrigation.The first thing to stop or prevent a runny nose is to irrigate and remove pollen, dust or pus from nasal passages. Use distilled water with a neti pot and sinus rinse that washes saltwater in one nostril and it comes out the other nostril. The rinse is approximately 240 milliliters (8.1  fl oz) of distilled water with mixed salt and baking soda to pH balance for comfort. Runny noses can irritate mucous and cause a bloody nose. This rinse can dry out mucous and might lead to epistaxis (bloody noses). To moisturize the nose, a half teaspoon of Glycerin 99.5% Anhydrous from the first aid department of a pharmacy can also be added to the nasal rinse. Glycerin is moisturizing and forms a barrier so pollen and dust will not come in contact with mucous membranes. A saltwater nasal rinse also helps a bloody nose to stop bleeding. Be careful not to inhale the water.

, Runny noses result when you have excess mucus and fluid buildup in your nose and throat.The best way to treat a runny nose is to get the excess fluid out. Blow your nose gently, using a soft tissue to avoid skin irritation. Don't blow too often, as it could cause skin burning and redness.

Try prescription medications.,
Try magnesium and zinc pills.",How to Get Rid of a Runny Nose5," The options include Olopatadine Nasal spray and Ipratropium Nasal spray. Olopatadine is a mast cell stabilizer and antihistamine at the H1 receptor. Ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic agent chemically similar to atropine. Ipratropium bromide has long been used as an inhaler to treat lung disease and it was serendipitously found to cause dry noses. Irrigate and allow time for nasal passages to dry (usually 15 minutes) before using medicated nasal sprays.

, Magnesium 400mg supplement oral pills can help blood vessels dilate and restore blood vessel responsiveness in the mucous producing glands. Oral Zinc 15mg supplements can also benefit intracellular pathways that cause secretions like mucous.

Identify the cause of your runny nose.,
Avoid nasal irritants.",How to Get Rid of a Runny Nose6," There are a number of potential causes, including common colds, flus, allergies, cold weather, stress, exposure to tobacco smoke, chickenpox, and whooping cough.If you are experiencing other symptoms in addition to a runny nose, like a fever or sore throat, then see your doctor to determine whether you have a bacterial or viral infection that requires medical treatment.
Common colds usually go away on their own, but should be treated with fluids like water and fruit juice, lots of rest, and soothing foods like soup.

, Runny noses can be caused by allergies to pollen, pets, latex, dust mites, and foods.If you are in constant contact with an animal, plant, or material that you are allergic to, you will probably experience runny noses often.


If you have allergies, try to stay away from pets and take medication if you are about to stay with one for prolonged periods.
Thoroughly clean your home to remove dust mites, and stay away from food and animals that you are allergic to.
Runny noses can also be caused by excessively dry or cold weather. Try using a humidifier to restore some of the moisture in the air in your home. Humidify the air and warm the air to keep nasal passages comfortable. Dry cold air can insult the mucous membranes and cause rhinitis. Dry nasal passages can become irritated and will be more likely to become infected and bleed."

Check with a physician before giving herbs to children. You also should check with a physician before ingesting herbs if you are taking medications.
Some of these herbs may cause allergic reactions. Test out the herb by taking a small dosage before taking it.

, Herbal teas are helpful with loosening phlegm. They also don’t contain caffeine, which can increase mucus production. Tea not only helps loosen congestion because it is a warm fluid, but you can also add expectorant herbs to increase the loosening of mucus in the chest. Chamomile and lemon teas are good for phlegm, and peppermint, spearmint, and ginger herbs are great for teas.


Take one teaspoon of dried herb, or three teaspoons of fresh herb, and steep in one cup of boiled water. Let it steep for five to 10 minutes. Drink multiple cups a day.
You can add some honey and lemon to taste. Cayenne pepper, garlic, mustard seed, black pepper, and onions tend to be the strongest and can be somewhat irritating, so drink these teas slowly.
If you are giving these teas to a child, cut the amount of herb by ½ or increase to two cups of water.

, Essential oils and expectorant herbs can be inhaled to help with cough. Inhaling them help loosen mucus.You can crush and boil the herbs in a pot so you can inhale them, or place them in a diffuser. The easiest way may be to get the herbs in the form of essential oils. You can place the essential oils in a burner, place them in warm water, or place them in a diffuser.


You can also inhale a cloth soaked in the herb. You can either soak it in the essential oils or in the water where you boiled the herb.
Use this in moderation as inhaling too much of any substance can severely irritate the lungs.

Choose an expectorant herb.,
Make a tea.,
Try steam therapy.",How to Get Rid of a Chesty Cough2," Expectorant herbs help make it easier to cough up phlegm. Depending on the way you choose to use them, you can use essential oils or dried herbs. These essential oils or dried herbs have antibacterial, antifungal, or antiseptic properties in addition to the expectorant properties, meaning they can kill bacteria and other microorganisms that can infect the sinuses. Expectorant herbs include:Eucalyptus

, Tea is a great way to ingest expectorant herbs to reduce your cough. Measure out one teaspoon of your dried herb of choice or three teaspoons of fresh herb. Steep the herb in one cup of boiled water. Let it steep for five to ten minutes.Drink four to six cups a day.
Add honey and lemon to taste. They both have antiviral and antibacterial properties that can also help soothe your cough. Do not give honey to children under one year old.
Cayenne pepper, black pepper, garlic, onions, and mustard seed tend to be strong and can be irritating. If you make teas with these herbs, drink them slowly.
If you are giving these teas to a child, cut the amount of herb by ½ or increase to two cups of water.

, Inhaling steam helps get the dried herbs into the lungs. It also helps open up the nasal passages and thin out the mucus. You can use either the dried herbs or the essential oils of many of these herbs. Both can be effective and depend on your preferences and what you have available.Add one to two drops of any essential oils made from expectorant herbs or one to two teaspoons of the dried herb to boiling water. Start with one drop per one quart of water. Once you add the herbs, boil for another minute, turn off the heat and move the pot to a comfortable area.
Drape a cotton towel over your head and hold your head over the steaming pot. Keep your face at least 12 inches away from the water to avoid scalding yourself. Close your eyes, and breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth for five counts, and then in and out through your mouth for two counts. Repeat for 10 minutes or as long as the water is still steaming.
You can do this every two hours.
To any herbal steam treatment listed, you can add a tiny pinch of cayenne pepper or black pepper. Make sure to only add a very small amount because they may be too irritating for your respiratory system.

Use a controlled cough.,
Try the huff cough.,
Loosen mucus with chest physical therapy (CPT).",How to Get Rid of a Chesty Cough3," A good way to make yourself cough up when you have a wet cough is through controlled coughing. Start seated in a comfortable place with both feet on the floor. Cross your arms over across your abdomen, breathing in slowly through your nose. Lean forward and press your arms against your abdomen. Cough two to three times in sharp, short bursts. The second and third cough should loosen the phlegm enough to cough it out. Spit it out.


Breathe in again through your nose so the mucus will not move back down your throat.
Rest a moment, then repeat the process if you still have mucus., Start sitting down with your chin slightly raised. Breathe in slowly using your diaphragm instead of your chest. Hold your breath for two to three seconds, then let it out in a sharp burst of air through your mouth. Repeat two to three times, then breath normally for a few breaths. Make yourself cough once you feel enough phlegm build up in the back of your throat.


It usually takes three to five cycles of huff breathing to clear enough mucus.
The stronger the breath, the more mucus you will push out.
Don't overtire yourself., Chest physical therapy is a method helpful for everyone from children to adults that loosens mucus stuck to the lungs. This requires a partner, so get someone to help you. Start with the congested person lying down with her chest raised about 45 degrees. Using a cupped hand, gently tap your hand on the area between the nipple and collarbone on the left side of the chest. Continue to tap your hand, using gentle but firm pressure, for two minutes. Repeat on the same area on the right side of the chest. To help clear the rest of your lungs, repeat the cupped hand tapping on:


Over the shoulder blade on the left and right side of the back, after moving to a seated position leaning over a pillow in your lap
On the front sides on the left and right while lying flat on the back
On the sides on the left and right, while alternating lying on both sides with the arms over the head
On the upper back above the edge of the ribs on both sides, while lying flat on the stomach
You will cough during and for up to two hours after CPT. This is common and lets you know it's working.This technique is often used with children and adult with cystic fibrosis.

Take it easy when blowing your nose.,
Take an over-the-counter decongestant or antihistamine.,
Use a saline nasal spray.,
Use steam to ease congestion.,
Stay hydrated.,
Put a warm compress over your nose.,
Use a vapor rub.,
Rest in an upright position.,
Use nasal adhesive strips.,
Eat spicy food.,
Use a soap rub.",How to Clear a Stuffy Nose1," If your nose is stuffed up but not dripping, or mucus isn't coming out easily when you blow your nose, don't force it. Your impulse may be to blow your nose — hard — until you expel some mucus, but it's best if you leave the tissues alone. Only blow your nose when it is running.


Blowing hard repeatedly will make the delicate membranes inside your nostrils get more inflamed, and can quickly lead to increased stuffiness. It seems counter-intuitive at first, but you really will feel better if you use tissues less.;
, Depending on the cause of the stuffiness, you might be able to find some relief in widely available medications. Here's what to choose:


If you have a cold, pick up a decongestant. Decongestants will ease the swelling and inflammation in your nasal passages, leading to easier breathing. You can take them orally, as a pill, or use a decongestant nasal spray. Be aware that decongestant nasal sprays are only recommended for three consecutive days of use; oral decongestants such as Sudafed can be taken for up to seven days.
If you're suffering from allergies, such as hay fever, get an antihistamine. If allergies are at the root of your problem, an antihistamine will both relieve congestion and take care of other symptoms, like sneezing. Be aware that some antihistamines can cause sedation. Look for non-drowsy options to take during the day and wait to drive or use heavy machinery until you see how the antihistamine affects you.

, Saline nasal sprays are simply salt water in a convenient applicator — no medications or drugs are included. The water will soothe the inflammation in your nose, as well as flushing out any mucus or bacteria.


Buy the spray, or make your own spray. You can purchase sterile saline sprays at most drug stores. Or, if you own a nasal aspirator or bulb syringe, make your own by mixing 1/4 teaspoon of salt with 1 cup warm, sterile water.
Lean over a sink, with the tip of your nose is pointing toward the drain. This position allows the water to easily run out of your nose.
Slowly spray the saline into one nostril at a time. If you're using a bulb syringe, squeeze it a little to evacuate the air, dip it into the saline solution, and release the bulb. Squeeze the bulb again to put the solution into your nostril.
Allow the solution to drain from your nose completely before spraying again.
Use the saline solution two to three times a day.
Check out How to Use a Neti Pot for an alternate way to irrigate your sinuses with saline solution.

, The moisture and heat from steam will ease the inflammation and help you breathe easier. The good news about this method: you can do it as often as you need to, including running a humidifier constantly until you feel better.


Take a steamy shower. Close the bathroom door so that no steam escapes and turn the water temperature up. If you don't want to bathe, simply get the shower going and inhale the steam as it fills the bathroom.
Inhale the steam from a boiling pot of water. Bring the water to a gentle boil, and carefully lean over it to breathe in the steam. (Just make sure you don't burn yourself!)
Run a humidifier or vaporizer. This can be especially helpful while you're sleeping. Make sure you follow the instructions for cleaning the unit, as mold can easily grow on humidifiers, which will only make your symptoms worse.

, Drinking plenty of fluid will thin out any mucus in your nose, making it easier to expel. The extra moisture in your system will also soothe irritated nasal passages and prevent sinus blockages.


Some people find it helpful to drink warm fluids when they're congested. Consider herbal teas, broths, or soups.

, Wet a washcloth with water that's as hot as you can stand, lie down, and lay the cloth over the bridge of your nose so that it covers your sinuses but leaves the path to your nostrils clear. Rewet the washcloth when it starts to feel uncomfortably cold.


It might take a few rounds of reheating the washcloth for you to feel any benefit, so be patient. Try using a compress while you do something relaxing, like listening to music or watching TV.

, Most chest or vapor rubs contain menthol, eucalyptus, and/or camphor, which some people believe helps ease congestion when the vapors are inhaled. Popular rubs that can be used for this purpose include Vick's, Tiger Balm, and IcyHot. Although the ingredients in these remedies may effectively relieve the sensation of a stuffy nose in many people, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that they effectively treat cold symptoms.Try these application methods for some relief:


Rub it on your throat or chest if you're going to sleep. It's close enough to your nose that you'll be able to breathe it consistently as you sleep, but not so close that it will irritate your eyes.
Put some vapor rub on a tissue, then hold the tissue to your nose and inhale deeply.
Or, if you don't have any vapor rub on hand, dab a drop or two of peppermint oil beneath your nose. It should have the same effect.

, If you find that the congestion gets worse when you lie down, try to elevate your head a little bit. Put an extra pillow beneath your head, or try to sleep in a recliner.

, These thin white strips go over the bridge of your nose, and are meant to manually widen your nostrils just enough to help you breathe easier. They might be marketed as anti-snoring strips in some stores.

, If your sinuses are congested, consider chowing down on a dish that's slightly spicier than you usually enjoy. Drink plenty of water as you eat, and you should find that your nose is running by the end of the meal. Blow out as much mucus as you can.

, If it is merely a mucus-filled nose this method can help. When you're in the shower or bath, take some soap and wet your finger so they can run over skin easily. Massage both side of the nose for a little while and this should soothe the nose and the mucus should run easily out of your nose due to the warmth.

Use a nasal steroid spray.,
Use decongestants.,
Take antihistamines.,
Get pain relief.,
Consult your physician.",How to Care for a Sinus Headache1," Intranasal steroids, such as fluticasone (Flonase) or triamcinolone (Nasacort), which are now available over-the-counter, work by reducing inflammation in the nose. These sprays can be particularly helpful for sinus headaches that are triggered by allergies. Nasal steroid spray has the benefit of having no major side effects like those caused by many oral decongestants and antihistamines, such as drowsiness and dry mouth. Note, however, that it takes a few days for the steroid to build up to its full effect; this means that you will not experience immediate relief.If you're using Flonase, the typical dosage is one spray per nostril twice daily. If you are using Nasacort, the typical dosage is two sprays per nostril once daily.
There are also other nasal steroids available with a prescription, such as mometasone Furoate (Nasonex).
Potential side effects include indigestion, nausea, headaches, and a bad taste or smell while using the spray.
New guidelines suggest that intranasal steroids should be the first line of treatment for sinus congestion.;
, Using an over-the-counter decongestant or medication can help relieve pressure in your sinuses by unblocking the nasal passages and helping them to drain. You can get them in the form of nasal sprays or as oral medication and they can be purchased at most pharmacies. Consult your doctor to ensure that the decongestant will not affect any health conditions you may have, such as high blood pressure, or have any negative interactions with any medications you may be taking.In addition, use a salt water nasal spray to help relieve congestion. Use it no more than six times daily. Nasal sprays other than the salt water variety may increase congestion or inflammation. Follow the dosage and usage directions that come with the nasal spray.
Nasal decongestant sprays should not be used for more than three days at a time. Longer term use has been linked to ""rebound"" swelling of the nasal passages.
Oral decongestants, such as Sudafed or Bronkaid pills, however, can be used for one to two weeks without supervision by a physician. While the ""rebound"" swelling is less common with oral decongestants, some people experience palpitations or a rise in blood pressure.
Avoid nasal sprays containing zinc. These have been linked to permanent loss of the sense of smell (though this is rare).

, Some people find antihistamines useful, particularly in longer-lasting occurrences of sinus infections or people with allergies, because they can ease nasal congestion. Oral antihistamines include diphenhydramine (Benadryl), cetirizine (Zyrtec) and loratadine (Claritin). Note, however, that some older antihistamines such as Benadryl can have serious side effects for the sinuses, including the drying up of the mucous membranes of the nasal tissue and thickening the secretions, and can also cause drowsiness.Take 25 – 50 milligrams of Benadryl every eight hours as needed for congestion. This drug may prove difficult to tolerate due to its side effects of drowsiness and “fogginess."" You should consult with your doctor before giving children Benadryl.
Take 10 mg of Zyrtec once daily. Children older than six years of age may take this as well, in doses of 5 – 10 mg per day, depending on age and weight. There is also a liquid version available for children over two. Consult the instructions or follow your doctor's advice. This medication may cause some drowsiness
Take 10 mg of Claritin once daily. Second generation antihistamines such as this one have a much improved side effect profile and are less likely to cause drowsiness.Claritin is is available in liquid, pill, and other forms for children over age 2. Consult with your pediatrician.
You could also try a prescription antihistamine nasal spray such as azelastine (Astelin, Astepro) or olopatadine hydrochloride (Patanase).

, Relieve the pain with over-the-counter NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) such as ibuprofen (Advil) or naproxen (Aleve) which will help to open the airways by reducing the inflammation. They also reduce fever and relieve pain. Discuss these options with your doctor if you have any doubt about their usage and whether these medications are right for you.Aspirin (Acetylsalicylic Acid) is a drug that works as an analgesic, relieving pain by inhibiting pain signals in the brain. It is also an antipyretic, a drug that reduces fever. Do not give to children under 18, however.
Acetaminophen (Tylenol) can be used for pain and fever but will not help with the inflammation. Acetaminophen is safe for children.

, If your headache recurs frequently, is very severe, or doesn't improve with home treatments, you should be checked by a doctor. Moreover, if the problem is due to growths, like polyps, or other defects blocking the sinuses, you may need surgery. Here are a number of circumstances where you should see your doctor:If you experience soft tissue swelling over the frontal sinus with headache and fever. This can indicate an infection of the frontal bone.
If your eyelids swell, become droopy, red, or warm, or if you experience vision changes. This may be indicative of a rare but very serious condition which can result in permanent blindness. Fever and severe illness is usually present. If pain from a sinus headache moves to the eye or swelling around the eye, you should be evaluated immediately.
If your sinus pain is associated with the frontal sinuses. The infection can cause the formation of a blood clot in that area. Symptoms of a blood clot are similar to those of an eye socket infection, but in this case, the pupil of the affected eye will be dilated, or larger than usual.
Anyone with a sinus headache or infection and experiencing a personality change, stiff neck, high fever, altered consciousness, rash on the body, visual problems or seizures should seek immediate medical attention. These symptoms may mean that the infection has spread to the surrounding tissue, including the brain.

Breathe in steam.,
Buy a humidifier.,
Use a warm compresses.,
Make saline spray.,
Use a neti pot.,
Drink or eat hot substances.,
Exercise.,
Perform a manual massage.",How to Drain Sinuses1," Steam is one of the best ways to get your sinuses to drain. To produce enough steam to help, go into the bathroom and turn on the hot water in the shower, closing the door to keep the steam inside. Remain in the bathroom with the hot water running for three to five minutes. The nasal secretions should be loose and ready to be blown out of your nose after this time. You can also place your head over a large bowl of just boiled water and cover your head with a towel to hold in the steam. Breathe this for about 10 minutes, or until you feel your nasal congestion get better.


If you feel dizziness during either method, step into fresh air, have a seat, and breath normally. This will pass. It is not anything to be alarmed about and will resolve in a few minutes.You can use essential oils such as lavender, eucalyptus, and peppermint in the bathroom as well. They have shown promise in their natural decongestant properties and may prove beneficial. Eucalyptus oil has been shown to have decongestant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties, which should help to clear your sinuses and aid in prevention of a sinus infection.To use, drop five to 10 drops of the oil in the tub or bowl of water.
Keep essential oils away from children. They can cause serious problems and possibly death if ingested or used in the wrong way.;
, Sometimes, your sinuses may be really dry, which can add to sinus congestion. Humidifiers can help much in the same way as steam. Keep it on while you are around the house or while you sleep in order for it to increase the moisture level in your nose and help loosen nasal secretions.


You can apply around five drops of essential oils such as eucalyptus or peppermint into your humidifier water to help with your congestion. Eucalyptus oil has antimicrobial, decongestant, and anti-inflammatory properties that can help your condition., Heat can also help your nasal congestion and drain your sinuses. Take a moist washcloth and place it in the microwave for two to three minutes. The temperature should be hot but tolerable. Place the cloth across your nose and allow it to sit until the heat is gone. Repeat this as needed. It should loosen secretions and permit clearance from your nose with blowing.


Use care not to burn yourself as you remove the washcloth from the microwave. All microwaves are different and yours may have heated the cloth too hot., Saline spray is beneficial in loosening nasal congestion. To make your own, mix 8oz of warm water with one half teaspoon of salt in a bowl. To administer it, buy a bulb suction device at the store. Place the long end of the bulb suction device in the bowl of solution, push on it to release water, then let the bulb go so the bulb will fill. Next, place the small end in your nose and administer two sprays into each nostril to add the liquid to your nasal secretions, which will facilitate blowing.


You may also buy saline (non-medicated) nasal sprays and drops at the pharmacy.You can use nasal saline sprays every few hours as there is no medicine in them to worry about. Nasal saline drops are very safe and effective even for babies.

, A neti pot is a miniature tea pot shaped device can cleanse your sinus passages by flooding warm water through one nostril and out the other. To use, fill the pot with warm water around 120 degrees. Tilt your head to the left and a little bit back and place the spout of the pot at your right nostril. Raise the pot up and pour water into your right nostril. It will drain out the left nostril.


Make sure the water is clean and sterile. Boil the water beforehand to warm it and remove all the impurities if you are unsure about the safety of your water supply., There are drinks and food that can help with your sinus issues. Try hot tea, which will have a similar effect to steam. The heat from the tea will heat up your sinus passages and help them drain. Any type of tea you prefer is fine, though peppermint and lavender may have additional benefits with sinus congestion.


Also change up the way you eat. Try hot salsa, hot peppers, hot wings, or any food you prefer that has a spicy kick to it. The added heat to your system will help heat up your sinuses and get your secretions running.
Hot soup or broth can also help loosen the sinuses., Although you may not feel like exercising when you have sinus congestion, the physical activity can help increase the flow of the mucus in your sinuses, which will help with the clearance of nasal secretions. Try some aerobic exercise for 15 to 20 minutes to help you.


If you are allergic to pollen or other outside substances, try exercising inside at a gym or at home to avoid increases exposure to irritating allergens., Sometimes, you can use your hand to help drain your sinuses. Apply gentle pressure using your index and middle fingers, rotating in a circular motion over the forehead, the bridge of your nose, beside your eyes, and under your eyes. Use an oil such as rosemary oil along your forehead to help open up your sinus passages.


This manual manipulation can manually or structurally break up secretions as well as warm the area with the action of your hands."

Recognize the basic symptoms.,
Consider how long you have had symptoms.,
Check for a fever.,
Look for dark yellow or green mucus.,
Know when to see a doctor.",How to Clear a Sinus Infection1," Sinusitis generally presents itself with the same basic symptoms. Symptoms of acute sinusitis often worsen after 5-7 days. Symptoms of chronic sinusitis may be milder, but are more long-lasting.Headache
Pressure or tenderness around the eyes
Nasal congestion
Runny nose
Sore throat and post-nasal drip (the sensation of “dripping” or running mucus at the back of your throat)Fatigue
Cough

Fever;
, Sinusitis can be acute (lasting less than four weeks) or chronic (lasting longer than twelve weeks).Having symptoms for a long time does not necessarily mean your sinusitis is more severe or dangerous.









Acute sinusitis can be caused by many things, but viral infection is the most common cause (90-98% of cases).You may get acute sinusitis after having a cold. Acute sinusitis due to a viral infection will usually improve within 7-14 days.
Allergies are the most common cause of chronic sinusitis. You may also be more susceptible to chronic sinusitis if you have asthma, nasal polyps, or if you smoke.

, Allergic sinusitis usually is not associated with a fever. Sinusitis caused by an infection, such as the common cold, may present with a fever.








A high fever (over 102F) is often a sign of bacterial sinus infection. If you have a fever above 102F, consult with your doctor.

, Dark yellow or green mucus with a bad smell or taste may be a sign of bacterial sinus infection. If you think you have a bacterial sinus infection, consult with your doctor. S








Physicians will often wait for further observation before prescribing an antibiotic. Many cases of bacterial sinusitis improve without antibiotic treatment. Doctors try to avoid prescribing antibiotics unless truly necessary, because too much antibiotic use can increase your risk of developing an antibiotic-resistant infection.Antibiotics will only help to treat bacterial sinusitis. They will not help other types of sinus infection.
Only 2-10% of acute sinusitis is caused by bacterial infection., In addition to high fever and dark yellow or green mucus, there are other symptoms that signal you should see a doctor. A doctor will evaluate you and determine whether a bacterial infection is likely and whether antibiotics are needed. If you have any of the following symptoms, consult with your physician to determine what treatment she recommends:









Symptoms that last longer than 7-10 days
Symptoms such as headache that do not respond to over-the-counter medicationsProductive cough with dark yellow, green, or bloody mucus
Shortness of breath, heaviness of your chest, or chest pain
Stiff neck or severe neck pain
Ear pain
Vision changes, redness, or swelling around the eyes
Development of an allergic reaction to any medication. Symptoms may include hives, swelling of the lips or face, and/or shortness of breath
Worsening of asthma symptoms in individuals with asthma
If you have been suffering from chronic sinusitis, it’s a good idea to see a doctor. S/he can help you treat long-term sinusitis. S/he may also refer you to an allergist or otolaryngologist (Ear-Nose-Throat doctor) to help determine the possible causes.

, A humidifier can add moisture to the air, which relieves the irritation in the nasal cavity. When the nasal cavity is irritated, it produces excess mucus as a response.

, Chronic postnasal drip could be caused by an underlying food allergy that you don't yet know about or have recently developed. Check with an allergist to see if you could be allergic to something and not yet know it.


The two main allergies are to gluten/wheat and dairy. Dairy is often linked to sinus, upper respiratory, and throat problems, while wheat is often associated gastrointestinal tract problems.Since dairy is a likely culprit, phase dairy out of your diet for one month. If you experience no change in your symptoms, you've ruled out dairy as a possible allergen. If you experience an improvement in symptoms, you know that your body reacts to dairy by producing more mucus, although studies indicate a no clear link between dairy and mucus production."

, Place the infant on a flat surface, with a rolled towel beneath the shoulders to tip the head back. Place a few drops of saline solution in each nostril, and wait 30 to 60 seconds.


To make your own saline solution, mix 1/4 teaspoon salt with 1/2 cup lukewarm water.

, Turn the infant on their stomach to help the mucus drain out. You have two choices when it comes to manual removal:


Roll a tissue into a small cone, and swab it around the nostrils. Do not insert cotton swabs into an infant's nose, ever.
Use a bulb syringe or nasal aspirator to remove mucus. Push out a small portion of air, insert the aspirator into the very front portion for the nostril, and gently release the bulb. Squeeze any mucus you remove onto a tissue.

, Nasal congestion can cause serious problems in infants if it continues for too long. Get help if you notice the following symptoms:


The congestion interferes with the baby's ability to feed.
The baby has a fever.

Using a bulb syringe purchased at the drugstore, irrigate your nostrils with this homemade saline rinse to help loosen and liquefy your nasal secretions and relieve congestion. Try doing two sprays in each nostril.Use water that is distilled, sterile, or already boiled and cooled. Always rinse the instrument after each use and let air dry before next use.

, A Neti pot is miniature tea pot-shaped device that has gained support from the medical community as a way of cleansing your sinus passages. Water from the Neti pot increases drainage and decreases inflammation in the nasal passages that contributes to sinus headaches. The Neti pot works by flooding warm water through one nostril and out the other. Do not use a Neti pot if you cannot blow your nose. You simply fill the “teapot” with warm water (120 degrees) and tilt your head to allow the water to pour into your right nostril and drain out the left. Then, do the other side.Use water that is distilled, sterile, or already boiled and cooled. Always rinse the Neti pot with clean water and dish detergent after each use.
There have been some reports of rare amoebic infections via the Neti pot in areas with unclean water but there have been no such reports in the United States.

, When you go to sleep at night, place a couple of pillows beneath your head so that it is elevated. This will make breathing easier and keep the sinus pressure from building up and causing a headache., Fill a one-quart pot with water. Boil the water on the stove for a minute or two or until it is steaming vigorously. Then remove the pot from the heat and place on a heat resistant mat on a table. Drape a large, clean cotton towel over your head and then place your head over the steaming pot. Close your eyes and keep your face at least 12 inches away from the water so that you don't burn yourself. Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth for five counts. Then reduce the inhales and exhales to two counts. Do this 10 minutes or for as long as the water is still steaming. Try to blow your nose during and after the treatment.Keep any children away from the pot while it is boiling and while it is steaming. Try to do a steaming treatment when there aren't any children around.
You can use this technique frequently, up to every two hours. When you're out and about or at work, you can simulate a steam treatment by placing your face over the steam coming from a cup of hot tea or bowl of soup.You can also add herbs and essential oils (one to two drops) to your steaming water. Spearmint or peppermint, thyme, sage, oregano, lavender, tea tree oil, and black lavender oil have either antibacterial, antifungal or antiseptic properties., Taking long, hot, steamy showers works very similarly to the steam treatments described above. The hot water from the shower creates warm, moist air that is useful in clearing out blocked nasal passages and relieving sinus pressure. Try blowing your nose naturally. The heat and steam will help moisten and liquefy the secretions in the sinuses to better facilitate their evacuation.You also achieve a similar beneficial effect by placing a warm compress on your face to help open up your nasal passages and relieve any pressure you might be feeling in your sinuses. Warm a moist washcloth in the microwave for two to three minutes. Always take care not to burn yourself., The warm, humid air of a humidifier may ease nasal congestion and sinus pain by helping the nasal passages to drain and to bring down inflammation. Follow the directions that come with your humidifier.Try placing the humidifier in your bedroom while you sleep as this is one time when people experience increased sinus pressure.
When your nasal passages are blocked, you need to focus on keeping your nasal passages and sinuses moist. Although many people think that if you have have a runny nose that dry air is the trick, dry air only further irritates the membranes in your nasal passage.
Humidifiers are especially good during the wintertime because the air in most homes is very dry due to central heating.
Even placing a hot bowl of water on your bedroom floor can increase the moisture in the air. Just make sure to put it in a place where you won't accidentally tip it over or step into it.

, Apply gentle pressure using your index and middle fingers, rotating in a circular motion over the forehead (frontal sinus) and the bridge of your nose and behind your eyes (orbital sinus) as well as under the eyes (maxillary sinus). Do this for several minutes and then blow your nose right after.You can also apply an oil, such as rosemary or peppermint, as you massage that may open up your sinus passages. Just don't let the oil get into your eyes.
If you can get a friend to assist, lie down and have a friend massage your head. Have your friend place his thumbs above your eyebrows in the center of your forehead and draw the thumbs up toward the hairline, then lift. Repeat, but draw the thumbs to the temples, then lift at the hairline. Repeat a fraction higher each time until the whole forehead region has been massaged.

, Keep the body hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids (at least eight full glasses a day). Nasal passages become congested when the tissue in the passages is inflamed and is unable to drain and drinking liquids will assist with nasal decongestion. The liquids assist with drainage by thinning out your nasal mucus and reducing the inflammation that leads to sinus headaches.Thinned out mucus is much more likely to drain. Whenever you feel the beginnings of sinus headache, make a concerted effort to stay hydrated.Water is best. Although juice tastes great, it is high in fructose and unneeded calories. If you don’t like unflavored water, then add a twist of lemon, lime or frozen strawberries.
Hot herbal tea may also help clear congestion while keeping you hydrated.

, Exercise is a natural decongestant. Getting your heart rate up just enough to break sweat can help clear your nasal secretions. If you can do some aerobic exercise, such as running or cycling for even 15 minutes, you may experience some relief.You can even try moderate exercise, such as going for a brisk walk.

, Hot salsa, peppers, hot wings, horseradish, and other spicy foods can get your nasal secretions flowing and thereby help to relieve the pressure in your sinuses. The nose is best blown when the secretions are moist and fluid. That is why remedies that generate this are effective.For sushi lovers, try wasabi. The spicy topping will temporarily relieve sinus pressure and help clear your sinuses.

Try medications.,
Ask your doctor about immunotherapy.,
Seek medical attention.",How to Drain Sinuses2," There are many medications, both over the counter and prescription, that can help relieve nasal congestion in your sinuses. Flonase and Nasacort are nasal steroid sprays that are available over-the-counter. To use, administer one spray per nostril, once or twice daily. This is especially helpful if you have allergies. You may also try Zyrtec, which is a non-drowsy antihistamine, which can reduce sinus congestion. Take 10 mg once a day. Also try Claritin, another non-drowsy antihistamine that may work well for you. Take 10 mg once a day. Oral decongestants that include pseudoephedrine may also be helpful.


If the over the counter doses don't work for you, talk to your doctor about stronger version of these medications or other, prescription only decongestants that may work better for your case.OTC pain medications for the pain associated with sinus congestion, such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen, may also help.Nasal decongestants, such as Afrin, can quickly reduce sinus congestion, but should only be used for three days. If you use them longer, you may get rebound symptoms.Pregnant women or people with medical problems such as heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, or thyroid disease should not use these medications without talking to their doctor. And talk to your child’s doctor before giving them to children.

, If you have severe chronic allergies that cause your sinus issues, consider immunotherapy to eliminate your sinus congestion. Immunotherapy is the process by which you are administered small doses of what you are allergic to, such as pollen, mold, or pet dander, either by injections or under the tongue. The first step is to get tested by an allergist, who will figure out exactly what you are allergic to. Once your doctor has confirmed what you are allergic to, he or she will begin to administer the allergen as injections or under your tongue. The doctor gives you doses of the allergen with the idea that your body will learn to adapt to the allergen, no longer see it as an invader, and no longer continue to mount an immune response, such as the sinus congestion or a runny nose.


The injections or treatments will take place weekly for the first four to six months. Next, you should be at the maintenance level and require treatment every two to four weeks. Gradually you will go longer and longer between treatments until you only need them once a month. After one year, if you have responded to therapy, you will have either no symptoms or be much improved and your treatments can continue for three to five years, when you should be completely immune to the allergen.
If you haven't responded, the immunotherapy will be terminated.
This treatment is time consuming and can be expensive, but many people are turning to this therapy because it removes their sinus congestion and improves their quality of life., There are certain situations when a doctor may be needed. If you have had symptoms of a head cold for more than two weeks, you should see your doctor to check for a larger issue such as a bacterial infection. If there is a change from your usual allergy secretions and symptoms for a week, it is reasonable to seek treatment if you are worsening on day seven instead of improving.


Occasionally, sinus congestion can lead to a bacterial sinus infection, and your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic at that time. Sinus surgery is rarely needed for chronic sinus congestion or infections.
If you are bleeding from your sinuses, if your sinus congestion is associated with headaches that are severe or with high fevers, confusion, neck stiffness, or weakness, or if any symptom increases after the use of any home remedy, see your doctor immediately.Drainage from sinus congestion can trigger symptoms in people with asthma or other lung problems. See your doctor right away if you have a cough, wheezing, chest pain, or shortness of breath associated with your sinus congestion.

Consult a doctor.,
Use antibiotics as directed.,
Take an antihistamine for allergies.,
Take an OTC pain reliever.,
Try a nasal spray.,
Try a decongestant.,
Consider a mucolytic.",How to Clear a Sinus Infection2," If you are going to take a prescription medication, you will obviously need to see a doctor first. However, you may need to call your doctor before taking a non-prescription medication in some cases as well, especially if you have medical conditions or take other medications. While many over-the-counter medicines are safe for healthy adults, there are many circumstances which would complicate self-treatment with OTC medicines.









Never give medication to children that is meant for an adult, as many cold medicines are not recommended for children.
Women who are pregnant are likewise restricted from many cold medicines, and nursing mothers may need to check with a care provider or lactation consultant before taking OTC medications.

, If your physician prescribes antibiotics for a bacterial sinus infection, be sure that you take the entire course of antibiotics, even after you begin to feel better. This will minimize the possibility of the infection to return or become resistant to the antibiotic.









Antibiotics commonly used for bacterial sinus infections include amoxicillin (most commonly), augmentin, cefdinir, or azithromycin (for individuals who may be allergic to amoxicillin).Side effects common to these antibiotics include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and a skin rash. More serious side effects such as fainting, trouble breathing, or hives should be reported to your doctor right away., If your sinus problems are associated with seasonal or systemic allergies, antihistamines may help. Antihistamines are medications that directly work against your body’s reaction to allergens by preventing histamine from attaching to receptors in your cells. Antihistamines can stop the symptoms of allergic sinusitis before they start.








Antihistamines generally come in pill form, such as loratidine (Claritin), diphenhydramine (Benadryl), and Cetirizine (Zyrtec). Liquid, chewable, and dissolvable forms may also be available, particularly for children.
Consult with your doctor or pharmacist to determine which antihistamine will be most effective for you.
Do not take an antihistamine for acute sinusitis without consulting with your doctor. Antihistamines may complicate acute sinusitis by thickening your nasal secretions., Pain relievers will not cure a sinus infection, but they can reduce some of the unpleasant symptoms associated with it like headaches and sinus pain.








Acetaminophen/paracetamol (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil) help relieve pain from headaches, sore throat, and can reduce fever.

Be mindful that ibuprofen should not be given to children under 6 months of age.



, An over-the-counter nasal spray may provide some immediate relief to blocked sinuses. There are three main types of nasal sprays; saline sprays, decongestant sprays, and steroid sprays.









Decongestant sprays such as Afrin should not be used for more than 3-5 days, as doing so can actually worsen your congestion.Saline sprays can safely be used frequently and help clear out mucous.
Fluticasone (Flonase) is a steroid nasal spray that is used to treat symptoms of allergies. This type of nasal spray can be used longer than decongestant sprays, but may not help with sinus infections, as it is meant to help with allergy symptoms.

, These medications can help relieve stuffy noses and sinus pain. Do not take a decongestant for more than 3 days. Using a decongestant for too long can cause “rebound” congestion.








Common choices include phenylephrine (Sudafed PE) or pseudoephedrine (Sudafed 12-hour). Some antihistamines include a decongestant, such as Allegra-D, Claritin-D, or Zyrtec-D.
Many medicines marked as “D” contain pseudoephedrine and may be held behind the pharmacy counter due to purchasing restrictions.
Some decongestants contain acetaminophen. Do not take additional acetaminophen if you are taking a decongestant that already contains it. Overdose can cause serious complications., A mucolytic (such as guaifenesin/Mucinex) thins mucous secretions, which may help improve drainage from your sinuses.There is not strong evidence that these help treat sinusitis, but you may have success with the medication.








"
"
Get some rest.,
Drink plenty of fluids.,
Try a Neti pot or nasal syringe.,
Inhale steam.,
Run a mist humidifier.,
Apply a warm compress.,
Eat spicy foods.,
Drink tea.,
Treat your cough.,
Stop smoking.",How to Clear a Sinus Infection3," If you're continuing to not get enough sleep or work excessive hours, it will take your body longer to get rid of the infection. If at all possible, try to have a full 24 hour period of complete rest.








Try to sleep with your head elevated. This will help promote drainage and reduce congestion., Staying hydrated will help thin the mucus and reduce the feeling of blockage.Water is the best option, but non-caffeinated tea, sports drinks containing electrolytes, and clear broths are also good options.









Men should drink at least 13 cups (3 liters) of fluids per day. Women should drink at least 9 cups (2.2 liters) of fluids per day. If you’re sick, you may need even more.Avoid alcohol. It can actually make the swelling in your sinuses worse.Caffeine may dehydrate you, which could make the mucus thicker., Flushing your sinuses (also known as “irrigating” them) can help clear out built-up mucus naturally. You can do this several times a day with minimal side effects.








Use a sterile saline solution in the pot or syringe. You can buy a prepared solution or make your own using distilled, boiled, or sterile water.
Tilt your head at about a 45-degree angle. You will want to do this over a sink or in the shower, to make cleanup easier.Place the spout of the Neti pot (or the tip of the syringe) into your top nostril. Gently pour the solution into your nostril. It should run out the other nostril.
Repeat on the other side.

, Steam will help keep your sinuses moist and may make it easier for you to breathe. Take a hot shower or inhale the steam from a bowl.Using a mentholated “shower bomb” can help.









To use a bowl, carefully pour boiling hot water into a temperature-safe bowl. (Do not inhale steam from water that is still on the stove!) Put the bowl on a table or at a comfortable height so you can lean over it.Lean your head over the bowl. Do not get so close that the water or steam burns your face.
Cover your head and the bowl with a light towel. Inhale the steam for 10 minutes.
If desired, you can add 2-3 drops of eucalyptus oil or other decongesting oil to the water.
Use 2-4 times per day.If using this method with children, use extreme caution around the hot water and do not leave children unattended with the hot water treatment.

, Dry, hot air irritates sinus passages, so running a humidifier while you sleep will help make breathing easier. A warm or cool mist humidifier should work equally well. You can also add a few drops of essential oils like eucalyptus into the water in the humidifier, which will help further reduce congestion (but check the humidifier’s user manual before adding anything to the water).








Watch for mold. If the air is too humid, mold may begin to grow on or around your humidifier. Clean the humidifier regularly to keep it sanitary.

, To ease facial pressure and pain, apply a warm compress to the affected areas.









Moisten a small towel and microwave it for about 30 seconds. The towel should be quite warm, but not hot enough to be uncomfortable.
Place the compress on your nose, cheeks, or near the eyes to reduce your pain. Leave on for 5-10 minutes., Some research suggests that spicy foods, such as hot peppers or horseradish may help clear your sinuses.








The capsaicin in peppers and spicy foods may help thin mucus and promote drainage.Other “spicy” foods such as ginger may also help you feel better.

, Hot, non-caffeinated tea may help soothe a sore throat, especially if it contains ginger and honey. This can also help reduce coughing. However, you should avoid teas with too much caffeine, as these may dehydrate you or cause you to lose sleep.









You can make a simple ginger tea at home. Grate about 1 ounce of fresh ginger per cup of boiling water and allow to steep for at least 10 minutes.
One traditional herbal tea, “Throat Coat,” has been shown to significantly relieve sore throat pain vs. a placebo tea.Benifuuki green tea may help reduce nasal and allergic symptoms when drunk regularly., Often, a sinus infection will be accompanied by a cough. To ease your discomfort and the inconvenience of a cough, you should stay well hydrated, drink warm liquids such as herbal tea, and take honey (only for individuals over the age of 1).








, Cigarette smoke, even secondhand smoke, causes irritation of the sinus lining and promotes sinus infections.Secondhand smoke contributes to as many as 40% of the chronic sinusitis cases in the United States each year. You should stop smoking and avoid secondhand smoke while you have a sinus infection.









To prevent future sinus infections and promote better overall health, stop smoking entirely. Smoking harms basically every organ in your body and can take years off your life expectancy."

Drink plenty of fluids to remain hydrated.,
Blow your nose frequently to remove excess mucus in the nasal cavity.,
Rinse the nasal cavity to remove mucus causing irritants.,
Use over-the-counter decongestants to relieve the symptoms of excess mucus buildup and postnasal drip.,
Use decongestants for only three days in succession.,
Remove mucus with mucus-thinning medications.,
Ask your doctor for prescription medications to relieve irritation and mucus buildup.",How to Cure Postnasal Drip2," Dehydration can aggravate the symptoms of rhinitis and postnasal drip. Avoid caffeine and alcohol, which can cause dehydration. Water is the best choice to remain hydrated while suffering from rhinitis and postnasal drip.


Look at your urine to determine if you're getting enough water during the day. If your urine is yellow, you're probably not getting enough water. If your urine is clearer, with at most a hint of yellow, you're probably drinking enough water.

, Blowing the nose can remove irritants, which causes a buildup of mucus. For mucus that cannot be cleared after blowing the nose, some people prefer snorting and spitting the excess mucus from the back of the throat, avoiding bad breath and dry mouth.

, Over the counter saline kits and nasal sprays are available to rinse the nasal cavity. The saline solution flushes the irritants from the nasal cavity, thins the mucus and relieves the membranes in the nose.


Try using a Neti pot to clear out the mucus in the sinus and the back of the throat. Be aware, however, that by using a sinus irrigation device you could be removing natural antimicrobial agents that get rid of enemy bacteria, viruses, and fungi., Oral decongestants narrow the blood vessels to reduce the amount of congestion in the nasal cavity.Decongestants are also available in a nasal spray.

, If symptoms don't get better after three days, discontinue use of decongestants.Use of decongestants after three days may be more harmful than helpful.

, Medications such as guaifenesin (Mucinex) are sold OTC and taken in tablet or syrup form.

, The physician can prescribe corticosteroid, antihistamine and anti-drip sprays to relieve postnasal drip.


Corticosteroid sprays treat the inflammation that occurs with non-allergic rhinitis.
Antihistamine sprays can effectively treat allergic rhinitis causes of postnasal drip but are not effective for non-allergic causes.
Anticholinergic or anti-drip sprays are medications used in asthma inhalers, which can help treat postnasal drip as well.

, If allergens are haunting your sinuses, the only home treatment you may need is a treatment of your home. Try the following suggestions to remove dust, pollen, and dander from your residence before they come back to bite you — in the nose.


Wash your clothes, sheets, pillowcases, and mattresses in hot water regularly. Hot water will kill any bacteria that may be causing your symptoms.
Use HEPA air filters in your home. HEPA stands for high efficiency particulate air, and is an industry standard tested by the government.
Vacuum regularly with true or absolute HEPA filters. Vacuuming with HEPA filters ensures that any allergens are picked up during the vacuuming process.

, All three may make mucus production worse.

, Try out a DIY steam treatment by covering your head with a towel and placing it a safe distance from a pot of warm water. Make the steam treatment aromatic by adding tea (ginger, mint, or chamomile, for example) or essential oils (lavender, rosemary, etc.).


Take a warm shower. Let the steam of the warm water work its way into your lungs and sinuses while you bathe.

Drink a cup of warm milk or hot water and honey to reduce your sugar cravings.,
Consume more fresh foods and avoid pre-packaged foods.,
Have a larger lunch and a smaller dinner.",How to Get Started With Ayurvedic Diet," There are three primary doshas in Ayurveda: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. You can review the qualities of each dosha to determine your dosha or take an online Dosha quiz to determine your dosha: http://doshaquiz.chopra.com/. If you have addictive eating behaviors or an eating disorder, you may have an underlying Vata imbalance as part of your mind-body type.Though some people may use Ayurvedic as a tactic to lose weight, it is not designed as a weight loss program. Rather, Ayurvedic focuses on ensuring you have a mind-body balance through your diet and your eating habits to have a more healthy lifestyle and way of thinking.;
, If your primary dosha is Vata, you are very focused on movement and change and possess an energetic and creative mind. Your require balance and stability in your life and low stress to feel energized and enthusiastic about life. But you are also prone to anxiety and insomnia.Vatas tend to have irregular eating patterns, especially when feeling stressed or overworked. You may also be guided by food cravings for comfort foods like chocolate, baked goods, or pastas, rather than a consistent and healthy meal schedule, and you may be prone to skipping meals. You can have extreme eating habits that involve lots of snacking and stress eating or missing meals entirely. Your eating is often centered around stress and you may use eating as a way to deal with feelings of anxiety and imbalance.

, A Pitta dosha tends to be full of intensity for food, experiences, and knowledge. Pittas enjoy being challenged and using their intellect to learn new things. When you feel imbalanced or stressed, you tend to develop heat related issues in your body like heartburn, ulcers, hypertension, and inflammatory conditions. This heat can also manifest in your personality, as you may be prone to frustration, irritability, and feelings of anger.Pittas crave order and predictability with their eating habits and diet, with structured meal times three times a day at the same time every day. You focus on stability and control in many aspects of your life, including eating, and may feel annoyed or grouchy if your meal schedule is thrown off or you eat later than usual. Pittas tend to overeat as a way to express anger, literally swallowing their anger, through eating too much at every meal. You may also view overeating as a way to rebel against stressful situations or larger issues in the world.

, This mind-body type tends to have a natural propensity for physical strength and endurance. You may be naturally athletic, with a calm personality and the ability to use critical thinking and retain information quickly. However, you may be prone to weight gain, fluid retention, and allergies if you are feeling imbalanced. You may also exhibit an aversion to change and an overall stubborn demeanor. Kaphas tend to hold on to experiences, relationships, and objects long after they stop being useful or necessary.Kaphas usually have a natural love of eating and can become addicted to food. If you are feeling imbalanced, you may eat constantly, before and after meal times. You may use food to hide your intense emotions and as a way to avoid confrontation with others or with your own feelings and emotions.

, The Ayurvedic diet focuses on creating meals around the six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent. The idea is to include all six tastes in every meal so every major food group is present on your plate and you are consuming enough nutrients. Foods that contain each of the six tastes include:Sweet: These include foods such as whole grains, dairy, meat, chicken, fish, honey, sugar, and molasses.
Sour: These include foods such as cheese, yogurt, alcohol, vinegar, pickled foods, tomatoes, plums, berries, and citrus fruits.
Salty: These include foods such as seaweed, salted meats, fish, soy sauce, and any food that contains added salt.
Bitter: These include foods such as green vegetables (leafy greens, celery, broccoli, sprouts, spinach, kale), endives, chicory, beets, and tonic water.
Pungent: These include foods such as onions, garlic, chilies, peppers, cayenne, black pepper, cloves, ginger, mustard, and salsa.
Astringent: These include foods such as dried beans, lentils, green apples, cauliflower, figs, pomegranates, and tea.
The six tastes are ordered in the order you should digest them at every meal. Start with sweet foods and move down to astringent foods.

, Vatas should consume more sweet, salty, and sour foods and limit their consumption of pungent, bitter, and astringent foods. As a Vata, you have a light, dry, cool nature so you should counteract this with warm, oily, and heavy foods. If you are looking to lose weight, you can minimize foods high in sugar or fat and have more natural grains, and fruits and vegetables.Consume more natural grains like barley, corn, millet, buckwheat, and rye. You should also have cooked rice, wheat, and oats every day.
Go for sweet fruits like bananas, avocados, mangoes, plums, berries, melons, papaya, peaches, cherries and nectarines. Make it easier for your body to digest these fruits by stewing or sauteing them. Avoid dried and unripe fruits, as well as apples, cranberries, pears, and pomegranates.
Have more cooked vegetables, using olive oil or ghee, such as asparagus, beets, green beans, sweet potatoes, turnips, broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini, and carrots. You can use spices like cardamom, cumin, ginger, salt, cloves, mustard seed, cinnamon, basil, cilantro, fennel, oregano, thyme, and black pepper, but avoid bitter herbs and spices like coriander, parsley, turmeric, and fenugeek.
Avoid eating beans as this can aggravate your stomach as a Vata. If you must eat beans, have chickpeas, mung beans, pink lentils, and soybeans (such as tofu). If you are not vegetarian, you can have organic chicken, turkey, seafood, and eggs, and reduce your intake of red meat.

, Pittas should focus on sweet, bitter, and astringent tastes and avoid pungent, salty, or sour tastes. Heat can affect Pittas negatively, so you should eat heavy, cool, and dry foods and liquids. Though you can have most sweeteners, avoid molasses and honey.You can have dairy such as butter, milk, ice cream, and ghee but you should avoid sour dairy products like yogurt, sour cream, and cheese. When cooking, you should use coconut, olive or sunflower oils, as well as soy sauce, but avoid almond, corn, and sesame oils.
Focus on increasing your consumption of wheat, rice, barley, and oats and reducing your consumption of brown rice, corn, rye, and millet.
You can also have sweet fruits like grapes, avocados, mangos, cherries, coconuts, pineapples, apples, oranges, and figs. Avoid sour fruits such as grapefruits, cranberries, lemons, and persimmons. Pittas should consume more cool fruits like asparagus, potatoes, leafy greens, pumpkins, broccoli, cauliflower, celery, zucchini, lettuce, okra, and green beans. Avoid hot, pungent vegetables like hot peppers, onions, garlic, tomatoes, and radishes.
When cooking with spices, go for seasonings that are cooling and soothing like coriander, cilantro, cardamom, saffron, and fennel. Use hot spices like ginger, cumin, black pepper, clove, salt, and mustard seed sparingly. Avoid pungent seasonings like chili peppers and cayenne. You can chew on fennel seeds after meals to help your stomach acid cool down.

, Go for foods that have a bitter, pungent, or astringent taste and avoid foods that have a sweet, sour, or salty taste.Have very low amounts of dairy products and only have low-fat milk or low-fat yogurt. You should only have honey as a sweetener and avoid other sources of sugar, as Kaphas are prone to issues like clogged sinuses, allergies, colds, and weight gain. You should have two to three cups of ginger tea a day to help with digestion and overall health.
You can have all types of beans as a protein in your diet, but limit your consumption of kidney beans, soybeans, and soy-based foods like tofu. Go for natural grains like corn, millet, buckwheat and rye but have less oats, rice, and wheat.
Go for lighter fruits like pears, apples, apricots, pomegranates, and cranberries and have less heavier fruits, such as bananas, melons, dates, figs, avocados, coconuts, and oranges. Do not have any dried fruits.
Kaphas can consume lots of vegetables in all varieties except for sweet and juicy vegetables like sweet potatoes, zucchini, and tomatoes. When cooking, use small amounts of extra virgin olive oil, almond oil, sunflower oil, mustard oil, and ghee and use a variety of pungent spices like pepper, ginger, cayenne, and mustard seed.

, As part of the Ayurvedic diet, you can use breathing awareness meditation to distract yourself from an emotionally based craving for unhealthy foods or to prevent food binging. Practice meditation whenever you feel a craving coming on.Sit in a quiet area with your hands by your sides and close your eyes. Breathe deeply, focusing on your breathing as it flows from your lungs out through your nose. Inhale and exhale with awareness.
Let your attention follow your breathe as it moves from your lungs and out your nose. Keep your eyes closed and continue to focus on your breath, pushing out all outside thoughts. Do this for five to ten minutes.

, Your body will send messages to your brain to indicate when it is hungry and requires food. Focusing on your body’s natural need for food, rather than your emotional desire for food, will ensure you are eating enough every day. Only eat when you are hungry and stop eating when you are satisfied. However, when you are feeling really hungry, eat until you are comfortable full but not stuffed or overly full. This will allow your digestive system to process the food and not be overwhelmed by food.Allow your stomach, rather than your emotions, to dictate how much you eat every day and when you eat. Try to do this for two weeks in a row, eating when you feel hungry, which may mean you eat at unusual times or do not eat for a period of time until you feel hunger. Then, only eat until you feel comfortably full. This will allow you to be more in touch with your body’s natural eating cycle and avoid overeating or eating with your emotions.

, It can be difficult to suppress a craving for sweets while on the Ayurvedic diet. One way to stave off sugar cravings if to have a warm cup of milk or to have hot water with honey and a little bit of lemon.If you have a constant craving for sweets, try having a cup of warm milk in the morning every day to prevent reaching for unhealthy sugar products. You can also have a cup of hot water with lemon and honey once a day to prevent sugar cravings.

, In the Ayurvedic diet, fresh foods are associated with energy, vitality, and health, while pre-packaged foods are associated with imbalance, fatigue, and staleness. Avoid canned, frozen, and pre-packaged foods to ensure you are only consuming foods that will add to your overall health. Go shopping every day or every other day at a farmer’s market for fresh fruits and vegetables.You should also minimize your consumption of leftovers and microwaved meals, as these are not considered fresh and full of energy.

, The Ayurvedic diet encourages a shift to smaller meals at night to improve overall well-being and to also aid in weight loss. Your digestive system is the most alert in the middle of the day at lunch time so try to shift your portions so you have a larger lunch and a smaller dinner. This can also improve your sleep, as your body will not need to process a large meal at night, and give you more energy during the day."

Write down everything that you have excelled at because of quitting weed.",How to Quit Smoking Weed After Years," Cannabis intake normally causes lack of initiative or laziness, an unwillingness to participate in many social situations (especially when interacting with non-smokers is involved), as well as damage to internal organs like the heart and lungs. These reasons are why the number of people deciding to quit smoking weed is progressively increasing. How has it changed you?


Having an addiction does not only destroy one’s physical health, but also makes one more prone to psychological disorders like schizophrenia, depression and anxiety.
Consumption of weed increases the release of serotonin in the body which is a chemical produced in the brain that gives feeling of pleasure. Unfortunately, the longer you smoke weed, the less and less serotonin gets produced, the less ""pleased"" you feel, and the more you're left with additional cravings.;
, Clear a few hours (or even a whole day) of your schedule and find a calm, serene place – settings which you enjoy and where you can be by yourself. Turn off your phone so that you won’t be disturbed or distracted by it and think about your use of marijuana. Some helpful questions to ask yourself are:


When did you first try marijuana and why did you do it?
For how long have you been smoking and how often do you do it?
What do you feel before and after smoking? (Try to especially concentrate on whether you are trying to ease negative thoughts or avoid dealing with problems by smoking.)
Were there times when you neglected your duties (to yourself, family and friends, school or work) because of smoking?
Are there activities that you want to take part of or would like to excel at but haven’t done so yet because you were not feeling very motivated?

, The closer you get to these, the easier it'll be to stop. Once you figure out your motivations to smoke, you can figure out what might motivate you to stop. Come up with corresponding goals -- something that will motivate you to kick the habit. That can be anything ranging from applying to a good college or taking better care of your family through excelling at a sport or a craft.


If you want to quit smoking cannabis, it is crucial to be certain of your motivators – the stronger they are, the better chances you have.

, Most of the people who have an addiction feel that they want to quit every time they smoke. They make a commitment to themselves each time for quitting and then end up doing it again. You need to know that this time your decision is final. In order to heal, the first step is to accept that you have a problem.


In this case, accepting that you have a problem is not just it -- you also need to accept that it is a problem and not a pleasure. Problems need addressing before they get any worse -- which is exactly what you are doing.

, Another essential point is to avoid blaming the substance, other people, or your living situation. To be successful in quitting, you have to try to take responsibility for your own actions – both positive and negative. This will aid you in the process as you will be more likely to praise yourself for success and work harder when things don’t turn out exactly the way you imagined.


Blaming others will only give you an ""easy out"" when things are difficult and will make you more likely to start smoking again. Even though the first step of quitting is being honest with yourself, you don’t have to complete the whole process on your own. Some techniques, especially psychological help, can aid your efforts tremendously.

, As much as weed is a great thing to experience, it comes with severe side effects that could last a long, long time. Knowing what could befall you could help clinch your decision. Here are a few effects that you might be facing after long-term addiction:


An increased heart rate
Lack of coordination in sensory organs
Anxiety
Hyperactivity
Hallucinations
Irritability
Mood swings
Lack of fertility
Isolation
Suicidal thoughts
Aggressive behavior
Intolerance

, It is immensely arduous for people to quit who have had drug dependency for a long period of time. Leaving the drug once and for all suddenly will just make the withdrawal symptoms worse and you might lose hope to continue. It is much easier if you initially decide to slow it down and then ultimately leave it completely. Don't try to go cold turkey!


If you have been smoking weed at least twice a day then try limiting yourself to once a day for the next week. This will help the body get used to less serotonin in a much healthier and easy way.

, Quitting an addiction can be difficult beyond belief so you need to keep reminding yourself that you have made a pledge to become finer for your own sake. Write it on a piece of paper or make a sticky note on your phone saying “I want to quit.” Make sure you can always see it.


There might be times when you would want to break all the chains and light that thing up but then this note will help you to remember the decision that you took for your own benefit.

, In order to do that, you should get rid of everything that reminds you of marijuana – paraphernalia, posters, music, movies, etc. This is an important step because even if you believe you have solved the problem and are keeping the mentioned above simply as souvenirs, you are more likely to get tempted to start smoking again.


Picture loving cake while knowing that you should never have it again and yet constantly keeping your favorite kind on the counter, where you can always see it. It is an unnecessary trigger that will only torment you.

, This includes irritability, lack of sleep, decreased appetite, fatigue and maybe even some headaches. Luckily, marijuana withdrawal is not that long of a process – it only takes about 10-15 days, depending on factors such as your age, health status and use duration.


However, it gets more challenging afterwards when you have to keep away from weed for the rest of your life. There are many factors that might trigger your use or could make it very difficult to deal with life without smoking. We'll discuss long-term strength shortly.

, Make sure you are surrounded by the right kind of people as peer pressure is one of the most influencing sources of getting into drugs. While quitting, be around the friends who have been encouraging you to quit as they will be more understanding towards your situation rather than being with your pot buddies who might attract you towards it again. They might be great people at heart, but having an exposure to drugs while in the process of quitting will make you covet it even more.


When you think you have accomplished your goal of quitting, you can bond with them again; only if you think you are strong enough to not indulge yourself in the addiction again should this be considered.

, You need friends and family who love and understand you. That is why it is essential to talk to your loved ones about your decision to stop smoking. Explain to them that this is difficult for you and you really need their support. Explaining that you are planning to take action and are very serious about your decision will help your loved ones get on board and do their best to support you.


Even though it is better, at least at first, to stay away from people who use marijuana, you might have some valuable relationships among those people. If that is the case, explain to them that you are not looking to change their behavior (otherwise they might feel attacked and try to talk you out of the decision).

Let them know what your reasons for quitting are and ask them not to smoke or demonstrate any behavior connected to smoking when they are around you. If they're true friends, they will do as you request.



, There are a lot support rehabilitation groups that have proven to be great sources of quitting addiction if you think you cannot do it all by yourself. A good rehabilitation centre is a great place to be at. Not only will you be kept accountable, but you'll be surrounded by people that are going through the same thing you are.


Some people need to be restricted or threatened by authority figures in order to stay balanced. These centres keep a check that you do not start with the addiction again and even helps you get sober with the help of medical and psychological help usually through cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as the most important method of treating cannabis use disorders (CUD).

, Therapy can be very useful with issues like this, due to the fact that it will help you understand your underlying motives for smoking and will let you cope better with trying life-situations which could otherwise bring you back to square one. Appropriately trained and certified therapists can serve as objective onlookers who could show you another point of view which you have not considered before, thus further motivating you to stop smoking marijuana.


What is more, these professionals have experience with people struggling to quit weed and so will be able to construct a tailor-made approach for your own personality and lifestyle. However, as there are many approaches in psychotherapy and even more therapists, it may sometimes be difficult to pick the most suitable one for your needs. That's what we'll discuss next.

, When going into therapy it might be useful to learn a bit more about the most common and successful approaches when it comes to quitting weed. Here's the gist:



Cognitive behavioral therapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy refers to the belief that your thoughts and actions are very much interconnected; therefore, through changing your negative thoughts you can change your negative behaviors. This approach can be very useful when trying to quit smoking weed, as it will examine the thoughts that provoke your smoking and thus will work on the behavior itself.

Motivational enhancement therapy. This therapy is especially useful to people who are trying to quit cannabis, alcohol or nicotine. It is based on the fact that people with such problems often realize that their actions are harming them, but are still very comfortable doing what they are doing. Its purpose is to examine your motivation for change in a very positive, non-judgmental and non-confrontational manner. In this therapy you are not told why you should change, but rather are aided to find your own arguments and reasons. The therapist helps you elicit positive statements and empower yourself, so as to strengthen your inner motivation.

, There is no one universally correct approach, when it comes to helping you stop smoking marijuana – every person is different and their motivation for acting a certain way is very specific. That is why the kind of therapy you choose should be appealing to you. If you feel uncomfortable with the approach you are more likely to fight it, even unconsciously, thus reducing your chances for success.


In addition, your therapist will tailor the approach to your unique personality, thus improving the likelihood of you quitting even further.
To choose a therapist. consult with your general practitioner. They will recommend some good options within your area. It is essential to remember to be as honest as possible with your therapist because this way you will meet him or her halfway and will aid the success of your own goal.

, A good, healthy diet while quitting does not only help in keeping your hydration level high but it can actually stop the craving of smoking. To fight those urges, load up on these foods:


Smoking causes the person to have more sweet and artificial flavor cravings. 2-3 apples per day can help in fighting these urges. The crunching also keeps the mouth busy and tired. Bonus!
Vegetables that are crunchy in texture help in fighting the addiction as well. Vegetables like garlic and ginger leave a taste in your mouth that makes the smoke taste worse. Chop these two into very little and chewable pieces and add them into your everyday food.

, Utilizing these foods in your diet might help you pass through the withdrawal stages more quickly. They also make you look healthier and better looking than before by helping your hair, skin, and nails. When it comes to dairy, here's what you should know:


Having a glass of milk one hour before your smoking hours will make your stomach feel filled up; because of this, you will lose the desire to smoke pot. It will also leave a taste in your mouth that no one wants to mix with drugs!
Cheese is very useful while quitting as it contains the taste of salt which stays in the mouth. But go easy on it if you think you are consuming more than the required amount of fat already.

, While quitting drugs all by yourself, it is necessary to keep your nutrition levels in check as you might feel drained all the time. You still need some pick-me-ups, though! Here's how to get your fix:


Dark chocolate has always been famous in treating mood disorders and will help you deal with the phases of depression that you might get.
Dried fruits and potato also help in stopping the cravings.

, At the very least, 10% of your diet should be from protein and at the very most, about 1/3 of it from carbs. Here are some good sources:


Lean white meat, tuna and salmon are known for quitting addictions as it leaves a taste in your mouth that will not be good if amalgamated with the weed.
When it comes to carbs, go crunchy. They're more sating and come with starch that gives you the energy to keep going with your mission.

, Exercise is a healthy way to take out all the energy that has been lying dormant in your body. It helps you keep your body fit and focuses all your energy at a positive activity. It also helps with the cravings!



Yoga has been known as an exercise to relax the mind and therefore helps during withdrawal as the body sometimes want to just start screaming out loud. You know the feeling.
Running every day for 30 minutes is a good, healthy activity towards quitting addictions.

, After you have chosen an approach and have talked to your loved ones, consider taking up a hobby -- something that will occupy your time and will serve as a distraction from the urge to smoke. In order to do that, think about the things you enjoy and ask yourself some questions such as:


Am I good at handiwork?
Do I like any sports? (Even if you don’t play a sport, think about the ones you enjoy watching and consider trying one of them)
What do my friends like to do?

You can come up with more questions that are suitable to your lifestyle and personality and therefore help yourself find something to occupy your spare time. In addition, finding a hobby will help strengthen your motivation for quitting, as you know you won’t be as driven if you smoke weed.
What is more, if you take up a sport or an otherwise social hobby, you will meet new people who are not connected to your old habits. This will help you construct a new lifestyle that doesn’t involve cannabis.



, For addicts who have been consuming drugs for a long period of time, it is extra difficult for them to get over the bad habit, so they often seek medical help. There are different drugs that help in giving the same feel of weed but cause less harm to the body. These drugs help in minimizing the cravings and eventually help the person become completely sober.


Nicotine medicines, patches and gums are available in stores and can be bought without prescription. Nicotine helps in making the cravings less severe and reduces feelings of irritability and headache that you might face during withdrawal.

Chewing a gum after every 2 hours when you’re awake helps in minimizing the cravings. If you are using 4 mg gums, make sure you don’t chew more than 20 gums per day or if using 3 mg, then not more than 30 pieces of gum per day.
A patch should be changed after every 16 or 24 hours and the dosage you need depends on your level of addiction. It can be taken off while sleeping and put right back as soon as you wake up. It does cause a little soreness on the area it was patched so it is advisable to change areas every time.



, Make sure you do not completely rely on these medications (and other substances, like alcohol) as they are addictive in nature, too. The doses should be cut back with time, which will serve the right purpose of using them in the first place!


These nicotine replacements should not be used if you have not completely quit smoking as the combination comes with serious problems.

, There are other non-nicotine medicines that are gained by prescription of a doctor. These are usually Xanax, Zyban, Wellbutrin, Wellbutrin SR and Wellbutrin XL and Varenicline. These medicines tell the brain to stop craving for the drug if taken in the right amount. However, they do require a prescription from your doctor.


Most of these help with depression symptoms and may cause agitation, frustration and unusual behavior at times. If you think there is a negative change (more than just a normal feeling that you might be feeling temporarily) then it is best to talk to your doctor as the dosage might not be suiting you.

, The process of quitting drugs comes hand in hand with major mood swings, depression and frustration. Don’t let these temporary mood disorders get you! Having low self-esteem and recoiling on yourself is normal as you have been trying to struggle against your desires. Have faith and make sure you keep reminding yourself that you are better than this. Because you are!


Talk to yourself out loud in front of the mirror and tell that image in front of you that you are a beautiful, strong person who has the strength to overcome this obstacle. And if you think you are less of a talker and more of a writer, grab a diary and start writing it all down.

, In fact, keep a diary of your entire process. Keep that journal someplace visible, so that you are constantly reminded of how well you are doing and thus are positively motivated to keep up the good work.


One day when you will able to come over your addiction, you will read that diary and think of all the sufferings that you have overcome with your strength. That will be one beautiful moment of pure contentment for your moral later in life or upcoming crises.

You may want it to be outside or in a designated “smoker’s room.” Consider designating two spaces in the case that the weather doesn’t cooperate.Consider how many smokers you know of and plan for more. Many people smoke socially when they’re with others or having a drink.

This friend can give you tips on what types of items you may want to have in the area and if the space itself accommodates smokers.Tell your friend what your expectations for smokers and the smoking space are. For example, “Avery, I want to make sure that my smoking and non-smoking guests feel welcome. I think I found a nice space that will accommodate both groups. Since I don’t smoke, do you mind checking it out and suggesting some ways to make it comfortable?”

, You want your smoking guests to feel as welcome and cozy as you and other non-smokers. Making your designated smoking spot inviting to smokers can help them have as good of a time as non-smokers.

Consider using chairs that you can easily wipe off or wash if you are concerned about the smell of smoke lingering on fabric.
Have several ashtrays on hand and place them around the seating area. You may need to purchase a few small ashtrays if you don’t already have them. Consider getting non-flammable materials such as glass or metal. You can use these for future events, too.
Set up a trash bin in the space. This gives your smoking guests the opportunity to take food or drinks with them and can help keep your spaces free of trash. Make sure to designated the bin as “trash only” so that guests don’t use it as an ashtray, which may spark a fire.
Take the weather into consideration. If there is rain in the forecast, provide a canopy or set up your alternative space so that smokers aren’t left out.

, Part of making sure your smoking guests feel welcome is paying attention to them as much as your non-smokers. Occasionally slip to the smoking space to make sure that your smoking guests are comfortable and don’t need anything.Go to the space and say, “Hello! I wanted to stop out and check on everyone. Does anyone need anything?” If you are able, sit down and talk to the group for a few minutes. If not, you can always excuse yourself politely with, “I’m sorry to leave so quickly, but I have a terrible allergy to cigarette smoke. I’ll be inside and would love to chat more with each of you.”
Empty any ashtrays that appear full. You may also want to throw out any lingering trash so that people feel comfortable using the space.

Consider allowing people to use e-cigarettes.,
Have a large selection of food and drinks.,
Incorporate crunchy foods.,
Provide a bowl of candies or gum.,
Have toothpicks on hand.",How to Entertain Smokers as a Non Smoker2," You may not want to provide a smoking area when entertaining. This could be because of health concerns or a personal distaste for smoking. This is your choice, but you should recognize that your decision may push away some guests. Many people can’t curb their cravings to smoke.


Assure anyone who can’t come because of smoking that you understand. Say, “I’m so sorry you can’t join us, Frankie, but I completely understand. If you feel like swinging by for a few minutes, please know that the doors are always open.”

, If you are not willing to allow people to smoke in or around your home, then you might consider allowing them to use e-cigarettes as an alternative. Using e-cigarettes, or vaping, has become a popular alternative to smoking and it does not produce as much of an odor.


Try telling people that while you do not want anyone smoking in or around your house, you have set up a designated vaping area. You could set this area up in the corner of a room or in your backyard.

, One of the best way to help smokers curb cravings is by keeping their mouths busy.

Inform guests of any smoking limitations.,
Let smoking guests know about other offerings.,
Tell guests about the smoking policy.,
Remind smokers about the ban.,
Deal with guests who ignore smoking bans.",How to Entertain Smokers as a Non Smoker3," It’s important that guests know of any smoking bans or limitations before the party. You may want to include this information in your invitation. This may help smokers decide if they want to come or avoid the event if they cannot avoid smoking.Keep the notice as positive and polite as possible. For example, “We want all of our guests to be comfortable, happy, and healthy. Due to our new baby, we cannot accommodate smoking at the party,” or “I’d love for everyone to come, but I’ve chosen to host at a fantastic place that unfortunately prohibits any type of smoking.” Follow this up with, “If you are a smoker and decide not to come because of the smoking ban, I completely understand. You are most welcome to join us if you change your mind.”

, As a part of your invitation, give smokers some assurance about attending even with a smoking ban. Include information on things such as food offerings, activities, and alternative places they can smoke.

For example, you might post signs that say, “No smoking within 30 feet of entrances,” or “Smoking is permitted on the patio.”

, Before your event, it may be a good idea to send an update to all of your guests. This can remind any smokers of the ban without making them feel unnecessarily left out.Send an email or “newsletters” a few weeks before the event to let guests know things about parking, food, activities, or anything else they may want to know. Use this as your opportunity to gently remind guests of the limitations on smoking and any penalties they may incur for not obeying the ban.

, In some cases, there are people who don’t care about any bans on smoking. They may smoke or try to smoke during your event. Handling guests who ignore the rules can cause you a lot of stress—and possibly even fines. Deal gently but appropriately with anyone who decides to smoke despite any bans.

Remind the person to stop smoking the first time you notice the behavior. It may be a case that the person automatically grabbed a cigarette and forgot the ban. You can say, “Hey Taylor, I don’t want to cause a problem, but you can’t smoke here. Please put your cigarette out.”
Ask a person to leave the event if the individual continues to smoke. Say, “Hey Taylor, I understand you need to smoke, but I can lose my apartment if there is smoking here or outside of my place. Please leave so everyone can enjoy the party and I don’t get in trouble.” You can also say, “Hey Taylor, someone from the hotel just let me know that you’re smoking. I got charged $1,000 for that. Please leave so I don’t have any more problems from the staff or the hotel closes the party.”"

, Exercising can help to improve your lung strength, and, therefore, could potentially help reduce your lung cancer risk. While this has not be scientifically proven, it's good practice to keep your cardiovascular system healthy for a number of other reasons. If you have not exercised recently, start with light exercise like walking or jogging and gradually work your way up to work intense workouts.


Cardio can help to get your lungs pumping. Cardio exercises include running, swimming, biking, and aerobics classes like Zumba or kickboxing.

, Breathing exercises can help to increase the blood flow to your lungs, which can increase the amount of oxygen your lungs receive and help your lung tissue stay healthy. Breathing deeply also increases the amount of oxygen in your blood, which can boost your energy. To practice deep breathing:


Sit in a place where you can breathe fresh air. Sit with your back straight and your eyes closed. Slowly inhale and expand your abdomen. Inhale to the count of six.
Hold your breath for six counts. Slowly exhale and as you do so, let your abdomen flatten. Exhale for 12 counts. Do not inhale for another six counts. Repeat this process.

You can make up to 10% solutions as you are more experienced or with very user-friendly essential oils. Stronger solutions are used for therapeutic reasons., This formula will help you figure out how much of your carrier oil you’ll need to add to create the dilution ratio you want. Total ml of carrier x 20 drops per ml = carrier drops.For example, 1 oz = 30 ml x 20 drops = 600 drops.
This tells you that there are 600 total drops in one ounce.

, You’ll need to know how many drops of essential oil to use in your dilution. The amount of essential oils required for various uses can vary, but in general you can use this formula: Total carrier drops x percent = drops of essential oil.


For example, to make a 2% solution using one ounce of carrier, 600 drops x 2% = 12 drops.
Note: To multiply a percent, you must use a decimal. 2% = 0.02 for the above example.

, To make the diluted essential oil solution, you’ll need to gather a few items. You’ll need your selected essential oil and your supplemental carrier oil, a separate bottle or container to hold the new mixture, and several eye droppers.


Try to get dark colored glass bottles to filter out the damaging UV rays., Using two separate eye droppers to avoid cross-contamination, make your mixture based on the formula you have already established. If your formula calls for 12 drops of essential oil and 5 drops of carrier oil, use your eye droppers to extract the desired amount of each liquid and carefully squeeze it into the new container – making sure to count each drop carefully.


Once you have added both ingredients, put the lid on and give it a good shake to ensure the contents are properly mixed.
And don’t forget to label the bottle before you put it away and forget what is in it.

, Be cautious about direct contact to the skin of the undiluted essential oils. You should also carefully weigh your decision to use essential oils if you are pregnant. There is controversy around whether or not essential oils can impact a fetus, so you should carefully consider it for yourself., Typically, you need to store your essential oils (including diluted essential oil mixtures) in a cool, dark place. It’s important to keep them out of direct sunlight or away from places that are constantly being cooled and warmed based on exposure to the sun. This will keep them from becoming useless because of increased oxidation over time.Carrier oils should be stored in the fridge during the hot summer months to avoid fatty particles from forming that will need to be re-dissolved before you can use it. But they should still be at room temperature when you use them for mixing, so take them out of the fridge twelve hours before you intend to use them.

, Some people believe that it is okay to use undiluted essential oils on the skin. However, this is not true. You should always dilute your essential oils before applying them to the skin to avoid any kind of reaction, including sensitization.


Most essential oil blends will be 1-5% dilutions.It is not necessary to dilute essential oils if you are using them for inhalation through vapors.
When you use essential oils that are not diluted, it is called applying them neat.

, Remember that skin is permeable, but it is even more so when it is damaged. So if you have diseased, inflamed, or damaged skin, it will be more susceptible to the effects of essential oils, even if they are diluted before the application.

, Sensitization occurs when your body (especially your skin) is exposed to essential oils that are undiluted and you develop a reaction – almost like an allergic reaction – to the ingredients. Sensitization commonly results in severe rashes on the skin, but it can even lead to respiratory problems or anaphylactic shock in more extreme cases.
In addition to sensitization, you can also encounter system toxicity by allowing too much of an essential oil into your body., Carrier oils are any type of vegetable oil (olive oil, coconut oil, grapeseed oil, etc.) that are often used to dilute essential oils. Using carrier oils to dilute your essential oils will ensure that your skin reacts well to the essential oils.Using carrier oils will even save you money by causing you to use less of the essential oils for each application
Note: Never use petroleum, margarine, butter, or vegetable shortening in place of carrier oils.

, Adding essential oils to your bath can be very beneficial for the body. Use a mild essential oil like lavender oil, rose oil, or sandalwood oil, while avoiding more spicy oils like cinnamon oil or thyme oil as well as citrusy oils like lemongrass oil.Using essential oils in your bath can help with many skin problems, circulation problems, respiratory problems, stress, insomnia, and menstrual cramps.
Usually use 5-10 drops of essential oils in a bath.

, Diffusers are devices that use candles to heat up essential oils so that they evaporate and permeate the air around them. They are easy to use and smell quite nice.Some diffusers use electricity instead of candles.

, This is a good option for people who do not tolerate carrier oils well. Use an un-perfumed base cream and add some essential oils to it. This can help with many skin conditions, including rashes.Never make a cream or lotion stronger than a 2% dilution.Use between 4 and 10 drops of essential oils per 50 grams of cream/lotion, depending on your age and sensitivity.

, Add essential oils to a hot compress and wrap it around your face or other body part. Use a cloth or washrag that has been soaked in warm water and add the essential oils.This can be good for bruises, wounds, aches, headaches, and other skin problems.
Use 3-5 drops of essential oils.

Research your oil’s uses.,
Assess your oil’s therapeutic results.,
Consider any side effects.,
Make sure you’re using the best method for your needs.",How to Know if Aromatherapy Is Working1," Essential oils are concentrated extracts derived from medicinal plants. Each essential oil has unique active ingredients that have specific therapeutic effects with benefits for the body and/or mind. Make sure that you are using the right one(s) for your needs by looking into their particular purposes.A list of the most common essential oils and their uses is available here: https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/essential-oils/list-of-essential-oils.html

The most reliable way to do research is to purchase or check out an authoritative reference book on essential oils. Try one that’s written by a certified aromatherapist or professional researcher, such as The Complete Book of Essential Oils and Aromatherapy or Aromatherapy for Every Day.
If you’re not using the correct oil, find the right one by searching for an essential oil that corresponds with your needs; for example, “essential oil for arthritis.”;
, If you’re using aromatherapy to address a specific mental or physical condition, analyze its efficacy by keeping a log to track its effectiveness at treating your symptoms.


Be sure to give your aromatherapy treatment a fair trial by using it for at least a week to see if the results vary. Keep notes for each day’s use(s) to analyze if there’s an overall benefit.
For instance, if you’re using lavender to help address anxiety, take notes about the degree to which it’s making you feel calmer and for how long its effects are lasting. If you’re using gardenia to alleviate the symptoms associated with menopause, take note if it’s helping with your agitation, headaches, and/or hot flashes., Usually, if administered correctly, aromatherapy has minimal side effects. However, you should be alert to anything that may compromise your experience or undermine the efficacy of a treatment or its effectiveness.Some of the rare side effects people have recorded include rashes or other skin irritations, asthma, and headaches.
Essential oils may also interact negatively with certain medications, like pentobarbital or amphetamine. Be sure to check with your doctor if you’re using aromatherapy in conjunction with any prescriptions.

, There are a variety of ways to administer aromatherapy, such as body oils, bath salts, or vaporizers. Some may be more effective than others at addressing your needs.For instance, if you’re using aromatherapy to alleviate muscle aches, you should be using a topical application like massage oils. If you’re going for mental, cognitive, or emotional benefits, vapor methods like a diffuser will be the most effective.
Keep in mind that many popular products, like candles and beauty products, that advertise themselves as aromatherapy often contain synthetic fragrances and/or are probably not efficacious treatments. For aromatherapy tools to be effective, they need to include a natural essential oil derived from plants."
"
Try topical applications.,
Use a vapor method.,
Try an inhalation patch.,
Keep a log to compare each method.",How to Know if Aromatherapy Is Working2," The most common delivery methods for aromatherapy are topical applications of solutions, such as compresses or massage oils, that include small amounts of essential oils. Mix a few drops of essential oil into a carrier liquid like water or mild cold-pressed oils, and apply it to your skin.The general guidelines for mixing topical solutions is that you should add 1-3 drops of essential oil for each teaspoon of your carrier liquid. Never exceed a 5% concentration of essential oils in your mix. Then, you can either rub your solution directly onto your skin or pour it over a clean towel to apply as a compress.
If you’re using an oil for your carrier liquid, it’s best to use ones that aren’t strongly scented, such as jojoba, grapeseed, or avocado oil.
If you’re using water, be sure to shake your solution before using it since oil and water do not stay mixed.
If you don’t want to mix your own, there are plenty of products that offer pre-made topical solutions, such as massage oils, lotions, and body sprays. Be sure that they have at least a 1% concentration of actual essential oil.
This delivery method allows you to inhale the essential oil’s perfume. It is also a useful treatment for acute skin conditions, like minor cuts and burns, since essential oils have antimicrobial properties.
Because essential oils can be hazardous to your health or easily cause skin irritations when they’re applied incorrectly or in too great of concentrations, there are some risks associated with topical application methods., Use a diffuser or steam bath to vaporize the oil so that you can breathe it in. These applications allow you to inhale essential oil vapors into your nostrils, which can directly stimulate the targeted neural receptors in your brain.Electronic diffusers offer a high-tech tool for the vapor method. Once you fill their reservoirs with essential oil, they will facilitate the timed release of its vapors for you to inhale. You can generally program their running time to last anywhere from 5-12 hours.For a shorter, DIY vapor delivery method, add 1-2 drops of essential oil to a steaming bowl of recently boiled water. Keep your eyes shut tight, and drape a towel over your head and the edges of a bowl to form a loose tent. Breathe in the steam as long as it lasts.Vapor methods are among the safest and most direct ways to deliver aromatherapy.

, This sticky patch comes with a pouch that is already filled with essential oils. Apply the sticky side to your skin according to the instructions on the package. This adhesive back-side will prevent the oil from leaking through while the opposite, porous side slowly releases essential oil vapors over the course of the day as they’re activated by your body heat.Since this method only exposes you to the vapor without letting the oil penetrate your skin, it’s considered among the safest and most effective delivery systems for aromatherapy.
Aromatherapy patches are available from a number of companies, such as Bioesse, Wyndmere Aromatherapy, and Natural Patches of Vermont. The kinds of oils available and duration of their release will vary by company, with the effects lasting anywhere from 6 to 24 hours.

, You can figure out which application works best for you by keeping notes that record the pros and cons of each. Try each method at least three times to be sure that your observations are consistent. Once you’ve tried each, use your log to determine which type of aromatherapy suits your needs the best.


When assessing the pros and cons of each delivery method, take both their practical logistics and therapeutic outcomes into consideration.
For instance, if you’re taking notes in your log about the inhalation patch, you might list “easy to use, long-lasting, non-messy, and very effective at reducing agitation” as the pros and “expensive, limited options, and not effective as a sleeping aid” as the cons.
When making your final decision, be sure to weigh the effectiveness, convenience, and cost of the various delivery methods. If you find two are similarly effective, go for the one that’s cheaper or more convenient.

"
"
Try a different oil.,
Change your delivery method.,
Adjust your dosing.,
Consult with a clinical aromatherapist.",How to Know if Aromatherapy Is Working3," Many essential oils have overlapping therapeutic uses. If one is not working for you, try another that’s designated for the same purpose but might have slightly different active ingredients.For instance, if you’ve been using bergamot oil to lift your mood and alleviate depression, you might try using camomile instead.
Keep in mind that the quality of your essential oil might also play a role in its effectiveness, so you might just want to try a different brand. The plant content, production process, and packaging can all affect quality. In general, quality products will list the scientific name and origin of the plant, include a statement of purity, and not be offered at a significantly discounted price., If topical solutions are not having the desired effect(s), try an inhalation patch instead to see if it makes a difference. If you are having adverse side-effects from a particular delivery method, switch to one that will minimize them.

, You can do this either by altering the amount of essential oil used or the duration of your exposure to it.


For instance, if you’re using a topical application with a 1% concentration of essential oil, you might consider increasing the concentration to 3% if the lower dose is having no effect.
If you’re using a steam bath to inhale oil vapors, you might consider switching to a diffuser or inhalation patch that will release those vapors more slowly over a longer period of time.

, Clinical aromatherapists hold Masters of Science degrees in aromatherapy. Make an appointment with one to get their recommendations about the most effective treatments for your needs."

, Shake well! Spray your dry ingredients three times and mix quickly. Do this until you can pick up about a spoonful and squeeze it together without it crumbling. It will not form a shape easily in your hand so don't worry about that.

, Let dry overnight, and when you take your next shower place one on the floor in front of you, with you in between it and the spray. Let the steam do most of the work, if you don't like a very hot shower you can let the spray hit it every now and then to release a burst of oil into the air. As it melts, it will run over your feet and leave them nice and soft, too.

Find a container with a narrow opening.,
Purchase reed sticks.,

Choose a carrier oil.,
Measure out ¼ cup of carrier oil.,
Add 25 to 30 drops of essential oil.,
Stir to combine the oil.,
Pour the oil mixture into the container.,
Add the reed sticks.,
Flip the reed sticks after an hour.,
Swirl the oil every week.,
Flip the sticks every few days.,
Add more oil when the scent diminishes.,
Replace the reed sticks once a month.",How to Make Reed Diffusers," Begin assembling your reed diffuser by finding a suitable base container for the reeds. Look for a container that is about five to ten inches tall with a small opening made of ceramic, glass, stainless steel, earthenware or wood. Do not use a plastic container, as essential oils can react with plastic.A small opening at the top of the container ensures that minimal evaporation occurs. If too much water evaporates, the percentage of essential oil becomes higher, and the scent can become overpowering.
If you have a jar with a cork top, you can also drill a hole in the cork. This is one of the best options for minimal evaporation.
You can get creative by matching your diffuser container to the colors of your room or even decorating the outside of the container.
Craft stores often have cheap glass bottles and vases in a variety of sizes.;
, Purchase rattan reeds meant for oil diffusal, either online or in specialty health stores. Use new reed diffusers, as old reeds lose their effectiveness once they are over-saturated with oil. The reeds must be tall enough to stand well above the vase or bottle you chose. The reeds should stick out several inches or centimeters from the top of the container. Increase the scenting ability of the diffuser by using reeds that are double the height of the bottle or more.
Ready-made reeds are usually sold in 10-, 12- and 15-inch (25-, 30- and 38 cm) lengths.
You can also use bamboo skewers, but rattan reed sticks tend to disperse scent more effectively.

, Pick your favorites. Make sure the oils are of a 100% concentration, or else they will not have a strong enough scent. You can use just one oil, or pair two or more oils whose scents complement one another.Some classic essential oil pairings are lavender and peppermint, orange and vanilla, spearmint and patchouli, and chamomile and lavender.
Lavender, jasmine, neroli and geranium are calming scents.
Peppermint, rosemary, tea tree, lemon, basil, and ginger are energizing scents.
Chamomile, orange, sandalwood, lavender, and marjoram are great for combating anxiety., A carrier oil is a neutral oil that combines with an essential oil to dilute it so that the scent of the essential oil isn’t overpowering. Safflower oil and almond oil are common carrier oils. If you don’t want to purchase a carrier oil, you can also use plain water mixed with a splash of alcohol that is at least 90% concentration.You can use rubbing alcohol, perfumer’s alcohol, or vodka to mix with water as a substitute for carrier oil.

, Pour ¼ cup (59.14 ml) of your carrier oil into a measuring cup. If you are using water and alcohol, pour ¼ cup (59.14 ml) of water and add 1 teaspoon (4.92 ml) of the alcohol of your choice, then mix.You can slightly alter the amount of carrier oil if you are using a small container, but keep in mind that the ratio of carrier oil to essential oil should be about 85 to 15. For instance, for a small container you could reduce the ratio to 17:1. If you want a strongly scented reed diffuser, make the ratio around 75 to 25.
Keep in mind that the water and vodka mixture evaporates at a faster rate than carrier oil, so you will have to refill it more.

, Add 25-30 drops of the essential oil or oils of your choice into the measuring cup. If you are using two different oils, add 15 drops of one oil and 15 drops of the other., Gently swirl the oil mixture within the measuring cup to blend the oils by moving the measuring cup in circles, or use a spoon to stir and blend the oils together., Carefully pour the oil mixture into the container with the narrow opening that you purchased. If your measuring cup does not have a spout, you may want to use a funnel to help transfer the liquid into the container., Add about 4-8 reed sticks into the container. Fan the reed sticks out instead of leaning them all to one side of the rim so that they can work more effectively., Allow the reed sticks to sit in the oil for an hour, then take them out and flip them over so that the dry ends sit in the oil mixture. This will saturate both ends and quick-start the process of releasing the scent of the essential oil.You should start to notice the scent of the essential oils after a day or so.

, Make sure that you gently swirl the oil inside the reed diffuser about once a week to ensure that the oil mixture is adequately mixed. If you are using water and vodka as a base, swirl the mixture twice a week., After the first flip, get in the habit of flipping the reed sticks every three or four days. Flipping the sticks stops the sticks from drying out so that the scent of the oil can continue spreading.You can flip after swirling the oil, or at a different time.

, After a month or so, you may notice that even though you are regularly flipping the sticks, the scent of the essential oils seems to be diminishing. At this point, look inside the jar or vase and see how much of the oil mixture is left. Replace any of the oil mixture that has evaporated, keeping in mind the 75-85/15-25 ratio of carrier oil to essential oil.If you are using water and alcohol as your base, you may have to replace the mixture inside the base more often than once a month. Stick to a ratio of 85/15 water and alcohol to essential oil.

, After about a month, you may also notice that the reed sticks have become completely saturated in oil. Replace the reed sticks every month or when you see that they have become saturated.The oil should slightly darken the color of the reeds, so when the entire reed is darkened you can tell that it has become completely saturated.
Once the reed has become saturated, it does not diffuse the scent of the oil, which is why it is important to regularly replace used reeds.

Many of these programs will offer you a certification. This certification has no legal basis, but it does show that you have completed coursework related to aromatherapy.Try to look for a school that is accredited by The National Association for Holistic Aromatherapy (NAHA). If the school is accredited by this body, it means that it has met the minimum requirements regarding the educational and ethical standards of the NAHA. You can see a list of schools in the US (and a few other countries) here.
Some schools may offer online, evening, or weekend courses to help make it more convenient and accessible to those who must work while also attending school.;
, Online courses might be more suitable for people who have very busy lives and might not be able to attend an in-person course or for people who simply want to learn about aromatherapy, but aren’t interested in practicing aromatherapy as a profession.If you are interested in practicing aromatherapy, you can still do an online course and learn everything you need to know. However, with an in-person class, you may have more opportunities to ask questions and receive direct feedback about how to mix oils and use them properly.
A combination course might allow you to do most of your learning online, but will also offer an opportunity to practice what you have learned in-person with an instructor. In this case, you can also ask them to answer any questions that may have arisen during your online learning.

, If you complete a program that is accredited by the NAHA and you aim for the professional aromatherapy certification (level 2), you will be required to complete at least 200 hours of training. At present, this is the highest level of certification offered, though the NAHA is working on a level 3, clinical aromatherapy certification.Some programs offer courses that are as short as a few hours. If you don’t care much about receiving any kind of certification, and simply want to learn a thing or two about aromatherapy, or if you aren’t sure if you’re interested in aromatherapy, a course such as this might be a good place to start., Some programs will not require you to take an examination, but if you are attending an NAHA accredited school and working towards your level 2 professional aromatherapy certification, you will be required to take and pass an exam.If you are working on a level 1 certification (foundations of aromatherapy) at an NAHA accredited school, you will not need to pass an exam.
For a level 2 certification, you will also be required to successfully complete a research paper, complete several case studies, and you must complete oil profiles on at least 25 essential oils.

, The cost of an aromatherapy program can vary considerably, but usually costs around $500.If you need help covering the costs of the course, there are different options you can look into for getting financial aid.


For example, The Department of Education offers subsidized loans that are regulated by the government.

, Once you have chosen a program that is suitable to your needs, contact the school to find out how you can get started. Make sure that you carefully read through all of the information that the school provides you, and take note of whether you must purchase equipment such as books and oils yourself, or whether this will all be provided for you.


If something is not clear to you, be sure to approach a representative of the school and chat with them before handing over any money. You want to make sure you find a place where you will feel respected and comfortable learning.
Be aware that courses can vary tremendously. Some courses may be more traditional in that you will sit through lectures given by experienced aromatherapists. You may also have seminars with teachers and other students where you will get a chance to work with different oils. In online courses, you will likely have lectures as well, but it will be more difficult (and maybe even impossible) to interact with the course instructor and other students. You may also have to work with the oils unsupervised.

, Although what you learn will vary based on the course you choose, if you are attending an NAHA accredited school, you will probably be taught about how high quality essential oils are produced, basic physiology, how certain aromas interact with emotional states, ethical and safety issues, as well as how to use oils safely on the skin.This is only a basic list of what you can expect to learn.
Don’t be afraid to take the initiative to learn more than what is being taught in your program. If you are curious about something, ask your teacher. If you want to know something and the teach doesn’t know, try searching the internet for information about the topic.

, Joining the NAHA is not mandatory, but if you completed a program that was accredited by the NAHA you will be eligible to become a professional member. Doing so offers several benefits, such as access to the latest research in the area of aromatherapy, the right to use the NAHA logo when advertising your services, as well as the opportunity to advertise your services on their website.The cost of a professional membership is $125 for people living in the United States. For international members, the cost is $155.

, There are many different places that an aromatherapist can be employed. For example, spas, fitness centers, hospice centers, hospitals, and yoga studios may all want to hire an aromatherapist to help their customers benefit from aromatherapy.


Search your local newspaper as well as the internet for jobs. If you are willing to relocate for work, you may have many interesting opportunities available to you.

, If you don’t want to work for someone, you could open a shop where you offer aromatherapy consultations to those interested in using at as a means of holistic health care. You could also sell essential oils, and offer workshops where people can learn how to use aromatherapy in their daily lives.


Remember that opening you own business can be very rewarding, but it can also be very challenging. It can also be a risk because no matter how well you run your business, your business may not flourish.

, If you are already a massage therapist, or are also working toward obtaining a license in massage therapy, you can incorporate these professions into one. You can use your knowledge of aromatherapy to help meet the needs of your clients.For example, if you have a client who is extremely tense and stressed, you can incorporate specific oils into their massage that will help them to relax through a combination of scent and massage.

, Although an aromatherapist cannot diagnose diseases, aromatherapists can act as consultants on the benefits of aromatherapy for a healthy lifestyle. This means that if someone comes to an aromatherapist with a problem, the aromatherapist can take their knowledge and make recommendations about how to take steps to improve the problem. An aromatherapist should think of themselves as educators, not healthcare providers.For example, this recommendation might include certain oils and combinations of oils that can be used to treat pain without the use of traditional medication, and in addition to other lifestyle improvements (e.g. eating healthy, drinking enough water, getting exercise).
Be aware that aromatherapists are not able to prescribe medications or perform invasive procedures. If you decide to become an aromatherapist and wish to provide consultations with people, it is probably a good idea to make sure the person understands that you are not a doctor and are not making diagnoses.

, Research has demonstrated that aromatherapy can positively impact the well-being of patients under hospice care.Additionally, aromatherapy is becoming very popular within the nursing field.In these instances, if you are a nurse or a hospice worker, you can incorporate aromatherapy into your work to help patients with pain and/or well-being while they are under your care.
If you are not a nurse or hospice worker, you may be able to be hired on in some clinics as an aromatherapist, where you will help deal with the specific needs of various patients.

, Yoga is believed to have many physical and emotional benefits for those who practice regularly.Using aromatherapy in conjunction with a yoga practice can enhance those benefits even more.If you are a yoga instructor, want to become an instructor you can incorporate your knowledge of aromatherapy into your practice to make yourself stand out and to enhance the experience of your clients.


In some bigger yoga studios, you may also be able to be hired on as an aromatherapist without being a yoga instructor.

, If you don’t necessarily want/need to work, you can also practice what you have learned by helping family and friends and by using your knowledge to help yourself. If you have a family member who is suffering with a health condition, and you think that aromatherapy could help them, consider offering your knowledge to help them.


Remember that not everyone believes in the power of aromatherapy, if you offer to help someone but they say they aren’t interested, then be respectful of their wishes.

, This means that, in the United States, the government does not regulate the aromatherapist profession. Furthermore, there is no official accreditation or certification program.This doesn’t mean that aromatherapy is a scam or something that cannot provide valuable benefits to people. As a trained aromatherapist, you will be able to help people understand the value of the field.

, At the moment, there are four associations that attempt to ensure that, in order to become an aromatherapist, there are standardized educational and examination procedures, that aromatherapists are behaving ethically, and standards for certification.These governing bodies include:


The Educational Standards in Aromatherapy Association.
Natural Oils Research Association (NORA).
The American Alliance of Aromatherapy.
The National Association for Holistic Aromatherapy (NAHA).

, As with many professions, aromatherapy has a large and rich community of practitioners, researchers, and followers. Getting involved with the aromatherapy can help you learn more about the history of aromatherapy, can help you stay up-to-date with new findings, and may lead to personal opportunities as well as job opportunities.You can look for local networking opportunities on the internet, but you can also travel to attend aromatherapy conferences where you will meet lots of interesting people.

Determine what type of scent you want.,
Choose top, middle, and base notes.,
Test your blend.,
Mix the oils.,
Find a carrier oil if you want to apply it to the skin.,
Add a dispersing agent if you want to use it in the bath.,
Mix with alcohol for a perfume.,
Determine your proportion of ingredients.,
Combine the essential oil blend with the diluting agent.,
Store in a bottle.,
Wait a few days.",How to Blend Essential Oils," Different types of scents are often used to alleviate different issues. Think about what type of scent you want. There are general categories of essential oil scent, and oils in any one category tend to mix well with their own kind. That said, you can mix scents from different categories. Try experimenting with different types of scents.Floral: Lavender, neroli, jasmine, ylang ylang, rose

Earthy: Oakmoss, patchouli, pine, cedar

Herbal: Marjoram, rosemary, basil, thyme

Minty: Peppermint, spearmint, sage

Spicy: Nutmeg, clove, cinnamon, black pepper

Citrus: Orange, lemon, lime, bergamot;
, The note of an oil refers to the length of time that it takes to evaporate. Top notes evaporate the quickest while base notes linger for a long time. If you want your oils to hold their aroma for a certain time, choose a good base note that pairs well with top and middle notes.


Top notes evaporate within one or two hours. They include anise, basil, citronella, eucalyptus, lavender, spearmint, orange, and lemongrass.
Middle notes evaporate within two to four hours. They include fennel, nutmeg, tea tree, jasmine, and chamomile.
Base notes last for up to a few days. They include balsam, cedarwood, ginger, patchouli, and oakmoss., Dip one cotton swab into each bottle of oil. You should use one swab per bottle. Hold these about a foot away from your nose, and swirl them in circles in the air.This will give you a sense of what the scent combination will smell like. If you do not like it, try removing one of the cotton swabs, and try again.This will help you find a good combination of aromas for your blend.


You can also use cotton balls or fragrance testing strips to try out your scents.

, Once you have determined your essential oil blend, you can start adding them together. Using a pipette or dropper, drop the measured amounts of your top, middle, and base notes into a clean mixing bowl or into a glass vial. Drop the correct amount of drops as stated per the recipe you are using. If you are unsure how much to use, you can follow a few different guidelines:



The 30-50-20 rule: your mixture is 30% of your top note, 50% of your middle note, and 20% of your base note.The 1-2-3 Rule: For every one drop of your base note, you have two drops of your middle note and three drops of your top note.You should mix your essential oils together first before adding any carriers or diluting agents., If you are applying essential oils to the skin, you will need to dilute them with a carrier oil first. Essential oils are highly concentrated, and by applying them directly to your skin without a carrier oil, you risk permanent damage to your skin.Carrier oils are typically vegetable oils. Good carrier oils include:


Sweet Almond Oil
Rosehip Oil
Avocado Oil
Sesame Oil
Jojoba Oil
Hemp Seed Oil
Olive Oil
Grape Seed Oil, If you are not planning to rub it directly on the skin but do want to use it in the bath, you should use a dispersing agent. A dispersing agent will help the oil spread through the bath safely. While some vegetable oils can be used as a dispersing agent, others, like coconut oil, are too thick for use in the bath. Try using an oil with a lighter, more liquid viscosity.Some good agents include:


Honey
Milk
Jojoba Oil
Sweet Almond Oil

, Perfumes are used in smaller applications. While you can use jojoba oil for a perfume, alcohol is typically the preferred diluting agent. Use between ten and fifteen drops of essential oil blend per half ounce (15 ml) of alcohol or jojoba oil., Once you have mixed your essential oils, you can add them to a carrier oil or dispersing agent, depending on your use of the oil. How much of each ingredient you mix together depends on how you are planning on using your essential oil.


For massages, use between fifteen and twenty drops of essential oil blend per ounce of carrier oil.
For lotions or skin oils, use between three and fifteen drops per ounce of carrier oil.
For use on children, use three to six drops per ounce of carrier oil.
For baths, use between two and twelve drops of oil per ounce of dispersing agent.If you are using essential oils for smelling or inhaling only, you do not need a carrier oil.

, You can combine your ingredients in a bowl or in a bottle. If you are mixing your oils in a bowl, you should mix the oil by stirring the oil with a spoon. Wooden stir sticks may also help. If you are mixing your oils in a bottle, you can gently swirl the bottle in your hand to mix the oils., Glass vials, bottles, and sprayers are a good way to store your essential oil blends. Amber bottles with a volume of two to four millimeters are often recommended to store essential oils.Carefully pour the blended oil inside the container; you may use a funnel if it helps. Keep the blend in a cool, dark area.


Carrier oils may expire more quickly than essential oils. Blends with rosehip, sesame, or sweet almond oil can be stored for 6-12 months. Jojoba oil and coconut oil are very stable and may last indefinitely.
You may also store the blended oil in the refrigerator. The exception to this is any blend containing avocado oil, which should not be stored in the fridge.
Do not use if your oils smell bitter or rancid.Do not store the oils in direct sunlight or near a stove., The scent of an essential oil blend can change as the oils settle.Let the essential oil sit for three or four days before you try smelling it again. Note if the scent has changed significantly. This will tell you how a blend ages. By aging some of your blends, you might find more satisfying scents.

Look at your own behavior.,
Understand your child's developmental stage.,
Know your child's strengths (and weaknesses).,
Reflect upon your hopes for your child.,
Focus on one thing at a time.,
Remember that goals are about progress.,
Be consistent.",How to Change Your Child's Attitude1," You are your child's first and most influential teacher. If your own attitude toward life is negative, your child's will be, too. How do you respond in a frustrating situation? How do you treat friends, loved ones, or service workers? What is your reaction if you feel a situation is unfair? Your child absorbs -- and mirrors -- the behaviors you teach him or her., Attitude problems signify the challenges your child is facing as he or she grapples with the unique dimensions of each stage along the journey from infancy to adulthood.


Toddlers and young children displaying attitude problems are likely testing your reactions to learn the boundaries of proper behavior. Ensure you are an attentive parent when your child is fully engaged in positive play; she'll learn that she needn't provoke your anger to get attention.
Children in their early elementary years are old enough to learn from consequences. Elementary school-aged children are also increasingly influenced by the behavior of friends and playmates. Start setting rules about appropriate behavior around adults.As children reach their ""tween"" and teen years they are starting to ""individuate,"" or develop their own, unique identity. Your role is to help them through this often-bewildering stage with clear expectations, respect (which they need to reciprocate), and plenty of personal attention., Consider how your child learns best. Some kids, for example, respond well to auditory instruction, while others are very visual and may need written expectations or physical demonstrations of the behavior you wish to encourage.


Understand what your child is and is not capable of achieving. A child struggling with ADHD, for example, may be ""ignoring"" you not because she has a poor attitude but because she struggles to process the waves of information she is receiving from the world around her.
Children presented with unrealistic expectations can sometimes react by giving up entirely rather than continuing to grapple with what is, for them, an impossible task.
Recognize your child's unique ""starting point"" and then work from there to set behavior expectations., Look down the road and think about the attributes you'd like your child to possess. Would you like him to be kind? Prioritize teaching kindness. Would you like her to be responsible? Teach responsibility. If you would like your child to spend time with you during adolescence and young adulthood, spend time with your child while he or she is young., Pick one behavior to focus upon, and be specific about your parameters. Rather than setting a vague goal such as ""I want my child to listen to me,"" for example, opt for something concrete: ""I want my child to complete his or her homework daily."" Once you and your child have made substantial progress toward that goal, you can move onto the next step: ""I want our conversations about homework to be an attitude-free zone,"" or ""I want to develop a practice of having a kind 5-minute conversation about school with my child daily."", Improvement counts! None of us is capable of perfection. Focus on your child's progress toward meeting your behavior expectations. Avoid becoming discouraged if your child has a bad day; remember that each morning is a new beginning., Say what you mean, mean what you say, and follow through on any stated consequences.Ensure everyone in your household is on the same page. You and your spouse should share the same expectations and follow through with the same consequences.

"
"
Set clear boundaries.,
Remain calm.,
Allow your child to reap what he or she sows.,
Use time-outs as a consequence.Children often display poor attitudes and other bad behavior because they feel out of control.,
Withdraw privileges.",How to Change Your Child's Attitude2," Children thrive when they feel secure in their environment and understand what is expected of them.Develop a consistent household structure, clear expectations, and logical consequences if these expectations are not met.

, Avoid responding to your child's poor attitude with anger. Instead, calmly deliver your request and then disengage.If your child is younger or may place him or herself in a dangerous situation, disengaging may mean selectively ignoring your child's poor behavior while continuing to actively supervise. If your child is older or in safe circumstances, leave the room (always remain within earshot of a young child).


While counting to three, five, or ten is often recommended as a tool to redirect a child's behavior, it may provide even greater benefit for a beleaguered parent. Count in your head before responding to your child's frustrating behavior. Doing so gives you a few seconds to regroup and calm your own frayed emotions., Let reality be your child's teacher. Follow through on the consequences you've set for poor behavior. If your child has been told, for example, that if she responds to your requests with sarcasm she cannot attend Friday's football game, hold firm in your resolve. She'll learn that poor behavior has real consequences.Issue reminders -- but hold your child responsible for following through. Developing brains do sometimes forget what they've been asked to do, so plan on allowing some leeway for a reminder or two. You might even try a written reminder. Consider developing a system of ""warnings,"" but follow through with consequences if those warnings aren't heeded.Remember that to attain the long-term goal of a well-behaved child you may have to deal with short-term personal discomfort. You may have heard the adage, ""punishing the child punishes the parent,"" and while you're listening to a temper tantrum or dealing with an angry teenager you'll recognize the truth of this saying. In the end, though, your job as a parent is to struggle through the immediate discomfort of a situation, recognizing the long-term benefits at stake.

, Employing a time-out interrupts the cycle of this behavior, giving the child a moment to regroup and reflect. Consider targeting the length of a time-out to the age of your child (for a 2-year-old, for example, set a timer for two minutes).

, Ensure the privilege withdrawn relates in some way to the poor behavior you're trying to correct. A child who refuses to put down his video game console, for example, may lose the use of this toy for a day.


This technique works best as part of a pre-arranged behavior management strategy. Sit down with your children and decide upon behaviors you expect -- and privileges they'll receive in return. For example, you might agree that your child will receive the privilege of watching a favorite television program if she completes her homework without fussing. Creating a system helps children learn that with increased privileges come increased responsibilities."
"
Praise your child.,
Take advantage of teachable moments.,
Instill self-worth by developing your child's sense of competence.,
Offer motivation.,
Respect your child's point of view.,
Use humor.Enjoy your relationship with your child.",How to Change Your Child's Attitude3," Let your child know when he or she is displaying a great attitude. Praise your child's behavior; rather than saying ""good boy,"" for example, compliment him on the great way he played with his younger brother. No one can be ""good"" all the time, but praise for a specific action helps your child recognize that you're noticing his efforts.


Vary your praise. Consider leaving your child a note, or complimenting her on different aspects of her behavior.
Don't overdo it. Offer praise for genuine effort and respond to your child's cues -- if she is excited about her hard work or success, reinforce that sense of self-worth with words of praise.
Teach your child to be comfortable giving and receiving compliments.
Avoid using words of praise to promote a hidden agenda. Children are smart. ""I like your new wardrobe"" will easily be re-interpreted as ""thank goodness you've moved on from that style I didn't care for."", When you see evidence of poor attitudes -- or good attitudes -- in everyday life, point these out to your child. They'll absorb the lessons of seeing someone throw a fit (and look ridiculous!) or politely serve a table (and perhaps receive a tip for their efforts).Children's books can be a great way to provide younger children with examples of how (and how not) to behave., Compensating for your child's poor attitude by taking on tasks she should be doing does her no favors. Children develop a sense of self-worth through learning responsibility for their actions and becoming competent at the basic tasks of life. Use praise and other motivators to provide your child with positive reinforcement when he takes on responsibility., Younger children may benefit from a rewards chart. Connect rewards to the behavior itself. A child working on not throwing a fit when asked to take a bath, for example, might earn a fluffy new towel set in his favorite color.


Beware of excessive rewards. Your ultimate goal is to instill self-discipline. Use praise and encouragement to help your child understand that rewards are short-term ways to instill positive behavior., Sometimes parents worry that if they compromise at all, they will lose authority. While you should hold firm on expectations and consequences once rules are set, engaging your child in the rule-making process teaches them valuable decision-making skills. Setting rules together also helps older children feel respected as they start to assert their independence. You may, for example, negotiate a slightly later bedtime -- with the proviso that your child spends the extra half-hour in bed, reading. , Be sure you work opportunities for simple fun and enjoyment into your routine. If your relationship with your child is on firm footing, he's much more likely to respond well to gentle, kind-hearted comments that shed light on the sillier elements of a poor attitude.

Watch for signs of serious illness.,
Visit your local pharmacist.",How to Care for a Sick Child," Being sick is uncomfortable and your child may be worried or upset because of how he or she feels. Giving your child some extra attention and care may help. For example, you can:


Sit with your child.
Read your child a book.
Sing to your child.
Hold your child’s hand.
Hold your baby in your arms.;
, A cough can get worse if your child is lying flat on his or her back.To keep your child’s head elevated, try putting a book or towel under the mattress of your baby’s crib or under the legs at the head of the crib or bed.


You can also give your child an extra pillow or use a wedge pillow to help your child stay upright.

, Dry air can make a cough or sore throat feel worse. Try using a humidifier or cool-mist vaporizer to keep the air in your child’s room moist. This can help to reduce coughing, congestion, and discomfort.


Make sure to change the water in your humidifier frequently.
Wash the humidifier according to the manufacturer's instructions to prevent mold from growing in it., Keep your home as quiet and peaceful as possible to make it easier for your child to rest. Stimulation from television or computers prevents sleep and your child needs as much rest as possible, so you may consider removing devices from your child’s bedroom or at least limiting your child’s use of devices., Your child may feel hot or cold depending on the illness, so adjusting the temperature in your home may help your child to feel more comfortable. It may be helpful to keep your home between 65 and 70 degrees, but you can also adjust this temperature if your child is too hot or too cold.


For example, if your child is complaining that he or she is too cold, then turn up the heat a bit. If your child complains that he or she is hot, then turn on an air conditioner or fan.

, Dehydration can make matters worse when your child is sick. Prevent dehydration in your child by making sure your child drinks fluids frequently.Offer your child:


Water
Ice pops
Ginger ale
Diluted fruit juice
Electrolyte-enhanced beverages

, Give your child nutritious foods that won’t upset their stomach. Choice of food might depend on your child’s symptoms. Good options include:


Salty crackers
Bananas
Applesauce
ToastCooked cereals
Mashed potatoes, Although it will not cure your child, warm chicken soup helps relieve cold and flu symptoms by making mucus thinner and acting as an anti-inflammatory.There are a number of recipes for making your own chicken soup, although many commercial varieties work well, too.

, Encourage your child to sleep as often as he or she likes. Read your child a story or have your child listen to an audio book to make it easier to fall asleep.Your child needs as much rest as they can get.

, If you decide to give medicine, try to stick to one product, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, rather than alternating medications or giving combinations of medications. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about which medicines might be appropriate for your child.Do not give ibuprofen to a child under 6 months old.Do not give cough and cold medicines to a child under 4 years old, and preferably not until at least 8 years old. These medicines have the potential to cause life-threatening side effects and have not been shown to be very effective either.Do not give infants, children, or teenagers acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) because this can cause a rare but serious illness called Reye’s syndrome.

, Add ¼ teaspoon of regular table salt into 8 ounces of lukewarm water. Have your child gargle and spit out the salty water when finished. Gargling with salt water can help relieve throat pain.For younger children or for nasal congestion, you can also use salt water (saline) nasal drops or sprays. You can make a saline spray yourself or buy some at the pharmacy. For infants, you can use a bulb syringe to suction the nose after using the drops.

, Avoid smoking around your child and avoid wearing especially strong perfumes. Postpone activities like painting or cleaning. The fumes can irritate your child’s throat and lungs and make their illness worse., Periodically open the windows in your child’s room to keep the air fresh. Do this when the child is in the bathroom so they don’t get cold.Give your child extra blankets as necessary.

, Take symptoms of an infection with the influenza virus seriously. It is a potentially dangerous illness that often develops suddenly. Contact your child's doctor if you think your child may have the flu, especially if your child is under age 2 or has medical problems such as asthma. Symptoms of the flu include:


High fever and/or chills
Cough
Sore throat
Runny nose
Body or muscle aches
Headache
Tiredness and/or weakness
Diarrhea and/or vomiting, Check to see if your child has chills, a flushed appearance, is sweating, or feels very warm to the touch if you do not have a thermometer., Ask your child how much pain he or she is in and where the pain is located. You may also want to apply gentle pressure to the spot your child is complaining about to get an idea of how severe it is.

, Pay careful attention to signs that indicate your child needs to be seen by a medical professional immediately. These include:


Fever in a child under three months old
Severe headache or a stiff neck
Changes in breathing patterns, especially any trouble breathing
Changes in skin color, such as looking very pale, reddish, or bluish
Child refuses to drink fluids or stops urinating
No tears when crying
Severe or persistent vomiting
Child is difficult to wake up or is unresponsive
Child is unusually quiet and inactive
Signs of extreme irritability or pain
Pain or pressure in the chest or stomach
Sudden or prolonged dizziness
Confusion
Flu-like symptoms improve but then get worse, Talk to your local pharmacist if you are not sure whether your child needs to be seen by a doctor. She or he can help determine if your child’s symptoms require medical attention and can offer advice on medications if they are needed.


You can also call your doctor's office, as there is almost always someone available to help you decide what to do and to provide home care advice.

"
Keep the child hydrated.,
Give them bland foods.,
Feed breastfed babies in small increments.,
Keep them home from school.",How to Care for Vomiting in Kids1," Avoid giving the child anything to drink or eat within 30-60 minutes of vomiting or if the child remains nauseous. Then, have them drink small sips of a clear, non-carbonated fluid, about a half ounce every 5-10 minutes. If the child vomits after this, start over and wait another 30-60 minutes.If they are very nauseated or have trouble swallowing, have them suck on ice chips or fruit pops to get small amounts of fluid.


Pedialyte can be used to rehydrate, too. Since it’s usually dosed by the child’s body weight, you can call your doctor if you need help understanding how much to give your child. Also consult a doctor or pharmacist for advice on how much to give to an infant.Dilute Gatorade or other sports drinks with 50% water.If the child goes 8 hours unable to keep fluids down, take them to the doctor. There’s a high risk they will get dehydrated.
Breastfeeding babies should be given breast milk.;
, Crackers, toast, and gelatin (like jell-o) are a good place to start. If they vomit these up, skip food for now and continue with fluids. Once they can keep down gelatin and toast, try more salty, high-protein, high-carbohydrate foods like rice, cereal, and fruit. Wait to give the child any solid foods until at least 6 hours after they last vomited (fluids and soft foods are okay sooner).Don’t give them fatty or spicy foods for a few days after they stop vomiting, since they can be hard to digest.
Wait 30-60 minutes after vomiting to give them any food or water, unless it’s very small sips of water. This lets their stomach recover a little., If your young child is vomiting due to an illness or simply spits up a lot, try feeding them in smaller amounts more often. Talk to your healthcare provider about how best to do this. You can probably slowly increase the amount you breastfeed at a time as symptoms subside., Your child needs rest while they are sick, and if vomiting is due to a common virus they are highly contagious while they’re vomiting. A child with either rotavirus or norovirus (the two most common causes of “stomach flu”) can be contagious for up to 2 weeks after they’re sick.You don’t have to keep them out of school for this long, but keep them home for at least 48 hours after they stop vomiting or having diarrhea.


When they do go back to school, instruct them on proper hand washing techniques. Demonstrate how to cough or sneeze into the crook of your arm, and how to properly wash hands with soap and hot water. Good hygiene can help prevent the spread of infection.

Identify what sorts of activities your child will do.,
Choose a tracker with a long battery life.,
Select a device that is customizable.,
Take your child’s favorite color into account.,
Look for a waterproof fitness tracker.,
Think about the fit.,Ask your child if their peers have a fitness tracker.",How to Choose a Fitness Tracker for Children1," If your child is really into a particular activity like jumping rope, check with the manufacturer to ensure that the tracker you’re considering can accommodate that activity in its calculus. If your child often goes swimming, you’ll need a waterproof fitness tracker. Heading into the fitness tracker selection process with an understanding of what your child intends to do with the device will make the decision easier., Some fitness trackers need to be recharged every seven days. Others need to be recharged only once per year. The more the fitness tracker needs to be charged, the more likely it is that your child will fail or forget to charge it, or lose the charger itself. Find a fitness tracker that requires minimal charging so that your child is not inconvenienced., If you find a fitness tracker that allow you to enter your child’s name in the display, they will feel a greater sense of ownership over the fitness tracker. Likewise, if you can find a fitness tracker that offers the ability to change the font colors or background graphics, your child will be pleased., Most fitness trackers come in a variety of colors. Get a fitness tracker with a color that your child will love. Ask your child what their favorite color is if you are unsure. Just ask them, “What is your favorite color?”, A waterproof fitness tracker will prevent damage when your child accidentally jumps in the pool or tub without removing it. It will also prevent damage from even more mild exposure to water, including walking home from school in the rain, or splashing and playing in the sink.If your child loves swimming, diving, or playing other water sports, a waterproof fitness tracker is a must.

, Before you buy a fitness tracker for your child, visit an electronics or sporting goods store where such devices are sold. Have your child try several fitness trackers on. Buy a tracker that is comfortable and fits your child’s wrist properly.You can discover whether a fitness tracker fits your child’s wrist in one of two ways. You could ask your child, “Does that feel comfortable?” Alternately, you could look at the strap around your child’s wrist and ensure that it is snug but not tight.
With snap-band fitness trackers, have your child shake their wrist a few times to ensure the tracker does not fall off or become loose with activity.
Some fitness trackers aren’t worn on the wrist at all, but are rather clipped onto a pants cuff or belt loop. Have your kid test devices of this type, too, and ensure they won’t become detached from your child’s clothing during physical activity., Some fitness trackers can exchange information between them. And if your child’s friends have a particular fitness tracker and like it, they’ve essentially tested it for you. Plus, your child will be more likely to enjoy something that they know their friends already think is neat.<REfhttp://www.eatright.org/resource/fitness/exercise/family-activities/fitness-trackers-for-kids</ref>


Some fitness tracker manufacturers offer discount rates if a large number of trackers is made at once. Consider talking to parents of your child’s friends to see if they want to place a large order at the same time."

Keep your child on a nutritional diet.",How to Care For a Child with Metabolic Disorders," If your child has not been officially diagnosed by a physician and you suspect she has a metabolic disorder, you should contact a doctor immediately. The physician will run blood work and other tests in order to gather important data needed for a diagnosis. Your physician might even refer you to a specialist or others who might be important members of your medical support team.


Be prepared for a wide array of tests, including blood work. Your doctor may order a comprehensive metabolic panel to check organ function and levels of enzymes and other
You’ll probably have to visit the doctor or specialist several times before your child is diagnosed.
Make sure to find a doctor you and your child like, as you’ll be visiting their office often.
Some common metabolic disorders include: diabetes, Tay-Sachs disease (TSD), von Gierke disease, Niemann-Pick disease, Morquio syndrome, maple syrup urine disease, cystinosis, cystinuria, Galactosemia. This is only a fraction of existing metabolic disorders — there are hundreds of different types.;
, Just because your child has received an official diagnosis does not mean that you’re done with the doctor. You’ll be visiting his office on a regular basis so that he can monitor your child’s status and progress. This is necessary in making sure your child’s vitals, nutrition, and overall health are stabilized.


Your doctor might run blood work relatively regularly.

, Because there are so many different types of metabolic disorders, each with its own specific medications and dietary adjustments or supplements needed to keep a child healthy. Some metabolic disorders are fatal, while others are relatively benign. Work with your doctor to learn more about your child's specific disorder and make sure your child is taking her medications exactly as prescribed and/or is following her recommended diet.For instance, your child may need to receive steroids to replace hormones that her body cannot create on its own.In other cases, treatment may simply be focused on reducing symptoms and making your child as comfortable as possible., Some metabolic disorders impair the body’s ability to metabolize and incorporate important enzymes. If this is the case, your doctor will prescribe enzyme replacements. Make sure your child regularly takes her enzyme replacements, as they will be extremely important in managing her metabolic disorder and maintaining good health. Enzyme replacement therapy might include:


Imiglucerase
Velaglucerase alfa
Taliglucerase alfa, Some children with metabolic disorders do not get enough fiber to maintain a healthy metabolism. In order to overcome this, you might consider putting your child on fiber supplements.


Fiber supplements will help make sure your child has regular bowel movements.
Fiber supplements might help reduce your child’s LDL cholesterol level.
Consult your doctor before putting your child on any supplement., Monitoring your child's condition is going to be an on-going task for you to do. You need to keep vigilant about your child's health and well-being, as somewhat innocuous changes can signal potentially life threatening consequences.


If your child sleeps too much, contact your physician.
If you notice rapid breathing patterns or changes in appetite, contact your physician.
If your child's health is deteriorating in any way, contact your doctor.

, Everyone in your home and others who you frequently associate with should be part of your support team. They can help monitor your child’s diet and wellbeing when needed, and they can provide emotional support during rough times. A non-medical support team is extremely important in managing metabolic disorders, as the demands of metabolic disorders on caregivers are often high and time-consuming.


Educate others in your family and social circle on the specific condition and the child's ever changing eating patterns.
Even if one parent is able to stay home full-time, you should enlist the help from those in whom you trust.
Always have a couple people on backup just in case the primary care giver can’t be around to monitor the child., Since diet is so important in keeping children with metabolic disorders healthy, you need to communicate with everyone who will have supervisory roles around your child. Talk with your child’s teachers and let them know the specifics of your child’s disorder. Communicate with the parents of your child’s friends so they can know the specifics, too. Let both know what your child can and can’t eat, and if and when your child needs to take medication., Make sure you have all of the healthcare contact numbers with you at all times. At the same time, make sure your partner (if you have one) or other members of your support team also have any numbers they might need in the event of a metabolic crisis.


Keep numbers in your cell phone.
Post emergency numbers in an obvious place at home so members of your support team can find them.
If your child is old enough, have her memorize her primary care physician’s phone number.
Have your child wear a medical alert bracelet or carry a card with appropriate medical information and contact numbers., Talk to everyone in your support team and make sure they know where your child’s medicines are located. You don’t want someone to have to search for them in the event of a time-sensitive event.


Keep them in an easily accessible and obvious location.
Try not to put them away in a drawer or behind other things in the fridge.
Make sure your child cannot reach them by herself.

, Educating yourself about your child's disorder is perhaps one of the most important things you can do in your battle to keep your child healthy. This way you'll be informed about the latest breakthroughs in treatment and the newest drug developments.


Join official support groups for the particular disorder and learn from other families who are dealing with the same issues as you are. Most organizations on the specific disorder have websites with information about the disorder along with other resources and support group information.
Attend seminars and conferences for updates in education and medical advances and/or setbacks.
Read and study to get educated on the condition and others like it.
Talk to your doctors and don't be afraid to ask them for recommendations about things you can read or conferences or talks you can attend.

, After receiving a proper diagnosis from your medical professional, you should have a very good idea of what food and drugs your child needs to avoid in order to maintain a healthy metabolism. Once you’ve done that, try to eliminate those food and drugs from your child’s diet. If you can’t completely eliminate them, minimize them as much as you can., Whatever the metabolic problem, weight is often an associated challenge. Because of this, you (along with your doctor) should draft a weight management plan for your child. This plan sets a target weight goal and then you and your child take the appropriate steps to reach and maintain that goal.


Weight management plans are not just for overweight children, but for underweight children, too.
Weight management plans are not “diets” but are intended to reach and maintain a healthy weight.
Always consult your doctor before starting your child on any weight management plan., Some babies are unfortunately born with metabolic disorders and need special formula in order to manage their disorder. Fortunately, we now better understand what nutritional steps to take in order to manage metabolic disorders in infants.


If your baby has galactosemia, try to eliminate dairy products and put her on a non-milk formula.
If your baby has PKU, put her on a phenylalanine-free formula and a low-protein diet.
Consult your doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment as well as recommendations or even prescriptions for formulas., An exercise routine will make sure that your child is not only active, but healthy. Exercising should be an important part of any overall plan that is intended to manage metabolic disorders. In many cases, exercising will be the cornerstone of your child’s overall plan to overcome metabolic disorders.


Exercising will help kids lower their blood pressure and cholesterol.
Exercising could help your child’s body regulate insulin better.
Exercising will help your child mentally, too., Your child’s overall metabolic plan will hinge on a healthy diet. As metabolic disorders are associated with how your child processes food, your child will undoubtedly have to be on a strict diet. You’ll need to make sure your child is getting all of the nutrition she needs to stay healthy. This is perhaps one of the most important aspects of managing your child’s disorder, so if your child is old enough, you should have frequent conversations with them about their nutrition and overall health.


Your doctor will with you to formulate a proper nutrition plan.
Talk about “cheating” on the diet with your doctor. Your child might be able to veer off the diet and have treats occasionally, but this should only be done with the sanction of your doctor.
Make sure to communicate your child’s diet to other members of your support team."

Have the child rest.,
Avoid triggering vomiting.,
Minimize motion sickness.,
Give the child extra love and attention.,
Sanitize the house after their illness.",How to Care for Vomiting in Kids2," Don't force a child to stay in bed, but limit their activities. Try reading to them, playing a board game in bed, or keeping them otherwise calm and still.Ample rest will help them recover more quickly.


Roll young children and babies who are vomiting onto their side or stomach to prevent them from choking on vomit., Avoid strong smells and other triggers when your child is nauseated. Driving, flickering lights, smoke, perfume and other strong smells, and hot humid rooms can worsen nausea and vomiting., Some vomiting in children can be caused by motion sickness, the queasy feeling you get when traveling. If the child’s vomiting is associated with being in the car, on a plane, or on a boat and occurs at no other time, they likely have motion sickness. Try to minimize motion sickness during traveling by:Letting the child sit in the front passenger’s seat of the car if they’re over 12 years old – this usually improves motion sickness over being in the back seat.
When flying, get a seat over the front edge of the wing, and direct airflow from the vent onto your child’s face.
On a boat, get a cabin near water level at the front or middle of the boat.
Face forward on trains, and try to sit next to a window near the front of the train.
Give them dry crackers and a flat soda like ginger ale.
If the child is old enough to follow directions, tell them to keep their head still (don’t read or watch videos), and focus on a stationary object or the horizon in the distance.
Giving a child over 2 years old Dramamine for Kids or similar medicine approved for children., Vomiting can be both uncomfortable and scary for a child. Give them extra care by spending time with them doing calm activities like reading or playing board games. Comfort them physically by stroking their hair, holding their hand, or rubbing their back – especially while they’re vomiting. Help them get cleaned up afterwards by wiping their forehead with a cool cloth, or helping them wash out their mouth with water.

, “Stomach flu” germs get airborne when a child vomits or has diarrhea and can remain contagious on household surfaces even after the child gets well. To prevent re-infection or infecting others, clean all household surfaces once your child has stopped vomiting and having diarrhea.Use disinfectant products that work against viruses, clean all surfaces with 1 cup bleach in 1 quart water, or use a steam cleaner.


Be careful when having visitors over the next two weeks, especially children, since someone with rotavirus or norovirus may remain contagious over this time period, even if they have recovered. "

Look for signs of poisoning.,
Go to the doctor immediately if your child is dehydrated.,
See your care provider for severe or persistent vomiting.,
Go to the doctor if vomiting occurs with a high fever.,
Seek medical care for projectile vomiting in an infant.,
Get help soon if the child has severe pain or “currant jelly” stool.,
Call emergency services if vomiting is due to an allergic reaction.,
Seek Emergency Care for other serious symptoms.",How to Care for Vomiting in Kids3," If you suspect poisoning, call the Poison Control Center (1-800-222-1222 in the United States) or emergency medical services immediately. If vomiting occurs suddenly, take a quick look for signs of poisoning: Suspicious containers such as medications, cleaning solvents, or poisons which small children may have found. Check the vomit for blood, which can indicate poisoning. Smell the child's breath – if there is any chemical, fruity, or unusual odor, suspect poisoning.If the child is old enough, ask them if they ate or drank something they found. Try to appear calm and not angry to encourage the child to tell you honestly.

, Vomiting and diarrhea in children can quickly lead to dehydration, which can have serious consequences for kids. Take your child to the doctor or emergency room right away or call 911 if they exhibit any severe signs of dehydration such as:Extremely dry mouth, dry skin or no tears when crying.
Passes out.
Cannot stand due to weakness or dizziness.
Is lethargic or unable to think clearly.
Is older and has not urinated in 12 hours or longer.
If you notice less severe symptoms of mild or moderate dehydration, like not drinking or eating enough, dark yellow urine or less frequent urination, dry mouth/eyes, irritability, or vomiting more than once, call your doctor, especially if your child is less than 1 year old since dehydration can happen much more quickly in younger children.

, Take the child to their doctor if vomiting lasts longer than 24 hours, the child also has diarrhea, abdominal pain, or black or tarry stools, or the vomit contains greenish material or blood (which may appear bright red or the vomit might look dark like coffee grounds).If the child vomits several times an hour for several hours, that’s also severe enough to see the doctor.Consult a doctor if your child has recently started a new medication. Their vomiting may be a serious reaction to the new medicine.
Some babies up to 4-5 months old vomit or spit-up because of a condition known as Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD). If your child seem uncomfortable or in pain and /or develops breathing problem associated with spitting up, talk to your pediatrician or family practitioner., Fevers can contribute to dehydration in children and can cause serious problems. Take your feverish, ill child to see their doctor if:A baby up to 3 months old has a fever of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher (get emergency help immediately, even if not vomiting).
A child up to 2 years old has a fever of 100.4°F (38°C) (okay to see the regular doctor).
A child of any age has a fever of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher that keeps coming back or lasts longer than 24 hours.

, If a newborn is unable to feed due to projectile vomiting, they may have a condition called pyloric stenosis. This condition is treatable with surgery, and prompt treatment is important so the baby can start to feed properly and gain weight.Pyloric stenosis usually develops in children under 3 months of age.
Projectile vomiting is forceful vomiting during which the baby might eject liquids for up to several feet., A disorder called intussusception sometimes occurs, usually in children under 3 years old. This is when part of the intestine “telescopes” into another part, causing a block in the intestine. This can be a serious medical concern, so get help right away if vomiting is accompanied by:Abdominal pain, usually occurring every 15-20 minutes then becoming more constant as time passes. A young child with abdominal pain might pull their knees to their chest and cry.
Stool mixed with mucus and blood, called “currant jelly stool” because of how it looks.
Diarrhea.

Fever.
Lethargy or unusual weakness or sleepiness.
A lump in the abdomen.

, Vomiting that occurs right after a bee sting or introduction of a new food (including milk) may be due to a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis.Very quickly look for other signs of allergic reaction as shown below. If the child has an Epi pen, use it right away. If not, call for emergency help and follow up with your doctor to discuss long-term management. Look for:Hives or a rash.
Flushed or pale skin.
The child feeling warm.
Visible swelling of the child’s tongue or lips, or swelling of the tongue or throat as shown by wheezing or trouble breathing.
A fast, weak pulse.
Fainting.

, No matter what is causing a child’s vomiting, some signs and symptoms indicate a serious problem. Call emergency services or take your child for emergency care if vomiting occurs with any of the following:Trouble breathing.
Difficulty waking up or staying awake, or confusion.
Seizure.
Racing or irregular heartbeat.
No bowel movement for 3 days or longer.
Stiff neck or severe headache.
Trouble urinating or pain when urinating.Blood in the vomit or stool.Greenish color to vomit.

Consider a tracker that offers games.,
Find a tracker that doubles as a watch.,
Look for a tracker that has educational value.",How to Choose a Fitness Tracker for Children2," Moving your body is great fun. But some kids don’t see it that way. If your child’s fitness tracker makes it fun for your child to engage in physical activity, they will be more likely to do so. Choose a fitness tracker that offers new games or unlockable digital prizes when your child meets their fitness requirements., Many fitness trackers can also be used as watches. With a clock feature, your child will be better able to keep track of the time, as well as their fitness and activity levels., Some fitness trackers specially designed for kids offer games that help them learn. Children love opportunities to learn on the go.For example, the Garmin Vivofit Jr. app – used in conjunction with the Garmin Vivofit Jr. fitness tracker – teaches kids interesting facts about and images of animals as they move closer to their fitness goal.
Other trackers like the Jewelbot offer opportunities to learn basic programming skills by entering simple code into the fitness tracker’s system."
"
Choose a fitness tracker that includes a GPS tracker.,
Think about getting a fitness tracker that can assign additional responsibilities.,
Decide if you want to get a tracker to match.,
Compare prices.,
Look for trackers that offer extra data.",How to Choose a Fitness Tracker for Children3," With a GPS tracker installed in the fitness tracker, you’ll be able to see exactly where your kids are at all times. That way, your child will be safe and you’ll be able to locate them quickly if they wander away., Many fitness trackers for kids allow parents to send information about chores and other responsibilities like homework directly to their child’s fitness tracker. Such a feature can keep your child focused on what the need to do.You can often add tasks and allot a timeframe within which your child must complete each task via an independent application for your phone.

, Parents often enjoy obtaining a grown-up counterpart to their child’s fitness tracker. Some fitness trackers offer the opportunity to link your device with your child’s, allowing you to get updates and information about your child’s activities more easily. Plus, with a tracker of your own, you’ll be more likely to engage in a fitness regimen of your own.Kids and parents can have great fun challenging each other each day to see who took the most steps.
If you decide that you want to get one of your own, you’ll have to take your own preferences about fit, color, and features as well as those of your child into account.

, When you’re first looking for a fitness tracker for your child, think about how different brands compare in price. Then, once you and your child have settled on a particular fitness tracker, compare prices for the make and model you want between different stores. Look for deals around holidays, and don’t forget to check online.Think about getting gently used fitness trackers on eBay and similar online auction sites, too.

, Many fitness trackers collect only basic data like calories burned or steps taken. But many trackers also offer information like how many hours your child is sleeping, or what your child’s heart rate is.Many trackers also offer not only more output, but opportunities to input data like how many calories your child consumes, too. This information can be better used to monitor your child’s overall health.

Change the flavor.,
Drip the medicine with a dropper or syringe.,
Deliver smaller doses.,
Serve the medicine with a treat.,
Talk to your child.,
Use force only as a last resort.",How to Administer Medicine to a Resistant Child1," The pharmacist can add flavor like chocolate, watermelon, cherry, or another of your child’s favorites to many syrup medicines for a small charge.This can even work on over-the-counter medicines which are already flavored, and your child prefers to be flavored differently.;
, You can get a blank (needle-less) syringe without a prescription from a pharmacy. You can also use a dropper. Sit the child up, slip the syringe or dropper full of the correct dose between the teeth or gums within the mouth. Push the plunger slowly so the drops pour down the back of the tongue or into the cheek.Don’t use a spoon for this method. Also avoid squirting into the back of the throat or the child may choke. Try squirting the medicine to the side of the mouth instead.

, Use the dosing cups or dosing spoons that frequently come with liquid medications to portion out the doses over more time. Ask your doctor and pharmacist before you attempt this method. You need to make sure you’re giving the same total dose necessary for the illness, but you can give smaller amounts more frequently so the child is not taking it all at once.An example of this could be instead of giving a child 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of a medicine every 12 hours you give her two half tablespoons (7.5 ml each) in quick succession at the dosing time.
The child may think this is prolonging the unpleasant experience of taking medicine—so it could be making things worse.

, Ask your doctor and pharmacist if the medicine can be taken soon before eating or drinking or even with food. If the medicine can be taken with food, then you may be able to mix it into a cup of pudding, yogurt, or juice to get the child to take it. Or, you can give your child one of his favorite snacks or beverages such as a bowl of ice cream, a fruit snack or flavored yogurt right after the medicine. Let him know in advance he will get the treat if he takes their medicine.If you mix your child's medicine in with food or drink, make sure that your child consumes all of it.
If the medicine cannot be taken with food or drink, then ask the doctor and pharmacist for the time limit between giving the medicine to your child and when he can eat and drink again.
Be aware that this method may ultimately backfire, as your child may come to associate the treat with an unpleasant experience.

, Introduce the medicine as something that will help her, and follow that up by asking her what form (cup, syringe) and flavor she wants it in. This will give the child some sense of control in the situation.Don’t let the discussion turn into one where she refuses to take the medicine. If that happens you might counter by saying something such as, “You want to get better so you can play with your friends again, don’t you?”

, If all else fails, you may have to use some degree of physical force. You will usually need a helper for this. Have a blank syringe prepared with the correct dose of medicine already. Place the child on the lap of one person who will hold the child’s head still and level (not tilted backwards). The second adult should use one hand to push down the child’s chin/lower jaw. Use the other hand to insert the syringe between the child’s teeth and squirt the medicine on the back of the tongue. Shut the child’s mouth until the child swallows.There are times that force needs to be used for the wellbeing of the child, but again, this should always be used as absolute last resort. Using physical force can cause mistrust to form between you and your child.
You can let the child know he can help next time if he doesn't want you to use force. Also consider giving him positive reinforcement such as a hug and treat (yogurt, a video, stickers, etc…).

See your pediatrician promptly if you suspect your child has RSV.,
Consult with the doctor about the use of antibiotics.,
Admit your child to a hospital if your doctor advises you to so do.,
Manage high fever with acetaminophen.,
Offer fluids.,
Suction congestion from your child’s nose.,
Prop your child upright with a pillow for better sleep.,
Wash your hands before playing with infants or children.,
Wear a facemask when you are ill.,
Avoid kissing children if you are sick.,
Opt for a nanny instead of a large daycare.,
Avoid smoking.,
Avoid crowds if you have a high-risk baby.",How to Care for Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) in Children," The doctor will swab your child’s nasal fluid and use a rapid test to determine if RSV is the source of the infection. The results of this test are usually available within fifteen minutes.;
, Often, secondary bacterial infections can occur as a result of an RSV infection. Your child’s doctor can perform a physical examination to determine if any secondary infections are present and if antibiotics are appropriate for your child., Hospitals can provide supportive care for children with severe infection. During their hospital stay, children may receive oxygen, humidified air, and intravenous fluids as the infection runs its course., While certain levels of fever can be therapeutic in fighting RSV, fevers above 103 degrees F (38.4 degrees C) can be dangerous. Over-the-counter medicines, such as acetaminophen, can help manage fever and regulate body temperature. Dosage is usually based on your child's weight, but this can be variable in infants or children under 2 years old. Consult your doctor to calculate the appropriate dose to manage your child’s fever.Tell your doctor about any persistent or prolonged fever.

, Monitor your child’s urine output and any dry mouth, as a fever can cause dehydration. Offer plenty of water and clear fruit juices. If your child doesn’t urinate within a given 6-8 hour period, consult your doctor., Use saline and a nasal aspirator, such as a bulb syringe or a NoseFrida, to remove mucus from your child’s nose. This will aid their breathing and can help them sleep better. Follow the manufacturer’s directions regarding suctioning technique and how much saline is appropriate, depending upon your child’s age., Place a firm pillow or two behind your child’s neck and back to help them sleep in a more upright position. This can help relieve nasal congestion and allow your child to rest soundly.It is not advisable to put pillows or other soft objects in the cribs of children under two. Consult your doctor for measures that can help younger babies sleep well while fighting the virus.

, Adults have more developed immune systems than young children. To keep those vulnerable to RSV healthiest, wash your hands with soap and warm water for 30 seconds, scrubbing underneath your nails, before any interactions. If you have a young baby, request any visitors who want to hold the baby to do the same, particularly if they seem sick.For example, you might say, “I’m so excited to see you. I prefer that everyone wash their hands before holding the baby. Do you mind?” Guests are sure to oblige.
Children in daycare settings are much more likely to be exposed to RSV. If you have an older child, supervise their handwashing before they play with a younger sibling.

, If you are ill and need to care for a baby or young child, it can’t hurt to wear a facemask. You may have RSV and not know it, as the infection passes like a bad cold in most adults. Facemasks limit the spread of infectious particles that are dispersed when you cough or sneeze.You can buy facemasks at online retailers.

, RSV can be passed by intimate contact such as kissing. If you are feeling ill and don’t know if your infection is RSV or the common cold, avoid kissing children on the mouth, face or hands., Children are more likely to be exposed to RSV in daycare and group-play settings. Arranging care for your child in your home or in a home daycare with fewer children will minimize their risk of contracting RSV in the first place.This is especially helpful for young babies, whose immune systems aren’t fully developed at birth.

, Do not smoke cigarettes, cigars or a pipe around your child or infant. While RSV passes as a cold would for most children, children who are exposed to secondhand smoke are much more likely to have complications related to the infection. Some may even need to be hospitalized or put in intensive care. Minimize this risk by limiting your smoking.Ask others to do the same. If you have a guest who smokes, kindly ask them to do so outside away from your child.

, If your doctor has indicated that your child has an immature immune system due to prematurity at birth or an underlying health condition, avoid crowded events. In large groups, it is much more likely that someone may be ill. Plus, many people have trouble resisting playing with or holding small children.Crowded areas aren’t just restricted to events; everyday places such as shopping malls and elevators can provide the close quarters necessary for RSV transmission.

Place the pill or capsule far back in the child’s mouth.,
Split or crush the pills.,
Empty slow-release capsules.,
Show older children how to take pills.",How to Administer Medicine to a Resistant Child2," One method is to place the pill on the back of the tongue, and have the child drink water or a favorite drink of hers—such as a fruit juice. Have her gulp the drink quickly and focus on the drink flavor.Keep the child’s head level or bent forward slightly. Using a straw for the drink also helps.

, This is one way to break up the dose for easier swallowing. Use a knife or pill cutter to split the pill in half or quarters. You can also crush the pill between two spoons into a powder and mix it into a small amount of a favorite food of the child’s that requires no chewing (ice cream, pudding, yogurt, etc…).Just make sure you mix it into a manageable amount of food — she must eat all of the food to get the full dose.


Crushing the pill can be done more easily if you wet the pill with a drop or two of water and let it sit for five minutes.

Do not attempt this with slow-release capsules or pills with special coatings. If you destroy the slow release capability of the pill and it delivers a single, large dose, this can be extremely dangerous for your child. Ask your doctor and pharmacist if you are uncertain.

, Ask your doctor and pharmacist before attempting this, as not all capsules are meant to be opened. The contents can be swallowed without chewing, and are usually bitter, so need to be mixed with the child’s favorite sweet foods (applesauce, yogurt, or the like).This can be messy. You don’t want to risk losing the ingredients. Make sure you have a clear and dry workspace to empty the contents onto.

, For children over the age of eight and unable or unwilling to take pills they can practice when not sick or upset. Provide the child with a small piece of candy or ice for them to suck on. Use something that will melt quickly to avoid items getting stuck in the child’s throat.Work up to candies the size of M&Ms. You can try a thin coating of butter if stickiness is still an issue.

Toddlers should have their hair shampooed about three times a week.
Oily and straight hair should be shampooed once a day or every other day.Straight, non-oily hair can be shampooed once or twice a week.African-American hair, curly hair, or dry hair should be shampooed every 7 to 10 days. Hair should be rinsed with water and conditioned after heavy sweating or swimming. ;
, Monitor how your child's hair responds to the recommended shampooing frequencies and make adjustments as necessary. The weather or changes in activity levels may require a change in shampooing frequency. If you notice that the hair and/or scalp is oily, add an additional shampoo per week until the oiliness is gone.If you notice dullness, shedding, or dryness, remove one shampoo per week until the hair feels better., Consider the scent, gentleness, and the child's hair type when choosing a shampoo. For example, if your child has dry hair, you should look for a moisturizing shampoo. There are many children's shampoos on the market, and finding the best shampoo will require trial and error.If your child has a scalp condition such as psoriasis,dermatitis, or dandruff, consult a dermatologist about the best shampoo.
If your child has fine or thin hair, try a lightweight shampoo that will not weigh his or her hair down.

, Wet the hair thoroughly before applying shampoo then squirt a quarter sized amount of shampoo in your hand. Gently massage the shampoo into your child's scalp. Make sure that all of the shampoo is rinsed out of the hair when finished.Use the ball of your fingertips to massage the scalp. Scratching with your nails can irritate the scalp.If the child has tight curly tresses, do not gather the hair on top of the child's head. This can cause the hair to tangle.Adjust the amount of shampoo you use based on the child's hair. For example, a child with thicker hair may need more than a quarter sized amount of shampoo, and a child with thin or fine hair may need less than a quarter sized amount of shampoo.
An itchy, dry, or flaky scalp may be a sign that all of the shampoo is not being rinsed out., African-American, curly hair, and dry hair should be conditioned after the shampooing process. Conditioner adds shine, softens hair, and smooths the cuticle.The conditioning needs of your child's hair may change due to the climate. Hair may need conditioner during colder months or in drier climates.

, Three types of conditioners include leave-in conditioner, deep conditioners, and instant conditioners. The type of conditioner you choose is based on the child's hair. For example, if your child has extremely dry hair, a deep conditioner would be best.Always follow the directions on the conditioner bottle.


Leave-in conditioners are kept in and are not rinsed out of the hair. They can make the detangling process easier. A leave-in conditioner may weigh fine or thin hair down.
Instant conditioners coat the hair and create softness and shine. They do not have to be left in the hair for very long before they are rinsed out.Deep conditioners usually stay in the hair for about 15 minutes before rinsing. They can be used after every shampoo or once a month depending on the condition of your child's hair.A hot oil treatment can also be used once or twice a month to condition hair as well. Heat up some oil (e.g. olive oil, coconut oil, jojoba oil) and then massage the warm oil into the scalp and hair. Cover the hair with a shower cap or a warm towel and let the oil sit for 20 minutes. Rinse out the oil when finished.

, Conditioner should be applied on freshly washed hair. Squeeze out any excess water before applying. Put hair into sections and then apply a palm sized amount of conditioner to each section. Focus conditioner application on the ends of the hair.Thicker and curlier hair should be divided into smaller sections to better distribute the conditioner.
Work the conditioner through the hair using a wide toothed comb or your hands.Conditioner does not need to be applied to your scalp.
Thicker and highly textured hair may need more conditioner than fine and thin hair. Adjust the amount of conditioner you use based on the child's hair type.

, Gum can be removed without cutting the child's hair. Creamy peanut butter or any type of vegetable oil can be applied to the hair to remove gum. Completely cover the gum with peanut butter or oil using you fingers or a toothbrush and let the product sit for a few minutes. Then remove the gum from the hair and wash the child's hair.Vegetable oil works best if the gum is in the child's eyelashes or eyebrows as well.

, Conditioner can be used to remove glue from hair. Wet the hair and then apply conditioner to the area covered with glue. Let the conditioner soak for 20 minutes, and then use a comb to remove the glue from the hair.


If the conditioner does not work, try using baby oil instead of the conditioner. The oil should be left on the hair for 20 minutes as well.

, It is not uncommon for a child to cut his or her own hair or have his or her hair cut by another child at school. If this happens, you can take the child to a professional stylist to fix the hair. If the damage is not that bad, have the child try accessories such as hats, headbands, barrettes, bobby pins, or styles that can camouflage the damage.Talk to your child about the appropriated ways to use scissors (e.g. for arts and crafts).
If your child is interested in styling hair, allow them to cut the hair of a doll or mannequin instead.
If another child cuts your child's hair, address the matter with the teacher and the other child's parent so this does not happen again.
Remind your child that other children should not touch or play with his or her hair.
Remember that hair grows back.

, Cowlicks are not uncommon. Try reversing your child's usual part or use bobby pins and hairspray to train the hair to lay down. You also may try hairstyles that allow the cowlick to remain in its preferred direction.Cowlicks are less visible on long hair, super short hair and textured hair. Growing out the hair or having a very short hair style may hide the cowlick.
Cowlicks should be brushed down while the hair is still wet., Always detangle hair, before styling. Divide hair into sections and secure the sections with a clip or ponytail holder. Apply a leave-in conditioner or a detangler to the section, and then begin to comb the section. Start at the ends of the hair and work your way up. Be gentle as not to hurt the child or damage the hair.Entertaining the child with a movie or book can help the detangling process go more smoothly. Make sure both you and the child are in a comfortable position before you get started.
A wide tooth comb is a good tool to use for detangling.
Once a section is detangled, either braid it or twist it so it does not become tangled again.Be extra gentle with kinky and curly hair. This hair type should be divided into smaller sections for the detangling process. You can also use your fingers to help detangle the hair.
If you plan on applying heat to the child's hair later, apply a heat protectant to the hair as you are detangling.

, Too tight braids, ponytails, and barrettes can cause children's hair to fall out.If the child mentions that he or she is in pain, loosen the braid or the ponytail. Hairstyles should never be painful.


For African-American children, pay special attention to the hairline. Styles such as braids and cornrows should be done gently. Avoid excessive pulling and tension which could cause thinning of the hairline.Small bumps around the hairline can also indicate that a style is too tight.

, Heat can be used to dry hair more quickly or to straighten kinky and curly hair. A heat protectant should always be used before applying heat.Heat puts stress on the hair and can lead to dryness.Hair should be separated into sections before blow-drying. Start at the ends first and work your way up. Thicker and highly textured hair should be blow dried in smaller sections.
Blow-dryers with a comb nozzle attachment are recommended for African-American hair.If you are using a ceramic comb or iron to straighten hair, put it on the lowest temperature setting possible. Thick or coarse hair may need more heat or be divided into smaller sections before straightening.
African-American hair should not be straightened more than once a week., African-American children should not chemically relax their hair to straighten it. These chemicals can negatively affect their scalp. The tighter curl pattern of African-American hair makes it more susceptible to chemical damage.Blow-drying or ceramic combs are safer alternatives for straightening hair.


If you choose to relax the hair, wait until the child is at least 12 years old and have the relaxer done by a professional stylist.Permanent and semi-permanent hair color should not be used by children under 16 years of age.Use styling products such as mousse, gels, and pomades that are specially formulated for children.

Check for symptoms of viral infection.,
Check the frequency of bowel movements.,
Look for signs of dehydration.,
Check the side effects of your child's medication.",How to Care for a Child With Diarrhea1," There are many causes for diarrhea in children, but the main cause is often a viral infection, such as rotavirus. Viral infections are often accompanied by many other symptoms including headache, stomachache, vomiting, and fever.Diarrhea, especially caused by viral infection, often lasts between five and fourteen days.Check your child’s temperature with a medical thermometer to see if they have a raised body temperature, which is often another sign of viral infection.;
, Many treatments and indicators of severity are tied to how frequently your child has a bowel movement. Once you begin treating your child’s diarrhea, bowel movements should become less frequent and stool should become less watery.The BRAT treatment is meant for those who are having watery bowel movements every four hours. However, this dietary treatment is not ideal for young children.

, Although not always a high risk in children with mild diarrhea, many children risk becoming dehydrated while having severe diarrhea due to the amount of fluids lost. Identifying the signs of dehydration as soon as they begin to emerge will help you seek the best possible treatment as early as possible.Look for signs of dizziness, a dry or sticky mouth, dark yellow or little to no urine, and few to no tears when crying.Severe dehydration can cause serious health problems, like seizures and brain damage. Seek immediate medical care if you notice signs of severe dehydration in your child. These may include lethargy; dry, cool, pale or mottled skin; fainting or confusion; and rapid heart rate or rapid breathing., If your child regularly takes medication, or has been taking medication recently due to another illness or ailment, check the medications side-effects and see if they include diarrhea. If so, consult your child's doctor for the best course of action."

Praise their effort rather than a trait or accomplishment.,
Avoid insincere praising.,
Encourage good behavior through targeted praise.",How to Build a Child's Self Esteem1," When you praise a child, acknowledge the amount of effort they put into their activity. This encourages their hard work -- they realize their hard work is noticed and valued by others. Focusing praise on a result or a personality trait, however, emphasizes you value something they may not necessarily able to control.For example, if your child shows you a picture they drew, praise the effort that went into it. You could say, “I can tell you spent a lot of time on this picture. Look how much detail you put on the bird’s feathers!” Do not praise the child for “being such a good artist” or blanket praise the picture with a non-specific “Good job!”
For example, if your child brings home a good grade on an exam, you could say, “I’m so proud of you! You studied hard for this unit, and it paid off.” This would be better than saying, “You’re always so smart in social studies!” or “That A+ will look great on our refrigerator!”
Focusing on intelligence and outcome can be problematic because there will be times when a subject doesn’t naturally come easily to them. There will also be times when they will work very hard and still fall short of their goal. Focusing on a characteristic or end result doesn’t encourage pride in one’s own effort.;
, Adults often fall into the trap of too much praise, fearing that one non-positive comment will damage their children’s self-esteem. However, too much praise will seem insincere to the child. It can also create a sense of entitlement -- the child believes they can do no wrong -- and they may come to depend on it in order to accomplish anything.Children may not develop an “internal cheerleader” that helps them feel good about themselves, if they are constantly hearing empty praise from others. Instead, they can be led to believe that they’re only good if someone tells them they are.
As a result of too much praise, children may be afraid to take risks and try new things. They begin to believe that their value lies in their accomplishments, rather than their efforts, and they are reluctant to set themselves up to fail with something new.

, Acknowledge a completed chore, a positive sibling interaction, or other behaviors you’d like to encourage with appreciation. Naming the valued behavior in a positive way will help reinforce the behavior for your child.For example, you could say, “Carlos, thank you for putting away your toys this afternoon without being asked. That was very helpful.”

Involve your child's pediatrician.,
Prepare for your child’s doctor’s appointment.,
Avoid over the counter medications.",How to Care for a Child With Diarrhea2," Contact your pediatrician immediately if you are concerned or have questions about your child’s state. Keep an eye out for other symptoms that may indicate serious illness while your child has diarrhea, such as: high fever (over 102 F), dehydration, blood in stool, mucus in stool, black, tar-like stool, or frequent vomiting. If you are treating your child’s symptoms and they are not improving within a couple of days or are getting worse, make an appointment to see your pediatrician as soon as possible.
Keep in mind that diarrhea is the body’s process of removing infection and that infections need to run their course. Although your child should not be declining in health, it may still take a few days to see improvement.

, Prepare for the appointment with your child’s doctor by reviewing the length and qualities of their illness. Keep notes of how long your child has had diarrhea as well as how many bowel movements they have a day.


Find out what the color and consistency of your child’s stool is as well as if it contains blood or mucus.
Keep a note of the other symptoms your child has, like fever or vomiting, as these may be signs of other infections., Avoid giving your child over the counter anti-diarrheal medications as they are generally meant for adults and can cause other complications within children.Do not give your child any medication for diarrhea unless it has been prescribed by your doctor.

Nurse your baby often.,
Increase the amount of bottle feedings if you use formula.,
Feed them familiar semi-solid foods.,
Consult your doctor about an oral rehydration solution (ORS).,
Protect sensitive areas.",How to Care for a Child With Diarrhea3," One of the larger concerns of infants who have diarrhea is dehydration. Nursing your baby more often than usual will supply them with the fluids, calories, and nutrients they will need to get healthy and stay hydrated.Offer each breast to your baby for at least one to two minutes every ten to fifteen minutes until symptoms have reduced, or, if you aren’t breast feeding, use formula and a bottle., Increase the amount of bottle feedings to make up for lost nutrients and liquids in both newborns and infants. The amount of nutritional supplementation a baby might need depends on their size and age, for example, 1 fl oz. for newborns and 3 fl oz. for 12-month olds at each extra feeding.If you are uncertain of the extra amount your baby needs consult your healthcare professional.

, Introduce semi-solid foods back into your child’s diet if they have eaten them in the past. Foods like mashed bananas or potatoes are high in nutrients and can help resupply infants who have diarrhea.Cereal with milk is another way to introduce nutrients and liquids back into your baby’s diet., Ask your doctor or healthcare professional about an ORS if you are concerned your baby is not getting enough liquids from breastfeeding or formula. ORS is a special rehydration solution and is offered at many drug stores and pharmacies (most of them end in “lyte”).Most ORS do not give babies the amount of nutrients they need and are therefore not meant as a dietary replacement, simply a hydration supplement. Be sure to return to formula, breastfeeding, or semi-solid foods once you see improvement.

, Diaper rashes are common with babies who have diarrhea. Wash your baby’s bottom after each bowel movement, pat dry with a towel, and apply an ointment or zinc oxide paste to avoid skin irritation."
"
Offer lots of fluids.,
Feed your child small, frequent, bland meals.,
Introduce rehydration supplements and probiotics after 24 hours.",How to Care for a Child With Diarrhea4," Keeping enough extra fluids down is the most important during periods of diarrhea. Consuming lots of fluids will help your child keep up with the fluids they are losing during their bowel movements. A liquid only diet is recommended at the onset of moderate or severe diarrhea, with foods slowly being introduced back into their diet. Clear liquids are the most helpful. However, plain water does not replace lost minerals. Try to supplement liquids with an oral rehydration solution (ORS) to replenish lost minerals and electrolytes.If keeping liquids down is difficult encourage them to take small sips or suck on ice chips frequently to avoid dehydration.
Avoid refined sugars and juices. Avoid giving your child fruit juices, sodas, or sweetened sports drinks, as they are known to loosen stool.

, Feeding your child small and bland meals frequently will help them avoid any irritation from overeating as well as help soothe their stomachs. Feed your child about six small meals a day as opposed to three larger meals to keep a nutrient rich intake consistent.Try nutrient rich foods like bananas, sliced apples, pasta, white rice, or cooked vegetables.
Do not withhold food from your child. The higher and more frequent their nutrient rich diet, the shorter their symptoms will last.Avoid foods high in fat. Foods like cheese, cream, and even full-fat yogurt can cause bloating and increase pain and discomfort while a child has diarrhea.

, After 24 hours your child will begin to benefit from ORSs and probiotic supplements. ORSs replace lost electrolytes while probiotics replace many helpful bacteria, as well as help combat harmful diarrhea causing bacteria, in your child’s GI tract.Yogurt is the most common and widely available probiotic, but it’s high fat content might cause discomfort. Check your local health food store or pharmacy for alternative probiotic supplements, choose low-fat yogurt options with live active cultures, or ask your doctor for advice.

Remind them that no one is perfect.,
Remind your child of the value of working toward a goal.,
Help your child understand and set realistic expectations for themselves.,
Choose correction over criticism.,
Use their natural talents to teach them about hard work.,
Encourage them to play sports.,
Give them chores.",How to Build a Child's Self Esteem2," Kids, like adults, are surrounded by images of people at the top of their game, succeeding and accomplishing important goals every day. Your child may be frustrated when they realize they can’t emulate their favorite singer or baseball player. Teach your child that no one is born knowing how to do anything perfectly., You could use their childhood idol as an example. You could say, “Yes, LeBron James is incredibly talented. But he didn’t just get where he was by walking in off the street and trying out for the team. When he was your age, I bet he was shooting baskets at the park every day.”, If a child is disappointed that they’re not a star tennis player, they are likely not going to feel very good about themselves. Help your child understand that most goals take a long time to accomplish, and that they can take baby steps every day to work towards that goal.Encourage them to be proud of the effort they put in and the progress they make, rather than focusing on how far they are from achieving a goal.

, Building a child’s self-esteem does not mean avoiding discipline. Ignoring a child’s mistakes means that you are depriving them an opportunity to learn from wrongdoings and make other choices to change their behavior in the future. Provide teaching opportunities while disciplining your child, rather than limiting your discipline to criticism.Instead of saying, “Your dresser is a mess! All your clothes are just thrown in there and now they’re wrinkled! You can’t seem to keep anything neat!” you could say, “Have I shown you how to fold your clothes? Let me show you. It’s helpful to have a good way to organize your dresser, so you can find something easily. Your clothes won’t get so wrinkled, either.”
It’s okay to tell your child that you are upset with something they did. It’s important to teach a child that their behavior impacts other people. For example, you could say, “Mommy is very upset that you hit the baby. We never hit each other, because hitting hurts. What will you do the next time you are upset that the baby took your toy instead?”
Avoid name-calling or using loaded language when disciplining, like “You’re so clumsy!” or “Can’t you ever get this right?” If you find that you are losing your temper, give yourself a timeout.Establish clear boundaries and rules in your home. Indicate consequences for not following the rules, and follow through with them as necessary. Your child will feel confident in knowing what is expected of them., If your child shows a natural ability in sports, the arts, or another area, give the child plenty of opportunity to develop those talents.If they are naturally talented in these areas, they will see how some effort will easily pay dividends. Then you can show them how hard work can carry over into other aspects of their lives.A child’s talents and success will improve their self-esteem and make them feel more confident that they can accomplish goals in other areas.
If your child feels daunted by a difficult task, remind them of their previous successes. For example, “Do you remember your piano recital? You had a really difficult piece to play, but you practiced note by note and page by page until you mastered the piece. Because you worked so hard, you had an excellent performance. The same goes for your math homework. Look at this problem by problem and keep trying until you get it right.”

, Through athletics, kids learn that they can practice to improve their skills and achieve goals, building self-esteem. It also helps kids learn to handle setbacks and defeat.Enroll your child in a team sport to learn teamwork, sportsmanship, and make new friends.
Allow your child to participate in the decision as much as possible. If there are a variety of sports to choose from in your area, let your child pick which one they would like to try out.
If your child is not into team sports, find a solo athletic activity they could participate in, like martial arts or dance.
Sports also help your child stay physically fit and healthy, which further boosts self-esteem., Children as young as two can have basic chores around the house. Having chores helps children feel more valuable, building self-esteem, and it also helps build resiliency and self-discipline. Sometimes work must happen before fun.You may want to make a chore chart to help your child see their responsibilities and track their completion.
Assign chores according to age and ability. Give kids jobs that they will be able to complete with little to no adult supervision.

"
Avoid making comparisons.,
Pay attention to your child’s friends.,
Create a welcoming environment for other children.,
Spend time with your child.,
Give your child plenty of opportunities for play.",How to Build a Child's Self Esteem3," Don’t compare your child with their classmates, siblings, or even yourself as a child. Show your child that you value them as an individual, not by how they are better or worse than others.Don’t say, “Your older brother was such a better reader at your age,” or “Why can’t you be more social, like your friend Bianca?”
If your child is worried about how they measure up against their peers, reassure them that you love them no matter what, and that everyone has different strengths and weaknesses. You could say, “I know Ian is the best in your class at math, so it must be really frustrating to sit next to him sometimes. But I know how creative you are, and how much you enjoy writing stories.”

, Make sure your child is friends with other children who appreciate them and treat them with respect. You likely want your child to be surrounded by people who bring out the best in them and will help give them self-confidence, so monitor their friends and relationships closely.Notice your child’s behavior after playing with a friend. If they do not seem like they are in a good mood following a playdate, it may be helpful to keep a closer eye on the relationship to ensure good compatibility with the friend. Good friendships have positive influences on a child’s self-esteem, but bad friendships can be harmful.
If you are concerned about your child’s friend being a bad influence on your child or that the friendship is incompatible, do not hesitate to intervene. Kids often need a lot of help figuring out how to have healthy friendships.

, Welcome your child’s friends into your home. You will have a noisier home and more bags of pretzels to purchase, but you get the benefit of watching how your child interacts with their friends. If your child and their friends need extra assistance, you can step in and role model appropriate behavior.If children are able to develop their self-confidence in social situations at home, the more likely they will remain confident in new social situations away from your watchful eye.
If kids aren’t getting along or behaving inappropriately, you can step in and correct the behavior. You could say, “In our house, we don’t exclude friends. Everybody is playing the game,” or “How do you think you could solve this problem? Both of you want to play with the truck.”, If possible, schedule some one-on-one time with you and your child once a week. Have a special outing or set aside some time to just be together. This shows your child how much you value them and the time you spend together.Younger children may want to play, while older children may want to do a special activity. Ask your child what they might like to do. You could give them a choice, for example, “Would you rather go to the park or go for a bike ride together tomorrow?”

, Make sure your child has lots of opportunity for unstructured play during their day, both with and without others. Children learn through play, and through it they gain feelings of accomplishment and confidence.Play with your child. Take time to play with your child as often as you can. Let them choose the activity -- it will make them feel important and special to know that you are playing “their” special game.

Show them your love.,
Express your feelings.,
Cultivate a positive body image.,
Avoid name-calling or sarcasm.,
Model positive self-talk.",How to Build a Child's Self Esteem4," A child’s self-esteem begins with a parent or other trusted adult showing them love and acceptance. Laying this groundwork for them means that they can learn ways to love and accept themselves. Make it a point to frequently remind them that you love them.Give them lots of hugs and kisses.
Snuggle up together and read a book.
Be responsive when they are upset. It shows that you are paying attention to them and what they have to say matters. Hold them when they cry and help them feel safe and loved as they express difficult feelings., It’s okay to show your child that you are upset. Show how feelings can be expressed appropriately. Your child will see what those emotions look like, how you deal with anger or sadness, and it will increase your child’s emotional awareness.Seeing you upset can help your child learn ways to make you (and others) feel better, boosting their self-confidence.
If your child spots you crying, you could say, “Yes, I’m sad right now. My friend told me some bad news. Sometimes when I’m sad it helps me feel better to cry. Do you ever feel better after you cry?”

, Be proud of your body, and share your pride with your child. Avoid putting too much emphasis on the valuing the appearance of your or other people’s bodies. Role model body positivity so your child can know how to be proud of their body, as well.You could say, “What I like best about my body is that I have arms to give you a hug! I like that I can run and swim and hike with my body. I also like how my eyes look brown in some light and green in others. What do you like best about your body?”
Participate in a race or other athletic event so your child can see you using your body in a healthy way.
Avoid criticizing your appearance in front of your child. Don’t complain about your weight or something about your appearance you dislike.

, Being around children who are constantly demanding can be stressful, and a parent or other caregiver can feel overwhelmed by their needs. It can feel like an easy release to lash out or be sarcastic with your child, but diminishing their feelings only leads them to believe that their feelings are not important. Over the long term, this can harm their self-esteem.If you are feeling stressed out or frustrated, try to take a short break from the child, even if it is just going into another room for a moment to collect yourself.
Role model appropriate behavior by not using name-calling words to describe other people. For example, when someone cuts you off while driving, don’t yell, “You idiot!” with your child in the car.

Apologize to your child if necessary. It role models how to say you’re sorry, and it helps a child feel secure that a grown-up can admit when they are wrong. Saying you’re sorry shows that you have good enough self-esteem to face the consequences of your actions.You could say, “Miles, I’m sorry for not using kind words with you earlier. I was upset, and I should have taken a break rather than lash out at you. You didn’t do anything wrong, I did. I’m sorry I hurt your feelings.”

, When you feel proud that you have accomplished a goal, let your child know. Celebrate your successes with your child. Talk about how mistakes you’ve made don’t make you a failure.For example, if you get a promotion at work, share your news with your child. You could say, “I am so proud of myself today! I’ve been working on a project for a long time, and today my boss told me that I did such a great job on it, they know I am ready for more responsibility, so I am getting a higher position at work. I reached a goal, and I am feeling great!”
Role model what your child can say to themselves when they make a mistake, even a small one. For example, if you spill something in front of your child, you could say, “Oops, I just knocked over the water glass. I made a mistake, but I can fix it. I’ll get a towel. I screwed up, but it’s okay.”

Enroll the child in age-appropriate activities.",How to Calculate BMI for Children," While a light T-shirt or shorts are fine, heavy sweaters or jeans and shoes will prevent you from accurately measuring the child's height and weight. Any hair accessories that gather the child's hair on the top of their head also interfere with the height measurement.Bulky clothing can interfere with an accurate height measurement as well as weight. For example, if the child is wearing a hoodie they won't be able to stand straight against a wall.
You also might want to remove braids if they add height.
Your purpose is to get accurate measurements, not to humiliate the child or make them uncomfortable. Allow them to cover their body in a way that won't interfere with your results.;
, You can get an accurate measure of the child's height at home with a flat stick, a wall, and a measuring tape. Choose a location where the child can stand straight against the wall on an uncarpeted floor.Have the child stand straight with their head, shoulders, buttocks, and heels against the wall, looking straight ahead. The child's heels should be together, their shoulders flat. Keep in mind that depending on the child's body shape, they may not be able to touch the wall with all of those body parts.
Get a flat stick such as a ruler and place it against the wall at a right angle. Lower it until it firmly rests on the top of the child's head.
Make a light mark with a pencil at the spot where the bottom of your stick hits the wall. You may want to have the child duck out from under it once you have the stick in place so you can make your mark.
Using a metal tape measure, find the child's height by measuring the distance from the floor to the mark you made.

, To get an accurate measurement of your child's weight at home, place a digital scale on firm, even flooring such as tile or wood. Avoid scales that are spring-loaded for weighing children.Make sure the child isn't wearing shoes, or any heavy or bulky clothing that could add weight to the result.
Have the child stand straight up with both feet on the scale. You may want to have the child step off the scale and repeat the weighing twice more for the most accuracy, especially if the child is fidgety.
If you weigh the child more than once, simply average the results.

, As you measure the child, write down the results. To ensure the most accurate measurement, record the child's height to the nearest one-eighth of an inch (or 0.1 centimeter), and record the child's weight to the nearest decimal tenth.Take measurements in the system with which you are most comfortable. Although BMI is measured using the metric system, most calculators will convert measurements recorded in pounds and inches.

, While you can calculate the child's BMI manually, it typically is much easier to find a BMI calculator online. All you have to do is provide the child's age, biological sex, and measurements.You can find a reliable children's BMI calculator on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website here: https://nccd.cdc.gov/dnpabmi/Calculator.aspx. Many state government and health insurance agencies also have reliable calculators.
Ideally, you want to use a calculator on the website of a government agency or health care provider you trust. Don't use a calculator if the website is asking for your name, email address, or any other such information before giving you the results.
The calculator will provide you with the child's BMI; however, unlike an adult BMI calculation, the child's specific BMI doesn't tell you much. You have to consult a chart to determine what that number means based on the child's age and biological sex.
the manual calculation is as follows:

BMI = weight in pounds / x 703
BMI = weight in kilograms / , To properly interpret a child's BMI, you must use a growth chart that provides a BMI index based on the age of children and teenagers. The BMI is expressed as a percentile, which measures the child's BMI relative to other children in the U.S.The data used to create the official BMI charts was gathered through surveys conducted from 1963-1965 and 1988-94. Keep this in mind when interpreting the results.
You can easily find a BMI chart online. Use a government website or a trusted health care provider. There are two different charts – one for boys and one for girls.

, To use the BMI growth chart, first find the child's age along the bottom of the chart, then find the child's BMI along the side. Use a piece of paper or other straight edge to find the point on the chart that corresponds with the child's BMI and age.The CDC chart allows you to find the percentile for children, teenagers, and young adults from two years old to 20 years old.
Generally, the child is considered underweight if their BMI falls below the 5th percentile.
If the child's BMI is greater than the 5th percentile but below the 85th percentile, the child has a normal or healthy weight. You still should monitor the child's activities and eating, particularly if they fall at the upper end of that range.
If a child has a BMI above the 85th percentile, but below the 95th percentile, they are considered overweight, and a child with a BMI above the 95th percentile is obese. If the child falls in these ranges, they are at risk for significant health problems.

, In children, the BMI calculation is not considered a diagnostic tool. If your measurements indicate that the child is either overweight or underweight, take the child to a doctor for further testing and analysis.Occasionally, an older child with significant muscle mass may appear overweight on a BMI calculation when they are not. The doctor can help determine if the child is overweight or not.
Let the doctor know the results of your measurement and interpretation, and schedule an appointment. The doctor may want to take skinfold thickness measurements or others to confirm your interpretation.
If your interpretation shows that the child is significantly over- or underweight, the doctor may want to complete additional screenings to ensure the child does not have any health conditions as a result.
The doctor also will likely conduct a complete evaluation of the child's diet, activities, and family medical history.

, Whether the child is over- or underweight, a healthy, balanced diet will put the child on the right track to healthy weight management, as well as building habits the child can carry with them into adulthood.Provided the child isn't lactose-intolerant or allergic, make sure their diet includes two to three servings of low-fat milk and dairy products each day.
Offer your child plenty of fruits and vegetables.
Limit foods with saturated fats.
Serve reasonable portions — the size of the child's fist is a good ""rule of thumb"" to measure portion sizes generally.
Read ingredient labels carefully, particularly on processed or packaged foods. Avoid those that contain lots of chemicals and added sugars. Most processed foods should only be eaten occasionally.
Choose lean meats such as chicken and turkey, and limit consumption of red meat.
Avoid sodas and fruit juice drinks with added sugar. Instead, offer water, milk and natural fruit juices.

, If you have sweets and snacks in the house, the child will eat them. Replace candies, cookies, and salty snacks like chips and crackers with plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables.You don't have to spend a lot of money to give children healthy snacks. Buy healthy grains and nuts in bulk and mix them together to make your own trail mix. You also can buy whole vegetables and cut them yourself and divide them into snack-size portions.
Keep individually portioned bags of healthy snacks in the front of the fridge so anyone can grab them easily.
Keep in mind that children learn from parents and adults. Teaching the children in your home to eat healthy means the adults need to eat healthy too. The children will emulate the adults.

, If the child's BMI indicated they were underweight for their age, foods that have healthy fats and are full of protein will help the child build strong muscles and bones and encourage the child to gain weight.Talk to your child's doctor or a dietitian for specific dietary instructions for your child's needs.


Full-fat milk is better for underweight kids than low-fat or skim milk. Hummus and bean dips also provide a good mix of protein and healthy fat.
Whole wheat breads and pastas are good sources of carbohydrates for kids who are underweight.
Nuts, seeds, and avocados also are good sources for healthy fats that will help an underweight child gain weight.
To encourage an underweight child to eat, especially if they are a picky eater, make mealtime a pleasant experience. Don't rush the experience, and involve the child in meal preparation.

, Ideally, children should engage in at least one hour of moderately intense physical activity every day. Making physical activity a part of the daily routine for the entire family means children will be more likely to get involved.For example, you may start a daily habit of going for a walk as a family after dinner each evening.
When you think of moderately intense activity, focus on things that will make your child breathe harder and make their heart beat faster. They shouldn't be gasping for breath.
For example, walking the dog is an activity of moderate intensity. Running around playing tag is more of a vigorous-intensity activity.
If you have the means to do so, adopting a dog can be a great way to ensure everyone in the family leads a more active lifestyle. Walking the dog or playing with the dog outside all are moderate-intensity activities. Taking care of a pet also teaches a child discipline and responsibility.

, Between television, computers, tablets, and smartphones, many children live relatively sedentary lifestyles in which too much time is spent in front of a screen. Monitoring and rationing this time can help encourage the child to be more active.Pediatric health experts recommend limiting children's screen time to no more than two hours each day. This may be a difficult limit to maintain, however, if the child is older or has a homework assignment that requires using the internet.
When children are sitting for an extended period of time, whether they are working on homework or playing a video game, encourage them to stand and move around every 20 minutes or so, even if it's only to get up and do jumping jacks for five minutes.

, School and community sports and other activities keep the child active. The child also can learn important lessons about teamwork, discipline, and responsibility.Swimming and soccer are two activities that promote full-body fitness and overall strength.
Gymnastics or dance classes teach important life skills such as discipline and focus while also giving a child a good whole-body workout.
Some classes and sports can be relatively expensive compared to others, so make sure the activity fits in your budget before you introduce it to the child.

Call your doctor if your child’s symptoms get worse or do not improve.",How to Administer Eye Drops in Children," Be clear on what eye needs what medication and how many drops should be used. It helps to understand what medical condition the eye drops are treating. You will know what to expect when you apply the eye drops.There are many reasons why your child’s doctor could have prescribed the eye drops. Your child may have hay fever or allergies and you will have to treat your child’s itchy eyes off and on throughout the allergy season. Conjunctivitis is an infection of the tissue lining the inside of the eyelids and the sclera, the whites of the eye. You will apply the eye drops for a limited period of time, but you have to be careful not to spread the infection to your child’s other eye or to you. Glaucoma, increased pressure in your child’s eye, is a chronic disease and you likely will have to apply the eye drops for a long period of time.Your child will start to feel better sooner if her eye(s) receive the proper treatment. Your child may be having a problem with only one eye or both eyes. She may not have the same issue in both eyes. You may have to put only one medication in one eye and two medications in the other eye. It will be easier to focus on your child’s comfort when applying the eye drops if you are comfortable with exactly what you need to do.;
, Eye drops are a medication and they may cause side effects, including an allergic reaction, in your child. You want to recognize the signs so that you can stop the eye drops as soon as possible.The symptoms from an allergic reaction can have a lot of overlap with the symptoms from a side effect. Your child may experience redness, itching, burning, and blurry vision. These are symptoms you child may be having already from her illness; suspect a problem when your child’s symptoms get worse instead of better as time passes. Your doctor will tell you about the specific side effects the eye drops may cause. If you have any concerns about how your child is reacting to the eye drops, call your doctor. She can determine if your child needs a different type of medication., Tell her about all the prescription and over-the-counter medications your child is taking currently. Any medication can interact poorly with the eye drops. Your child’s drug allergies are important information for your child’s doctor to have when she is prescribing the eye drops., Your child may be old enough to wear contacts, but she may still need your help with the eye drops. Follow the doctor’s instructions.A general rule is that you can have your child remove her soft contacts and keep them out for 15 minutes after using preservative-free eye drops. She will have to wear her glasses for several days if the eye drops contain a preservative. If your child wears hard contacts, she can use eye drops with or without a preservative and still keep in her contacts., Every time you use the eye drops from a multi-dose bottle there is a risk of contamination. This could lead to an eye infection in your child.The preservatives used in eye drops discourage the growth of bacteria after the bottle is opened, but there is a limit. A multi-dose bottle should not be used longer than 4 weeks. Write the day and month you opened the bottle on the label to remind you to throw away the eye drops.
Preservatives are not used in the eye drops contained in single-use vials. These eye drops should be discarded immediately after use; do not save any of remaining fluid for the next dose., Read the medicine label to check the instructions and the expiration date. Shake the bottle and draw up the medication into the dropper to look for any changes the fluid’s appearance.The instructions on the label should be the same as what your child’s doctor told you during the office visit.
Do not use the eye drops if the expiration date has passed. Do not risk prolonging your child’s recovery time by using medication which may not be at full strength, or may be contaminated with harmful bacteria.
Shaking makes the medication uniform throughout the bottle. Discard the eye drops if you see any crystals forming or if the medication has changed colors. These changes suggest the eye drops have been contaminated. You should be able to examine the eye drops through the clear plastic of the single-dose vial., You want your hands to be free of germs when you are touching the bottle and applying the drops to your child’s eye(s). Contamination of the eye drops and unintentionally causing an infection in your child is always a concern.Use soap and warm water, and scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds (about the time it takes to sing ""Happy Birthday"" twice). Don't forget to get under your nails and between your fingers.

, When the time comes, it will be easier on both you and your child if the eye drops are applied without distractions for your child and with a lot of light for you to see.A room filled with her toys and with the TV or music blaring will make you child want to move around or look all over the place. Your child’s is already a little afraid. Do everything you can to help keep her calm.

, She may be more cooperative if she knows what to expect. Tell her the eye drops will make her feel better in the end, but that drops may make her eyes sting or make her vision blurry for a short time. Do some playacting to get her familiar with how you will apply the eye drops.Show your child the medicine bottle. Explain how you will take out a dropper. Make believe you are putting eye drops in your own eyes or your partner’s eyes first. Then, make believe you are doing it to your child. Praise everyone, especially your child, for staying calm.You can put a drop on the back of your child’s hand to let her see what it feels like. But, you want to be careful not to touch anything with the tip of the dropper., Once you have drawn up the medicine into the dropper, you want to free up your hand. However, you do not want the outside of the bottle to come in contact with dirt or dust.


Try not to put down the dropper or the opened single-use vial. The tips must be kept as clean as possible. You must be aware of not contaminating the tip of the dropper.

, It is best if your child has her head back and her eyes looking upward. You may have to try several positions before your child is settled and willing to stay still. It will be easier if you have a partner who can help keep your child calm.You can have your partner cradle the child while she is lying flat on her back. If your child is old enough, ask her to look upwards.Have your child in a seated position so that she can tilt her head back, making her eyes roll upwards, naturally. Your partner may need to hold a younger child’s head in this position, gently.If you are alone, sit on the floor with your child on your lap facing you. After you bend your knees, your thighs become a cradle. Ask your child to lean back or lie on her back so that her head is resting on your knees. Both of your hands are now free., Use a tissue, cotton ball, or cotton swab moistened with warm water. Wipe gently from near the nose towards the ear.An extra layer of pus or hardened eye discharge in and around the eye may prevent the eye drops from being absorbed by the superficial tissue layers of the eye., When the child is looking up, this action creates a sac where you can put the eye drops. Take care not to let the tip of the dropper touch anything, including your child’s eye, eyelashes or face.Use a two-handed approach. Use your non-dominant hand to move the eyelid and your dominant hand to apply the drops.
You can encourage your child to look up by having your partner hold up a toy or by placing a toy she likes high up on something and pointing it out to her.If your child will not look up, you may have to use your thumb on the lower eyelid and your pointer finger on the upper eyelid to open her eye., Encourage your child not to squeeze her eye shut. You are giving the eye drops time to bathe the eye and be absorbed by the superficial layers of the eye. While you wait, use a clean tissue to wipe away any medication that drained from your child’s eye.Excessive blinking or tight closing may force medicine out of her eye. However, there is absolutely no way to keep your child from blinking or squeezing if she is unable or unwilling to listen to you.Clear away any excess eye drops that have drained from your child’s eye.

, You want to press gently on the eye near your child’s nose. This step can prevent the medication from becoming systemic and going throughout your child’s entire body.Some children will not tolerate this pressure and it is best not to force the issue.
Your pressure is meant to block your child’s tear duct and to prevent the eye medication from becoming systemic. The medication in the eye drops is meant to treat your child’s eye only. It is absorbed by the thin layers covering your child’s eye. However, there is a tear duct located in the inside corner of her eye near her nose. Tears flow out of it to lubricate the eye. The eye drops can flow into the tear duct; the small blood vessels in there can carry the medication to other parts of the body., It is best to wait around five minutes. This prevents the second medication from washing away the first before it has time to be absorbed., Your child will enjoy the affection and hearing about how good and brave she is. This is positive reinforcement encourages her to remain calm and cooperative the next time you apply the eye drops., You can keep arms and legs from flying everywhere or stop your child from trying to run away from you. It will help if you have a partner who will help keep your child calm.This technique works best if your child is younger than 3 years old. However, you still can see if your slightly older and upset child will give it a try.Putting drops in open eyes works better, so try the above method first. If it does not work, proceed with this method.
Swaddling is known to calm infants.A small child will wiggle less and may find the light pressure comforting, especially if your partner is cuddling her as well.

, Use a tissue, cotton ball, or cotton swab moistened with warm water. Wipe gently from near the nose towards the ear.An extra layer of pus or hardened eye discharge in and around the eye may prevent the eye drops from being absorbed by the superficial tissue layers of the eye., It is likely your young or nervous, older child will not be very cooperative. You may have to try several positions. Wrapping your child in the blanket should not prevent you from getting your child into position.You can have your partner cradle the child while she is lying flat on her back.Have your child in a seated position with her head tilted back. Your partner may need to hold your child’s head in this position, gently.If you are alone, sit on the floor with your child on your lap facing you. After you bend your knees, your thighs become a cradle. Ask your child to lean back or lie on her back so that her head is resting on your knees. Both of your hands are now free., If you cannot use the open-eye method (or you have tried it and it didn't work), apply the drops to closed eyes. Use the corner closest to the nose. Make sure you do not touch your child’s eye, eyelashes, or face.This does not work as well as when you place the eye drops in your child’s lower eyelid, but there may not be another option when your child is young or very upset. However, you can try the open-eye method first. Some even very young children will respond well to it., Encourage very young children to open their eyes by showing them a favorite toy or a video on your phone. Normal blinking will let the eye drops flow into the eye. If she is too afraid to open her eye, rub her eyelids gently to bathe the eye. Use a clean tissue to wipe away any excess medication around the eye.Excessive blinking or tight closing may force medicine out of her eye. Help your child to follow your instructions as much as she can.Clean away any excess eye drops that have drained from your child’s eye.

The tip of the dropper should be cleaned with a cotton ball soaked in rubbing alcohol.If your child has an eye infection, you want to prevent the spread of infection throughout your household. Also, you do not want to get the medication, which is not supposed to be swallowed, in your mouth.
It's important to keep the dropper tip clean and free from germs for future use. Rinse off the dropper with water to make sure there is no residual alcohol when you use it again.

, This means keeping the bottle out of the reach of your child and other children in house. Ask your pharmacist if the bottle needs to be stored in a specific place like refrigerator or out of direct sunlight to help it maintain its effectiveness.Your child may be very curious about the medicine bottle once you use the eye drops on her. Remind her it is not to be touched.

, Don’t hesitate to call if you feel like something is just not right with your child. You know her best.Call your doctor immediately if your child’s eyelids becoming very red and swollen, she has increasing eye pain, her vision stays blurry for a long time, or if your child begins acting very sick. Most children will play even if they are not well; a child feeling too weak to move around is worrisome.Call your doctor if an infection has not cleared up after 3 days or if your child develops an earache."

Keep your child calm.,
Help your child get plenty of rest.,
Keep your child hydrated.,
Put your child in the bathroom with the shower running.,
Use Tylenol to reduce fever or pain.,
Keep your child out of school until their fever breaks.,
Wash your hands regularly.",How to Care for a Child With Croup1," It can be frustrating or even frightening when your airway is slightly obstructed by swelling, and children may become very upset. It’s important that you try to keep them calm, as getting too agitated can make breathing problems worse.Speak in a soothing voice and make sure your child does not see you get visibly upset about their breathing.
If your child’s breathing becomes too labored, seek immediate medical attention.;
, Like most illnesses, getting plenty of rest is an important part of recovering from croup. Because croup is caused by a viral infection, antibiotics cannot help with recovery.Croup and your child’s body fighting the illness will likely make them very tired. However, seek immediate medical attention if you child is difficult to arouse.
Make sure your child stays in bed as much as possible. Let them sleep as long as they need.

, Hydration is extremely important not only to your child’s ability to fight croup, but to your child’s health in general. Although congestion and swelling in the throat may make it difficult or painful to swallow fluids, encourage your child to drink often. Breast milk is find for infants, but older children may prefer things like popsicles as they can ease some inflammation. If your child becomes dehydrated, he or she may have to go to the hospital to receive IV fluids.
Dehydration can make the symptoms of croup like the cough and sore throat worse.

, Use hot water to steam up the bathroom. Warm, moist air can relax the vocal chords and provide your child with some relief from the symptoms of croup. The barking cough caused by croup is created by swelling of the vocal chords, so soothing them may help your child breath.Using a humidifier in your child’s room can also provide some relief while they are sleeping.
If your child’s breathing becomes strained or difficult, seek medical attention immediately.
Cold air can also also help your child breathe. You can open a window if it's cold out, or open the freezer door, and let the child breathe in the cold air for a few minutes.

, Many cold medicines are not suitable for young children, but you can treat fever with medications like acetaminophen. Acetaminophen is common in Tylenol as well as other medications.Make sure to buy medicine meant for your child’s age. Infant acetaminophen dosages are often different than those designed for older children which can lead to overdose risks.
There are two different strengths of acetaminophen sold over the counter, so it’s important to look for the right strength for your child based on age and weight requirements you can find on the package.
Alternatively, ibuprofen can be given to children over 6 months old.

, Croup can be caused by a number of different viruses, which can make it difficult to establish a timeline for recovery, but your child’s fever should usually break after about three days. Once the fever breaks, your child will no longer be contagious.If your child continues to have a fever after three days, you should see a doctor.
Croup can be extremely contagious, so prevent your child from interacting with other children until their fever breaks.

, Croup is a viral infection that can be transmitted in the same ways as the common cold or the flu. Washing your hands regularly can help prevent you and your child from transferring croup virus from your hands to your mouth or eyes.Wash your hands after coming into any contact with the bodily fluids of others, or after touching something a sick person has come into contact with.
Make sure you know how to wash your hands properly and teach your children the same.

Assess your symptoms.,
Figure out what type of sciatica you have.,
Get a correct diagnosis.",How to Treat Sciatica Naturally1," Technically, sciatica is a symptom and not a medical diagnosis, per se. People with sciatica experience one or more of the following:Lower back pain. If a person has lower back pain, it is usually not as severe as the leg pain.
Constant pain on one side of the buttock or leg. Rarely, the pain occurs on both sides.
Pain originating at the low back or at the buttock. The pain follows the path of the sciatic nerve. The nerve has several different paths. One path goes through the buttocks, down the back of the thigh and into the lower leg and the foot on the outside part. The other path goes down the side of the thigh, to the front of the lower leg and into the big toe area.
Pain that is typically described as sharp or searing, rather than dull.
The pain usually retreats when lying down or walking. Pain is worse when standing or sitting
There may be a ""pins-and-needles"" sensation. Numbness, weakness, or a prickling sensation down the leg is also commonly reported.;
, There are three different types of sciatic pain, depending on the specific nerve roots affected and if the pain is from the lumbar or the sacral spine. The sciatic nerve is formed from five different nerve roots, two from the lumbar spine (L4 and L5) and three from the sacral spine (S1, S2 and S3).


L4 nerve root sciatica: The pain usually affects the thigh with weakness in straightening the leg. There may be a diminished knee-jerk reflex (when the doctor uses a reflex hammer and taps right below the knee)
L5 nerve root sciatica: The pain and other symptoms extend to the big toe and ankle and may result in a “foot drop."" ""Foot drop"" is the weakening of the muscles that allow you to flex your ankles and toes while walking, resulting in the dropping of the front of the foot which results in the need to lift the knee higher while walking. There may also be pain pain or numbness on the top of the foot, particularly between the big and second toe.S1 nerve root sciatica: The pain and other symptoms affect only the outer part of the foot. The toes other than the big toe may be involved. Some people may experience weakness when they try to lift the heel or try to stand on on their tiptoes. The ankle-jerk reflex is often reduced.

, The correct diagnosis is critical in getting the correct treatment. Using any of the natural approaches can be combined with medical treatment for general sciatic pain, but the exercise therapy must be specifically designed for your specific needs. Make sure you make an appointment with your physician for any back pain right away. The most common causes of sciatica are:Herniated lumbar disc: A herniated, slipped or bulging disc can irritate the nerve because the inner core of the disc (the nucleus pulposus) bulges through the outer core and directly presses on the nerve root.
Degenerative Disc Disease: This is a disorder associated with aging and is the result of a weakening of the disc bones and surrounding tissues. This has inflammatory components — the inflammation irritates the nerve root.
Isthmic spondylolisthesis: This is often commonly called a “slipped disc” — one disc essentially is sliding over the lower disc.
Lumbar Spinal Stenosis: Stenosis is the narrowing of the spinal canal through which the spinal nerves travel. Lumbar spinal stenosis may also be considered to be associated with aging and may be due to a combination of herniated discs and degenerative disc disease.
Piriformis Syndrome: The piriformis muscle runs through the buttock and can pinch or irritate the sciatic nerve as the nerve runs under the muscle.
Sacroiliac (SI) Joint Dysfunction: The SI joint is located at the bottom of the spine and lies under the L5 nerve.

Observe situations that cause shyness in children.,
Avoid labeling children as shy.,
Develop a social development plan.,
Allow shy children to speak for themselves.,
Remind shy children of their positive qualities.,
Decrease social withdrawal using deliberate pairings.,
Assign seats in the classroom.,
Avoid embarrassing shy children.",How to Work With Shy Children," A child may feel unsafe in a social situation due to ridicule or mistreatment from others. Situations that require children to perform in front of or be evaluated by their peers can cause them to feel self-conscious. Social situations for which a child does not have the words, such as greeting an adult who is asking difficult questions, may also cause children to react with shyness.;
, Children can become deeply identified with the shy label and introduce themselves as such to others. This only reinforces the shy behavior, and may cause other people to leave the child alone for fear of causing discomfort.

, Sit down with shy children one-on-one on a regular basis to discuss social goals. Ask shy children about their feelings and the social activities that they would ideally like to engage in. Based on their responses, create a set of social goals that you can revisit together on a regular basis.


Encourage the development of interests. Find out the child's interests and create opportunities for strengthening skills. For example, a shy child who loves to play soccer can be encouraged to try out for the soccer team. While actively engaged in the sport, the child will naturally interact with team members and build friendships.

, While it's important to protect children from ridicule, if they are asked questions by their peers, other teachers or administrators, refrain from speaking on their behalf. Allow them to speak for themselves.

, This is particularly important for shy children who lack confidence in their skills and abilities. Ask them to create a list of their positive strengths and to read the list daily.

, Pair a shy child with one who is socially at ease for class projects. The more socially engaged child can help to draw out the shy child's personality and encourage the development of friendships with others.

, Place shy children near friendly and outgoing classmates.

, Some children are scared of social interaction and public humiliation because they have been ridiculed in the past. If students are required to make public presentations, pay special attention to the shy child and reduce anxiety by offering presentation guidance.


Speak to shy children privately. If the child has broken a rule or is exhibiting anxiety, refrain from calling attention to the child in a group environment. Pull the child aside after class to correct behaviors and offer guidance in a one-on-one conversation.

Have your doctor prescribe a steroid.,
Ask a doctor to administer epinephrine.,
Look for signs of dehydration.,
Recognize symptoms that indicate an emergency.,
Have a breathing tube inserted.",How to Care for a Child With Croup2," If your child’s croup does not pass on its own or is more severe, your doctor may choose to prescribe a steroid like Dexamethasone. These steroids will reduce inflammation and make breathing easier.Dexamethasone is commonly prescribed because of its long lasting effect (usually around 72 hours) but it can take up to six hours to produce relief.

, Epinephrine is used for croup when the child is having trouble breathing, or ""stridor,"" at rest. It is given in a breathing machine and is called ""vaponephrine."" It helps relax the muscles in the airway, which helps the child breathe. It is only given in a doctor's office, emergency room, or hospital. It works quickly, but may not last as long as a steroid. Therefore, a steroid is given along with this., Your child may require medical attention to help them recover from croup, but other related issues could also require medical assistance. Dehydration is a serious risk with croup, as it can make swallowing uncomfortable. Severe dehydration can limit your child’s ability to recover and create other health issues. Keep a look out for signs that your child is becoming dehydrated. If your child exhibits any of the following symptoms, seek medical attention:If your child has been going to the bathroom less frequently than usual, that is often a sign of dehydration. The color of your child’s urine will grow darker the more dehydrated they are. Most babies should urinate at least 6 times a day, and older children should urinate at least 3 times a day.
Dehydration can cause constipation, which can lead to abdominal cramping.
If the soft spot (or fontanel) on an infant’s head appears sunken, your infant may be severely dehydrated.
Rapid breathing and heartbeat are signs that your child is severely dehydrated.
Other symptoms include no tears while crying and a dry mouth.

, It is uncommon for a child to require hospitalization for croup, but it’s important that you are aware of the symptoms that may indicate that your child needs immediate medical care. Seek medical treatment if your child displays any of the following symptoms:Breathing becomes extremely labored or difficult
The child begins to drool or has difficulty swallowing, or the child has noisy breathing (called stridor) even when resting
Skin around the nose or mouth turns blueish or grey
Fever reaches 104 degrees Fahrenheit
The child is difficult to arouse or is very irritable.

, In extreme cases, it is sometimes necessary to insert a breathing tube in your child’s windpipe to help ensure they are able to breath until they begin to recover. This will require hospitalizing your child.This is usually used as a last resort and is fairly uncommon.
Breathing tubes are often used in conjunction with IV fluids to keep your child well hydrated.

Listen for high-pitched, barky coughing.,
Look for sinus congestion.,
Check for fever.",How to Care for a Child With Croup3," The most prominent symptom of croup is the high pitched, barking like sound children make when coughing. The cough often starts suddenly at night and is usually worse at night. Croup causes vocal chords to swell, which narrows the airway in a child’s throat and creates a high pitched sound when air passes through them.Croup also causes a hoarse voice for some children.


While croup is possible in adults, it is less likely as adult airways are larger and don’t often create a whistling sound.
Inhaling deeply can also cause the throat to whistle in children with croup. It may sound like wheezing, and is called stridor.

, Because croup often displays symptoms similar to that of the common cold, it can be easy to mistake them for one another. Croup often causes severe sinus congestion which can make breathing through the nose very difficult.Sinus congestion can also lead to post-nasal drip, which may cause nausea.
Sneezing, runny nose, and a sore throat are all also tied to congestion caused by croup.

, Croup will often cause the body’s temperature to increase slightly. Fever may not be among the first symptoms to present themselves and may take a few days to appear. If a child presents a fever, make sure to check it periodically to make sure it doesn’t get too high.If your child’s fever reaches 104 degrees Fahrenheit, seek immediate medical treatment.
Remember that your child must hydrate often to help their body regulate temperature.

Feed your kids vitamin C. You've probably heard that vitamin C can help the immune system.,
Boost vitamin E. Another important nutrient for fighting off sickness is vitamin E, as it is a strong antioxidant.,
Pay attention to zinc and iron.,
Incorporate selenium.,
Don't forget vitamin A.,
Make sure your child is eating vitamin B6.,
Look to folic acid.,
Create a balanced diet.",How to Boost Your Child's Immune System1," Of course, you know you can get this vitamin from places like oranges and other citrus, but it's in a wide variety of other foods, too. Try to include these healthy foods in your child's diet.Kale, collard greens, and spinach are excellent sources. Try putting them in a smoothie if your child won't eat them straight up.
You can also try bell peppers, strawberries, and papayas.
Vitamin C, as known as ascorbic acid, is a cofactor in a number of enzymatic reactions, is involved in the synthesis of collagen, and acts as an antioxidant. Linus Pauling, the famous Scientist and Author, popularized the use of Vitamin C as a holistic approach to boosting the immune system.;
, You'll find this vitamin in nuts, oils, meats, and eggs as well as green leafy vegetables like spinach and broccoli are also a good source., A deficiency in zinc also has an effect on the immune system, so incorporating it into your child's diet is important. Supplementing with zinc when you have a cold also decreases cold symptoms severity and duration. Meats are a good source of zinc. Oysters, in particular, are high in zinc, though if your child's palate isn't refined enough for oysters yet, you have plenty of other options.Meats, fortified cereals, crab, lobster, and baked beans are all rich in zinc.
Other sources that have some zinc include dairy products, cashews, chickpeas, almonds, and oatmeal.
These foods are also a great source of iron, another essential nutrient for your child's immune system. Broccoli, kale, and other dark, leafy greens also have iron. Pair vitamin C with iron to help your child’s body absorb it better.
Try zinc syrups and lozenges as well to supplement your zinc intake.

, Selenium can also play a vital role in keeping up the immune system.Beef, eggs, seafood, kidney, liver, and other types of meat are all good sources of selenium, so if your child is getting enough protein, they are likely getting enough selenium.Other good sources of selenium include cheese, oatmeal, brown rice, enriched pasta, spinach, baked beans, whole-wheat bread, and fortified cereal.
Selenium acts as an antioxidant and serves as cofactor in the production of thyroid hormone. Selenium is found to be in high concentration in immune system organs such as the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes. It is believed to have an immune function.
In one study it was found that CD4 positive T cells had a linear relationship with selenium. These results show that the progressive deprivation of serum selenium in HIV-infection is associated with loss of CD(4+)-cells and with increased levels of markers of disease progression and inflammatory response., You've probably heard that vitamin A plays a role in maintaining good eyesight. You may not know that it's also helpful in maintaining your child's immune system because it provides antioxidants.Carrots, butternut squash, pumpkin, cantaloupe, and sweet potatoes are good sources of vitamin A.
Supplementation with Vitamin A is recommended by the WHO because of its beneficial effects on immunity. Further, research has been conducted to focus on the immune dysfunctions that are a consequence of vitamin A deficiency and that predispose people to further infection.

, Vitamin B6 is essential to many systems in your body, as it is one key to the numerous chemical reactions that keep your body functioning. One of those essential functions is helping to maintain you and your child's immune system.Good news! Bananas are high in vitamin B6. Other good sources include tuna, chicken breast, baked potatoes, and chickpeas.

, Folic acid helps boost your child's immune system response.It's found in foods like beans, peas, and dark, leafy greens. Whole grains are also usually high in folic acid, as well as fortified foods like cereals., Basically, the key is to create a balanced diet for your child. Incorporate dairy, beans and peas, fruits and veggies, and protein sources. Don't forget to focus on whole grains as much as possible, such as whole-wheat bread, whole-wheat pasta, oatmeal, brown rice, quinoa, bulgar, and buckwheat."

Drink more water.,
See a chiropractor to treat your sciatica.,
Find an acupuncturist to treat your sciatica.,
Employ massage therapy to treat your sciatica.,
Use hot and cold therapy.Both hot and cold therapy are very useful approaches in treating sciatica.,
Consult an expert in herbal therapy.",How to Treat Sciatica Naturally2," Water is the great cleanser and helps minimize inflammation. While sciatica is not always directly associated with inflammation, pain is always associated with inflammation.


In addition, the tissues of the spine contain water and staying hydrated can help strengthen those structures.

, Chiropractors are specially trained, especially in spinal disorders. They are trained to manipulate and move the bones of the spine back into alignment and reduce the pressure on the sciatic nerve. Overall, chiropractic care has been shown to significantly improve symptoms of sciatica.Chiropractors are also trained to treat all the major causes of sciatic pain and, if necessary, can refer patients to other specialists such as surgeons.
Chiropractors also educate their patients regarding specific exercises designed to improve the spine and the bones, joints and muscles that may be impacted in sciatic pain.
Traction, or spinal decompression therapy involves stretching out the spine using a traction table or other device is often used to re-position a bulging disc and can be very helpful in treating sciatica.

, Acupuncture is part of Traditional Chinese Medicine and is based on the concept that meridians — energy channels — run throughout the body. The placement of needles at specific points along these meridians can relieve pain and treat a wide variety of conditions.The placement of the needles will depend on your specific needs and may be combined with Chinese medical massage (Tui na).
Acupuncture may also be combined with the use of Chinese herbs combinations to promote muscle relaxation and release of tension. This can provide direct pain relief.

, Therapeutic massage can improve circulation, relax the muscles, and lead to the increase in endorphin levels. Endorphins are the body’s natural opiates or pain relievers.The type of therapeutic massage usually used to treat sciatica is called trigger point myotherapy or just myotherapy. This therapy utilizes the concept of trigger points or specific areas on the muscles that can be “defused” by applying pressure for five to seven seconds to those points using the fingers, knuckles or elbows. When the pressure is removed, the trigger points become “deactivated."", Most natural practitioners will recommend first applying ice followed by heat for three cycles. This should be repeated at least four times a day.


Apply ice for about 10 minutes followed by heat for five minutes. This is one cycle.

, Herbal therapy can utilize muscle relaxants and anti-inflammatory agents. For best effects, these herbal remedies may need to be combined. For this, consult a naturopath or a medical herbalist. Some of the herbs that may be used are:


Equisetum or Horsetail, an ancient plant that is commonly used to flush out the kidneys. It contains high levels of minerals and can help strengthen the skeletal structure including the spine.
Jamaican dogwood, a muscle relaxant and a potent sedative. It should only be used on the advice of a knowledgeable healthcare professional. It is also an effective anti-inflammatory agent and pain reliever.
Curcuma longa or turmeric, which has long been used in Ayurvedic medicine and is an effective anti-inflammatory agent.
Willow bark, the basis of modern aspirin. The bark has been used for centuries to treat pain due to inflammation.
Holy Basil, which is similar to regular kitchen basil but has more effective anti-inflammatory properties.
Ginger root, which is another effective anti-inflammatory agent.
Nutmeg, which has been used as a muscle relaxant and pain reliever for centuries — and along with its value as a culinary spice, there has also been a lively trade in nutmeg for centuries!

Do yoga.,
Do breathing exercises.,
Do the ""flossing"" exercise.Here the aim is to release the trapped sciatic nerve for optimum functioning of the muscles of the lower back.,
Do the McKenzie's extension.,
Do flexion exercises.In lumbar canal stenosis, there is a narrowing of the spinal canal which causes compression on the exiting nerve.",How to Treat Sciatica Naturally3," Pain is an outward manifestation of the internally diseased body. A yogic approach focuses in correcting this root cause. The attitude of the mind will reflect in the attitude of the body as well. Hence, practicing yoga will correct the imbalance between mind and body and achieve greater pain relief thanks to a better mind-body sync.It is akin to cognitive behavioural therapy that aims at retraining the mind to curb its side effects that are ailing the physical form. If you're not already a yogi, give it a shot for your back!


""Shavasana"" or the ""corpse pose"" is helpful technique where a person lies down on his back on the floor and consciously relaxes each and every muscle of the body from head to foot. This helps in decreasing the muscle tension. It works wonders as a natural muscle relaxant and at the same time rejuvenates the mind.
If the pain is due to a herniated disc, the ""downward facing dog"" pose will benefit where the person assumes an inverted ""V"" pose with the hips facing the ceiling while the heels and hands are grounded. This gives a good hamstring stretch. Tightness in the hamstring muscles exerts pressure on the muscles of the lower back; exercises that stretch and toning the hamstring muscles will release the tension on the underlying sciatic nerve.
The ""half spinal twist pose"" and its variations of a sitting twist and a standing twist work on the tight piriformis muscle by giving it a stretch and release. This helps in reducing the inflammation around the piriformis and its underlying tendons which help to release the trapped sciatic nerve between the muscle and its tendons.

, Along with yoga, breath work through ""pranayam"" can also be practised. It involves breathing in and out in equal counts; an offshoot of this technique involves inhaling through one nostril and exhaling through the other. The focus of ""asanas"" should be aimed towards healthy breathwork, too.

, The flossing exercise helps to break away the scar tissue that has built around the affected part of the nerve, thereby allowing the nerve to glide freely over the muscles. It's called ""flossing"" because of the release of the junk around your nerve, kind of like your teeth!


Begin in a seated position. The flossing is then done by gradually straightening the affected leg from the knee and allowing the tension to build up in the muscle to the extent that it can be tolerated. You want to flex your foot back towards you, so that the calf it tightened as well. This will work best for the peripheral nerve entrapments.
Studies have shown a good amount of evidence for the efficacy of exercises in relieving chronic/sub acute lower back pain.Another single-blind, randomized, clinical, controlled study showed that exercises may help patients with chronic and severe sciatica pain and may stave off the normally prescribed surgery., If the cause of your pain is a herniated disc, then doing the McKenzie’s extension exercises will provide great relief. The focus of these exercises is to centralize pain from the peripheral muscles and buttocks to the lower back.This exercise is begins by lying on your stomach with arms lying along your side and your head turned to the side. Then move your arms up towards your head while your raise your chest. You will plant your elbows alongside your chest, and continue to raise your chest, like doing a push-up on the floor.
A variation of this would be to put a pillow under your chest and gradually increase the number of pillows to two or three, whichever is comfortable, and stay in this position until it can be tolerated comfortably.

, In this case, relief is best obtained by doing flexion exercises. The diameter of the spinal canal increases by bending forwards or flexing. Thus, this exercise releases the pressure of the impinged nerve and gives relief.


This exercise can be done by lying on your back on the floor or mat and bringing the arms and knees close to the chest.
The other method to flex the spine would be to go down on the hands and knees and then come back on the heels and rest the buttocks on the heels.
All these exercises should be done under the supervision of a trained physical therapist to begin with, and once learnt can be practised at home. Doing these exercises regularly will prevent recurrence of symptoms.
If you find that your leg pain or numbness increases while doing this, stop and see your physician immediately.

Ensure your child is breathing clean air.,
Make sure your child is sleeping enough.,
Consider the risks and benefits of daycare.",How to Boost Your Child's Immune System2," Smoking can compromise your immune system, and being around secondhand smoke can affect your child's immune system. If you or someone in your family smokes, make sure to keep the smoke out of your home., Your child needs sleep to keep their immune system functioning properly. Without enough sleep, your child is more likely to get sick more readily.The amount of sleep a child needs varies by age, so make sure your child is getting enough sleep for their age group.Newborns should get 14 to 17 hours, while infants need 12 to 15 hours. Toddlers do best on 11 to 14 hours, while preschoolers do just fine on 10 to 13 hours. Once your child reaches age 6, 9 to 11 hours is enough, until they are about 14. At 14, they do just fine on 8 to 10 hours. Over 17, 7 to 9 hours is fine, just like adults., Daycare is a breeding ground for diseases and germs. Your child is more likely to catch viruses and other infections if they attend daycare than if they stay home. Nonetheless, being in daycare can help boost your child's immune system for the long run, as it helps your child's body learn how to fight off a variety of diseases."

Get vaccinated while pregnant.,
Vaccinate your child.,
Take your child for a yearly flu vaccination.,
Skip antibiotics when possible.,
Encourage exercising.",How to Boost Your Child's Immune System3," When you get vaccinated around your pregnancy, you help protect your child from those diseases, if you're not already up-to-date and immune. The CDC recommends that you should have some vaccines directly before your pregnancy (about a month), including the MMR vaccine (measles, mumps, and rubella). During your pregnancy, you should have the Tdap vaccine (for whooping cough).You can also take the flu vaccine as needed. If you missed other vaccinations while pregnant, ask your doctor about taking them after you give birth to your child. You'll pass it to your child through your breast milk.
A blood test will show if you need to have these vaccinations, as your doctor will be able to tell if you're already immune.

, Getting your child the regular vaccinations is one sure way to boost their immune system. A vaccination basically teaches your child's immune system how to fight certain infections, making it more robust.Talk to your doctor about an appropriate vaccination schedule for your child. Generally, kids are vaccinated at birth, two months, four months, six months, and 12 to 18 months. Kids will also need boosts before starting school.

, Sometimes, the flu vaccine is overlooked for its benefits. It can boost your child's ability to fight against certain flu strains, keeping your child healthier through the fall and winter. Your child's flu vaccine should be covered by insurance if you have it., You want your child to get better as quickly as possible when they are sick. However, not every illness requires or responds to antibiotics. Viruses, for instance, do not respond to antibiotics. The problem is, when your child takes antibiotics too often, it leads to stronger bacteria that are harder to kill. In addition, it kills off the good bacteria that help keep your child's body in balance.Your child should take antibiotics if they have a more serious bacterial infection (rather than mild). However, your child's doctor should make the call about whether antibiotics are necessary.
If your child has an earache or sore throat, these are not times to skip on an antibiotic. You need to see a physician and they will tell you if your child’s illness requires an antibiotic or not.

, Exercising can help boost children's and adults' immune systems alike.It increases the antibodies in the body, part of your system's way of fighting off disease.Kids should aim for an hour of exercise and play each day.


Kids should work on aerobic exercises, strength-training exercises, and bone-strengthening exercises. Aerobic exercises should make up the bulk of your child's exercising and can include things like running, walking quickly, playing sports, or swimming. Pushups, sit-ups, and gymnastics can help strengthen muscles, while bone-strengthening exercises include jumping rope and running.According to the President's Council on Fitness, Sports and Nutrition children should get 60 minutes of exercise a day. The exercise should be in the form of moderate to vigorous intensity aerobic exercise. Further, they should get strengthening activities at least three days a week."

Encourage frequent hand washing.,
Teach them to not to touch their eyes or mouth.,
Let them know when it's not okay to share.",How to Boost Your Child's Immune System4," One way to stop the spread of germs is to encourage your child to wash their hands frequently. Tell your child that they should wash their hands after activities like playing on the playground, going to the bathroom, and sneezing or coughing into their hands. Also, encourage them to wash their hands before handling food or eating. Model the same behavior for your child.Show your child how to use soap to thoroughly scrub up their hands. If they aren't washing long enough, get them to sing ""Happy Birthday,"" which is about the right length of time.

, When your child picks up germs from surfaces and other kids, they are often transferred into the body through the mouth or eyes. By teaching your kids to keep their hands away from these areas, you can help keep them from getting sick., While you want your kids to be giving and kind, you don't want them to share germs. One way you can help limit exposure is to make sure your kids aren't sharing food, cups, utensils, or water bottles that have been in their mouths. Germs can be passed easily this way."
"
Take pain medications.,
Consider steroid injections.,
Get spinal surgery if your sciatica is severe and has not responded to other treatments.",How to Treat Sciatica Naturally4," Pain medications, such as OTC non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen, naproxen, or COX-2 inhibitors, can help with sciatica pain. Your doctor may write a prescription for stronger NSAIDs if the pain is more severe.

, Steroid injections are placed directly into the epidural space of the spinal cord. The steroids reduce inflammation.


Oral steroids are also used to reduce inflammation.

, Spinal surgery is generally reserved for severe pain that lasts for more than four to six weeks or persistent pain despite medication or other treatments. This is pain that is severely limiting the patient’s life.Obviously, you will need to consult with a doctor to move toward this treatment of your sciatica.

"
Do not ignore your child's fear.,
Do not make fun of your child’s fears.,
Give the right message.",How to Help Your Child Overcome Fears2," If your child is scared of a particular relative, caregiver or a neighbour, do not ignore it or force the child to be with them. Instead, speak to your child about it and let him explain what makes that person fearful. Even if you think that the person is unlikely to cause any trouble to the child, do give your child some benefit of doubt.

, Making fun of a child’s fear will not make him less fearful; instead, it will increase his anxiety and at the same time lower his self-esteem. This can lead to more intense problems like developing phobias (an advanced state of fear). The child can overcome his/her fear only with your love and care. Neglect will only develop negative feelings in the child.

, Don’t send wrong messages to your child by saying things like: “Stop being a baby”, “Don’t be scared”, “See, your friend is not scared”, etc. This makes the child believe that it is wrong to be scared and he/she will stop sharing his fears with you. Tell your child that it's all right to be afraid. Also, explain him that it is okay to share his fear and to ask for help.

"
"
Do not force your child to do something that he or she is scared of.,
Model being brave.,
Keep children away from fearful characters.,
Offer to walk with the child through the house/room/area that the child associates fear with.,
Use humor to defray the fear.,
Make sure your child knows he or she is loved.",How to Help Your Child Overcome Fears3," Forcing the child is likely to worsen his or her fear. Just think how you would react if you were forced to hold a scary bug in your hand or to go bungee jumping. Allow your child to take his or her own time to adjust and overcome the fears. Support your child with all the love and care that you can.

, Your child will always follow your actions. If you freak out at something, probably the child will also react in the same way. Your child believes if something or someone is safe for you, it is safe for him too. Also, don’t make your child scared by freaking out every time you feel that the child might hurt himself. Instead, just walk to him to assist him and explain what he should and shouldn't do for ensuring safety, in a calm way.

, A young child cannot differentiate between reality and fantasy. Children do get scared of the fantasy characters that they watch on TV. Turn off the scary TV shows. Also, let your child understand the difference between fantasy and reality by explaining to him how movies and cartoons are made in a simple manner.

, Open all the doors, look under the bed; use light to show that nothing is there. If your child is frightened by sounds or shadowy images, discuss what could actually be causing these sounds in a non-judgmental way.

, Have the child describe to you the monster that he or she is imagining. Add silly things to that image, such as checkered underwear or a silly hat. Maybe you could pretend that this imaginary monster is asking to use the child's bathroom because he really, really has to go, or he is sad because he doesn't have many friends. Play on your child's empathy for it. This will humanize the image of the monster and make him more likeable and less scary.

Fill a spray bottle with a mixture of water and some lavender or other aromatic oil. Stick a big label on it that says ""Monster Spray"" and tell your child that this will keep all monsters away because, not only are they afraid of water, but the sweet smell makes their nose itch. Spray a few spritzes into the air and assure your child that any monster would have to be crazy to come in here now.
Put a dish by the door and fill it with a few candies, then tell your child that candy is a monster's favorite thing in the world but once they eat them they become soft and sweet, like puppy dogs.
Take a ball of yarn and lay a ""monster barrier"" around your child's bed. Tell your child that monsters can't cross that sort of barrier and if they try, they will go poof and are zapped away like magic.

, Make it clear that you will always be there to protect your child.

Ask your doctor about selegiline and rasagiline.,
Try entacapone.,
Consider benztropine or trihexyphenidyl.,
Try amantadine.",How to Treat Parkinson's Disease1," This medication is taken in pill form to produce dopamine in the brain. Dopamine can alleviate problems with movement. It is the most effective medication for treating Parkinson's disease..

Side effects include low blood pressure and involuntary movements.;
, These are pill forms of dopamine agonists. They don't produce dopamine, but make the body acts as if dopamine were present. Apomorphine is an injectable dopaminergic agonist that provides fast relief; however, its effects don't last long.Side effects of dopamine agonists include sleepiness, hallucinations, low blood pressure, and water retention. It can also cause serious compulsive behaviors.

, These medications inhibit monoamine oxidase B (MAO B) from breaking down dopamine. It may be taken with levodopa. Selegiline should be use cautiously in elderly patients.Patients don't commonly experience negative side effects, such as headache, confusion, hallucinations, and dizziness.

, This is a catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor that may be taken with levodopa to prolong its effect. Tolcapone is another COMT inhibitor, but it has been known to cause liver damage and failure.

COMT inhibitors may intensify the involuntary movements that are a common side effect of levodopa as well as cause confusion, nausea, and hallucinations.

, These medications are anticholinergics, which are used to specifically control tremors. They can be very helpful in treating Parkinson’s symptoms.

Unfortunately, confusion, impaired memory, dry mouth and eyes, constipation, and impaired urination can be bothersome side effects. Talk to your doctor about these and what is normal for you.

, This is a glutamate (NMDA) blocking drug that can control symptoms in early states of Parkinson's disease to lessen involuntary movements caused by levodopa. Ask your doctor if this medication could help alleviate some of your Parkinson’s symptoms.Purple mottling of the skin (livedo reticularis) can be a side effect, along with hallucinations.

Consult your doctor.,
Participate in physical therapy.,
Consider deep brain stimulation to control tremors and other symptoms.,
Consult a speech-language specialist.",How to Treat Parkinson's Disease2," In order to treat your Parkinson’s disease, you’ll need to follow your doctor’s orders and discuss any changes in your treatment plan with your doctor. Your doctor has the knowledge and experience to help make the right decisions for how to treat your condition.Your doctor will probably prescribe a combination of medications, lifestyle changes, and symptom alleviators.
Your doctor will also be able to refer you to a variety of specialists that you may need in the future.

, Since Parkinson’s often affects mobility and muscle deterioration, it can be helpful to begin working with a physical therapist early on. This will help you improve mobility, muscle tone, range of motion, balance, and gait.A physical therapist will be able to recommend a course of treatment that is tailored to your specific needs.

, This is a particularly viable option if you have advanced Parkinson's disease or have inconsistent results from drug treatment. Deep brain stimulation requires surgically implanting electrodes into the parts of your brain that control movement. A wire is placed under your skin from the electrodes to a device under the skin in your chest area. The device controls the amount of stimulation delivered by the electrodes.With the help of deep brain stimulation, many Parkinson’s patients are able to minimize their symptoms and decrease their medication.

, A major side effect of Parkinson’s disease is a decrease in verbal skills. If you notice that other people often have trouble understanding you, it might be time to enlist the help of a professional speech therapist. In addition to verbal problems, a speech-language pathologist will be able to help you with any difficulties you may be having with swallowing.A treatment that has been proven particularly effective for Parkinson’s is the Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT LOUD)."

Monitor your stress levels.",How to Treat Parkinson's Disease3," This will help you maintain muscle tone. It won't reverse Parkinson's disease, but it can slow the progression. Focus on low-impact exercises like walking or water aerobics if you have trouble with mobility. Remaining active will help prevent muscle degeneration and will help you stay healthier for longer.Remember to always talk to your doctor before making any changes to your exercise routine.

, Those who suffer with Parkinson’s disease may need to alter their diet to accommodate the changes in their body. Discuss any side effects with your doctor, or get a referral for a nutritionist.You may want to start eating high-fiber foods to help with constipation problems. This includes foods like whole wheat bread or pasta, brown rice, fruits, nuts, and certain vegetables.
Problems with swallowing caused by Parkinson’s may require smaller bites, including more liquid diet options, or avoiding hard, brittle foods.
Decreased mobility and inactivity could cause potential weight gain. In this case, you may need to consult your doctor and/or a nutritionist to maintain a healthy weight.

, If you have Parkinson’s disease, you may need to make adjustments to your home to make it more livable for you. This could include things like purchasing a shower stool, adding grip bars in the bathroom (shower and/or toilet area), moving oft-used items to lower cabinets or shelves, or moving your bedroom downstairs.

An occupational therapist will be able to discuss these potential changes and walk you through the process.

, If your Parkinson’s progresses, you may need assistance handling some everyday activities like bathing, cooking, or cleaning. Your health insurance may cover some of these problems – like providing a person who comes over to help you bathe. But other services may need to be covered by friends and loved ones.There may also be programs available in your area that offer services you could use – like delivering meals to your home or helping you with financial and legal issues.
You may also find support groups with other Parkinson’s patients who can support your emotionally as you adjust to your new situation.

, High stress levels can increase Parkinson’s symptoms and speed up the progression of the disease. Try to maintain low levels of stress in your life in order to manage your Parkinson’s symptoms.If you want to lower your stress levels, you might want to try meditation, calming visualization, deep breathing, or even getting a pet.
Some people also respond well to music therapy as a means of decreasing stress.

Consider epilepsy.,
Learn what a seizure looks like.,
Understand that additional symptoms can include changes in skin sensation; twitching of a limb; vision changes, or rarely, hallucinations; loss of muscle control and muscle tension or tightening, causing the head, legs, body and arms to twist or twitch.

",How to Understand the Causes of Seizures," No underlying cause for seizures can be found in about 70 percent of cases. Another 30 percent of seizures are found to be from underlying epilepsy.;
, At the time a person suffers a stroke, for example, brain tissue surrounding the site of the brain bleed becomes abnormally excited. The same phenomenon develops when the person experiences a head injury.

, A temporary medical condition may lead to a seizure that happens only once. After the infant has received medical care and the condition has healed, he or she may not experience further seizure activity.

, The patient may have a family history of seizures, but may not, himself or herself, receive a diagnosis of epilepsy. Idiopathic seizures generally begin sometime between the ages of 5 and 20, but they can start at any time in the person's life.

, These can include brain tumors or lesions, such as bleeding, Phenylketonuria (PKU), stroke, transient ischemic attack or traumatic brain injury. Other seizure causes include brain infections such as abscess, encephalitis, meningitis, AIDS or syphilis.


Add more causes of seizures to your list, including: suddenly stopping drinking alcohol after drinking heavily for a long period; the person stops taking some medications (morphine, barbiturates or sleeping pills) after taking them for a long period; illnesses that cause brain deterioration; use of illicit or recreational drugs.
Study more seizure causes: dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease; liver or kidney failure, congenital brain defects; low sodium in the blood; low blood sugar; brain injuries that take place during labor.

, This is a congenital condition passed from parents to children and it affects nerve cells inside the brain, causing seizures. Some of these seizures are small, or petit mal, and some are large seizures, called grand mal. The person diagnosed with epilepsy has the condition lifelong and is at risk of experiencing seizures at any time.

, The person experiences a change in consciousness, meaning he or she won't remember what happened right before, during or right after a seizure. He or she may experience unexplainable emotions or taste a bitter flavor in his or her mouth.

Get your eyes checked.",How to Stop Getting Vertigo1," Visit your doctor to determine what is causing your vertigo. Vertigo is often related to two inner ear disorders known as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and Méniére's disease, but it could be a number of other conditions. Don't try to treat yourself for BPPV or Méniére's disease unless you've received a diagnosis and are certain that's what you have. Treatments for these disorders won't work to mitigate vertigo caused by other underlying issues. Here are a few other conditions that may lead to vertigo:Other inner ear disorders such as vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis
Head injuries and ear injuries
Migraine headaches
Decreased blood flow in the arteries that supply blood to the vein
Brain tumors
Stroke
Complications from drinking alcohol or taking medications;
, You'll need to figure out which ear is causing the problem, since the treatment you get may be different depending on which side is affecting you.


Pay attention to when you get dizzy. If you get dizzy when you roll to the right in bed, then it's probably your right ear that's affecting you.If you can't figure out which ear is causing the problem, ask your doctor.

, The Epley maneuver is a series of head movements that return the crystals that have come loose in your inner ear to the right place.The Epley maneuver can be easily performed by a physician without any special equipment. The Epley maneuver is an effective treatment for BPPV when it is performed properly.


Once your doctor shows you how to do the Epley maneuver, you can do it on your own at home next time you get vertigo. You may watch videos online to learn the different head adjustments to make.
Stabilize your neck for the 48 hours after doing the Epley maneuver.
Don't do the Epley maneuver if you aren't sure you have BPPV. If you have an underlying problem, you need to make sure you get the proper treatment., You can relieve symptoms and decrease the frequency of episodes of vertigo caused by this inner ear disorder by controlling your body's fluid retention. Try the following methods for doing so:


Limit salt consumption and foods with MSG.
Consider taking diuretic medication that reduces fluid retention.
Look into taking betahistine hydrochloride. This drug is said to reduce the frequency and severity of vertigo attacks by raising blood flow around the inner ear.It is primarily used in the treatment of Méniére's disease. Ask your doctor for more information about this treatment.

, If nonsurgical treatments are ineffective, there are surgical procedures that can cure vertigo caused by certain inner ear disorders.If your vertigo is caused by one of the following disorders, it can be cured with surgery:


BPPV
Ménière's disease
Vestibular neuronitis
Chronic labyrinthitis

, The most common type of vertigo, BPPV, happens when tiny calcium carbonate crystals in one part of your inner ear float to another part of your inner ear, disrupting your equilibrium and triggering the uncomfortable dizzy sensation of vertigo. The crystals can get dislodged during the night when you move your head in certain ways, and sleeping with your head slightly elevated will prevent this from happening as often.Sleep on your back instead of your side or stomach, and prop your head up with an extra pillow while you're sleeping.

, If you have BPPV, motions like this can dislodge the crystals in your inner ear and lead to vertigo.It can help to become more aware of your body movements and take measures to avoid bending over.


If you need to pick something up, bend your knees to lower yourself down instead of bending at the waist.
Don't do exercises that require being upside down or bending forward.

, The movement you use when you extend your neck, as when you're reaching for something, can cause the crystals to get dislodged, too. Try not to stretch your neck upward. When you do stretch your neck, move your head slowly; don't let your head bob around.

, Any jerky movements you make that cause your head to move about can lead to vertigo, especially when you're particularly prone to getting it. Avoid activities that put you in a situation in which your head might move around quickly.


Don't ride roller coasters or other rides that cause your head to whip back and forth.
Avoid sports that put you at risk of sudden head movements. Stick to swimming, walking and jogging instead of high-impact sports.

, This cure-all superfood treats numerous ailments, including some instances of vertigo.Take ginger capsule supplements on a daily basis, or eat some of the food by itself. Ginger is a common successful treatment for many vertigo-sufferers.

, Smoking tobacco has been shown to decrease the efficacy of treatments for vertigo.Cut back on smoking and using other tobacco products so you'll have fewer episodes of vertigo as well as less severe symptoms.

, Dizziness spells can be much worse with poor eyesight.Make sure your eyes are in the clear with regular checkups at your optometrist. Make sure that you have working glasses or contacts in an accurate prescription as well.

Talk to your doctor about chiropractic care.,
Locate a chiropractor.,
Have an initial consultation.,
Visit your chiropractor regularly.,
Recognize effectiveness of chiropractic care for MS.,
Watch for side effects of chiropractic care.",How to Use Chiropractic Care for MS," If you have MS and want to try chiropractic care to help manage your symptoms, speak to your doctor.Chiropractic care can complement traditional medical treatment programs for the disease, but should not be a substitute for it.Your doctor can advise you if you are healthy enough to use chiropractic care as well as coordinate treatment with your chiropractor for the most effective management of your MS.


Be aware that your doctor may recommend foregoing chiropractic care if you have certain medical conditions in addition to your MS. Chiropractic manipulations are not safe if you have spinal-bone fractures or dislocations, spine trauma, severe disk herniations, osteoporosis, arthritis, or diabetes. You also shouldn’t have spinal manipulations if you take blood thinners.;
, Ask your doctor to suggest a chiropractor who can help manage your MS symptoms. If you are in an MS support group, you can also ask fellow participants to recommend a good chiropractor. You can also find a local chiropractor at https://www.acatoday.org/Find-a-Doctor. Some of the qualities you may want to consider in a chiropractor include:Is familiar with your symptoms
Can help you make changes to your activity level
Welcomes chiropractic care as a complementary treatment for your MS

, If you have find a chiropractor who you like or whom your doctor recommends, schedule an initial visit at the office. This will give you a chance to get to know the doctor, review your MS symptoms, and undergo any testing before chiropractic manipulations begin.Bring any relevant medical records with you. These can inform your chiropractor about your overall treatment and how to best treat your symptoms.
Tell the chiropractor about your specific symptoms and any areas that cause you any pain and discomfort, such as your lower back. Answer any questions the chiropractor may have for you.
Undergo diagnostic testing, such as X-rays, which can help your chiropractor locate specific areas on your spine that may require manipulation.

, During your initial visit, your chiropractor will assess your MS symptoms and discuss chiropractic treatment options with you. This usually consists of precise adjustments to the vertebral column to return it to proper alignment. Your chiropractor will adjust your spine over a series of regular appointments.Let your doctor know any areas that need attention during each visit. The doctor will make a record of these before making adjustments. This information can help your chiropractor target adjustments to best manage your symptoms. It can also help track your progress.
Use chiropractic care as long as you have MS symptoms. Discuss discontinuing chiropractic care with your doctor if you go into remission.

, Seeing a chiropractor regularly may help manage your symptoms of MS and even relieve pain and discomfort. When practiced by a licensed chiropractor, this complementary care is also safe. However, you should not expect that chiropractic care can change or slow the progression of your MS.Recognize that chiropractic care may be especially beneficial for lower back pain. It can also help realign the pelvis and spine so that your body is balanced and your muscles can work better.Be aware that there is some controversy about what chiropractic care can do for MS. Some chiropractors believe that correcting upper neck injuries may reverse the progress of MS.However, others, including the National MS Society, maintain that chiropractic care cannot alter or slow the disease’s progression. If you have any questions about this, speak to both your doctor and chiropractor., Spinal manipulations can help relieve symptoms of MS, including discomfort and muscle weakness. You may also experience some side effects including achy muscles, headaches, and fatigue. Let your chiropractor know if you are experiencing any side effects, pain, discomfort, or unusual sensations following an adjustment.Be aware that while chiropractic care is generally safe, in rare cases it can cause strokes from the manipulation of the neck, fracture bones, injure disks, and harm the nerves of the lower spine.

Monitor your diet.,
Develop an exercise program.",How to Stop Getting Vertigo2," Too much salt can aggravate some types of vertigo, endolymphatic hydrops or migraine-associated vertigo.Limit your alcohol consumption and avoid smoking. Drink lots of water and be sure to include food rich in vitamins and minerals in your diet.


Caffeine probably does not have an effect on tinnitus (ear-ringing sometimes associated with vertigo). It's usually best to stick to your current caffeine intake instead of making a dramatic change., Many sufferers of vertigo symptoms have found that exercise is helpful in treating vertigo.Start slowly, and begin by moving your head slowly from side to side while standing. Easy stretches and walking also often help alleviate the symptoms of vertigo. You can also ask a healthcare professional for more specific exercises based on your specific type of vertigo. Using the wrong type of exercise can backfire, so it's best not to try them without a diagnosis."

Don't expect magnets to cure vertigo.,
Don't use swimmer's ear medication to treat vertigo.",How to Stop Getting Vertigo3," Home remedies involving magnets are based on fads, not science. That may change in future, as early research has found that patients with vertigo react differently to the strong magnets in an MRI machine.This has not been developed into a treatment, or even a solid idea for one.

, Swimmer's ear is a type of infection, usually treated with an antibiotic. Only take swimmer's ear medication if you have multiple symptoms of swimmer's ear, not just vertigo.

Sit or lie down.,
Drink water.,
Have something to eat.,
Focus on a particular spot.,
Breathe deeply.,
Avoid bright lights.,
Perform the Epley maneuver.The Epley maneuver is a head and neck tilting exercise that can be used to treat symptoms of vertigo.",How to Stop Dizziness1," Dizziness or light-headedness usually hits when you are standing up or moving around. At the first signs of dizziness or light-headedness, sit or lie down immediately. This will usually help to relieve the spinning sensation and is safer in the event that you fall.


If you're sitting down, try putting your head between your legs. This increases the blood flow to your brain. Lying down will achieve the same result.Remain seated or lying down for 1-2 minutes, or until the dizziness has passed.;
, Dizziness is often the result of dehydration. Dehydration can be caused by not drinking enough water generally or failing to rehydrate during and after exercise. It can also be an issue when you're suffering from an illness that causes vomiting, diarrhea or fever, which can cause you to lose a lot of fluid. Once the worst of the dizziness has passed, you should drink more water and other fluids.If you're finding it difficult to drink a lot of water, try drinking other fluids like energy drinks, hot tea with a little sugar, soups and broths, or diluted fruit juices.

, Dizziness can be caused by low blood sugar levels, especially for diabetics.When dizziness hits, try eating a quick snack, preferably something high in carbohydrates or sugar. A bar of chocolate or a banana might do the trick.

, To prevent dizziness when spinning, many dancers focus their eyes on a particular spot. The same technique can be used by people who suffer from dizzy spells.


Focusing on a particular spot, like a crack in the ceiling or a speck of dirt on the floor, can help your senses to realize that you are not actually spinning, contrary to what your body is telling you.

, Dizziness can sometimes be a symptom of an anxiety attack. Often during anxiety attacks it feels as though you cannot get a full breath. But usually the problem is that you're trying to breathe too much. If this is the case, try breathing slowly and deeply. This will help you to calm down and alleviate feelings of dizziness., If you are experiencing feelings of dizziness, try to avoid bright lights, or light from a television or laptop.


Bright light may cause you to feel disoriented and make the dizziness worse.
Try sitting or lying down in a dark room, or close your eyes for a minute or two.

, The Epley maneuver forces the calcium crystal debris causing vertigo to slip into an area of the inner ear where it can no longer cause symptoms. To perform the Epley maneuver:


Sit down and tilt your head 45 degrees horizontally towards the affected ear.
Lie back into a horizontal position, keeping your head hanging at a 45-degree turn. Hold this position for a minute or two. You should feel the vertigo subside.
Turn your head 90 degrees toward the unaffected ear. Roll onto the side of the unaffected ear. You should now be looking at the floor.
Hold this position. You may experience another attack of vertigo, but this should subside within a minute.
Slowly return to a seated position.

Get antibiotic treatment for bacterial infections.,
Take it easy if you have a viral infection.,
Seek immediate medical care for chronic or fungal meningitis.,
Ask your doctor about prophylactic medicine if you’re around sick people.",How to Treat Meningitis (Spinal Meningitis)1," If your meningitis is caused by bacteria, your doctor will start you on antibiotics. Often, you will stay in the hospital and antibiotics will be given by IV. Oral antibiotics may not be strong enough or fast-acting enough to treat bacterial meningitis appropriately.


Your doctor may start you on “broad-spectrum” antibiotics immediately, even while waiting to see what bacteria grows from your spinal tap. These are antibiotics that fight a wide range of bacteria. Then once results return, your antibiotics may be changed to specifically target the appropriate bacteria causing your illness.
You may also get treated with corticosteroids to minimize the chance of complications like seizures and brain swelling.;
, Most cases of meningitis come from viruses, not bacteria. Viral meningitis is usually less severe than bacterial meningitis. It usually requires no treatment and should clear on its own.Stay home from work or school, get plenty of rest, drink fluids, and allow the illness to pass.


Over-the-counter pain medication can help to temporarily relieve uncomfortable symptoms.Your doctor may want to give you a course of steroid treatment to prevent brain swelling, and maybe anticonvulsants to prevent seizures.
If the herpes virus is causing your meningitis, you may be prescribed an antiviral medication.

, Chronic meningitis – when symptoms develop over a course of 2 weeks or longer – occurs when a slow-growing organism, like fungus, causes the infection. This requires hospitalization and treatment with antifungal medications. The symptoms are similar to bacterial meningitis, so seek care and diagnosis when you have any meningitis symptoms., If someone around you has meningitis, your doctor may recommend that you take antibiotics as a prophylactic, or preventative, measure. This can help keep you from getting the illness, especially if you live with someone who is sick or you have a weakened immune system. Discuss this option with your doctor."

Recognize the signs of conversion disorder.,
Schedule a doctor’s appointment.,
Undergo diagnostic tests.",How to Treat Conversion Disorder1," Symptoms of conversion disorder generally arise after a person has experienced a physical or psychological trauma or stressful event. Symptoms may affect a person’s ability to move or they may affect a person’s senses.Movement-related symptoms may include abnormal movements like trouble walking or tremors, difficulty swallowing, episodes of unresponsiveness, loss of balance, seizures or convulsion, as well as weakness or paralysis.
Sensory-related symptoms may include hearing difficulty or deafness, numbness or loss of physical sensations, speech problems, or vision problems.;
, If you notice any of the symptoms of conversion disorder in a friend or loved one, it’s best to seek medical attention as soon as possible. Doctors will want to be sure your symptoms aren’t due to an underlying condition before diagnosing conversion disorder. It’s important to get evaluated – you don’t want to overlook other seriously medical issues.


It may help with diagnosis to keep a log of symptoms in order to assist the doctor in ruling out any alternative medical conditions.

, Research shows that 25 to 50% of conversion disorder cases turn out to be caused by a medical condition.That’s why early and thorough detection is important. The person’s doctor and health care team will need to perform a review of both medical and family history, complete a physical examination, and order a range of diagnostic tests to determine the cause of symptoms.


Diagnostic tests used by doctors may include imaging tests such as x-rays and an electroencephalogram to determine if seizure symptoms have a neurological cause.Many medical conditions have symptoms that resemble conversion disorder, including stroke, epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, lupus, HIV/AIDS, and myasthenia gravis.

Ask about surgical options for treating PD.",How to Test for Parkinson's Disease," One of the first complaints presented to doctors by many later diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease is an involuntary tremor or shaking of the hands, fingers, arms, legs, jaw, and face.There are many causes of tremors. Parkinson's Disease is one of the most common causes, and tremors are often the first sign of the disease.
The tremor and other symptoms may initially appear only on one side of the body, or may appear worse on one side than the other.A repetitive “pill-rolling"" movement between the thumb and finger--named because it looks as though the person is rolling a pill between the fingers--is characteristic of a parkinsonian tremor.;
, A common symptom of Parkinson’s is a shuffling gait with short steps and a tendency to lean forward. People with Parkinson's often have difficulty with their balance, and there is sometimes a tendency to fall forward, causing the person to walk faster and faster to keep from falling over. This pattern is called a ""festinating gait,"" and it is very common in Parkinson's disease., Those with Parkinson’s Disease often lean forward at the waist when standing or walking. This is because Parkinson's can cause posture and balance problems, including rigidity. There is a tendency to flex the arms and the head so that the person appears bent over with the elbows flexed and the head down.Check for postural rigidity. Also referred to as “cog-wheeling,” this symptom presents as a hallmark, rigid motion when an examiner moves the arm of a patient through basic flexion and extension motions. The rigidity and resistance to movement is most obvious with passive movement of the wrists and elbow., Some symptoms of Parkinson's are caused by the larger symptom of slowed movements (also known as bradykinesia).This primarily affects motor functions from walking and balance to writing and even motor functions that are often considered reflexive or spontaneous.


Look for distortions in voluntary movements. In addition to involuntary movements, those with Parkinson’s may experience disturbances in their voluntary movements beyond just slowness. Some of the treatments used for Parkinson's disease may cause abnormal involuntary movements, or an increase in movement, referred to as dyskinesia. These distortions (dyskinesias) can be similar to a “tic” in appearance and worsen with psychological stress.
Advanced dyskinesia is most often seen in patients who have been on the medication Levodopa for some time.

, Some cognitive impairment is common, but usually not until late in the course of the disease., Around 90 percent of those with PD will show signs of speech disturbances at some point.These can present as quieter speech, breathy or hoarse qualities to the voice, and reduced precision with language.The voice often becomes soft or whispery because the vocal muscles lack mobility.

, Up to 60 percent of those with PD may show signs or anxiety or depression.PD affects some of the mood-stabilizing portions of the brain, which leads to this increased chance for depression, especially paired with the quality of life for patients in late stages of the disease., The muscles used to push food through the digestive system are also affected by PD. This can lead to a variety of gastrointestinal issues from incontinence to constipation.These same symptoms often present along with difficulty swallowing food as well., Many of the involuntary movements associated with Parkinson’s make it increasingly difficult for those with the disease to get a full night of sleep.Other symptoms—such as muscle rigidity making it difficult to roll over at night or bladder issues leading to getting up at night to urinate frequently—compound the sleep disruptions experienced by those with PD., While symptoms alone cannot provide an accurate diagnosis, you can test for the symptoms elsewhere in this article in order to provide your doctor a complete case of your symptoms. The first thing your doctor would do if you came in asking about PD is perform a physical exam, and you can look for some of the same signs he or she would look for.Rest your hand in your lap and look for tremor. Unlike most other forms of tremor, the tremor associated with Parkinson's is worse when you are at rest.
Note your posture. Most people with Parkinson's usually stand slightly bent forward, with the head down and the elbows flexed.

, Ultimately a diagnosis can only come from your doctor. Make an appointment and tell him or her your case history and concerns. If your physician thinks PD is among the potential causes, then he or she will likely run a few tests to help determine the diagnosis.


Note that Parkinson’s Disease is not difficult to diagnose, except in the very early stages. There is no single test your doctor will perform. Instead, your doctor may run other tests to eliminate other conditions that lead to similar symptoms as Parkinson’s (such as stroke, hydrocephalus, or benign essential tremor).The condition that most often mimics PD is essential tremor, which often runs in families and is most marked with the hands outstretched.
Your doctor may also refer you to a neurologist, which is a doctor that specializes in conditions of the nervous system., The first thing your doctor will do is give you a physical exam looking for a variety of different indicators:Is your expression animated?
Do you show signs of a tremor with arms at rest?
Do you exhibit rigidity in your neck or limbs?
How easily can you stand up from a sitting position?
Do you have a normal gait, and do your arms swing symmetrically as you walk?
When given a small push, are you quickly able to resume your balance?

, Imaging tests, such as MRI, ultrasound, SPECT, and PET scans, are not usually very helpful in diagnosing Parkinson's.However, in some cases your doctor may recommend one of these tests to help him or her distinguish between Parkinson's and diseases that present similar symptoms. Due to the expense of such scans, the invasive nature of the procedures, and the plain lack of availability of the machines, it is unlikely that your doctor will recommend these scans as a diagnostic tool in most cases.


An MRI may help your physician distinguish between PD and conditions that display similar symptoms, such as progressive supranuclear palsy and multisystem atrophy., Treatment involves increasing the effect of dopamine (the neurotransmitter affected by PD) in the brain. Treatment may consist of administering levodopa, the most commonly prescribed and most effective drug for PD, on its own (usually as a levodopa/carbidopa combination). In some cases, your doctor may also prescribe a dopamine agonist, such as premipexole, that stimulates the dopamine receptors.If your symptoms are advanced enough to warrant use of medication, then your doctor may prescribe it to see if it curbs any of the symptoms you experience. Diseases that mimic PD tend to respond to treatment less well than PD does. A good response to medication makes PD more likely.

, Unfortunately, there aren't any cures for Parkinson’s Disease yet. However, a wide array of medications are available to treat different symptoms.Some of the medications for treating PD include:Levodopa/Carbidopa (Sinemet, Parcopa, Stalevo, etc.), which treats the various motor symptoms seen in both early and advanced PD
Dopamine agonists (Apokyn, Parlodel, Neupro, etc.), which stimulate dopamine receptors to trick the brain into believing it is receiving dopamine
Anticholinergics (Artane, Cogentin, etc.), which are primarily used to help treat tremors
MAO-B inhibitors (Eldepryl, Carbex, Zelapar, etc.), which help enhance the effects of levodopa
COMT inhibitors (Comtan, Tasmar), which block the body’s metabolism of levodopa, prolonging the effects

, Though exercise is by no means a permanent solution to the effects of PD, it has been shown to reduce stiffness and improve mobility, gait, posture, and balance.Aerobic exercises that require good biomechanics, posture, rotation, and rhythmic movements have proven especially beneficial.Types of exercise that can help include:Dancing
Yoga
Tai Chi
Volleyball and tennis
Aerobics classes

, To find the best fitness regimen based on your specific progression of PD, consult a physical therapist.A physical therapist can tailor a routine to target the areas where you have started experiencing stiffness or decreased mobility.


You should also consult your physical therapist for periodic reevaluation of your routine both to ensure maximum effectiveness of the regimen and to keep up with the progression of the disease., Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a surgical procedure that has revolutionized the treatment of PD in its later stages. The procedure involves implanting electrodes into the targeted region of the brain, which are then connected to an impulse generator inserted beneath the collarbone. The patient is then given a controller to turn the device on or off at necessary times.The effects of DBS are often dramatic and doctors may recommend this route for those who experience disabling tremors, those with adverse side effects to medication, or if medications begin losing their efficacy."

Move slowly.,
Increase your daily fluid intake.,
Get plenty of rest.,
Keep a dizzy diary.,
Wear flat shoes.,
Adapt your environment.,
Take motion sickness medication.,
Avoid substances that affect your circulation.,
Watch out for symptoms of more serious conditions.",How to Stop Dizziness2," If you are prone to dizziness, it is important not to make any sudden movements, as moving too quickly can wreak havoc on your blood pressure. You should move slowly and deliberately when sitting or standing up, holding on to a stable surface such as a hand railing where possible.


When you're getting up in the morning, make sure to get up in stages. First you should sit up slowly in bed, then put your feet on the floor. Take a moment to relax and breathe before slowly standing up.
When moving from a sitting to standing position, flex your legs first. This will help to get your circulation going and minimize light-headedness.

, Dehydration can affect your blood pressure, leading to symptoms of dizziness. Keep dehydration at bay by drinking 6-8 glasses of water a day. However, if you are already dehydrated, try drinking a sports drink. The electrolytes in these drinks can help you to rehydrate quickly and work better than water alone. In addition, increased salt intake can be beneficial in certain conditions.

, It is quite common to experience dizziness or light-headedness as a symptom of some viral illnesses, such as colds or the flu. Getting plenty of rest when you are suffering from a viral illness will help you to recuperate faster and minimize feelings of dizziness., It may sound strange, but by keeping track of your dizzy spells you should be able to identify what your dizziness triggers are and learn to avoid them in future.


For example, your dizziness may be caused by hunger, by standing up too quickly, or by showering with very hot water. Figure out your dizziness triggers and you should be able to head them off in advance.

, If you are prone to attacks of dizziness, wearing high heels may not be your best option. Flat shoes help your brain to read your posture better, thus keeping your body's equilibrium in check. Wearing flat shoes will also help to avoid a sprained ankle if you should fall during an episode of light-headedness.

, One of major concerns with dizziness is that the spinning sensation may cause you to fall and injure yourself. If you suffer from dizziness, you should adapt your home or work environment to minimize the chances of this happening.


Tuck away any electrical wires which you might be in danger of tripping over during dizzy spells.
Use night-lights to prevent your brain from becoming disoriented in the dark.
Avoid thick carpeting which makes it harder for your feet to register changes in position and posture.
Use non-slip mats in your bath and on your bathroom floor.

, Taking motion sickness tablets can help to relieve symptoms of dizziness associated with vertigo. You can find over-the-counter motion sickness medication, or you may be prescribed a stronger version by your doctor. Motion sickness medication includes:


Dimenhydrinate (Dramamine). Available in tablet, liquid, and suppository form, dimenhydrinate is probably the most popular antiemetic and anti-nausea drug on the market.
Meclizine (Bonine). Meclizine should not be taken by children 12 or younger, as its safety has not been thoroughly established.Diphenhydramine (Benadryl). Although more popular as an antihistamine in treating rashes and itches, diphenhydramine is commonly used in treating motion sickness, and is readily available., Dizziness is often caused by low blood pressure, so try to avoid or limit your intake of substances that affect your circulation, such as caffeine, tobacco, alcohol, and illegal drugs., Dizziness is sometimes a symptom of a more serious illness.If you suffer from frequent or prolonged bouts of dizziness it is advisable that you see your doctor.


The doctor can then do tests to check for more serious underlying conditions. Dizziness may be a symptom of:

An inner ear condition, such as labyrinthitis, BPPV or Meniere's disease.
An anxiety disorder, such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.
A heart rhythm problem, such as atrial fibrillation.
P.O.T.S. Or another circulatory issue.
syncope.

Try ginger.,
Drink celery juice.,
Drink honey and cider vinegar.,
Take an iron supplement.,
Take gingko biloba.,
Take feverfew.",How to Stop Dizziness3," Ginger has been used in countless natural remedies for hundreds of years, including treatment for dizziness and its accompanying nausea. This isn't just some herbal mumbo-jumbo -- scientific studies have proven ginger's efficacy at stopping dizziness in its tracks, also finding that it can actually relieve dizziness faster than some over-the-counter medications. Ginger helps dizziness by stimulating blood flow to the brain, as dizziness is often caused by poor circulation.Some ways to incorporate ginger into your diet include:


Taking ginger supplements in capsule form.
Chewing on a small slice of fresh ginger root.
Drinking ginger ale or ginger tea. To make ginger tea, add a little fresh ginger root to a cup of boiled water.
Nibble on ginger candies or suck on ginger lollipops.

, Celery juice can ease feelings of dizziness that are brought on by low blood pressure. You can buy celery juice at a health food store or make your own using fresh celery and a juicer.

, Two teaspoons of apple cider vinegar together with two teaspoons of honey in a glass of hot or cold water three times a day helps to regulate blood pressure and may ease symptoms of dizziness.

, If your dizziness is a symptom of iron-deficiency anaemia, you may need to take an iron supplement. Watch out for other symptom of anaemia, such as tiredness, shortness of breath or headaches. If you think you make be anaemic, consult your doctor before starting on an iron supplement., Ginkgo biloba is a certain type of tree which has many medicinal uses. Ginkgo biloba aids with dizziness problems, since it boosts circulation of blood within the inner ear, correcting some inner ear problems. It is available in tablet, liquid extract and dried leaf form., Another good herb to treat dizziness is feverfew. Not only has it been shown to help with migraines, it can also reduce inflammation processes in your inner ear, while improving blood circulation. Feverfew supplements are available in capsule, tablet and liquid extract form."

Avoid contact with infected people.,
Know if you are in a high-risk group.,
Get vaccinated against Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae.,
Vaccinate your child against Haemophilus Influenzae Type B (Hib).,
Get tested for group B streptococcus if you’re pregnant.",How to Treat Meningitis (Spinal Meningitis)2," Some forms of bacterial meningitis are contagious. The bacteria are spread through respiratory droplets and saliva, such as through kissing, coughing, and sneezing. You are at greater risk of contracting meningitis if you:


Are in close or prolonged contact with someone who has meningitis, such as in a daycare setting or shared household
Have direct contact with a sick patient's oral secretions
Live in an area with poor food and water hygiene – you can get some types of bacterial meningitis from contaminated food and water, Certain groups of people are at higher risk of getting meningitis. It is especially recommended that these groups get vaccinated against the illness. Be aware if you are in one of the following high-risk groups:U.S. military recruits
Anyone who has a damaged spleen or whose spleen has been removed
College students living in dormitories, and other groups living in close proximity
Microbiologists or other healthcare professionals exposed to meningococcal bacteria
Anyone who has terminal complement component deficiency (an immune system disorder), or are otherwise immunocompromised
Anyone traveling to countries which have an outbreak of meningococcal disease. If traveling overseas, check to see if the vaccine is recommended – you should receive the vaccine at least 1 week before departure.
Those who might have been exposed to meningitis during an outbreak
Young babies, under the age of 2

, Meningococcal vaccines protect against most types of meningitis, although they do not prevent all cases. There are two vaccines against Neisseria meningitidis, a common infecting bacteria, available in the United States: meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4), and meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4).


MCV4 is the preferred vaccine for people ages 2-55. If your child did not get this vaccine at their 11 or 12 year old check-up, make an appointment for them to get it now.

, Hib is a bacterial infection that can cause meningitis in children.The Hib vaccine is the best way to prevent Hib infection and is 95% effective. All children younger than 5 years old should get the Hib vaccine.Make sure your child gets all doses for the best protection, and if you miss a dose or get behind schedule get the next dose as soon as you can. Children should get a series of vaccines at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, and 12-15 months of age.

, Pregnant women can pass group B streptococcus bacteria to their infant during childbirth. Group B strep is another cause of meningitis in young children. If you’re pregnant, get tested for group B strep by your doctor. They can give you antibiotics during labor to reduce the risk of passing the bacteria to your baby.Get tested between 35-37 weeks of your pregnancy.

Know symptoms of meningitis like stiff neck, fever, and headache.,
Pay close attention to behavioral changes in young children.,
Seek treatment early.",How to Treat Meningitis (Spinal Meningitis)3," Headaches, fever, and nausea can occur for a number of reasons, and are common in simple, non-threatening illnesses. If your symptoms are more severe or different than how you typically feel with a cold though, you should seek evaluation. Familiarize yourself with the signs and symptoms of meningitis and watch for specific combinations of symptoms that may suggest meningitis over another illness. For those over the age of 2, watch for the following symptoms:Stiff neck
Headache
High fever of 102°F (39°C) or higher
Discomfort looking into bright lights
Sleepiness

Nausea or vomiting
Confusion
Seizures
Skin rash, For children under the age of 2, recognizing the classic symptoms of meningitis may be difficult. Be on the lookout for signs of meningitis in young children such as:Slow movements or inactivity
Abnormal reflexes
Irritability
Vomiting
Loss of appetite
Seizures
Bulging fontanelle, the soft spot in the center of the baby’s skull
Stiffness in the baby’s neck or body, Early diagnosis and treatment of meningitis are very important to prevent life-threatening complications. As soon as you notice symptoms occurring, see your doctor immediately. It's best to get evaluated if there are any concerns because a delay can lead to serious consequences and even be life threatening.Your doctor can diagnose meningitis by growing bacteria from a blood sample or fluid obtained with a spinal tap (or “lumbar puncture”). A spinal tap is performed by inserting a needle into an area in the lower back where fluid in the spinal canal is readily attainable – it’s a relatively quick procedure and isn’t too uncomfortable. Treatment will begin as soon as meningitis is diagnosed, or possibly even while you’re awaiting diagnosis.

Get physical therapy to address symptoms.,
Try psychotherapy.,
Identify and treat any comorbid disorders.,
Consider transcranial magnetic stimulation.",How to Treat Conversion Disorder2," Despite there not being any identifiable medical condition contributing to the symptoms of conversion disorder, sufferers may benefit from physiotherapy. These people are not consciously in control of their symptoms, so weakness and muscle contractures may occur due to limb inactivity.


Participating in physical therapy allows a person with conversion disorder to have “power” over improving their symptoms, enabling them to return to functioning in their social, occupational, and physical lives. Benefits include decreased stiffness, improved posture, heightened confidence, greater independence, and less anxiety.A physical therapist may recommend a range of exercises including stretching, biofeedback, gait and locomotion training, and relaxation training among others.

, One of the foundational approaches for effective treatment of conversion disorder is psychotherapy. Also known as talk therapy, psychotherapy allows mental health providers to focus in on the emotional stress and conflict associated with the disorder.


Cognitive behavior therapy, in particular, has shown great success in treating conversion disorder and other medically unexplained conditions.This form of therapy enables patients to identify and challenge negative or irrational thought patterns that may contribute to their condition. It also teaches problem-solving and coping skills for life stressors.Other forms of therapy used in the treatment of conversion disorder include psychoanalysis, behavior modification, and family therapy.

, It is very common for people with conversion disorder to also suffer from some other psychiatric condition, such as somatization, depressive, and anxiety disorders.Recognizing any underlying disorder and including proven treatments for these disorders in a comprehensive treatment plan can lead to better outcomes.


For example, if a patient is also suffering from anxiety or depression, a two-prong approach involving pharmaceuticals and psychotherapy can improve the patient’s prognosis of conversion disorder., One type of potential treatment—which is still in the early stages of research for use with conversion disorder is a brain stimulation therapy called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Patients suffering from conversion disorder may benefit from this approach.


Typically used for treatment-resistant depression, TMS stimulates brain nerve cells by using magnetic fields. This non-invasive treatment affects how certain parts of the brain are functioning."
"
Accept that there is no organic cause to your symptoms.,
Stay physically active.,
Practice relaxation techniques.,
Build a strong support system.,
Avoid unhealthy coping.It can be tempting for a person with conversion disorder to want to self-medicate with alcohol and drugs.",How to Treat Conversion Disorder3," A major milestone in conversion disorder treatment is a patient coming to terms with the lack of a physical explanation for their symptoms. If a person presents with conversion disorder, they often don’t see a connection between emotional distress and the physical symptom. If a doctor or loved one gently points out this connection and offers support symptoms may start to improve., Because conversion disorder is linked to psychological and emotional stress, getting adequate exercise can help overcome symptoms of this condition. Of course, the type of exercise the person can do will depend on what symptoms they are experiencing. However, encouraging even light exercise may help to improve physical problems and lift their mood.


Exercise may also be effective at addressing any underlying psychiatric disorder that is present. Both anxiety and depression are relieved with regular physical activity. Suggest at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days of the week., A person who is suffering from conversion disorder may find relief from symptoms by scheduling in activities that promote calm and a sense of well-being. Relaxation exercises may run the gamut from self-care activities like taking a warm bath or walking around the neighborhood to more focused exercises for stress relief. Try these relaxation techniques to ease emotional stress and conflict.



Deep breathing is a simple yet effective method of inducing the body’s natural relaxation response. Place one hand over the belly and one over the chest. Breathe in deeply through the nose for about 4 counts. Hold. Notice the hand on the belly rising while the one on the chest remains steady. Exhale the breath through the mouth for about 7 counts, noticing the belly deflating beneath the hand. Repeat as necessary.Progressive muscle relaxation involves the process of gradually moving across the body contracting and relaxing each muscle group. Start at the toes. Tense them and hold for about 5 counts. Release the tension and relax for about 30 counts. Go to the next muscle group and repeat.Other effective relaxation exercises may include yoga, meditation, and massage. Try out several to determine which works best for your loved one.

, Another staple to alleviating emotional stress and conflict is leaning on a support group. People who regularly engage in a social network enjoy reduced stress and greater resilience to illness. Plus, social connection produces feel-good hormones in the body that boost the mood.Have the person aim for a little social engagement each day. They may set up a lunch date with coworkers, chat with an old friend over the phone, or speak with a religious or spiritual advisor for support.

, However, these substances only numb or remove symptoms for a short while—they are not a long-term solution. Trying some of the other strategies listed above, such as deep breathing or exercise can offer a better response in the face of stress.


Foster well-being and stress-management by making sure the person consumes a healthy diet rich in vitamins and nutrients from foods like fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains. Enjoy sugar and caffeine in moderation. Also, make rest a top priority—and support physical and mental healing—by getting 7 to 9 hours per night.

Get plenty of exercise.,
Avoid obesity to reduce dementia risk.,
Lower your blood pressure.,
Reduce your cholesterol level.,
Quit smoking.,
Drink alcohol moderately.,
Adhere to a Mediterranean diet.,
Maintain a healthy social life.",How to Reduce Your Risk of Dementia," 5 sessions per week at 30 minutes each session is recommended for keeping dementia at bay. The exercise does not have to be vigorous, but it should at least get your heart rate up and have you breathing fast.;
, Obesity may increase your risk for dementia directly and/or indirectly, as diabetes associated with obesity also appears to be linked to higher rates of dementia. Have your doctor determine your Body Mass Index (BMI). If your BMI is over 30 percent, then you are considered clinically obese, and at a higher risk for dementia.

, Having a consistently raised blood pressure, especially during your midlife years (from age 35 to 65), causes damage to your brain and, in turn, increases your risk of dementia. If you have a family history of high blood pressure or are over 40 years of age, you should have your blood pressure checked regularly and take measures to keep it within the normal range in order to best prevent dementia.

, High cholesterol, much the same as high blood pressure, restricts blood flow to the brain and causes brain damage, which can, as a result, put you at a higher risk of developing dementia. Alzheimer's, specifically, is caused by protein plaque build-up in the brain, which appears to be promoted by high levels of cholesterol.

, Not only does smoking promote vascular disease, a risk factor for dementia, but it also lowers blood oxygen levels, which, in turn, aids plaque production in the brain.

, While chronic alcohol abuse may trigger certain types of dementia, studies show that drinking a moderate amount of alcohol (1 to 3 servings a day) appears to protect the brain against signs of dementia.

, Eating a diet high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish and olive oil and low in dairy products and processed foods appears to be beneficial in helping reduce dementia risk.

, Studies suggest that developing relationships and participating in social activities helps in preventing dementia. Likewise, social isolation is considered to be a risk factor for dementia.

Avoid potentially dangerous activities.",How to Treat Narcolepsy," If you have narcolepsy or suspect that you could suffer from the condition, it’s important to speak to your doctor about treatment. They can help determine the severity and formulate a plan to best tackle your symptoms.


Be open and honest with your doctor about your symptoms, including anything that makes them better or worse. Tell your doctor about any medications you are taking that could be causing narcolepsy or may interact with treatment options.Accurate diagnosis is important and there are other conditions that can affect sleep. You will likely need a sleep evaluation to make the diagnosis. In the meantime, there are strategies to improve you sleep/wake cycle.
See your doctor if your narcolepsy isn’t responding to treatment.;
, Stimulants are drugs that stimulate the central nervous system and can help people stay awake. These are the primary type of drugs given to people suffering from narcolepsy.Start with drugs such as modafinil or armodafinil. These are not as addictive as older stimulants and also don’t cause highs and lows often associated with stimulants. It’s uncommon to have side effects with modafinil or armodafinil, but you may get a headache, have nausea or a dry mouth.

, Narcolepsy disrupts the REM cycle of sleep, which can cause symptoms like hallucinations and sleep paralysis. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), which are antidepressants, can suppress REM sleep and help manage your symptoms.Talk to your doctor about the best medication for you. Your doctor may prescribe fluoxetine or venlafaxine for you. These medications can cause weight gain, sexual dysfunction, and digestive problems. You may have to try a couple of different medications to find one that works best for you.

, Cataplexy, which is a sudden and temporary loss of voluntary muscular function caused by an emotional trigger like laughter, is a common symptom in narcoleptics.In addition to SSRIs, a older category of antidepressants called tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are an effective therapy for narcolepsy-induced cataplexy.Talk to your doctor about trying TCAs if you suffer from bouts of cataplexy and other anti-depressants don’t work. The doctor may prescribe protriptyline, imipramine, or clomipramine. These medications can cause side effects including dry mouth and lightheadedness.

, Another medication that is highly effective for cataplexy is sodium oxybate, or Xyrem.It also can improve nighttime sleep and control daytime sleepiness. Be aware that sodium oxybate can have side effects including nausea, bed-wetting, and sleepwalking. If you’re using it in conjunction with other medications, pain relievers, or alcohol, it can cause difficulty breathing, coma, or even death.Sodium oxybate is specific to cataplexy and is not widely available in the US.
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about any concerns you have with sodium oxybate. If your symptoms get worse or you have other potentially serious side effects, contact your doctor as soon as possible.

, If you suffer from narcolepsy, it’s very important to maintain a strict nighttime schedule. By going to sleep and waking up at the same time every day, you can effectively reduce even debilitating symptoms of narcolepsy.Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, making sure that you get at least seven hours of sleep. Make sure that you stay on your schedule during the weekends or you may have more noticeable symptoms. If you have to change your schedule for any reason, consider adding naps during the day to prevent flare ups of symptoms.
Keep your bedroom for sleeping and avoid other activities such as reading or watching TV. These can interfere with your normal sleep patterns.

, If you suffer from narcolepsy symptoms during the day, it’s a good idea to schedule short, regular naps during your drowsiest times of the day. Not only can a 20 minute nap refresh you, it can also decrease sleepiness for one to three hours.Keep your naps at 20 minutes or less because they are generally more effective than longer naps of an hour or more. Because every person is different, experiment with how long you nap to figure out the best amount of sleep for your symptoms.
Plan your naps at strategic times, which can prevent unplanned lapses into sleep. You can either take them at regular intervals, such as every three hours, or just before you have a big event such as a test or meeting., Consuming a regular, healthy nutrient-rich diet based around the five food groups can help control symptoms of narcolepsy. Eating light or vegetarian meals during the day and staying away from heavy meals before important activities may prevent lapses into sleep or drowsiness.Choose foods from the five food groups — which are fruits, vegetables, grains, proteins, and dairy. Vary what you eat every day so that you get a range of nutrients.Eat whole fruits and vegetables such as blueberries, strawberries, cauliflower and spinach.
Try whole grain pasta, bread, steel cut oatmeal, brown rice or cereal for your grains.
Your protein should come from lean cuts of meat such as pork or poultry as well as cooked beans, peanut butter, or eggs.
You can get dairy from foods including yogurt, cheese, milks, and ice cream.
Avoid unhealthy food choices as much as possible. Processed and fried foods, sugary snacks, and desserts can weigh you down and make your symptoms worse., Getting moderate, regular exercise can help you feel more awake during the day. It also promotes better sleep at night. Daily activity also improves your mood, which is helpful to someone suffering from the emotional difficulties of narcolepsy.Get at least 150 minutes of moderate activity every week, which means about 30 minutes five days a week. If your symptoms are severe, consider doing two to three workouts of 15 minutes each. Do activities like walking, jogging, biking, or swimming. You may want to try yoga or Pilates which are forms of exercise that can also help relax you.

, Things like nicotine and alcohol and some over-the counter medications can act as stimulants and not only exacerbate your symptoms, but also disrupt sleep. Avoiding them as much as possible may help you more effectively manage your narcolepsy.Avoid drinking caffeine and alcohol as much as you can, especially close to bedtime. You should also limit nicotine consumption or give it up altogether. These substances can act as stimulants and may disrupt normal sleep patterns.
Avoid over-the-counter drugs that can cause drowsiness such as allergy and cold medications. Talk to your doctor about alternatives that won’t make your narcolepsy symptoms worse., If you have a lot to do during the day, try breaking up tasks or jobs into manageable parts. This can help you minimize symptoms and prevent unplanned lapses into sleep.Focus on one small task at a time. When you’re finished, ask yourself if you can do another small task or if you need to rest for a few minutes before tackling the next activity.
Consider recording important conversations and meetings. If fall asleep or have any other symptoms, you can go back to these to ensure you don’t miss anything.

, Intense emotions and stress can trigger the symptoms of narcolepsy. You can manage them by avoiding stressful situations and practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing.Organize a flexible schedule for yourself that builds in time for naps and to relax from potentially stressful situations. Stay away from stressful situations as much as you can. If you can’t, take deep breaths and don’t react, which can make the symptoms of narcolepsy worse.
Get regular massages to help yourself relax. You can even give yourself mini-massages during the day as a way to release stress and tension. For example, rubbing your temples and neck can do a lot to relax you.

, Many people suffer from narcolepsy and it’s nothing about which you need to feel ashamed. Let employers, coworkers, family members and friends know about your narcolepsy. This can alert them to help you if you lapse into sleep, hallucinations or other symptoms.Let people you inform know the best way to help you. For example, you could say, “If I fall asleep, don’t wake me up. I’ll get up within a few minutes and it would be a huge help to me if you could let me know what I missed.”
Wear a med-alert bracelet to inform others of your condition, especially in cases you don’t know the people.

, If you are prone to sudden sleep attacks, don’t do any activity that would be dangerous if you had one. Driving, climbing ladders, or operating heavy machinery can be dangerous if you fall asleep, become immobile or are unable to talk. If you can’t avoid these activities, take a nap before doing them to manage any possible sleepiness."

Studies have shown that eating these foods on a regular basis can help reduce your risk of developing dementia.Research shows that these foods are higher in B Vitamins like thiamin and folic acid. These vitamins play a protective role in your brain preventing shrinkage, maintaining blood sugar levels and supporting a healthy nervous system.Include foods like beans and lentils on a regular basis. The serving size for these foods are about 1/2 cup.Have hummus as a snack, make lentil or black bean soup, put beans over salad greens or make a cold bean salad.;
, A specific nutrient that has been associated with decreased risk of dementia are healthy fats, such as Omega-3 fatty acids, polyunsaturated, and monounsaturated fats.


Studies have shown that heart healthy fats like Omega-3 fats reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke which are linked to dementia.These heart-healthy fats are found in a wide variety of foods like: nuts; seeds; cold-water fish like salmon, tuna and mackerel; avocado; olive oil; olives; and canola oil.
Almonds are also high in healthy fats and have been specifically linked to a reduced risk of dementia.If you're choosing nuts, go for a 1/4 cup almonds. Have them alone as a snack, mixed into a trail mix or sprinkled into your morning oatmeal or yogurt.

, Fruits and vegetables are very important food groups to maintain your overall health and reduce your risk of developing dementia.


Fruits and vegetables are low in calories, but high in vitamins, minerals and most importantly antioxidants. Studies have shown that a variety of the antioxidants present in fruits and vegetables have a protective like quality to the brain.Aim for five to nine servings daily. Including one to two servings per meal will help you reach this goal. Measure out 1 cup of vegetables, 2 cups of salad greens and 1/2 cup of fruit.One vegetable in particular that has been linked to decreased risk of dementia is spinach. This leafy green has been shown to prevent the buildup of plaques in the brain and is also high in folic acid and iron.Berries high in flavonoids, such as blueberries and strawberries, have been associated with slower rates of cognitive decline.Flavonoids are believed to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that may have a protective effect against dementia.

, Your morning cup of coffee has also been linked to a reduced risk of developing dementia.Sip on coffee a little more often to help reduce your risk.


Studies have shown that those seniors that had mild cognitive impairment and drank three cups of caffeinated coffee daily were far less likely to develop full-blown dementia compared to those seniors who did not sip on coffee.The benefit is partially from the caffeine in the coffee, so decaf beverages are not as beneficial.
Dark chocolate is another tasty source of caffeine that can be added to your day to help prevent the development of dementia as well.

, Maintaining a normal Vitamin D level is difficult. It's very common to be deficient and a deficiency in this particular vitamin has been linked to the development of dementia.There are very few foods that are good sources of Vitamin D. Eggs, oily fish and dairy products are your best bet.In addition, you get Vitamin D from the sun. The UV rays cause your body produce this vitamin naturally. It is difficult to determine exactly how much sun exposure each person should get (it depends on season, time of day, cloud cover, amount of melanin in the person's skin, and many other factors).Some researchers suggest 5–30 minutes of sun exposure between 10 AM and 3 PM at least twice a week.However, if you do not eat these foods or spend time out in the sun, you may need to take a Vitamin D supplement. Always talk to your doctor prior to starting supplementation. Vitamin D that gets too high can be toxic.

, In addition to Vitamin D, there have been a few studies on other vitamins and herbal supplements that may also be promising in regards to reducing your risk for dementia. Try:


Coenzyme Q10. This compound is actually formed naturally in your body; however, when used as a supplement has been shown to have a positive effect on reducing the risk of dementia.It's typically safe to take 400 mg daily.Ginkgo. This herbal supplement comes from a plant that is high in antioxidants and and anti-inflammatory properties. Studies have shown that this herb may slow the progression of memory problems.It's typically safe to take anywhere between 250–600 mg of ginkgo daily.Vitamin E. This vitamin is found in many foods that have healthy fats - like nuts, seeds and cold water fish. Studies have shown that Vitamin E may also slow the progression of dementia.It's typically safe to consume up to 500 mg of Vitamin E daily.You can purchase these supplements at your local pharmacy, health food store or online; however, always talk to your doctor prior to starting any supplementation.

, Although there are a variety of foods that may help prevent the development of dementia or slow it's progress, there is also a style of eating that has shown similar benefits. Many studies have shown that those people in the countries that border the Mediterranean have lower incidences of dementia.This type of eating style has been associated with lower levels of inflammation which has been shown to be beneficial for reducing your risk of developing dementia.The Mediterranean diet focuses on many foods like: fish, legumes, whole grains, fruits and vegetables. It typically limits red meat, fatty meats, dairy products and sweets.By following the Mediterranean diet you'll automatically be including many of the specific foods that have been associated with a lower risk of dementia.

, High intakes of both saturated and trans fat have been linked to a variety of adverse health effects and chronic health conditions.Limit foods that are high in saturated fats and completely cut out foods that contain trans fats to decrease your risk of developing dementia.


Studies have shown that these unhealthy fats can cause a narrowing of your arteries which increases your overall risk for both stroke and dementia.Saturated fats are found in foods like: processed meats, fatty cuts of meat, full fat dairy products, and lard.Trans fats are found in fried foods, fast foods and many processed foods (like cookies, cakes and pies)., There are now studies that are linking foods that contain chemicals like diacetyl and nitrates with an increased risk of dementia. Limit foods that contain these harmful chemicals to help reduce your overall risk.Studies show that foods containing these chemicals may worsen an abnormal brain protein which has been linked to dementia in addition to reducing some protective proteins in the brain.Foods that typically contain diacetyl or nitrates include: beer, processed meats (like bacon, sausage, deli meat and smoked meats), margarine, candy and microwave popcorn., Refined carbohydrates are a group of foods that have been linked with a variety of chronic health conditions; however, studies have shown that refined carbohydrates have been linked to increased insulin levels and dementia.Even in people without diabetes, these foods spike your blood sugar and insulin. Studies have shown this leads to insulin resistance which predisposes you to dementia but also produces negative changes in your brain cells.Refined carbohydrates are those that are highly processed. The main two refined carbohydrates in the American diet are white flour and white sugar. These foods and any foods that are made from them break down to the same compound in the body - glucose - and cause a spike in your blood sugar and insulin levels.Limit foods like: white bread, white rice, white pasta, candy, cookies, cakes and pies, ice cream, sweetened beverages, pastries, cereals and crackers.

, There has been direct evidence that high or excessive amounts of alcohol are linked to dementia (especially Korsakoff's syndrome).You do not have to give up alcohol, but consumption should be kept in check.


Drinking large quantities of alcohol over a long period of time can causes negative changes in your brain cells. It's believed that a disruption in thiamin levels caused by alcohol consumption changes the signaling pathways in the brain and can cause scar tissue.The CDC provides guidelines on alcohol consumption. It's typically recommended for women to have no more than one drink daily and men to cut off their intake after two drinks per day., Whenever you're concerned about your risk for a chronic disease are are attempting to make changes to your diet or lifestyle to reduce your risk of that disease, you should always talk to your doctor first.


Your doctor is your primary resource for information and guidance on how to prevent chronic health conditions like dementia. If you're concerned about developing dementia, bring this up when you see your physician.
Talk to them about your family history, current medical conditions, medications, diet and lifestyle. Ask him or her about any changes they think you should make to lower your risk.
Also ask about the changes you're planning on making and whether or not they are appropriate and safe for you.
Also talk to your doctor about how to manage other chronic conditions like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes and depression as these have been associated with an increased risk of dementia., Like the prevention for many chronic diseases, maintaining a healthy weight is also important to decreasing your risk for developing dementia.Although there has been some controversy over weight and dementia risk, most studies show that being overweight or obese midlife increases your risk for dementia.You can tell if you're overweight by measuring your BMI. There are many websites that allow you to plug-in your information and get your BMI calculated automatically. If your BMI is 20.0–24.9 you're at a healthy weight. If your BMI is 25.0–29.9 you're considered overweight. Anything above 30 is considered obese.Try to maintain a healthy weight for your gender, height and age. If you think you're overweight, consider speaking to your doctor about appropriate weight loss methods.

, Staying physically active and including regular exercise is an important part to maintaining overall health and preventing dementia.Regular exercise has many benefits; however, it's specifically good for keeping your heart and vascular system in shape which is key in preventing dementia later on.It's recommended to include at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity cardio each week in addition to one to two days of strength or resistance training.Include exercises like: walking, jogging, yoga, weight lifting, dancing, water aerobics or taking aerobics classes.

, Smoking cigarettes in addition to using other tobacco products is incredibly harmful to every organ system in your body. Smoking has been directly linked to many adverse health effects and conditions including dementia.Smoking damages your heart and vascular system. It specifically damages the blood vessels in your brain and there is a direct link to the development of dementia.Stop smoking immediately. If you're having difficulty quitting cold turkey, consider joining a smoking cessation program or ask your doctor for medications that may make it easier to quit.

, Newer research has shown that continued social activity may help reduce the risk of developing dementia.Engage in regular outings and gatherings with friends and family to help prevent dementia.


Although research has shown a link between increased social activity and decreased risk of dementia, not much is known about why. Research in this area continues to grow.
Make sure that you schedule in regular social activities during the week. Go out to dinner with friends, join a book club, attend group exercise classes, go to religious worship services or volunteer.

, It's become more popular recently to engage in ""brain games"" or ""brain training."" Some studies suggest that regular engagement in puzzles or games may help reduce the risk of dementia.Many computer games and apps for your smartphone or tablet are geared toward ""brain training."" They include fun games, puzzles or riddles for you to solve. If you do not have a smartphone or tablet, consider doing puzzles like Sudoku or crossword puzzles.
Research suggests that the increased mental activity helps the brain cope with and compensate for any damage that has occurred.It's important to note that the research for brain training is geared for those under the age of 60 years old. These games have not shown to be preventative of dementia after the age of 60. Start playing these games early on."

Realize that a one time addict doesn't always need to be an addict.,
Assess for yourself if they have made the necessary changes in their lives.,
Approach a renewed friendship slowly.,
Do not waver.,
Remove temptation from your friend.",How to Deal With a Recovered Addict," During recovery an addict is struggling to subdue that characteristic in themselves, but it is still there. Nonetheless, given that they are honest and intent on changing, there is nothing stopping them from becoming a respectable person. With a sincere change in their thinking process and enough time, they can overcome the characteristics that led them to addiction.;
, Remember that abstinence from use does not necessarily mean a change in their thinking process. How do they treat you and those around them? How do they care for their belongings? Do they still have addictive tendencies (smoking, for instance, or compulsive behaviors)? Do they excuse wrong behaviors? Do they seem sincere or are they apologizing too much? What has really changed?

, Do not instantly become close again. Give them time to consider exactly what has been lost to their habits and the thought process with which the habits were established, and make it clear that severe relapse might lead to the end of the friendship.

, Be steadfast, and set an example of consistency in all aspects of your life. Do not flaunt or push too strongly for your friend's consistency. Instead, be a calm paradigm.

, Without seeming manipulative, introduce them to activities conducive to a clean life. Once they have truly changed their thought process(recovered), they will begin to disassociate themselves more from addicted friends and associated activities. Encouraging them to participate in productive activities, especially those involving service and other activities that establish self worth, will be a great benefit in assisting the transition from 'recovering' to 'recovered'. The goal is to create a drug free environment for your friend to grow accustomed to, and to ease the recovery process.

These underlying issues are what may best be handled with the help of professionals. You may have difficulty with mental or physical health, occupational issues, or social anxiety.The following are outward signs of addiction that might be well addressed by a rehab center.High tolerance to your drug of choice, and needing larger and larger doses to achieve the same effect.
Symptoms of withdrawal that accompany increases in tolerance. If limiting your use causes extreme anxiety, sweating, or nausea, it's likely that you'll need professional assistance to detoxify.
Turning to your drug of choice despite telling yourself and others that you want to stop. This is the vicious cycle of using only in order to alleviate the symptoms of withdrawal.
Being unable to keep up your drug habit and put time and energy into other parts of your life. This usually means that you spend much less time with people who do not use with you and are unable to keep up relationships with non-users.
Having mounting financial, legal, or professional problems. If you have been fired, penalized or become strapped financially by your drug use, rehab is likely a good idea.;
, Survey your options, and find facilities that you will be able to afford or cover with outside assistance. Costs can be high, especially since it is common to go to rehab facilities that require you to travel.Ask all prospective facilities what kind of insurance they take, and check with your insurance provider to see if your policy covers rehab stays.


Many treatment centers have financial counseling and financing available for qualified patients.So, ask about what sort of payment plan will be available to you.
Sometimes state funding is available for people in need of rehab. A call to your state's social services office will help you find out if you are eligible for some form of subsidized treatment. Then, locate a center with federally funded or subsidized spaces.

, It's important to choose a center that offer treatment programs will benefit you the most. There is a variety of programs, many of which will use hybrid methods. One facility will usually offer a variety of programs to fit individual needs. Here are a few common formats you may see on your search:


Detoxification treatment. This is usually offered for people addicted to alcohol, opiates, nicotine, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines. Detox treatment may require the use of other drugs (like Methadone or Naltrexone) or 24/7 medical oversight.Long term residential treatment. Long-term rehabs usually run for 6 to 12 months and focus on maintaining sobriety in a communal setting.
Short-term residential treatment. These programs last 3 to 6 weeks and usually use 12-step methods so that patients can transition smoothly back to into daily life.

, Different rehab facilities will usually offer a mixture of types of therapy along with necessary medical treatment. Depending on the length of your stay, you can expect to experience the following:


Group therapy sessions. Group therapy is very common and offers a communal, supportive settings to cope with the emotions of recovery.On-site medical care. Some centers offer a full staff of nurses and physicians. Check for accreditation of these rehabs, like JCAHO accreditation (Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations), which meets standards for quality medical care.Individual counseling and therapy. Some programs offer individual counseling that usually involves cognitive-behavioral or holistic therapy.
Educational lectures and life-skills workshops that are also usually done in medium-sized groups.

, Once you have made a decision to go to rehab, let your loved ones know that you're leaving. By doing this you'll be able to share your news before people you care about hear it through the grapevine first. It’s up to you to decide to tell them, or simply keep your privacy and explain that you'll be away for a while.


Alerting others in advance if you'll need help watching your home or keeping up with your finances. Asking for help is a great way to keep people you care about involved in your big change, as they won't necessarily be present throughout your rehabilitation.

, Get everything ready for your absence by making sure that your finances and bills will be kept up to date. This includes utilities, rent, and loans. If necessary, alert your landlord or neighbors that you will be away for an extended time.


Also, find trustworthy care or boarding for any pets and plants that you have.

, When you have made a decision on the facility you want to go to, contact the center and make arrangements for getting your treatment underway. Remember to discuss the date of arrival, rules about what you may or may not bring with you, and any remaining questions you might have about the duration of your stay, finances, and visitation once you’re there.


Find out if you can have visitors and how often the center permits its residents to contact their loved ones. Some centers will prefer that you do not contact people in your life during part or all of your initial stay so that you can be totally focused on the rehab program.

, Look within yourself and honestly ask why it is that you're going to rehab. Make sure that you don't waste your time and money by checking into a rehab program without being fully committed to recovery and ongoing sobriety. Outline on paper or mentally rehearse your goals for yourself. What do you hope to gain from treatment? Is there anything that you are not willing to do for your recovery?


Don't get too worried if you feel very anxious and overwhelmed. These feelings are to be expected.
Try to acknowledge the anxiety that you feel, sit with it for a while, and then continue to move forward, knowing that it's there and that there's nothing wrong with that.

, Be prepared to open up to a different side of yourself, spiritually and emotionally, that you may not be very familiar with. Rehabilitation requires that you put your heart into it and deeply desire the change it will bring, even if it means relinquishing your old ways of dealing with life.


Expect that there will be stretches of time at the center when you will feel depressed or alone, and keep in mind that faith in your own healing will lend you the positivity to overcome these feelings.
Remember to keep your expectations in check. While you've made a great decision to overhaul your life and kick your addiction, the rehabilitation process is long and can often be quite daunting.

, Although all rehab centers vary somewhat regarding things you can and can’t bring with you, there are many common items that are not allowed. The following should be left behind unless you are explicitly told otherwise by a staff member at your chosen rehab center:


Alcohol and drugs (even mouthwash that contains alcohol)
Pornography
Weapons (including razor blades)
Musical instruments
Outside food, drink, herbal products, and vitamins
Excessive makeup, jewelry, and offensive or revealing clothing

, Most rehab centers will allow you to bring the following. Again, rehab centers have slightly different rules and expectations, so always call the center beforehand if you are packing and stumble upon an item you’re not sure is allowed.


Prescription medication to be kept with the staff
Photos, books, and other personal mementos
Casual clothing, laundry supplies, and hygiene items (including electric razors)
Some cash

, Arrive on the specified date and time, and be prepared. Understand that you’ll feel anxiety and maybe some resistance to things that you'll be asked to do--even being told that there are things you should and shouldn't bring can trigger bitter feelings. However, these are normal feelings. Just getting to the center and staying for the duration of the treatment should be your first recovery goal.

, If you have not already addressed certain details about what to expect, the person doing your intake will be able to offer more information. There are different rules for each facility and some may have stricter policies than others may. Consider the following questions:


Does the program offer ways to minimize cravings?
Is there a nutritional component to treatment?
What sort of life skills education will be provided?

, Being as honest as possible about your addiction and your life circumstances will ensure that you are given the most personally beneficial forms of treatment. You can expect to be asked the following questions:


Why are you choosing to seek treatment now?
How recently have you used?
When did you first start using?
How has using impacted your life?
What is your medical or mental history?
What is your employment and living situation like?
Have you ever been to a rehab facility before?

, This is even more likely if you are in a detoxification program where treatment immediately requires the taxing physical feat of withdrawing from your drug of choice.

Identify your triggers to arousal and avoid them.,
Limit your exposure to pornographic material.,
Stash sex-objects.,
Limit your internet use.Some individuals have difficulty with watching pornography on the internet.This can be very arousing for some and can lead to difficulty abstaining from masturbation.",How to Control Your Urge to Masturbate1," Triggers to masturbation can be the thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and situations, that result in arousal or the urge to masturbate. Triggers vary in each person, but can include looking at attractive people, body parts, clothing, animals, or inanimate objects. Or, in some people this can include sounds, smells, or other sensory or thought stimulation. If you work to cope with or reduce these triggers, you may be less likely to act on your impulse (by reducing the trigger) to masturbate.


Make a list (either mental or on paper/the computer) of all of the things that trigger you to engage in masturbation. This list might include things like: looking at pornography, thinking about sex or fantasizing, looking at sex-related items, increased stress or anxiety, or difficulty sleeping.;
, There are some triggers that you can control yourself, such as looking at objects, pictures, or videos that make you feel aroused. Removing these items can drastically decrease your unintentional arousal, leading to a decrease in your impulse to masturbate.


Pornographic materials may include: DVDs, magazines, pictures, posters, sculptures, and romance novels.
Avoid driving by or entering triggering places such as: strip-clubs, brothels, or streets where prostitutes frequently hang out.

, Not only will pornographic materials naturally lead to arousal, but any object that reminds you of sexual intercourse or masturbation may lead to arousal and masturbation.


Remove or hide sex-objects that are triggering for you. These might include: condoms, lubrication (jelly or lotions), vibrators, dildos, sexy outfits, and anything else that you might have that could lead to thoughts of masturbation.

,


You can put parental controls on your computer or television through your internet/cable service which limits your ability to enter pornographic sites. Discuss this with your internet or cable provider. You don’t have to admit your issue to them because many people with children use these services to restrict their children from going to certain sites or television channels.

Do something else.,
Focus on your responsibilities.,
Change your environment.,
Exercise.,
Think about the negative effects.,
Set limits.",How to Control Your Urge to Masturbate2," Try to be as busy as possible during the day and night. Keep your mind focused on activities that do not stimulate your sexual fantasies. This will vary in each person.


Some examples of positive or distracting activities you can try are: playing video games, watching a movie (non-sexual), going for a walk, going window shopping, playing with a pet, reading a book, playing an instrument, creating art (painting, coloring, sculpting), and writing in a journal.

, Our obligations can help us focus on what is necessary (money, food, shelter, education, etc) rather than what is not essential for daily life (masturbation). Having less free-time overall can decrease your desire and actual ability to masturbate because it becomes an impractical part of your day. If you don't have time for it, you might not do it.


Make a list of the things you need to complete each day. This list might include things like: complete work or school projects, go shopping, clean bedroom, pay bills, practice the guitar, and exercise. Keep this list handy. When you have the urge to masturbate, look at your list and tell yourself, “I don’t have time to masturbate right now. I need to get all of this done today.”
Get a job if you are old enough. A job is a good distraction and can help you structure your schedule. Not to mention you'll have money to spend on activities that can distract and entertain you!

, Sometimes your environment (being home alone, or in your bedroom) can increase your desire to masturbate. Since masturbation in public is most likely inappropriate and illegal, changing your environment may help to reduce your urge to masturbate.If you have the urge to masturbate, take a walk outside or go for a drive. If you are in public it may prevent you from masturbating. Additionally, it can take your mind off of your desire to masturbate.
Ask a friend to hang out or spend time with your family. It will likely limit your ability to masturbate if you are in front of other people.

, Exercise may help reduce sexual desires.If you masturbate to reduce stress at times, exercise is a healthy alternative because it releases endorphins in your brain which make you feel happier and less stressed.


Try fun aerobic or exercise activities such as: skateboarding, swimming, hiking, biking, bowling, jumping-rope, dancing, aerobics, or yoga.

, One way to distract yourself is to remind yourself of or visualize the possible negative effects of excessive masturbationsuch as: impaired sexual function, depression, dissatisfaction in relationships, high blood pressure, increased prostate cancer risk in males, and swollen and painful prostate.Excessive vibrator use in women may result in side effects such as genital numbness, irritation, or cuts or tears.Identify the personal negative consequences of your habit of masturbating. This list might include things like difficulty completing work or school tasks, and disruption in personal relationships.

, If you really do not want to masturbate, try to focus on avoiding it when it is inappropriate to do so. This includes when you and your spouse/partner have planned intercourse soon, when you are not totally in private, when you need to be productive doing something else, or when you must save sperm for a medical test.


Set goals that are specific to your personal needs. Some individuals may want to avoid masturbation altogether for religious or cultural reasons, while others may want to reduce the amount of time they spend masturbating overall.
It is easy to lose your sense of time while masturbating. Be sure of how much time you have until your next obligation, such as work, school, etc. If you do not have enough time until your next obligation, consider putting off masturbation until later.

Lie down in bed only for sleep.,
Keep your bladder as empty as possible.,
Go to sleep when you are really tired.,
When you sleep, lay on your side.This may help to reduce your urge at the time because you are less likely to become aroused by rubbing up on something.,
Get out of bed immediately in the morning.",How to Control Your Urge to Masturbate3," Since your bedroom and bed are likely the most frequented areas for masturbation, it is important to control this environment – especially in regards to sleep and what you choose to do in your bedroom.


Do not spend time in bed doing other activities such as reading, watching TV, or using the computer.
Stay in a standing or sitting position the remainder of the time (during the day).

, The urge to urinate can be mistaken by the body as the urge for sex/masturbation. Go to the bathroom before you go to sleep at night and immediately when you wake up in the morning. Even if you feel the slightest urge to urinate, relieve yourself as soon as possible.

, This way, you will fall asleep quickly after lying down in bed and not spend time in bed trying to fall asleep. Drink a glass of milk before bed if necessary to help induce sleep.


Go to bed early and wake up early if you can.Avoid staying up too late in the night; this can lead to boredom and increase the likelihood of masturbation.
If you have trouble sleeping at night and use masturbation as means for relaxation, try deep-breathing instead. Simply breathe deeply and slowly in through your nose and out through your mouth until you fall asleep.

, Besides, most masturbation occurs either in a supine (lying on your back) or prone (lying on your belly) position.

, When you wake up in the morning at the set time, get out of bed as soon as possible and avoid lying in bed awake. Such is a time when masturbation is likely to occur.

Recognize hoarding behaviors.,
Understand underlying issues that lead to hoarding.,
Check on the hoarder frequently.,
Identify the problem.,
State your concerns in a non-judgmental manner.,
Ask for permission to help.,
Ask questions about the collected items.,
Help the hoarder establish goals.,
Avoid causing distress.,
Praise improvements.,
Find a motivation to improve.,
Develop a plan.,
Know the consequences of extended hoarding.,
Give it time.",How to Deal with a Hoarder1," People who struggle with excessive hoarding save excessive items in a disorganized manner, often creating a dangerous living environment. People who hoard are often unable to discard any items, even if they have no monetary value. They save these items out of sentimentality or due to fear that they may need the item in the future.Hoarders often create rooms in their homes that can no longer be used as they are intended due to an accumulation of clutter.
Hoarders often collect newspapers, magazines, brochures, and other documents that contain information so that they can read and digest the information at a later date, but many do not get around to actually reading the papers.
Hoarders attach strong emotions to objects and feel that possessions offer them a sense of comfort or security. They may feel as though letting go of a possession is losing a part of themselves.;
, The reasons behind hoarding vary from person to person, but hoarders consistently show an emotional or psychological connection to the items. They also exhibit a resistance to thinking or talking about the extent of the clutter., If you do not live with the hoarder, be sure to stop by to check on and socialize with him when you can. You should use your visits to determine whether conditions are improving or worsening. You may need to evaluate whether the hoarder has reached a point of being a danger to himself.

, Many hoarders may admit to being “pack rats” or wanting to keep things, but they do not understand concerns about health or safety. They may not see their behavior as problematic, and often do not realize the impact that their behaviors have on others. , You should communicate your concerns for the hoarder’s health and safety, but try not to sound judgmental.Try focusing on the health risks, including mold, dust, and cleanliness. You can also focus on environmental safety, pointing out fire hazards and blocked exits.


Try not to spend too much time focusing on the clutter or objects themselves, as this will likely cause the hoarder to become defensive.
For example, you might say “I care about you, and I am concerned for your safety. The apartment has become quite dusty and moldy, and because of the large piles everywhere, I don’t think you could get out quickly and safely in an emergency.”

, Organizing or throwing away items without the hoarder’s permission can give him serious anxiety.Instead, assure him that no one is going to enter his home and throw away his things. Offer to help sort through items or seek input from a professional organizer. Ultimately, the hoarder needs to maintain control of the decision making about what to do with items.


Try to use the language the hoarder uses to refer to the clutter. If the hoarder call the items his collection or his things, mirror the language he uses to seem more non-confrontational.

, You can gather information and try to help the hoarder by finding out more about how and why he has saved and organized the items in his possession. Try to enforce the hoarder’s feeling of control; remember, you’re trying to help, not tell him what to do.


Some examples of questions to ask include: “I notice there are a lot of books in the hallway. Why did you decide to put them there?” “I’m concerned these could be a tripping hazard in an emergency. Do you have somewhere else we could put them?” “Do you have any thoughts about how we could make this area safer?”

, Productive goals that will help the hoarder will focus on improving the quality of life and the functionality of the living space. Be sure to make the goals measurable.


Do not focus the goals on negatives (get rid of all of this junk).
Do not set vague goals like “get the house clean and organized.” A better goal would be “clear the hallway and make all exit doors easily accessible.”
Start with the bigger concerns about health and safety, then move on to smaller goals that will improve quality of life.

, It is important to be gentle and patient when working with a hoarder. Remember that hoarding is an emotional issue, and simply cleaning for a hoarder does not solve a long-term problem. You also risk violating the trust of the hoarder and losing any ground you may have gained with him.


Do not nag, force, or punish someone who is struggling with hoarding.
Do not argue or yell at a person who is hoarding. Instead, try to team up with him to work towards a goal together., Whenever the hoarder makes an effort to improve an area, praise him for his progress. You may notice a small area that has been de-cluttered or be able to see a patch of wall that wasn’t visible before. No matter how small the improvement is, it should elicit praise and positivity from you.

, While it can be difficult to externally motivate someone, you may be able to find a way for the hoarder to become motivated to improve. For example, you might suggest that he can host a party or a social gathering. This may encourage him to improve his living area before other people come over.

, A person who struggles with hoarding may not have the skills to organize and sort items themselves. If he is open to help, offer to help him organize and sort through items. You may want to gather storage containers, shelving units, boxes, and labels before you start.


Start by labeling boxes or bags with “keep,” “trash,” and “donate.” You probably need to make a space to pile items to think about or come back to.
Group similar items together. Seeing a large quantity of a single thing may help the hoarder make peace with reducing the number of a specific item. For example, if he has 100 boxes of tissue, he may be willing to reduce the number of boxes to 50. This is a small step, but it will help.
Categorize “want” and “don’t want.” You can start the “don’t want” pile with something that is an easier decision, like food items that have expired or dead plants.
Discuss where things that are to be kept will go. This may be a specific room in the house or a storage unit.

, Two key indications of hoarding are social or occupational impairment and an unsafe living environment. Left unchecked, hoarding can lead to an increasingly unsafe environment, health concerns, financial consequences, and strained relationships.Specific hazards that can result from hoarding include:

blocked exits creating fire hazards or building code violations
increased health risk for environmental irritants such as mold and dust as well health code violations
decreased hygienic habits due to inability to perform hygienic tasks such as bathing
increased isolation and avoidance of socializing
strained family relationships, child neglect, and separation or divorce



, The process of cleaning and organizing a huge accumulation of items will take a significant amount of time. This is not a problem that can be fixed in one day. It will take a long period of small, persistent efforts to organize a hoarder’s home.

Recognize your behavior for what it is.,
Accept the consequences of your gambling.,
Understand the risks of gambling.,
Be honest about your gambling.",How to Deal With a Gambling Addiction1," Admitting the problem is the first major step in dealing with it. If you first recognize the signs of your problem, you can then learn to modify your behavior.


Signs and symptoms of a gambling problem include: getting a thrill from taking gambling risks, taking increasingly bigger gambling risks over time, a preoccupation with gambling, reliving past gambling experiences (through imagination or telling stories), using gambling as a way to escape problems or negative feelings, feeling guilt or remorse after gambling, and repeated failed efforts to cut back on gambling.Additional social issues associated with gambling include: taking time away from work or family life to gamble, concealing or lying about gambling, and borrowing money or stealing to gamble.;
, Gambling excessively can cause many issues including: relationship problems, financial issues, legal problems, occupational concerns (job loss), substance use, poor health, and mental health issues (such as depression).Do you lose time from work to gamble? Do you extend yourself beyond your means by gambling away money that you have set aside to pay your rent, mortgage, or other bills? Do you use credit cards to gamble? Are you secretive about where the money's gone to after you've gambled?
Make a list of all of the consequences you have encountered due to your gambling. Also, identify people you have hurt as a result of your gambling such as family and friends.

, Knowing the risks of gambling may help encourage people who gamble to consider the consequences before deciding to gamble.


Excessive gambling can lead to depression, anxiety, aggression, increased suicide risk, relationship issues and stress-related illnesses.Gambling also increases stress levels (via the stress hormone cortisol) and your heart rate, which can lead to health risks.Pathological and addictive gambling can result in decreased decision-making skills and reduce your ability to evaluate the consequences of your actions., Don't be secretive about your finances or your gambling. Be honest with yourself and others about money spent gambling.


Pay bills immediately, when you have funds set aside to pay them.
Add up losses and keep a running tally. When you've added up losses from a gambling session, list the things that you might have purchased with that money, or other debts you could have paid down.
Admit it to yourself and others when you have gambled.

Talk to a counselor.,
Find addiction recovery resources on campus.,
Decide if you need medical help.,
Join a support group.,
Find a support network.",How to Cope with Addiction in College1," The help you get for your addiction depends on the type of addiction you have. Substance abuse problems will require different treatment methods than addiction to porn, sex, the internet, video games, or food. One way you can start getting help is to go see an addiction counselor.

A counselor can be a good first step for figuring out what kind of treatment you need for recovery.
You may go a therapist or psychologist, or you may start by going to one of the counselors who works at your college or university.;
, Many campuses have addiction recovery programs for their students. These programs are confidential, and the aim is to help college students through addiction recovery while staying in school and maintaining academic success.Check the college or university website or handbook. These resources should list any addiction recovery help the college offers.
Go talk to the college’s counseling or health services. If your college offers a recovery program, they will know about it.
Many college recovery programs offer educational sessions, 12-step programs, peer support groups, socials with others in the program, and other activities to help promote recovery, socializing with others in similar situations, and success.

, Some addictions, like severe substance abuse problems or eating disorders, may require medical help at the beginning of the recovery. You may need a medical detox or to go to an in-patient rehab center. Talk to your counselor or your doctor to help you decide if medical treatment is right for you.If you need a medical detox or to go into rehab, you need to talk to the college about working with you if you have to miss school. You may be able to miss a few classes if your treatment won’t take very long, or you may need to withdraw for the semester and come back in the next one. Talk to the school’s counselors and health professionals for advice, and discuss your situation with the dean.

, One trigger for your addiction may be loneliness or isolation. Because you are coping with addiction in college, you may feel different than your peers. You may feel like you can’t share your addiction with them or feel like you can connect with them. This may lead you to seek out your addiction to feel better. To help with this, find a support group so you can connect with others going through the same thing you are.Your campus may offer an addiction recovery program with support groups of your peers.

, If you have been spending time with friends who have the same addiction as you, they may not be happy you have decided to quit and go into recovery. They may try to pressure you back into your addiction. If you find yourself in this situation, it will help you to have a support network of people who want to see you through recovery and living a healthier lifestyle.Your support network may be your family, your boyfriend or girlfriend, or your friends who don’t have your addiction.
Don’t be afraid to ask your family or friends for help. Even if it’s just to talk during an intense craving, to help you make a good decision, or to listen when you need to vent about school.

Differentiate hoarding from collecting.,
Be patient.,
Focus on the shared nature of your home.,
Offer a compromise.,
Do not throw away hoarded belongings.",How to Deal with a Hoarder2," Collectors are people who acquire specific items. Collectors will often display these items in an organized manner. Hoarders, on the other hand, save random items and create hazardous mounds of clutter.


People who collect one type of thing—like dolls, stamps, antique end tables, figurines, etc—and organizes them in a particular way are not hoarders; they are collectors.
Do not let your own feelings about cleanliness, organization, and whether to keep important or significant items influence you to label someone who is disorganized or a collector as a hoarder., Living with a hoarder can be especially difficult, as he may become upset any time you try to clean or organize. It may be particularly difficult to get a hoarder with whom you live to assist in cleaning out clutter.

, You need to remind the hoarder that you both share a living environment. Emphasize making improvements to “our” living environment. Try not to separate “his things” from the shared space of the home.

, If your loved one is adamant that he “needs” to keep all of his things, try to establish acceptable limits in shared spaces. You may want to keep common spaces such as the living room and kitchen free of clutter, designating a particular room or rooms for storage.


You can provide space for your loved one’s things while addressing your concerns about the hoarding and maintaining your own need for a less cluttered environment.

, Discarding belongings, even if you view them as junk, can create a rift between you and your loved one. It can cause you to lose any ground you’ve made in helping the hoarder become more organized.

Recognize risk factors for hoarding behavior.,
Offer to help hire an outside party to assist with the organization.,
Encourage the hoarder to seek therapy.,
Offer to attend therapy together.,
Contact a doctor or mental health professional.",How to Deal with a Hoarder3," There are many complex factors that contribute to hoarding behavior, but many hoarders have common risk factors. Hoarders often have a family member who is also a hoarder, experience a brain injury, or undergo a stressful life event such as the death of a loved one. Some hoarding behavior also results from co-occurring mental health conditions, such as:anxiety
trauma
depression
attention deficit disorder or hyperactivity
alcohol abuse
being raised in chaotic homes
schizophrenia
dementia
excessive-compulsive disorder
personality disorders

, It may be emotional or embarrassing for the hoarder to have a family member sorting through his things. He may be more open to having a professional organizer or an objective outsider help.

, Cleaning alone will not solve most hoarding problems. Individuals suffering from hoarding disorder often need a combination of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), skills building, and medication.The particular method of CBT used with hoarders is called exposure and response prevention, which desensitizes participants to the things that they fear and reduces their responses to that fear.Medications prescribed for hoarders are often SSRI antidepressants that are used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder as well. Some of these medications include Anafranil, Zofran, Lexapro, Zoloft, Prozac, and Paxil., If you live with the hoarder or if he is a family member, you may both benefit from couples therapy, family therapy, or group therapy.Attending therapy together may encourage him to go to his therapy sessions.

, A physician may be able to give you advice about how best to work with a hoarder or convince him to seek help through therapy. Some communities also offer assistance for hoarding or mental health issues through their public health agencies.


It may be necessary for public health or animal welfare agencies to intervene with the hoarder.

Identify your triggers and cope with them.,
Don't put yourself in a position to gamble.,
Change your thinking about gambling.,
Prepare words to tell yourself when you want to gamble.,
Limit substance use.,
Increase impulse control.,
Manage your moods.",How to Deal With a Gambling Addiction2," Knowing what your triggers to gambling are can help you become better at dealing with your impulse to gamble. Triggers are thoughts, feelings, situations, and behaviors which make you want to gamble. For example, being around friends who gamble is a powerful trigger for many gamblers.


Identify your triggers by keeping a thought journal. When you have the desire to gamble, stop at that moment and write down your thoughts (possible trigger such as thinking about gambling), feelings (perhaps boredom which is a trigger to gambling), and ways you are going to cope with your trigger.
Do negative emotions such as stress or sadness lead to your gambling? If so, you may need to learn better ways to deal with these emotions.
Do you often gamble when you are looking for excitement? If so, boredom could be a big trigger for you. You may need to keep yourself busy or engage in other exciting (and safe) activities to fulfill your need for a thrill.
Try listening to music. Music may help calm and relax you in order to reduce impulsivity and deal with triggers to gamble., An individual with a gambling problem cannot gamble sensibly because the addict may be hooked on the adrenaline rush associated with ""the chase."" It is difficult to be in control if you are preoccupied with the feeling you get from an activity.


If friends suggest a trip to the casino, be honest with yourself and with others about the fact that, for you, gambling has gone beyond being recreational. Suggest another activity or opt out of this particular one.
At the earlier stages of recovery, avoid even driving past a gambling hall.
Avoid going to places that encourage gambling such as Las Vegas, Nevada. If you surround yourself with gambling it can make it very difficult to resist the urge to make a bet.

, Negative thinking habits such as irrational beliefs, the illusion of control, and the gamblers fallacy can lead to increases in gambling behaviors.Reduce these negative thoughts by identifying them and modifying them.


The illusion of control is common in people who gamble. It is the belief that you can somehow control the outcome of the game. In order to counter this thought, remind yourself that no strategy or trick can control the outcome; it is impossible to control the game (whether it be cards, online poker, betting on a sports game or horse race, or using slot machines). Each throw of the dice is independent and random.
The gamblers fallacy is when someone believes that a random event is less likely to happen due to a previous event. For example, a person may believe that his chances of losing a game of cards is less likely because he just lost; therefore, he believes it is more likely that he will win this time around. However, statistically speaking, the odds are exactly the same as before.
Superstitious thinking is also a common thinking habit associated with gambling. You may believe that random incidents have meaning. For example, if you are betting at the horse race track, perhaps you always pick a certain horse with a particular name because you believe it is lucky. Remind yourself that superstitious thinking occurs due to random events that occur together; it does not actually mean something is lucky.
Reduce risk-taking behaviors by thinking logically about the consequences and outcome of the situation.When you want to gamble, think about how much money you have lost and are likely to lose if you make a bet.

, Planning on what to tell yourself when you feel the urge to gamble can help ensure that you have a strategy when the time comes; this strategy can help you limit or eradicate your gambling.You can start by telling yourself, “It is too risky to gamble. I know that if I start I won’t be able to stop. I need to avoid it altogether.”
Explore different ideas of things to tell yourself and pick the ones that work best for you. You can write them down on index cards if you are likely to forget them. Then you can take them out and read them out loud when you have the urge to gamble.

, Substance use including alcohol and other drugs have been linked to increased gambling behaviors.When you drink alcohol and use other substances, this lowers your inhibition and decreases your ability to make logical decisions.


Avoid drinking too much alcohol. A few drinks may be fine depending on your tolerance and weight, but being inebriated is a big risk factor for problem gambling. Your coping resources and ability to resist urges will be significantly decreased if you are intoxicated.

, Some gamblers may have a distinct problem with impulse control.Impulses are like cravings, they are automatic urges to do something such as gambling.


When you have an impulse to gamble, stop and take a breath instead of acting immediately.
Take a step back a observe your thoughts and feelings. What thoughts are you having? What feelings do you have?
Identify ways to cope or alternative activities to engage in. Practice what works for you.

, Moods, especially depression and anxiety, may be a direct link to gambling behaviors in some gamblers.Learn better ways to cope with your negative emotions.


Try managing your emotions by writing them down, expressing them through art or dance, or talking to someone about them.

Get social support.,
Join a support group.,
Talk to a therapist.,
Explore different types of treatment.,
Consider medication.",How to Deal With a Gambling Addiction3," Social support is an integral component of recovery from gambling.Tell your family about your issue if they do not already know about it. You could say something like, ""I want you to know that I have been having a problem resisting gambling. I know it has caused problems for me in my life and I want to stop. I would appreciate your support.""
Talk to friends about the issue and keep them informed. They can help you avoid triggers to gambling. You could say something like, ""Hey, I just want to let you know I've been having an issue with gambling too much and I want to cut down. If you could support me in this that would be helpful for me."" This way, your friends will understand if you don't want to go on that trip to a casino or Las Vegas.

, Support groups can provide you with a safe environment to discuss your issue with gambling. It may also help you enjoy a congregation of individuals with similar struggles which can be very comforting and make you feel less alone in your recovery process.


For example, Gamblers Anonymous is a 12-step program that meets internationally and has helped many people with their gambling issue., Your gambling may be out of control if: it's affecting your relationships, finances, or work or school life, you're devoting more and more time and energy to gambling, you've unsuccessfully tried to stop or cut back on your gambling, you try to conceal your gambling from family or others, you resort to theft or fraud to get gambling money, or if you ask others to bail you out of financial woes because you've gambled money away.These types of issues can add up, and professional help is out there if you are open to it.


Contact your health insurance for a list of approved therapists. If you do not have health insurance you can conduct a search for low-cost, sliding scale, or free mental health clinics in your neighborhood.
Ask questions of your therapist such as: What's the best approach to my gambling problem? Should I see a psychiatrist, psychologist, addiction counselor or other mental health provider?, Knowing what types of treatments are available can help you make a decision on what type may be best for you and your needs.


Behavior therapy is a common form of treatment for gambling issues. This type of treatment uses systematic exposure to the behavior you want to unlearn (gambling) and teaches you skills to reduce your urge to gamble.
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is another effective form of therapy which focuses on identifying unhealthy, irrational and negative beliefs and replacing them with healthy, positive ones., Taking prescribed medications is an option if you find that your efforts to control your gambling have not worked. Antidepressants and mood stabilizers may help treat conditions that often coincide with a gambling addiction, but may not directly treat the gambling itself.Discuss options for medication with your doctor (general practitioner) or psychiatrist.

Identify the symptoms.,
Admit you are addicted.,
Seek support from peers.,
Talk to a therapist.",How to Beat Adrenaline Addiction1," Because your body produces adrenaline, it may be hard to become aware of the addiction. The best way to see if you have an adrenaline addiction may be to actually stop all activity and see how you feel. If you normally go rock climbing or BMX racing, hold off for now. Shut off your electronics, take some time off of work, and try to spend a day or two just relaxing — can you do it? Adrenaline addicts may experience withdrawal symptoms when unable to engage in novel, stimulating, or high-risk activities.Do you often feel bored, restless, or under-stimulated? Do you find yourself bored with what normal people would consider intense or stimulating experiences?Are you drawn to ""extreme"" sports or activities? This may include rock climbing, bungee jumping, skydiving, riding a motorcycle, racing cars, skateboarding, MMA fighting, traveling to unsafe areas, snowboarding, or anything that could be considered a dangerous or risky activity.
Are you in a particularly dangerous line of work or a high-stress position, such as a firefighter?
Are you willing to take major risks to your health and safety to experience something novel?
If this sounds like you, you may have an adrenaline addiction.;
, Like any addiction, change cannot be initiated until the addict admits that they have a problem. Not only do you need to admit that you have a problem, but you also need to have a sincere desire to fix the problem.Once you have acknowledged the problem and you have decided to fix it, do not hesitate to get support from a therapist to help you recover from your addiction.

, Let your peers, coworkers, and family members know that you are trying to overcome your addiction. They can encourage your efforts and help keep you accountable.


Say, for example: ""I have realized that I'm taking a lot of risks with my health and safety because I'm looking for an adrenaline rush. I am trying to learn to meet this need in a healthy way, and would appreciate it if you help me refrain from any dangerous activities.""

, A therapist can help you identify and confront underlying issues that are causing the addiction. Underlying issues can range from self-esteem and self-confidence issues, to traumatic experiences, anxiety disorders.Your therapist can also help you make lifestyle changes to channel your thrill-seeking behavior into constructive and positive activities and manage symptoms of withdrawal.


Adrenaline addiction is not totally understood. It is possible your adrenaline addiction was not caused by an incident, but simply means your brain processes stimuli differently from those who prefer more stability and structure."

Make a list of triggers.,
Avoid trigger situations.,
Prepare for vulnerable times of day.,
Refrain from giving in to peer pressure.,
Take an advocate with you.,
Think about how you will feel after you use.,
Learn how to manage academic triggers.",How to Cope with Addiction in College2," You have enough stress as a college student. You don’t want to add more stress by knowingly putting yourself into contact with things that trigger your addiction. Make a list of people, places, things, or situations that trigger your addiction. Keep this list with you and work on avoiding these situations.For example, if you have an alcohol addiction, you may want to add bars or parties to your list. If you have a drug addiction, parties or certain people may need to be on there.
For food addictions, you may write down going to the dining hall alone, or for a gaming addiction, you may add names of friends who encourage you to spend all your time playing video games.

, After you make your list of triggers, you will see that there are people, places, and situations that trigger your addiction. These people may encourage you to give in to your addiction, the places may make it easier to partake in your addiction, or the situation may lead to problematic behavior. Now that you have identified the triggers, you should actively avoid them.On your road to recovery, you may need to change things about your life to avoid any triggers. You may need to find new friends who participate in healthier activities that won’t lead to your addictive behavior.
Find alternate social situations or activities that don’t lead to unhealthy behaviors. For example, instead of going to parties where drugs and alcohol may be everywhere, you may instead go bowling, to the movies, to dinner, or camping with friends.

, The end of the day is the worst for your addiction cravings. At the end of the day, you are tired from a long day of classes, work, or internships. You may be run down, you may be irritated because of a tough assignment, or you may be frustrated with a friend. No matter how you feel at the end of the day, you should be prepared for potential triggers.You can’t control your day. However, you can control what you do and how you respond to these emotional triggers.
Come up with a way to fight cravings on these nights. This may be relaxation techniques, a night in watching movies, or hanging out with a friend.

, If you have an addiction in college, you may find yourself in many situations where you will face peer pressure to give into your addiction. Your friends may try to convince you at a party to drink or do drugs, or your friends may want you to share drinks with them at dinner. When you are coping with an addiction, be strong and don’t let others encourage you to give in.For example, you may have to tell your friends, “I’m sorry, I don’t drink. But we can still have fun” or “I’ll come to the party, but I won’t do drugs or drink.”
If you find yourself surrounded by people who keep trying to get you to give into your addiction, walk away.

, When you go out, you may need to take someone with you who will be your advocate. This person will know about your addiction, and they will be there to help you stay strong and not give in to your addiction. This person may be firm with you or remind you of your goals.


You and your friend should discuss ahead of time what they should do if you start to give into problematic behavior.
For example, your friend may pull you aside and say, “You don’t want to do this. You are stronger than this. You do not need to drink this” or “You gave me permission to remind you of how you should not be doing this activity. If you cannot handle being around the substance, we should leave.”

, If you have a craving or are tempted to partake in your addictive behavior, think about what will happen afterwards. How will you feel afterwards? Will you feel good? Or will you feel bad about yourself and disappointed because you gave into the addiction? Thinking about the consequences and the time after the temporary high can help you avoid giving in.Think about the disappointment and broken trust of the people who have been helping you overcome your addiction.
Remember the negatives connected to your addiction: feeling sick, grades slipping, social isolation, missing class, or losing chunks of time.

, If academic stress is your trigger, it can cause a potential problem. You don't want to drop out, but you also have to take care of yourself. You can start by talking to professors or campus counselors for help, creating an organized plan for your semester work, and learning to manage your stress.


Create a class management schedule. This schedule helps you manage your time, so that you can have enough time for class, studying, homework, work, and any social activities. Being organized and managing your time is one of the most important things for reducing stress while in school.
Lighten your load if you have to. Consider taking one less class, getting involved in one less club or activity, or cut a few hours at work each week. Don't overload yourself because that could lead to emotional exhaustion and cause you to give into your addiction.
Find academic buddies. These are people who can study with you, help you stay organized and on schedule, and support you if you are having a bad day.

Distract yourself from powerful emotions.,
Find a way to relieve stress.,
Try breathing exercises.,
Consider meditation.,
Exercise.",How to Cope with Addiction in College3," Powerful emotions can be dangerous when you are trying to recover from drug and alcohol addiction, but the stress of college can make powerful emotions arise frequently. One of the best things you can do when you experience a powerful emotion is to distract yourself from it.You can do this in a number of ways, such as by:

Going for a long walk, run, or bike ride.
Calling a friend to talk.
Reading a book or writing in a journal.
Watching a movie or favorite TV show.
Visiting the library and getting started on a project or studying for an exam.

, One reason you may turn to drugs, alcohol, or video games while you are in college is because you cannot deal with the stress that accompanies all your responsibilities. You may use your addiction to relax and relieve tension. One of the main reasons for addiction and relapses is an inability to deal with stress in a healthy way.You may have large course loads, jobs, extra-curriculars, social obligations, and family responsibilities. Instead of turning to an addiction, find healthy ways to relieve stress.One of the main ways you can cope with addiction is to learn how to relax. You must make this a habit and daily routine. If you don’t learn how to relax, all of the pressures of quitting your addiction and college will cause tension and stress, and you may relapse to try and relieve the stress.
The stress relief technique that helps another person may not help you. You have to discover a healthier way to reduce your stress than your addiction. This may include listening to soothing music, exercising, spending time with friends, yoga, or watching television., Deep breathing is an easy, effective relaxation technique. You can practice deep breathing anywhere, even in a crowd full of people or in the middle of class. You should work on breathing from your abdomen instead of your chest. Place a hand on your belly as you breathe in. If you are breathing properly, your hand will move as your belly expands outwards.Start by sitting straight in a comfortable position. Place one hand on your belly and the other on your chest. Take a deep inhale through your nose, which should cause the hand on your belly to move outward. Exhale through your mouth. Try to exhale as much air as possible while your belly goes back flat.
Once you get the hang of this, inhale to a count of four, hold for a count of four, then exhale for a count of four.
When you learn to belly breathe, you don’t have to place your hand on your stomach and can do these breathing exercises anywhere.

, Meditation is a great way to relieve stress. Meditation is easy and can be done in a few minutes each day. To try mindful meditation, sit or lay in a quiet room with no distractions. Turn on soothing music or keep it quiet. Focus on the now, on the sounds around you, the feeling of your body, and your breath as you inhale and exhale. Don’t think about the past or the future. Just stay present in the moment.You can sit or lay in a quiet room and repeat a word or mantra to yourself. Think of a word, phrase, or saying that can help you keep focused on your recovery or stay positive. Repeat this mantra over and over to yourself.
As you practice mindfulness, let yourself feel any emotions. Your recovery may cause you to feel a lot of emotions. As you sit or lay in the quiet room, let those emotions pass through your without judgment. Just name them as they float through your brain and then out again.
You can find guided meditation audio and video files online to help you with meditation if you are unsure how to do it.

, Exercise is one of the best ways to relieve stress and fight against any depression or anxiety that accompanies your addiction and recovery. Exercises increases the endorphins in your brain, which makes you feel better. It also helps you feel better about yourself and increases your self-esteem. Exercise also promotes a healthier lifestyle by keeping you active and helping you maintain a healthy weight.Try walking, jogging, sports, cycling, dance, yoga, kickboxing, or strength training. Go for a hike or kayaking. Join a gym or take a class offered by your college’s athletic department. Join a group activity, like kickball or recreational softball.
See if your friends want to get together and exercise. Exercise can be more fun and challenging if you do it in a group.
Use your exercise time as a time to be alone and regroup. Put on your favorite music or an audiobook as you go for a jog, lift weights, or use the elliptical.

Exercise.,
Meditate.,
Use deep breathing techniques.,
Try self-hypnosis.,
Check out neurofeedback.",How to Beat Adrenaline Addiction2," When you begin to feel the adrenaline coursing through your body, one of the best things you can do is exercise. Exercise may allow you to dispense the excess energy that is a result of the adrenaline rush; however, you must be careful not to over-exercise.Limit your exercise to a 40-minute maximum, and do a combination of weights, i.e., strengthening exercises, and cardio. Aim for three 40-minute workouts per week.
Yoga is a great exercise because it burns up excess energy and relaxes the mind when done properly and consistently.

, Meditation will help you relax and improve your sense of happiness and control. Therefore, by learning how to meditate properly you may be able to reduce your body’s production of adrenaline. There are a variety of meditation techniques, so pick one that is aimed at helping people relax.Meditate for 15 minutes in the morning and before you go to sleep.

, Deep breathing techniques are great for curbing your adrenaline and regaining control in the moment. When you feel that your adrenaline is spiking, slow down and focus on your breathing.Stop what you are doing and place one hand on your stomach and one on your chest. Inhale through your mouth. As you exhale, let your shoulder and upper body muscles relax. Then, slowly inhale through your nose while thrusting your stomach out. Hold your breath for a one or two seconds. Exhale through your mouth while sucking your stomach in. Repeat this technique until you feel relaxed., Self-hypnosis and/or guided imagery is helpful for people who have trouble falling asleep at night because of adrenaline spikes. You can purchase hypnosis downloads specifically for adrenaline addicts, or you can listen to guided sessions on YouTube for free.Download the self-hypnosis tapes onto your phone or iPod, or simply look up videos on YouTube. When searching for videos on YouTube type in the search bar, “relaxation hypnosis,” “relaxation meditation,” or “guided imagery for sleeping.”

, Neurofeedback, also called EEG Biofeedback, helps some patients overcome their addiction. Neurofeedback helps to re-set the natural rhythms in the brain. When your brain's natural rhythms are re-set, you are able to change behaviors and thoughts more easily.Contact a neurofeedback trainer or professional in your area. A typical session lasts 30 minutes. The professional will place sensors to your head which are attached to a special software that reads brainwaves. You will then be given relaxing music to listen to. When you hear a skip in the music, this is the machine re-setting the natural rhythms in your brain.
You may also be able to experiment with biofeedback at home. A biofeedback device may help you feel calmer in just 15 minutes."

Limit your adventure-seeking.,
Avoid stimulants.,
Reduce your use of technology.,
Sleep at regular times.,
Maintain a proper diet.,
Stay hydrated.",How to Beat Adrenaline Addiction3," As an adrenaline addict, you may find yourself craving to participate in activities that are high-risk or of a more extreme nature — say, cliff jumping or skydiving. To beat adrenaline addiction, limit how often you partake in these thrill-seeking activities. Work with your therapist to determine the best way for you to deal with these cravings, such as going for a run or engaging in biofeedback.

, Stimulants exacerbate any type of addiction, including adrenaline addiction. If you are serious about overcoming your addiction you will need to wean yourself off of and eventually stop consuming chemical and food stimulants. Stimulants like coffee, energy drinks, sugary foods/candy, cocaine, Adderall, and other stimulating substances should be avoided.

, For adrenaline addicts, technology is also considered a stimulant. While it is not feasible to cut technology from your life completely, you can reduce the amount of time you spend using electronic devices. Therefore, significantly reduce the amount of time you spend on your phone and computer, watching TV, and playing video games.


Stop using your electronics one hour before your sleep so you can fall asleep without distractions.

, In order for your body to function properly, it is recommended that you get at least seven to eight hours of sleep per night. It is also important that you go to bed and wake up at a consistent time every day. Consistency allows your body to actually relax while you sleep.If you sleep for six hours or less every night, your cortisol and adrenaline levels will amplified throughout the day.

, Eat a balanced diet of protein, fruits and vegetables, and carbohydrates. Try to steer way from processed foods and choose more natural foods instead. A diet that mainly consists of carbohydrates can increase your cortisol and adrenaline levels.Your meal should consist of a third of fruits and vegetables, a third of protein, and a little under a third of carbohydrates. Try to eat at least two portions of fish per week.

, Drinking an adequate amount of water each day is also a part of maintaining a healthy diet. Keeping your body hydrated will help it process the adrenaline out of your body. It is recommended that men drink 13 cups (3 liters) and women drink 9 cups (2.2 liters) of water per day."

Know that you can't overdose on marijuana or psychedelics.,
Avoid high-stress places and situations.,
Hang out with people you're comfortable around.,
Don't assume that people can tell you are high.,
Take your mind off of the high.,
Understand the risk of overdose from ""hard"" drugs.",How to Come Down from a High1," For someone who hasn't been high very often before, the experience can sometime be scary. It can feel like you're losing control of your mind and body or even like you're having an overdose. Luckily, for some drugs, overdose is impossible. If you're high on marijuana or a psychedelic drug like LSD, mushrooms, or peyote, you can't overdose, so don't worry!These drugs can make you less coordinated and give you poor judgement, however, so you will never want to do anything physically dangerous when high on them (like drive a car, operate machinery, use a gun, etc.);
, When you're high, your surroundings can have a big effect on the way you feel. If you're in a relaxing, calm place, it's easier to feel good, and if you're in a scary, stressful place, it's easier to feel panicked or stressed. If you've got a case of the jitters, try going somewhere relaxing and comfortable, like your room or a comfortable chair in your basement. Try listening to relaxing music or watching a movie or TV show you love. Don't go somewhere that makes you nervous or agitated, like a crowded mall or a loud nightclub.

, Good people can make it much easier to enjoy your high. If your high is making you nervous, try to surround yourself with people you know and trust. Close friends who are also high are usually your best bet. However, in the right situations, a trusted family member, a boyfriend/girlfriend, or a close friend who isn't high can be a good choice as well.


Everyone's different, so listen to your intuition — if someone makes you relaxed when you're high, stay with this person, and if someone makes you nervous or upset, stay away from this person.

, People who are high often worry about the idea of other people who aren't high ""discovering"" their highness. In reality, it's a lot harder for people to tell that you're high than you may think. People usually won't assume that another person is high unless they have good reason to, even if they're acting a little weird. Most high people are almost impossible to tell apart from non-high people unless you're specifically looking for it, which almost no one is, so don't worry! Take a deep breath, relax, and be yourself — no one's going to find out.

, When the effects of a high are making it hard to act normal, worrying usually makes the problem worse. Since it's tough to force yourself not to worry, instead, try doing something to distract yourself. Concentrating on something besides the fact that you're high can make you much more relaxed and focused. In fact, you may forget that you're high in the first place. Here are just a few ideas for taking your mind off of your high:


Listen to music.
Watch a movie you like.
Read.
Do something with your hands (like playing with Legos, drawing, or writing).
Find something interesting nearby to look at (like a plant, a piece of art, or some interesting architecture)

, Most people who are nervous from their high are absolutely fine and aren't in any danger. However, some drugs are dangerous and can hurt you if you overdose. To stay safe, it's important to know the signs of overdose for these drugs. This knowledge can also help you stay relaxed — if you don't have these symptoms, you're probably fine. Overdose symptoms for a few ""hard"" drugs are listed below:


MDMA/Ecstasy/Molly: Overheating, extremely high heart rate, dehydration, cardiac arrest, strokeCocaine: Overheating, extremely high heart rate, seizures, nausea, difficulty breathing, chest painsHeroin: Difficult breathing, no breathing, weak pulse, coma, bluish skinMethamphetamine: Extreme agitation, chest pains, cardiac arrest, extremely high heart rate, paranoia, stomach painOpiate painkillers (codeine, Oxycontin, vicodin, etc.): difficulty breathing, nausea, weak or very slow pulse, ""choking"" sounds from breathing, bluish skin, limp body, difficulty speaking"

Decide to change.,
Reduce your load.,
Discover new activities.,
Set goals.,
Stay positive.",How to Cope with Addiction in College4," One of the hardest things to do when coping with addiction is to actually make the decision to stop your addiction and change your life. In college, this can be difficult. You are away from your parents, living on your own for maybe the first time, and surrounded by temptation and stress. Even so, you can make the decision to stand strong and change your life.As you cope with your addiction, you will probably have to change a lot of things. You may have to change who you hang out with, what you do on the weekends, and how you deal with the stress of college.
You may decide to refocus your priorities. For example, you may decide to put school first, and then do something you’ve never done before, like learning a new skill, sport, or hobby.

, College should be challenging, but there may come a time when you have put too much on your plate. Maybe you have taken too many classes, or you have one too many jobs or internships. Because of this course load, you may have turned to drugs to help keep you awake, or you drink because you can’t handle the stress. Reduce the amount of stuff on your plate to help take some of the pressure off of yourself.College is the time to challenge yourself, but you don’t have to do it all. If the pressure and inability to meet your obligations has led you to an unhealthy addiction, you should take a step back and focus on getting yourself back on the right track.

, One way to help you fight addiction and cravings is to find new ways to occupy yourself. In college, there are many different opportunities for you to try new things. You can get involved in campus clubs, join an intramural sport, or take a class in something you know nothing about.Trying new things is a good way to meet new people who are not connected to your addiction. You also can start spending your time doing things that have nothing to do with your previous addiction as you move forward with your life.

, One way to help yourself on your road to recovery is to look towards the future. Set goals for things you want to do. Take this time to focus on yourself and bettering yourself instead of going back to your addiction. Your goals don’t have to be large or life-altering. They just need to be something you can achieve to make yourself feel better.For example, you may set a goal to make a higher grade on your next exam, try one new activity each month, make one healthy diet change each week, or exercise one additional day each week.

, College is a difficult time, and you may feel even more challenges as you cope with addiction. But thinking negatively is not healthy. Negative thinking may lead to depression or anxiety, which can lead to cravings or relapses. Instead, stay positive. You are doing something to change your life for the better. Even if the successes are small, they’re still there. You deserve to stay positive.Even if your classes are getting difficult, you’re not doing as well in them as you want, or you’re not as social as you used to be, remember to focus on the good that has come into your life instead of the negative.
Recovery is a series of small positives. If you have to, write down the positive things that have happened or your successes every day.

Consider treatment.",How to Beat an Addiction to Cell Phones," According to one study, college students may spend 8-10 hours per day on their cell phones. Tracking your cell phone use such as adding up how many times per hour you check your phone can increase your awareness about your problem. If you are aware of the extent of your problem you can begin to identify goals and possible solutions.


Try downloading an application that tracks your cell phone use like Checky. You can use this information to set a specific goal of how many times per hour or day you allow yourself to check your phone.;
, Limit your cell phone use to certain times of the day. You can set an alarm on your phone to alert you when you have reached your maximum time. For example, you can allow yourself to use your phone only from 6pm-7pm. You can also set up specific times not to use your phone, such as while you are at work or school. Write your plan and goals down to make them more concrete. Keep a log of which goals you’ve met and ones you are still working on.

, This concept is called positive self-reinforcement and it is used in therapy in order to teach an individual positive behaviors through use of a reward system. For example, if you meet your cell phone use goal for the day you can treat yourself to your favorite food, a new item, or an activity.

, Instead of going cold turkey and completely eliminating your cell phone use (which can be very anxiety provoking), begin by progressively reducing the amount of time you spend checking your phone. For example, start by limiting the amount you check your phone to once per 30 minutes, then once per 2 hours, as so on.


Keep a tally of how many times you check your phone per hour.
Use your phone only for necessary communications or emergencies.

, Put your phone somewhere where you will not see it. Turn your phone on silent mode when you are at work, study or anywhere else, so it won't distract you. , Cut cell phone use out of your life completely for a short period of time such as a weekend. Go on a trip or camping where there will be no cell service. This forces you to be off of your phone.
You can notify your friends and loved ones that you are going off the grid for a short time. This can be easily accomplished on social media.

, There are settings on your phone that may alert you every time you get an email or Facebook notification. Make sure you turn these off! This will reduce the amount of times your phone goes off or vibrates. This way you are not being notified every time something occurs. Settle for a pay-as-you-go plan as a last resort. It's similar to a portable pay phone and a calling card in one - in order to use a certain amount of minutes, you'll need to pay for that amount. It then disables your phone when you reach the maximum of minutes.

, Changing your thoughts may help alter your emotions and behaviors. In other words, if you change your thinking about your cell phone you can feel better and use your cell phone less.


Remind yourself that whatever you are wanting to check on your phone is not that important and can wait.Next time you feel the need to use it step back and think, ""Do I really need to call/text this person right now or can it wait until later?""

, Mindfulness, the art of being aware, can help you become centered and possibly reduce the impulse to engage in cell phone use. Try to be in the present moment by focusing on what is currently going on, including your own thoughts and reactions. , Triggers are your feelings and thoughts about a situation that lead to a certain behavior (cell phone use). Learning why you are urged to use your cell phone can help you develop alternative options.Are you on your cell phone because you have a strong desire to be social and connect with others? If so, you can fulfill your needs in ways that last longer such as face-to-face contact.
Are you simply bored? Boredom can be a huge trigger for individuals to engage in addictive behaviors. If you are often bored, it may be time to develop hobbies or other activities that sustain your attention.

, Using your cell phone has been linked to increases in mood, which positively reinforces cell phone use. Instead of using your phone to feel better, engage in alternative activities such as exercise/sports or creative activities such as writing or drawing.

, If you have a specific plan for each day and you are focusing on your responsibilities, you will have less time to spend on your phone. The bonus is that you will spend more time focusing on your goals and being productive.


If you are not employed you can apply to jobs or volunteer at a local organization.
Try taking up a new hobby like knitting, sewing or playing an instrument.
Spend more time doing things that need to be finished, whether it's chores or parents wanting a family day or time together.

, Try to do something constructive instead of using your phone the next time you feel the urge. Focus on your own personal goals and objectives for the day. Make a list of tasks that do not involve your phone and any time you have the impulse to check your phone, stop and gently redirect your attention to your responsibilities. , Much of our desire to be on the phone comes from our innate and evolutionary drive to be social beings. However, there are other options to be social which may be more beneficial and satisfying in the long-term. Instead of texting, write a letter, or meet up with a friend for coffee or a meal.
Instead of blasting your photos on Instagram, invite a family member over and physically show them your memories. This type of connection may result in an increase in quality intimacy.

, Think of each reason you use your cell phone (games, texting, phone calls). Some of these habits may be necessary to your work and daily life (perhaps work emails, etc), while others could be disrupting your life if they take away from your normal interactions and responsibilities. Attempt to replace each of these disruptive habits into more productive, social, and quality experiences.


If one of your issues is excessively playing games on your phone, think of an alternative such as inviting a friend over to play a board game.
If you spend too much time looking at profiles on social media, meet up with a close friend or family member and ask them about what is going on in their life (instead of simply reading about it online).

, Social support is a crucial component of mental health. Having a positive social network produces feelings of safety and connectedness. These components are important when considering limiting your cell phone use, since your use is likely to be at least partly based on social connection (such as texting, using social applications). While cell phone use may feel positive, it can actually limit us and close us off from intimate relationships.


Simply tell your family and friends that you think you are using your cell phone too much and you are working on cutting down. You can explain that you would appreciate if they support you in this process. Additionally, you could give them specific suggestions and involve them in your plan. For example, ask them to call or text you only at certain times of the day.
Ask for advice. Your family members know you personally and may be able to help you devise a specific plan on cutting down your phone use.

, Let your family and friends know that you may not text, call, or email them back right away since you are attempting to cut down your cell phone use. If they are aware of the situation they are more likely to be understanding and not be upset.

, Instead of getting social support mostly through your cell phone, it is important to engage on a personal and intimate level. This can only be fully accomplished in person. Plan an activity with family or friends. Spend your limited cell phone time researching and planning this event. This way your energy is being used in a productive and meaningful way.

, This can be especially helpful during times when you feel strong urges to use your phone including after school, after dinner, and during the weekend.

, While cell phone addiction is not yet a widely recognized diagnosis, this does not mean that you cannot get help. There are treatment centers and counselors that specialize in these types of issues. If your cell phone problem is severe and disrupts your daily life and functioning, counseling or mental health treatment may be helpful.


Some signs that you may need help are if you are unable to complete your responsibilities (work, school, home), or if your interpersonal relationships are significantly negatively affected by your cell phone use.
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a type of treatment that is used for a wide variety of conditions and addictions. It focuses on changing your thoughts in order to change your feelings and behaviors. CBT may be a helpful option if you choose to seek treatment.

Avoid negative reinforcement and physical punishment.,
Create positive reinforcement.,
Evaluate the problem.",How to Avoid Pornography1," If you find that pornography is ending up on your computer, either willingly or unwillingly, you’ll want to start avoiding pornography by cleaning up your computer. You’ll want to start by deleting any pornography saved onto the computer itself. After that, there are a few other things you can do, depending on the problem that you’re having:


Clear your browser. Clear your browser’s cache, history, as well as your Google search history. If your computer remembers you visiting porn sites (even if it was by accident), it will think you want more porn and display more advertisements for pornography and unsafe sites.
Check for viruses. If you notice that you get porn pop-ups even when you’re visiting trusted sites or maybe even as soon as you open your internet browser, you might have a computer virus. Call an expert to get the virus removed and then install anti-virus software that can protect you for the future.
Be careful about what search terms you use and websites you visit. Some phrases are frequently attached to pornography and some websites are more likely to give you viruses and lead to pornography. Turn on Google Safe Search to protect from unsafe searches and try to only visit sites that you absolutely trust.;
, There are a number of ways in which you can set up a censor that will keep you and others safe from pornography on the internet. You can block all but a few sites, only sites that are marked for adults, or you can just block certain sites. Choose a method that is right for your needs:


Use StayFocused. StayFocused is a browser add-on for Chrome browsers that allows you to control what websites you can access and how much time you can spend on those sites. It’s great for policing your own behavior, if you’re the one struggling with porn.
Alternatively use Stop Procrastinating App that allows you to block internet access or filter websites on all web browsers, not just Chrome. It is impossible to get around and also offers users goal setting options to help them focus psychologically on breaking their addiction.

Use Microsoft’s built-in content filter. If you’re trying to protect your family and you have a Windows Computer, take advantage of Microsoft’s built in parental controls. These are powerful controls that you can set to whatever the needs are for your family.Set up OpenDNS to block all objectionable content across all devices in your home. You can set up the OpenDNS software, which is available for free, to block all objectionable content in your household. This is the program frequently used by schools and it functions very well for protecting your family., Certain types of media will be more likely to subject you and other people to objectionable or dangerous material. Because of this, you might want to limit how much you use certain kinds of media. Movies are easy to choose because of their ratings, but TV might be harder to control. Limit the channels you receive and make sure to do your research on a show before deciding if it’s right for you and your family. Internet is the hardest of all to regulate, so make use of a censor or significantly limit how much your family uses the internet and where that internet usage happens.


For example, did you know that YouTube has a content filter that can help you protect yourself and your family from adult content on that site? Scroll to the bottom of any YouTube page and you’ll see a button that says “Safety: Off”. Click on that and YouTube will be instantly safer!

, Move any computers in your home into family spaces and keep an open door policy for any private rooms where computers will be staying. This open policy will help keep all family members, yourself included, honest and allow them to better control urges and bad habits.


So, for example, move your son’s computer from his bedroom and into a corner of the living room.

, Certain public spaces may be more prone to displaying offensive material in readily visible places. For every area this will be different, but if you find that you’re exposed to the materials while out in public, it might be a good idea to think about how you can change your where your time is spent.


For example, downtown areas and city-outskirts are known for attracting more objectionable material than other parts of cities.
If you know you tend to see this problematic material while driving or walking to work, for example, try changing your route.

, We’ll often hear the advice to snap a rubber band at our wrist when trying to stop our own bad habits or that we should physically punish our kids if they don’t stay away from material we find objectionable, but at least when it comes to watching pornography, you’re going to want to stay away from these practices. They work because they cause the person being punished to associate pain, discomfort, shame, and humiliation with whatever they’re being punished for. When these feelings are applied to sex, however, they create unhealthy feelings and may even prevent the person from having normal sexual interaction in the future. Avoid negative reinforcement for any kind of sexual practice as much as possible.

, Whether you’re trying to keep yourself away from pornography or you’re trying to help your family, using positive will be much more effective at creating the behaviors you want to see.


For example, reward your teenage son with extra spending money for very week where he spends less than 5 hours on the computer.
You can give yourself positive reinforcement too: try giving yourself a piece of candy every day that you don’t view pornography.

, It’s also important to really understand the problem that you’re having. Sometimes, viewing pornography might not be as bad as you think it is. You should look at your situation from an outsider perspective and really decide if you want to go to really great lengths to control the situation.


For example, if your son is having trouble with viewing pornography, it might be that this is just a phase. Increased sexual feelings at a young age are normal and pornography might be a safer outlet for releasing those feelings than if he stopped and then went looking for release elsewhere. You might want to just let him be, but at least offer him some advice about why pornography can give you bad ideas about sex and why it’s important not to let it control your life.
If you’re worried, for example, that you’re just seeing objectionable material through no fault of your own and what that could mean for your religious life, talk to your spiritual adviser. Many religions teach that transgressions which are out of our control are not our fault.

Understand that you deserve help.,
Define your stealing behaviors.,
Write out your feelings.,
Determine the consequences.",How to Stop Your Addiction to Stealing1," It is important to know that you are worthy because many individuals with guilt (including shame about stealing) may not believe that they deserve help.This often prevents them from seeking assistance. You do deserve help and understanding, and you are not alone.;
, It is important to first identify the specific reasons why you steal in order to begin to change this behavior.Do you steal for an emotional high? Do you feel initial tension, then a thrill of excitement that builds up prior to the theft and relief after it's done? Is this then followed by feeling guilt, shame and remorse? These are some signs that stealing may be a problem for you.
Do you steal to escape? When stealing, do you feel different, as if you're not yourself or you're not in touch with reality? This is a fairly common state of feeling for individuals who steal.

, After you've discovered what drives your stealing behaviors, try free writing about your need to steal. Don't censor your feelings – everything you think about or feel is important to note.Be sure to name the feelings, such as anger, fear, sadness, loneliness, being creeped out, exposed, vulnerable, etc. that accompany the need to steal.

, Thinking about the consequences of your behaviors can help to reduce impulsivity.If you have been nearly caught, or have been caught (or caught several times), write all of this down. Also write down your own subsequent feelings, such as shame and guilt, and the actions you use to try to cope with these feelings or remorse or disgust, such as drinking too much, cutting yourself, destroying the things you've stolen, or other destructive actions.


If you have been caught, how strong were the accompanying feelings? Why do you feel that even being caught isn't enough to overcome the need to steal? Write it all down.

Put away your smartphone, tablet, and computer, or give them to a friend or family member for safekeeping. Spend a few days away from the internet and allow your mind and body to detox.


Try doing this with a friend. Spend a full day with a friend in which both of you leave your devices at home and do not use them at all. Having someone else’s support might make the process easier.If you are giving up your smartphone, temporarily switch to a disposable cell phone in the meantime. You can buy them just about anywhere, including most gas stations. Give this number to the people you talk to regularly so they can still contact you. Make sure you pick a disposable phone that does not have internet access.;
, If you are privately insured, look for a provider in your network. Some other therapists in your area may offer their services on a sliding scale. Do some research on your chosen therapist and see if one of their specializations is addiction.


There are online resources for overcoming pornography addiction. You can download e-books, or even seek e-counseling over the internet. The downside with this option is that you will need to access the internet to access these services and products., Find something new to do that you enjoy, particularly something that will get you out of the house, or at least out of the area in which you normally access internet pornography. Whenever you get the urge to access these materials, choose instead to do something new.If you find this challenging, consider how much time you spend watching or viewing internet porn, and consider what you could get done with that amount of time if you spent it doing something productive and engaging.
Many former internet pornography addicts say that finding new activities to engage their minds with has allowed them to improve their quality of life, and feel like more productive and useful people.

, If you traditionally use internet pornography to become sexually stimulated, try using your own imagination to turn yourself on. If you are in a relationship, focus on your partner. Imagine some fantasies and put yourself back into the physical world.


You might have noticed that when you view internet porn, you are doing so very passively—watching other people act out your fantasies or sexual thoughts. If you take that role on yourself, you might find it more engaging and satisfying.

, Keeping a serious addiction problem from your partner can jeopardize your relationship, and the trust your partner has in you. Be honest and open with them about your struggles, and continue to talk with them through your recovery.Understand that your addiction will affect your partner’s life, whether you notice it or not. Any addiction can put a strain on a relationship, as the other partner tries to understand what you are going through. Your partner may feel shocked, betrayed, or even confused by your addiction. But, it is important not to ignore their feelings as you work through recovery.Express to your partner that you need and value their support. Your partner may even need to attend therapy, in conjunction with your own. Consider couples’ therapy as an option.

, If you take the measure to automatically block all pornographic material from your electronic, internet-enabled devices, the temptation to view pornography may be more limited, and easier to avoid.


Ask your partner or a close friend to set the password, rather than setting it yourself. This way, even if you want to unlock the blocks or filters, you won’t have the access to do so.

, Some options include Google Chrome and Firefox. These browsers contain the capability to block certain types of websites, and are safe for your computer.


Both Google Chrome and Firefox offer add-ons or extensions that you can install within your browser to block pornographic websites and pop-ups. Once you have downloaded your chosen browser, visit the add-ons or extension database for that browser and install a blocker to your browser.Turn on the pop-up blocker in your chosen web browser. This way, if a pornographic pop-up advertisement is generated by any web page, it will be blocked by your browser automatically.

, With Google, this option is available under the “Settings” button on the right side of the search page. Click “Turn on SafeSearch” to activate this setting.The safe search setting will block all kinds of different inappropriate search results, including pornographic websites. It blocks the results in all search categories, including images.
You can turn this function on and off very easily, but there is also an option to lock it in place with a password or pin. If you want to block these search results from other people in the household, use the lock option.

, You can access internet pornography from any device that is connected to the web, including smartphones and tablets. Make sure you enable these safe search and blocker capabilities across all of your devices.


Check the manual on your smartphone or tablet on how to install these blockers. How you install and use them will depend on which phone model you have, and which browser is installed on it., Most email service providers have a dedicated spam folder that automatically filters suspicious email messages, but it’s important that you don’t open any of these messages, click any links in them, or download any attachments. If you receive an email from a suspicious account or an address you don’t recognize, avoid accessing any material it contains.


Up to 25% of all spam emails contain pornographic material. By avoiding opening or accessing material in these spam messages, you can protect your devices from pornographic material, and also from any viruses that these spam emails sometimes contain.Don’t respond to these messages. Responding will validate to the spam sender that your account is active, and that spammer might continue to use, sell, and spam your email address.

, You can use a number of free and effective anti-malware and anti-spyware programs to scan your hard drive for viruses and remove them. Having certain malware on your computer could be setting you at a higher risk to get pornographic pop-up ads, so erasing them from your hard drive is important.


Free programs like BitDefender are easy to download and use, and will effectively protect your computer from malware and spyware that can make your device more vulnerable to viruses.

, This extends from both internet usage on laptops and computers, to accessing the internet via a smartphone, tablet, or other handheld device.


Talking to your children is the first line of defense when it comes to keeping them safe from internet pornography. Let them know your views on accessing this kind of material, and what kind of things you think are inappropriate for them to see.Set consequences for breaking these rules. Make sure your children understand that they are not allowed to access these materials, regardless of the circumstance.

, Even with certain blocks in place, some young people have found ways around them. Searching for things like “childbirth” or “breastfeeding” can often generate search results that slip through the pornography filter, but are still inappropriate for your children to see.Check to make sure your children haven’t figured out how to unlock any filters or blocks you have installed. Make sure you have used passwords or pins that they would not be able to guess.
Keep browser security up to date. If you browser needs an update, make sure you download and install it. These security features will help block pop-up ads that may contain pornographic material as well.

, If your family members have their own computers or laptops, ask that they use them with their bedroom doors open, or out in a more public area.Since smaller devices like smartphones or tablets can be more difficult to monitor, try to limit your child’s time with these devices. You might even ask that they leave their smartphones and tablets out of their bedrooms at bed time."

Splash your face with cold water.,
Try a change of scenery.,
Go for a walk.,
Shower or bathe.,
Eat a meal.,
Have some coffee.,
Rest.",How to Come Down from a High2," Before you do anything else, try this old trick. Find a sink (one without a mirror is best) and run some cold water. Carefully splash your face with the cool, refreshing water. This is a great way to bring yourself ""back to reality"" if your thoughts have been spiraling out of control and can help you relax if you're feeling anxious.


As noted above, mirrors can be something you want to avoid if you're seriously high, especially on a hallucinogen like LSD or mushrooms. For some people, looking into the mirror while tripping can make them feel strange or disconnected from reality.

, Sometimes, simply getting up and going somewhere different can have a positive effect on someone who's high. If you're indoors, leave the room you're in and go to a more comfortable one or someplace outside where there's fresh air.


If you've been smoking marijuana, a nice outdoor breeze can also help blow the smell out of your hair and clothes.

, Going for a short walk around the neighborhood can be a great way to calm yourself down and clear your head when you're high (and it's also usually pretty fun!) Feeling the warm sun or a pleasant breeze can help wash away any jittery feelings, leaving you feeling calm and relaxed. Also, because walking is mild exercise, it can make your body release natural endorphins, which will make you feel good.Some amateur weed ""experts"" claim that exercise can remove THC, the active chemical in marijuana, from the body. Though there is no scientific evidence to support this (in fact, the opposite may be true),a nice walk can make your thoughts much calmer and clearer when you're high, so it's definitely worth trying.

, What's more relaxing than a nice shower or bath? Warm, clean water can feel amazing when you're high, and as a plus, it can help you get a grip on scattered thoughts and ""collect yourself"", especially if you've been feeling nervous or panicked. For the best effect, try starting with warm water, then finishing with cool or cold water to help you snap back to reality.

, Being hungry can make it trickier for almost anyone to make smart, logical decisions — if you've ever felt angry or irritable after skipping a meal, you've felt this.When you're high, hunger pangs and irritation can make it a lot harder to ""keep it together"" when you're coming down, so chowing down on some filling, refreshing snacks can make a big difference.


Some drugs, like LSD, can make it so that you don't feel like eating when you're high. If this is true for you, don't force yourself to eat. Giving yourself an upset stomach may make the comedown period worse.

, If you're feeling sleepy, drowsy, or ""woozy"", in some cases, a nice cup of Joe (or something else with caffeine, like an energy drink) can help perk you up. Caffeine won't make you ""less high"", but it can make you a little more alert, so if you're worried about falling asleep before you come down, this can be a good ""quick fix"". Don't have more than about one drink's worth of caffeine — more can make you feel worse or make you panicky.


Drugs and other chemicals that affect your brain can have a multiplicative effect — in other words, the more types chemicals you put into your body, the more high you can feel. Because of this, you definitely won't want to drink lots of caffeine or take other ""upper"" drugs to make you feel less high!

, The quickest way to get a drug out of your system is usually just to let your body do its work, so if you have time to take a quick nap or get a night's sleep, do it. When you wake up, you'll feel refreshed, replenished, and possibly even completely sober!


For many drugs, including marijuana, sleep should come easy (and feel great) when you're high.If your high has you feeling jittery or nervous, don't worry — relaxing alone or with a few good friends can have the same sort of effect.

Use eye drops for red eyes.,
Eliminate odor with new clothes or cologne/perfume.,
Use gum or candy to hide smokey breath.,
Keep quiet if you're worried about how you'll sound.,
Stay relaxed as you move.",How to Come Down from a High3," When you're high, the idea of interacting with people who aren't high, especially people like your parents, teachers, and so on, can be scary. Luckily, it's not hard to hide your high! For example, if your eyes are red (a common side effect of marijuana), use soothing eye drops to clear them up. Products like Visine and Clear Eyes work well and are sold at pharmacies for cheap.

, If you've been smoking, the smell of your drugs can stick to your body and clothes. Some drugs, especially marijuana, have smells that can clue people into what you've been doing. If you have time, try changing your clothes, bathing, and even using a little perfume or cologne to cover this smell up.


Don't use tons of scent to hide the smell of your drugs. Strong scents of cologne or perfume can be attention-grabbing and may even be a clue that you've been smoking themselves.

, Don't forget about the smell on your breath! Even though this won't be as strong as the smell that clings to your body and clothes, it can be a problem if you have to get close to someone. Try sucking on a piece of hard candy or chewing scented gum to cover up this smell.


You may want to consider cough drops, especially if you've just smoked marijuana. Not only will they hide the scent of smoke on your breath, but they'll also make your throat feel better if your smoke was harsh.

, If you're not really high, don't worry &dash; you'll probably be able to talk to other people just fine without them telling you're high. However, you may not want to talk to other people unless you need to. Even if you don't sound high at all, you might get nervous from talking. When you're high and nervous, your thoughts can get scattered and panicky, so keeping quiet until you need to is usually a good move.

, Depending on the type of drugs you're using, you may be less coordinated than normal when you're high — you may feel slightly dizzy, slow, or disoriented. If this is true for you, avoid activities like sports and hard exercise. When you do get up and move around, stay relaxed! Getting nervous will only make you self-conscious of your own movements, which can make it even easier to make mistakes.

Replace the bad habit with a good one.,
Get too busy for porn.,
Look for spiritual guidance.,
Find a better sexual release.,
Think of all the reasons to stop.,
Get counseling if this problem continues to bother you.",How to Avoid Pornography2," For most people that look at a lot of porn, the impulse is simply a habit. One of the best ways to overcome a bad habit is to replace it with a good habit; you need to give yourself something else to do when you would normally be looking at porn. What that is will depend on who you are, but you can try:


Exercising. When you reach the time of day when you would normally start looking at porn, go out and get some exercise instead. Go for a jog around your block or do some jumping jacks. You can even do some more involved but fun exercises, like going swimming at your local pool.
Cleaning your home. You’ll probably know the basic things to clean (dishes, laundry, etc) but don’t forget about all the cleaning that a lot of people forget about, like cleaning around the toilet and scrubbing the bathtub.

, Pornography is easy to fall back on if you’ve got a lot of free time. By keeping your day booked solid, you’ll easily be able to keep yourself away from porn because you’ll have too much other stuff to do! Try taking on a new hobby (editing on wikiHow is good), teach yourself a new skill (learning a language is useful and fun), or finding another way to occupy your time (spending more time with your friends and family is always good).


For example, you can begin teaching yourself a new language online using free services like DuoLingo. Learning a new language will help fill up your time and keep you busy (and away from pornography) but it will also help you for the rest of your life too!
If you want to try something away from the computer so that you’re not tempted, try martial arts. The Japanese martial art of Aikido is designed for people who might not be all that strong and uses minimal movements to achieve the greatest effect, making it a good one for people who don’t have much experience or aren’t in very good shape. You can usually find Aikido classes as local community centers, universities, and community dojos.

, If you’re really having trouble getting your habit under control, you should consider seeking guidance from a spiritual counselor. While religion can’t help everyone with this problem, it does help some people and shouldn’t be dismissed. Do whatever works for you and don’t worry about what other people say.


Go to the local place of worship for whatever religion you believe in and ask to talk to a priest, imam, or rabbi. You might need to set up an appointment but someone should be available to talk to you.

, It shouldn’t be the first thing you try, but finding another way to get a satisfying sexual release might help you kick your habit. Find a sexual partner that you can be on the same page with about what you expect from your relationship and try to develop a more satisfying sex life. By keeping your sex life varied, mutually satisfying, and fresh, you should kick a lot of your desire to look at pornography.


If you’re already in a relationship, do what you can to spice up your sex life with your partner. You’ll probably have to make some real effort, but it will be worth it.

, For some people, keeping in mind all the reasons why they should stop is enough to curb the bad behavior. With significant enough motivation, if you can find it, you should be able to control your urges. However, this will work best if you combine significant motivation with the other behavioral techniques we talked about, like giving yourself something else to do and setting up an internet censor.


Consider the impact on your family. For some people, the effect that their porn habits have on their wives, girlfriends, or the fear of what their children might see is enough to deter them and help them control their habits. The same goes for if you’re young and still living with your family. What would your little sister think if she saw what you watch?
Consider your own feelings and free time. For some people, it’s easier to be motivated knowing the negative impact that pornography has on yourself. Survey’s have shown among men who stopped watching porn, 60% saw in increase in their sexual performance. Almost two thirds felt more energetic and productive. Porn can be very time consuming for those with really bad habits, so just imagine what you could do with all that reclaimed time.

, If you really can’t control yourself, think about talking to a doctor or psychologist. You may have larger problems that need to be addressed and if this has a negative impact on your life then that alone makes it important enough to deal with.


Talk to your family doctor about your problem. Even if they can’t help you themselves, they should be able to refer you to someone who can help.
You can also find specialized resources, like Sex Addicts Anonymous. Groups like this one deal specifically with this problem and they will know what you’re going through and how to help you.

Don't be judgmental.,
Talk to them about your concerns.,
Help them see how the behavior is hurtful.,
Give them a new focus.,
Plan for failure.,
Release your feelings of responsibility.",How to Avoid Pornography3," The first thing you should do when trying to help other people stay away from porn is to stop being judgmental. Do not see or portray the situation in a way that makes them bad for what they do. Sexuality is very normal and human. Even most religions teach that it is not anyone’s place to judge their fellow man (but is instead the job of the Creator). It’s also bad to judge people because it tends to turn them off from what you’re trying to do. Many people that might be open to change will become defensive if you judge them and become even more set in their ways.


Stay calm when you talk to them and avoid any judgmental language like “Why can’t you be more like Michael?” or “Watching pornography will turn you into a pedophile!”. Don’t make assumptions about how they think or compare them to other people, since language like this tends to shut people down.

, The best place to start is to talk to the person you’re concerned about. Tell them why you’re concerned. Sometimes, people might not realize that they even have a problem or how their problem might affect other people. If you’re open and honest, you’ll be much better able to reach them and connect with things that they can understand.


Say something like, “Will, I know that this is something that you enjoy, but I’m worried about what it’s doing to you. There is so much more to life and so much more that you could be doing right now to make yourself happy, but you’re spending all your free time in your room. I want you to get more out of life than just this.”

, Talk to them about the negative effects of pornography. Make sure to use lots of different types of evidence and reasoning though. If someone is religious, you’ll want to focus on religious arguments but if someone’s not, then that won’t work, right? Instead, pull on real-world evidence, logical arguments, emotional arguments, and whatever else you can. Using a combination of argument types will be best if you don’t know how the person will think about the problem.


For example, make a logical argument like, “Think about what this is doing to how you think about sex! You’re becoming accustomed to being able change who gets you off by just pressing a button. That’s going to make it very hard to have a satisfying relationship later in life.”
Make an emotional argument like, “What would happen if your little sister saw that? What would she think about you? Seeing things like that, when she’s too young to understand that it’s all make believe...she might become afraid of how men interact with women and what she can expect as an adult.”

, Using a new behavior or a new activity is the best way to stop an old behavior in its tracks. If you want to help someone to stop looking at porn, give them something else to do instead. You can try:


Offering to take a class with them at the local community center. Consider paying for you both to take a cooking class together at the local community center during the time of day you know they’re most vulnerable.
Give them something to do around the house. Give them a responsibility to take care of around the house. For example, if your son spends a lot of time in his room towards the end of the day, task him with taking the dog for a walk around the neighborhood every day instead.

, This is a difficult behavior to overcome and it may take time and a few mess ups before things feel right. You need to plan for failure so that both you and the person you’re trying to help don’t become disappointed with the events that happen. Disappointment can lead to harsh feelings and judgement, which might derail the whole effort. Expect that it will take some work and that a change won’t happen overnight.

, Realize that at the end of the day, you can’t be responsible for everything that someone else does. Whoever you’re trying to help, they’re either already an adult or they’re getting to the point where they really just have to make decisions on their own. This is a part of the world that they’ll be exposed to one way or the other and they’ll need to find their own way to cope with it. You can’t control other people and it’s not your responsibility to. If they feel negative consequences after you’ve done what you can to help them, that’s their responsibility. You did what you were capable of and no one can ask anything more from you.

Consider therapy.,
Understand treatment options.,
Explore medication options.",How to Stop Your Addiction to Stealing2," While it is possible to defeat your addiction to stealing on your own with a great deal of determination, it may also be helpful to consider treatment. The best form of help will be counseling with a psychologist or a psychiatrist. Therapy combined with medication can be effective in treating kleptomania or compulsive stealing.


Be reassured that therapy for kleptomania/compulsive stealing can be very successful in helping you to overcome this disorder, but also remember the outcome depends on how badly you want it and how much you are willing to work for it!

, The most common forms of therapy for stealing include: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Psychodynamic treatment, and Group therapy/12-step programs.CBT helps people change their thinking in order to change their feelings and behaviors. DBT is focused on teaching individuals distress tolerance, emotion regulation, interpersonal effectiveness, and mindfulness. Psychodynamic interventions look into your past and upbringing in order to identify the causes of problems and find ways to solve current issues. 12-step programs focus on addictions to substances, but there are also 12-step programs for stealing in particular.You can discuss these options with a mental health professional.
There are also ways you can explore these types of therapy on your own through self-help measures. For example, CBT involves changing your thoughts in order to change you feelings and behaviors.

, Several medications have been indicated in the treatment of kleptomania including Prozac and Revia.Consult a psychiatrist for additional information or to discuss psychotropic options.

Identify and challenge your thoughts.,
Train yourself to think differently.,
Reflect on the bigger picture.,
Be prepared to assert yourself and your needs more.",How to Stop Your Addiction to Stealing3," Changing your thoughts in order to change your feelings and behaviors is a key component of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which is a common type of therapy for treating stealing and kleptomania.Monitor your automatic thoughts, and you can change your stealing behaviors.Think about the thoughts that arise when you are considering stealing something. For example you may think, “I really want that,” or, “I will get away with it.” Think about who it benefits. Does it only benefit you when you steal? Or your family, friends, or someone else? And in what way does it benefit you or others? If you feel that some of your compulsion to steal is about validating your position or feeling secure within your group of friends or family by ""buying"" their affection or rewarding their attention with items, then you'll need to start seeing these drives for the insecurity within you that they represent.

, Once you’ve identified your thinking patterns you can begin thinking of alternative thoughts. This includes paying attention to your negative thoughts that reinforce your stealing behaviors, and actively changing your thought process in the moment.


For example, if you find yourself thinking, “I really want that ring, so I’ll steal it,” instead think, “I want that ring, but it is wrong to steal so I will focus on saving my money instead.”

, When you feel stronger about what is compelling you to steal and what you intend to do about it, spend some time reflecting over what you have been doing and where this is headed in all likelihood. Time for reflection is important because it's likely that you feel as if your life lacks purpose, or perhaps you feel as if you have no control over aspects of your life.


For some people, stealing is a form of passive rebellion against situations that make them feel powerless. Reflecting on these bigger picture concerns will help you to start developing your own goals for your life and will help you to set boundaries on poor behaviors that don't help you reach your goals.

, If you don't feel strong about standing up for yourself or you feel ignored, picked on or let down all the time, it is easy to use stealing as a form of ""revenge"" on people whom you perceive have hurt or ignored you. Or, you might be using stealing as a way to sedate your feelings in general. Unfortunately, by not asserting yourself and by not seeing your own self-worth but choosing stealing instead, you risk your future and you let the actions of others lead you into hurting yourself even more. Remind yourself that the only person you hurt for real is you – you might truly upset the people who love you but you're not punishing them; you're punishing yourself.

Identify your history of stealing.,
Understand and cope with your triggers to stealing.,
Adopt a plan to control your impulse.,
Continue to monitor your behaviors.",How to Stop Your Addiction to Stealing4," Creating a relapse prevention plan is a crucial component of taking control of your urge to steal, as well as preventing stealing in the future.The first step in relapse prevention planning is to identify the past issues you have had with stealing.


You can use the information you wrote down during the writing exercise above in order to begin your relapse prevention plan.
Write down a history of your stealing. List as many stealing episodes as possible, starting from when you were a child. Note any situations that were going on during that time or what influenced your decision to steal.
Rate the need to steal for each episode. Use a scale of 1 to 10 to show how much you felt compelled to steal on each occasion you've noted.

, Triggers are thoughts and feelings about a situation that may lead to a behavior. Write down your thoughts and feelings that are associated with stealing.


Learn high-risk situations. The key to controlling your impulses is understanding risky situations and avoiding them.What were your feelings when the stealing took place? See if you can identify particular triggers, such as someone being nasty to you, someone yelling at you, feeling down or unloved, being rejected, etc.
Note the correlation between what triggered your need to steal and the rating you've given the feeling that you needed to steal.
Keep this list, journal or notebook very safe.
Remove yourself from triggering situations that might encourage you or make it easy for you to steal. Some examples of these types of triggers include being around friends who steal, or going into stores that you know have low security. Avoid these situations at all cost so you will not be tempted.

, This involves talking to yourself before proceeding any further. Try the following:



Stop. Instead of acting on impulse, stop yourself immediately.

Take a breath. Stand still and give yourself breathing space.

Observe. Think about what is going on. What am I feeling? What am I thinking? What am I reacting to?

Pull back. Attempt to look at the situation objectively. Is there another way of thinking about the situation? Project yourself to after the theft when you're holding the item and wondering what to do with it and wondering how to overcome the guilt.

Practice what works. Choose for yourself what you would rather do instead of stealing something. Plan to change your behavior every time the craving to steal comes over you. Some examples of what might be helpful include: telling yourself about who you are and what your values are, reminding yourself that you are a good person and a person who is valued, self-calming techniques, and imagining peaceful scenes to calm your racing heart and tension.

, Once you have mastered the art of impulse control and have reduced or eliminated your stealing behaviors, you will need to continuously monitor your relapse prevention plan and adjust it accordingly.Turn to the present. Keep a daily account of your current stealing exploits, if any. As before, keep writing the feelings and rate the desire to steal.
Balance the writing. Be sure to write down your accomplishments, the things that you're proud of and the things that you're grateful for. Try to make these things become the main focus of your journal keeping over time, in order to help build your self-esteem.

Distract yourself.,
Get active.,
Find a job, get an increase in your allowance or pay, or revisit your budget.,
Find emotional outlets.",How to Stop Your Addiction to Stealing5," Find alternatives to stealing that give you a high or a focus but that don't create more harm in your life.This could include hobbies, activities, volunteering, helping others, making things, growing plants, caring for animals, writing, painting, studying, becoming an activist for a cause you believe in, or many other wonderful alternatives to stealing. Whatever you choose, make choices that are beneficial for you and that aren't simply about swapping one disorder for another (such as sedating yourself with alcohol).

, If stealing is filling a void in your life, fill it with activities.Take up sport or exercise, take up a hobby, or start volunteering. Instead of resorting to stealing as a way of filling in your time, use your time more productively and beneficially. This will lift your self-esteem, create renewed energy, and remove boredom. It will stop you from stealing for a lack of better things to do, or a sense of purposelessness. Just keep yourself busy and the rest will follow.

, If you've been stealing out of survival need or a sense of deprivation as well as from emotional triggers, having a more steady, certain stream of income might alleviate your desire or ""need"" to steal. Moreover, the security and routine of having a job if you don't have one, can restore a sense of responsibility and self-esteem that might be missing in your life. This step may not be relevant to you if you already have enough money, a job, or money isn't the issue, but if a toxic relationship with money is at the heart of your problem, earning your own secure source can be helpful.

, Use the knowledge you gain from the writing therapy to start tackling the emotions and feelings that are triggering your need to steal. Tackle your anger, your confusion, your sadness, your distress, and so forth. Acknowledge your original feelings and find new ways to deal with them other than through stealing.


Make notes of new ways to distract, entertain and amuse yourself. What sorts of new thoughts and actions are you discovering you can use to make yourself feel better?

Understand stealing versus kleptomania.,
Identify other causes.,
Conduct research about stealing.",How to Stop Your Addiction to Stealing6," In order to treat your specific struggle with stealing, it may benefit you to identify whether you engage in stealing behaviors, or if you may have a specific disorder.It is recommended that you seek consultation from a mental health professional.


Kleptomania exists in about .3-.6 % in the general population. In other words, about 1 in 200 people may meet the criteria for kleptomania as a disorder.
11% of people shoplift at least once in their lives.That is, over 1 in 10 people have shoplifted at least once. However, shoplifting once or twice does not constitute a disorder.
Kleptomania is an impulse control disorder; it is associated with a “high” when engaging in stealing, followed by guilt after stealing. It is also characterized by an inability to control or stop the stealing despite repeated efforts.Stealing is not considered an addiction according to the current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5), which is a reference guide for psychologists and psychiatrists in diagnosing mental disorders., The symptom of stealing could be part of a different disorder. For example diagnoses such as: Conduct Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, Antisocial Personality Disorder, and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, all have criteria that may include stealing-related behaviors.You also deserve assessment for other disorders that may be enabling the kleptomaniac habits, such as dissociative states, stress, anxiety, and mood disorders.

, Ask for more information at your local library or bookstore. In the age of the internet, it's easy to find out more information about our health and well-being; just be sure to look on reputable sites, such as government health sites and sites written by doctors and psychologists, with referencing and verified expertise. As well, read posts and forums where people with the same disorder as you share their thoughts, feelings, worries, etc., as this will help you to realize that you're not alone.

Remove the yellow caps from the syringe.,

There are usually two – one at each end of the syringe.A syringe is not a needle, it’s a plastic device that holds the needle – or in this case, what the Narcan screws onto.
You can find Narcan through the getnaloxonenow.org website.;
, The tube of Narcan (also labeled naloxone) may have a red cap. Pry this off and discard it., Grip the clear plastic wings of the nasal atomizer (the cone-shaped applicator), and insert it onto the syringe. Gently screw the Narcan container onto the barrel of the syringe.Do not prime or test the spray. It is single-use and can’t be reused.Some Narcan nasal sprays come in single-use, pre-assembled packages. They contain two needle-free devices, one to use in each nostril., Lay the victim on their back and tilt their head back. Place the white cone applicator into one nostril of the victim’s nose.

Find another outlet for your time and energy.,
Make a plan for avoiding masturbation during your ""go to"" times of day.,
Limit your solitude.,
Stop watching porn on your computer.,
Be persistent and patient.,
Stop punishing yourself.,
Don't believe the myths about the harms of masturbation.,
Know that it will get better.,
Know when to seek help.",How to Stop a Masturbation Addiction," Fill your life with engaging activities. The excitement of doing something different can help replace the urge to masturbate, and you'll have a go-to distraction next time you're tempted. Try some of these options:



Be creative. The process of turning sexual urges into creative output (called sublimation) is something on which monks and sages have relied upon for centuries. Start writing, learn to play a musical instrument, paint, draw, or do whatever else makes you feel like you're doing something productive.

Play sports. It takes discipline and persistence to excel at a sport. Develop an interest like running or swimming, or a group sport like soccer, football, basketball, or tennis. Also, any form of exercise will help you relieve tension, feel happier, and make you focus on your physicality in a positive way. Yoga is another form of exercise that can help you feel more relaxed and less likely to feel the sudden urge to masturbate.

Eat a healthy diet. Fruits and vegetables have healthy effects on the body and provide nutrients necessary to increase your energy to make you more active throughout the day. Minimize consumption of aphrodisiac foods, such as oysters, salmon, chili peppers, coffee, avocados, banana, and chocolate.

Find a new hobby, or cultivate a skill. Learning something that takes a while to master can refocus your brain on the delayed gratification of achieving goals instead of the instant gratification of masturbation. Try skills like cooking, woodshop, archery, baking, public speaking, or gardening.

Volunteer your time. Devote your energy to helping teens who've been less fortunate than you, such as working at a shelter, tutoring low-income students, cleaning up blighted areas, or raising money for a good cause. You'll get an altruistic feeling from helping others, and you'll have less time to stray from your goals.

Get enough sleep. Urges to masturbate can be exceedingly strong, so make sure you have enough energy to fight those urges. Try to get at least 8 hours of sleep. If you frequently forget to go to bed at a reasonable hour, set an alarm to remind you.;
, If you have problems before going to bed or in the shower, refrain from any temptation to masturbate. For instance, if it's a problem late at night, drop to the floor and do push-ups until you're too exhausted to do anything but fall asleep. If you find shower time too tempting, start using ice cold water only — you won't want to be in there for long; cold shower will offer the added benefit of saving you time and water.


If you always masturbate when you get home from school, make sure to have a solid plan to stave off any boredom you may feel. If you have so little to do that your mind frequently wanders to sexual thoughts, occupy your schedule. You'll find it gets easier to avoid masturbation if you're too busy or tired to spare any energy for distractions.
If you're tempted to masturbate in the morning, try to sleep with more than just one layer of clothing so touching yourself is more of an effort.

, If you masturbate frequently because you feel lonely, find ways to be as socially engaged as possible. This means that you should join as many clubs or activities as you can, accept and give more invitations to people, and go out of your way to make more friends. If you want to date someone, consider asking a friend to set you up or join an online dating site.


Another thing you can do is to limit the times when you are likely to be home alone. If you tend to masturbate in the hour or two before your parents get home from work, go for a walk during that time, or do your homework in a coffee shop.
Even if all of your friends are busy, you can still limit your impulse to masturbate by going out in public. For instance, instead of watching the game at home by yourself, watch it at a sports bar. Even if you're not hanging out with friends, you will not be alone, ultimately having no time for masturbation.

, One of the reasons you may be masturbating so much is that you know that you can access porn within seconds if you desire. However, if you don't have the willpower to stop looking at the porn on your own, then you may have to take other measures to get the job done:


Consider installing porn-blocking software on your computer. Of course you will know the password to bypass the blocking function, but just having it pop up will remind you of your priorities. You can also type a random password in a text file, copy and paste it when you enter your password and verify it, then delete the text file. Then, you will not be able to know the password of your own porn-blocker. This is the best way to keep you strong and spare you the struggle.
If you have the tendency to masturbate looking at porn on the computer, try moving your computer into a room where others can see you.
If you have a physical collection of porn, dispose of it ASAP.

, Stopping a masturbation addiction won't hit you like a lightning bolt. It's a process that requires commitment, and you might make mistakes or relapse on occasions. The real struggle is persevering, so commit now that you won't let little mistakes stand in your way.


Set up a reward system. Bribe yourself to stay on-track with rewards for good behavior. For instance, if you can go two whole weeks without masturbating once, treat yourself to a small indulgence like a new game or an ice cream cone.
Reward systems are great; just make sure not to reward yourself with the very thing you're trying to conquer, which, in this case, is masturbating. If you say that you'll reward yourself with masturbation after a week of not doing it, then you'll only be turning masturbation into something that you really, really want even more.

, Consider it this way: if you're constantly dwelling on the disapproval that some may feel about masturbating, then you're still thinking about masturbation all the time. Don't just trade in your masturbation addiction for another one — they're so closely related that you won't resolve anything. Instead, acknowledge that this has been a problem for you, but you will persevere to stop the impulse.


Remember, you're human, and humans masturbate. Some studies show that up to 95% of males and 89% of females admit that they have masturbated.You'll feel less shame once you realize you are not alone.
Resist the urge of sinking into despair by remembering the times spent feeling sorry for yourself when it could have been spent relinquishing your addiction.

, If you want to stop your masturbation addiction, then you should do it for reasons that are personal and moral, not for reasons that are health-related. The only real health problem that can be caused is pain and rawness from chronic masturbation, but that can go away if you stop touching yourself so frequently. Here are some things that masturbation will not do to your body:


Masturbation will not cause infertility, premature ejaculation, or impotence.
Masturbation will not cause insanity.
Masturbation will not cause blindness, or even eye floaters.
Masturbation will not cause frequent urination.
Masturbation does not affect facial hair, growth, facial features, kidneys, testicles, cause skin problems, or cause any major physical issues! These are all myths.

, If you have the faith that you can really find a way to stop your masturbation addiction, then you'll be able to do it. Maybe your goal isn't to stop masturbating completely, but just to limit your masturbation to a healthy amount, such as once or twice a day. That's perfectly fine, too. If you have the belief that you really can win this battle, you'll be much more likely to succeed than if you're constantly second-guessing yourself.


That being said, there may be days when you have relapses. If you find yourself masturbating one day when you planned not to, don't think, ""Oh, well, I've ruined this day anyway,"" and then continue compulsively masturbating for the rest of the day and then starting fresh the next. This is about as logical as thinking that you should eat an entire pie because you've had one cookie and have ruined your diet for the day anyway.

, If you've tried everything and just can't seem to get your addiction under control, it might be time to tell someone else about your problem and ask for assistance. Don't feel ashamed, and remember that many people have similar problems like an addiction. Seeking help is a brave action, and most people you ask will see it as such.


Ask your religious leader for guidance. If you belong to a church, consider asking your local clergy for help. Keep three things in mind: First, these people become part of the clergy because they're dedicated to helping their congregations. Second, they've probably already assisted someone with a masturbation addiction before. Lastly, they're bound by strict confidentiality. Request a private appointment with your priest, pastor, bishop, imam, rabbi, or other religious leader, and see if his or her advice can help you.
Make an appointment with a medical professional. Counselors, psychologists and psychiatrists are all trained to help people with varying levels of addiction. Start by seeing a therapist in your area, who can assess your addiction and refer you to more specialized help if necessary. Several treatment options are available, from cognitive-behavior therapy to medication.

Assemble a 1–1.5 inch (2.5–3.8 cm) needle.,
Prepare 1cc of Narcan.,
Select the injection site.,
Inject the Narcan.,
Monitor the victim for 3-5 minutes.",How to Administer Narcan2," After giving a few quick rescue breaths, assemble your needle. Use a 1” or 1.5” needle, called an IM or intramuscular needle. You can get these at needle exchange programs and pharmacies. Always have these on hand if you carry non-nasal Narcan., Pop the orange top off the vial of liquid Narcan. Insert the needle into the bottle. Pull back on the plunger until the liquid line reaches the 1cc mark.1cc = 1ml = 100U
Injectable Narcan comes in several different sized bottles – a 1cc bottle and a 10cc bottle. Only use 1cc of Narcan, not the whole 10cc’s. Giving too much Narcan too fast can cause the victim severe pain and other health problems.

, Choose a large muscle to inject the Narcan into. The best sites are the thigh, the upper, outer part of the buttock, or the upper arm (deltoid muscle). Generally, choose the outer thigh.

You can inject it through clothing if you need to., Insert the needle into the muscle at a 90° angle. Jab the needle into the muscle at a moderately quick speed. Go straight in and aim for the center of the big muscle. Press the plunger down at a moderate speed until all the Narcan has been injected.If you only have a small needle, inject the Narcan under the skin instead of into the muscle. Pinch a tent of skin in a somewhat fatty area, and insert the smaller needle at a 45° angle to their body.

, As with nasal Narcan, continue to monitor the victim and provide rescue breathing if necessary. Give another dose if there are no changes in 3-5 minutes."
"
Administer Narcan only if the victim meets the criteria.,
Provide supportive care until help arrives.,
Be prepared to administer more Narcan.,
Be sure the victim gets to the hospital.,
Encourage the victim not to use again that day.,
Store the Narcan appropriately.",How to Administer Narcan3," Only administer Narcan if the victim exhibits the following signs of overdose:They are unconscious, unresponsive, and you cannot wake them
They have pinpoint (constricted) pupils
Their breathing is slow and shallow, breathing fewer than 8 times per minute

, When you find a loved one unconscious, yell and rub your knuckles on the center of their breastbone to try to wake them. If they wake up, they do not need Narcan.If not, call emergency services immediately and tell them that someone may have overdosed. Before giving Narcan, see if the victim needs CPR - this may save their life! Follow these guidelines:

Count their breaths: Listening at their mouth while watching to see whether their chest is rising and falling for 5-10 seconds.If they are not breathing or are breathing fewer than 8 times per minute, give them a few rescue breaths before administering Narcan.Check for a pulse for 30 seconds by placing your middle and forefingers on the victim's neck just off to the side a little, under the jaw line. If they don't have a pulse, start CPR chest compressions.

, Narcan acts quickly – within about 2 minutes – but it also only lasts for about 30 minutes. Keep constant watch on the victim’s alertness and breathing. Administer more Narcan if they meet the criteria for it. Continue this until emergency services arrive.If you do not have more Narcan and the victim’s breathing slows below 8 breaths per minute, administer rescue breathing until help arrives.

, Emergency services should immediately take the victim to intensive care for monitoring. If you are unable to access emergency services, get the person to the hospital as soon as they can breathe on their own. They need medical care even if their overdose is reversed by Narcan., Narcan can cause symptoms of withdrawal, making the victim want to use their drug again. Doing so can cause another overdose. These cravings may be difficult for both of you to deal with. Try to support the victim emotionally, and encourage them not to use drugs again that day., Store any Narcan you have tightly closed in its original container. Store it at room temperature in a dark place.Dispose of the Narcan and get a new one if the red safety guard has been removed, it is expired, it looks cloudy or you can see particles floating in it.

Keep it safely out of reach of children. Do not let anyone else use your medication.

"
Know the victim’s drug of abuse.,
Get Narcan from a doctor.,
Do a quick scan for signs of opiate overdose.",How to Administer Narcan4," If a loved one uses illegal drugs or takes prescription medications inappropriately, try to find out what they take. Ask them outright and let them know you’re concerned about their safety. Narcan can reverse the effects of opiate drugs such as:Heroin
Prescription pain medicine like fentanyl, morphine, methadone, buprenorphine, hydrocodone, and oxycodone
Some common brand name medications such as Percocet, OxyContin, Vicodin, Percodan, Tylox, and Demerol

, If you or a loved one suffer from opiate addiction, talk to your doctor about getting Narcan to keep on hand. You may be able to obtain liquid Narcan that can be injected into a vein, muscle, or under the skin, or a nasal spray. You need a prescription to get Narcan in some states but not others.Automatic injection devices (Evzio) are sometimes available. These have voice guidance that can direct you or another on how to use the device. Use it once then throw it away. This is the BEST OPTION if you do not have medical training.You will probably not be able to administer Narcan to yourself if you are overdosing. Friends, family, and loved ones should know how to use the Narcan and where to find it.

, You may not always know what drug someone has overdosed on, or if they’ve used drugs at all. Don’t waste time, but look very quickly for some signs that the victim may have overdosed on opiates. Scan quickly for prescription drug bottles lying around, a morphine or fentanyl patch on their body (remove it!) or visible drug paraphernalia like syringes, spoons, and tourniquets."

Choose a urinal with privacy guards, if you can.,
Pick a urinal on the end, rather than in the middle.,
Select a urinal remote from other men.,
Look at the floor before you approach your urinal.,
Think before you pee.,
Avoid hitting the urinal cake.,
Hit the wall of the urinal at a gradual angle.,
Aim for splash-reducing urinal inserts.,
Stand closer (but at the right angle).,
Don't stand too close.,
Avoid “shaking” too briskly.",How to Use a Urinal Without Splashing Yourself," Some public restrooms have privacy guards between urinals. These guards serve the dual purpose of providing you privacy, and shielding you from other people’s splash back. Try to find a restroom that comes equipped with privacy guards, as you’ll be much less likely to fall victim to someone else’s splash back., If you can’t find a restroom with privacy guards, pick a urinal on the end, next to the stalls or the sink, instead of a middle urinal. This way, you’ll be half as likely to fall victim to the splash back generated by the guy next to you., Studies have shown that the closer you are to someone else, the more anxiety and difficulty you and that other person will have when it comes to urinating. The resulting panic and anxiety that you both experience might just lead you or your neighbor to create splash back., Many times the floor in front of the urinal will be wet – that’s other people’s pee. Be aware as you approach the urinal, you don’t want to step in someone else’s puddle and unwittingly splash pee onto yourself that way., Sometimes we’ve really got to go, and we rush up to the urinal and get peeing in a hurry. Try not to do this. You need to think before you pee so that you’ll be able to take steps and precautions that will limit your splash back.

, Urinal cakes are designed to fight odor and are often small and placed on the bottom of the urinal. They're not meant to be targets. If you hit them, they might create splash back and deflect urine spray in your direction.

, Change the angle of your stream. Don't hit the urinal dead on. The splash back will be worse the closer it is to 90 degrees. Instead, try to hit the urinal at a soft angle -- less than 45 degrees., Some urinal inserts and splash guards are designed to absorb the impact of your urine stream to reduce potential splash back. Shoot for these, especially if you can urinate on one that bends upward so that it is vertical and so you can hit it at less than 45 degrees., Splash back is greatly increased when your pee hits a surface at a sharp angle and from a great distance. After a few inches, your pee starts to break up into droplets. These droplets create more splash back than a solid stream of urine.


Distance matters because your stream will start to break up if you are too far, and you will have a higher chance of creating splash back.
In addition, your pee picks up a lot of velocity the farther you stand from the urinal, resulting in more splash back.
If you can impact that porcelain before stream breakup occurs, you will be in good shape., While you don't want to be too close, you don't want to be too far. Generally, your stream will begin to lose coherence and power after about six inches from your urethra, so take this into account when you urinate. Remember though, there is no ""magic"" number when it comes to how far to stand from a urinal, because each urinal is different, every person is different, and everyone's comfort level is different.

, When you’re done, don’t shake too quickly. This might cause your urine to fly through the air or it might hit the urinal and you could create splash back by accident.

Turn to family for support.,
Find a counselor.,
Attend support group meetings.,
Appoint a guardian.",How to Avoid a Relapse into Addiction1," Your family and friends will want to see you lead a happy and healthy life. They are likely to be willing to help you through your recovery, especially if you show them that you are serious about ending the addiction. Reach out to siblings, parents, aunts and uncles for help. Try to line up several family members so that you will not be relying on just person. This can help you by providing you with more support and help your family by not overburdening one person. Asking family for a place to stay or a ride to appointments is often easier than asking friends or acquaintances.Avoid leaning on any family members that have the same addiction as you. This could lead you into a relapse.
For example, you could call your parents and say, “I have been feeling pretty stressed out lately, and I’m afraid I’m going to relapse. I made an appointment for next week, but it would be great if I could be around support until then. Would it be okay if I come and stay with you for a couple of nights?”
If a family member is reluctant to help you, try to be willing to listen to their reasons why and find out if there is a way for you to regain their trust.;
, Recovery is a long process. The risk of relapse never completely goes away. To keep yourself on the right track, you should see a mental health professional regularly. They can help you learn to cope with stress and cravings, they will listen to your thoughts and feelings, and they can diagnose any underlying mental health issues that may contribute to a relapse.Ask your doctor for a recommendation to a mental health professional. Most doctors have a few facilities that they trust and work with often.
You may have to see a therapist frequently at first, and then over time your visits will likely be reduced as you get healthier. Even if you are not seeing a therapist regularly, it is important to develop a relationship with one in case trouble develops.

, Support groups bring together people who have gone through a similar experience. In the case of your addiction, a support group will offer you a chance to share your story with other people who have battled the same addiction. You will also get a chance to hear their stories and encourage them.These groups provide bonding and accountability for people who have suffered addictions of a similar nature (e.g. alcoholic’s groups, drug addict’s groups, sex addict’s groups, etc.). This is an important part of your support system since most people will not understand what your addiction is like.
There are also support groups for friends and family members of addicts, such as ALANON.
Finding a support group has gotten much easier with the internet. Look for groups in your area that are specific to your addiction. You could also ask your mental health professional or doctor to refer a group to you.

, Many support groups offer a sponsor. The sponsor is a recovered addict that you have access to all day every day to help walk you through tough times. If you don’t have a sponsor, have a family member or friend fill the role. Explain to them that you need someone that you can call if you feel like you are slipping back into your addiction.Sponsors greatly increase the success of a recovery program.
You can also authorize someone to place you in a rehabilitation program should you relapse.

Hand-held devices are also useful if you would like the freedom to dispose of the urine without assistance and reuse the device easily. There are several different styles of hand-held urinals, including:Jug shaped: This is a common style for female urinals, with a deep and open receptacle that is easy to urinate in. You can use them while standing or sitting.
Bottle shaped: This is another common style that consists of a narrow, hollow chamber with an opening that is designed to fit the female anatomy. You can use bottle-shaped urinals when standing or sitting in a chair with your pelvis tilted slightly forward. Some brands of this style are also made use when lying down or on your side.
Dish-shaped: This style has a flat base and is shallow, with a cover that surrounds the central opening of the urinal. You can insert this style under you when you are in bed or a chair.
A moulding with a drainage bag attached: This style is designed for individuals who are looking for an easy way to dispose of the urine. The small moulding sits between your thighs and drains through a tube into a drainage bag attached to the moulding. You can then dispose of the drainage bag or empty it and reuse it. The moulding is usually cup-shaped, like a funnel, and used when standing or sitting.;
, Body-supporting urinals are useful for individuals who have little to no mobility and require assistance to sit upright or stand upright. These devices are also better for individuals who cannot empty the urinal on their own and need help reusing the urinal.These devices are made to fit under your thighs. You can find body-supporting urinals that are shallow and flat, made for us in a chair or in a bed. There are also body-supporting urinals that resemble bedpans, often used for bedridden patients.

, Female urinals are not just made for women with an illness or mobility difficulties. You can choose to use a female urination device that is user-friendly and made for your everyday bathroom needs to avoid contact with public toilet seats and to enjoy the luxury of urinating while standing. Female urinals are also useful for women who are often outdoors hiking, camping, boating, skiing, or doing other physical activity where you will not have easy access to a bathroom.You can look for female urination devices, like the GoGirl, in store at a big box store or through their website.

The urinal should also be easy to empty and to clean with soap and water.Body-supporting urinals should also be made of a lightweight material like plastic and have grip areas for easy holding. You should be able to easily empty and clean the urinal with soap and water.
Some female urinal brands also have graduation marks on the side to indicate how full the urinal is and remind you when it is time to empty it. If you need to go to the bathroom often, you may look for a urinal that is larger and can hold a larger amount of liquid. If you are receiving assistance from a helper, like a nurse or caretaker, you may go for a urinal that holds a smaller amount of liquid, as it will likely be emptied often.

, There are three ways you can use the urinal: sitting, standing, or lying down. Your ideal position will depend on any injuries you may have on certain areas of your body and your comfort level when going to the bathroom.If you cannot be on your feet when urinating, you may choose to sit in a chair when using the urinal, with your pelvis tilted slightly forward and your legs apart.
If you have pain in your knees or hips, you may choose to use the urinal while standing so you do not need to squat or put unnecessary weight on your knees or hips.
If you have lower back pain or injuries on your back, you may use the urinal on one side while lying down.

, Once you find a urinating position that is comfortable for you, you can place the urinal between your legs. Make sure the cup or tube is positioned right under your urethra.


If you are using a body support device, you may need assistance from a helper to place the urinal under your thighs when you are in bed. Ensure the cup or dish is positioned right under your urethra.
If you are using a device that has a drainage bag, attach a bag to the urinal. This will allow the urine to collect in the drainage bag for easy disposal.

, Tilting your pelvis will allow you to urinate more effectively into the urinal. Make sure you use the cup or tube attached to the urinal when using it to ensure all or most of your urine ends up in the urinal.

, Once you are done using the urinal, you will need to empty the urinal. If you are using a handheld device, simply empty the urinal into the toilet or a bedpan. You can then wash the urinal with warm water and soap, hanging it to dry so it ready for use.


If you are using a body-supporting device, have the helper remove the urinal and empty it for you. The helper should then wash it so it is ready for use.
If you are using a urinal with a drainage bag, you can dispose of the drainage bag once it is full or wash it and reuse it.

Practice mindfulness.,
Beware of nostalgia.,
Eat well.,
Exercise regularly.,
Work a regular schedule.,
Schedule frequent sober outings.",How to Avoid a Relapse into Addiction2," Mindfulness is a way of focusing on the present moment. This offers an array of benefits to a recovering addict of any kind, like stopping you from thinking about the past and helping you remain grateful for where you are now. There are many ways to practice mindfulness. You can practice techniques like deep breathing, meditation, and yoga. They may feel unnatural at first, but as you practice you will get better at calming your mind and relaxing your body. Some of the benefits involved include things like:Mindfulness reduces stress.
Mindfulness keeps your focus on the present.
Mindfulness elevates your mood.

, Looking back on your former behaviors in a favorable light can be dangerous. Instead of referring to your time before recovery as something like ‘The Good Ol’ Days,’ be sure to remember the negative impact that the addiction had on your life. These negative effects are why you went down the road of recovery in the first place.Things like damaged relationships, poor finances, and lack of self-esteem are examples of the negative impact of addiction.
Try writing down all of the negative things that have resulted from your addiction. Then, read over this any time you start feeling nostalgic about your addiction.

, Staying healthy is imperative to a successful recovery. This doesn’t mean that you can’t have a dessert now and then, but you do want to include plenty of fruits, vegetables, and water in your diet. Your body and mind feel better when you are healthy, which will help you avoid your addictive behaviors.Try to avoid foods like:

Sugary drinks (soda, juice, etc.)
Processed grains (white bread, white flour, white rice, etc.)
Foods high in unhealthy fats (fried food, whole fat dairy, etc.)


Make a point to include foods like:

Fruits (apples, bananas, citrus, etc)
Vegetables (carrots, spinach, broccoli, etc.)
Lean meats (chicken, salmon, etc.)
Foods high in healthy fats (salmon, avocado, etc.)


If you are recovering from a food addiction, you will have to be even more careful about the things you choose to eat. In this case, even the occasional dessert could put you at a high risk for relapse.

, Exercise keeps your body fit and releases endorphins that make you feel good. This will elevate your mood and your self-esteem. Spending time exercising will also keep you busy and reduce the risk of falling back into your old habits out of boredom.It’s an added bonus if you can spend time exercising with friends (or make friends exercising).
Choose an exercise you like. You can do anything from running to weight lifting. You can also do low impact exercises like swimming.

, Whether the work is paid or volunteer, it will give you a sense of purpose and commitment. Keeping a regular work schedule also keeps you busy and gets you out into the community where you can make new friends. Look for things that you enjoy doing for work. This way, you will look forward to (or at least not dread) going to work.Avoid jobs that force you to confront the object of your addiction (e.g. recovering alcoholics shouldn’t work in a bar).
Look for jobs that give you a sense of purpose to help you avoid craving your addiction (e.g. take a job that allows you to help people in poverty or others battling addiction).
Nonprofit and charity organizations often accept volunteers even if they are not hiring staff. This can be a good way to find meaningful activities, and in some cases may lead to a job down the road. Keep in mind that you might have to work in addition to volunteering.

, Addictions have a way of seeping into every aspect of life. They dictate your behavior as well as your social circle. Ending an addiction can leave you feeling like you just have to sit home by yourself all the time. The truth is that you can and should go out and do new things. This allows you to find things that you enjoy in place of your old habits, and you can make some new friends.If you have made friends in sobriety, schedule frequent outings with them that do not revolve around your addiction. Being with a group of people who have had similar experiences will help to strengthen you and keep you sober.
There are many activities that you can do that cost little or no money. For example, you could go to a museum or an art gallery. You could also go watch movies or take a hike in nature.

Cut ties with other users.,
Avoid your triggers.,
Be aware of your stress level.,
Rely on planning, not willpower.,
Gain control over any slips.,
Stay motivated for the long haul.",How to Avoid a Relapse into Addiction3," Whatever your addiction, associating with other people who currently partake in that behavior is dangerous. This can be difficult if you have been addicted for a long time because most of your friends are likely addicts as well. If you are serious about avoiding a relapse you have to avoid these friends as much as possible.It is also a good idea to change your phone number to prevent certain people from contacting you. You may even consider moving out of the area to reduce the chance of running into anyone you want to avoid.
Not only will hanging out with other addicts tempt you, they may not take your recovery seriously. This could result in you being pressured to ‘have some fun’ and go back to your old ways.

, Triggers are things that you associate with the need to use your addiction as a crutch. They can be anything from a particular emotion (like sadness) to a familiar T.V. show. Recognize what you are doing and how you feel when you have an urge to relapse. Write these things down and make a list of your triggers to help yourself avoid and control them.You can also discuss your triggers with your mental health professional and/or your doctor.

, Stress is a major contributor to addiction and relapse. Managing your stress level from day to day with things like mindfulness and exercise is imperative to successfully avoiding a relapse. You should also have a plan for coping with major life events. These major events can introduce a tremendous amount of stress in a relatively short time, so it is important to call your sponsor or a trusted friend or family member right away if one of these events occurs. Some examples are:A change in marital status
A loss or death
A change in finances or employment
A holiday or other family function

, Your willpower largely dependent on your mood and state of mind at any given time. The best way to avoid a relapse is to plan to stay away from places where you used to use, people that you used with, or scenarios that make you want to turn to your addiction again. While you might make it out of one or two situations, if you continue to put yourself in vulnerable positions, you are likely to relapse. Some examples of things you can plan to do to avoid bad situations are:Take a different route to and from work.
Avoid places you used to hang out.
Have a backup plan ready in case you run into an old friend that is still addicted. For example, you could cut the conversation short by saying that you are late to pick up your mother for a doctor’s appointment.
Practice how you might respond to offers for substances. You can do this by role playing and rehearsing your answers with your sponsor or a trusted friend or family member.

, There is a difference between slipping a time or two and having a full relapse into addiction. The main difference depends on how quickly you regain control. Forgive yourself for any mistakes that you make and get back to your recovery plan as soon as possible.It is important to remember that recovery is a long process and a small mistake does not mean that you have failed. A small mistake is also not an excuse to go on a binge.

, Many people relax once they have conquered their addiction for a period of time. This is a common way to fall back into addiction. To avoid relapse, you need to continue with your treatment plan. The plan can change and adapt over time, but if you take for granted that you’ve beaten the addiction, you can fall prey to it again.For example, you might not need to see a counselor every week after a year of treatment, but that doesn’t mean that you should stop practicing mindfulness and exercising.

Keep track of your computer time.,
Schedule breaks.,
Designate time away from the computer each day.,
Plan internet usage.,
Block distracting sites.,
Use technology to help you.,
Do computer related work as soon as possible.",How to Spend Less Time on the Computer1," To start, spend a day tracking your computer time. Many people convince themselves they need to be online as much as they are due to work, school, and social obligations. However, this may not be true. If you keep a log of what you do online and how long you do it, you'll be surprised how much of your screen time is unnecessary.


For a day, carry around a small notebook. Each time you use your computer, write down what you're doing, how long you're doing it for, and whether or not this is a necessary task. You may spend 20 minutes replying to e-mails for work, a task which is vital to your professional career. Before and after this, however, you may spend 30 minutes total browsing Facebook.Be honest. You do not have to show your journal to anyone else. The goal here is for you to assess where your time is going and how to alter that time. For example, you may be shocked to realize you spend 2 hours a day total on social media sites. If you feel that's too much, from here you can set a goal to cut that back to an hour. See if you can reach that goal the following day.;
, Staring at a screen for too long is unhealthy and can easily lead to eyestrain and headaches. Therefore, schedule breaks from computer usage. This can help you consciously make an effort to spend time away from your computer.


If you have downtime at work, do not immediately get on Twitter or Facebook. Instead, spend some time away from your computer. Go for a short walk. Read a book for 10 minutes. Call a friend to chat.When you're home alone, try to consciously schedule breaks when you're working on the computer. For example, after 2 hours of computer usage promise yourself you'll take a 20 minute walk with the dog. This will pull you away from the screen and give you a break. You can even set a timer to help yourself stay on track., If you're spending too much time on the computer, you should actively work on being more conscious of how you spend your time. Try to schedule time each day when you power down your laptop. A 2 or 3 hour technology-free block in your day will greatly help you use your time more wisely.


Pick a specific timeframe where you will not use your computer. It can be helpful to choose the same timeframe each day. For example, every day after work from 5 o'clock to 7 o'clock you'll be off your computer.It might be hard at first. Many people learn to use technology as their single source of downtime. Engaging in activities you enjoy can help. Cook or bake something. Go for a long walk. Read a book. Do a puzzle. Call a friend you haven't talked to in awhile.

, Just as you plan time away from your computer, scheduling your internet usage can also help. The internet is often designed to entice you to stay as long as possible. Many websites encourage mindless clicking and browsing. Planning how long you'll use the internet each day can help you from getting sucked in.


Know exactly what you want to do online before getting on the computer. If you want to update your Facebook status, plan to update your status and then move on. If you want to buy a Valentine's Day present for your boyfriend, know what you're looking for and where to look before opening your computer. If you want to catch up on the news, bookmark a few news websites you enjoy reading and check those as soon as you get online.If you occasionally enjoy simply browsing the internet, you can still do so. However, set time limits for yourself. For example, you can allow yourself 90 minutes a day to simply go online. Set a timer for yourself and get offline when the timer goes off. At first, this might take some discipline but you'll come to enjoy your newfound self control.

, When you tracked your daily internet use, what sites took up the most time unnecessarily? Did you waste time on Facebook? Did you spend too much time browsing humorous sites, like Cracked? Most browsers have ad-ons or applications you can download that can temporarily block your access to time wasting sites. Firefox has a technology called LeechBlock, for example, that block websites for set periods of time. Consider installing some of these ad-ons and blocking troublesome sites for a few hours each day. That way, if you need to be on the computer you can make sure you use your time wisely., There are other ad-ons and applications that can help you manage your internet time. Consider investing in some of them if the internet is a major culprit in you spending too much time on your computer.


If you depend on the computer for your job, try RescueTime. This is an analytics application that can break down what you're doing on your computer each day and for how long. This can be quicker and simpler than tracking your computer time yourself each day. You can use RescueTime to see how you're improving as you strive to spend less time online.SelfControl is an application for Macs that blocks troublesome websites. It's similar to other ad-ons in that you block a site for a set number of hours. However, it's much harder to disable. You cannot get rid of SelfControl by deactivating the timer or restarting your computer You simply have to wait for the allotted time to pass. If you frequently disable or delete similar browser ad-ons, SelfControl may work for you., If you need to e-mail a colleague or complete another task online, you may procrastinate. This can lead to you wasting time browsing the internet or playing games after opening your laptop to complete a task. Simply changing the way you prioritize can lead to less time online.


When you have to work to do on the computer, make that the priority when you get online. Promise yourself you won't open Facebook until you've sent out that work-related e-mail. Avoid playing a game of The Sims if you haven't uploaded the new design to your company's website.It can be awkward to avoid procrastination at first. Many people are chronic procrastinators and the instant gratification of something like a game or social media is more enticing than work. It may take you a few days to get in the hang of prioritizing properly. If you fail to do so at first, keep trying. Eventually, this small change can add up to less hours a day on the computer.

Writing down the personal factors that are motivating you to make this change can help clarify your sense of purpose, which will come in handy down the road when you're struggling with the urge to start chewing again.


Be specific. Go beyond just writing ""my wife asked me to quit."" Write down the effect chewing tobacco has had on your relationship, and the fact that you want to be a strong, healthy presence in your kids' lives for a long time to come. make a list of all the reasons why you think quitting is a good idea.






Write a happy ending to the story. After you think about the harm chewing tobacco has caused you and your reasons for wanting to quit, write about how your life will look when you've successfully kicked the habit. What positive changes will it bring to your life? List all of the ways, large and small, your life will be improved. Here are a few examples:






You won't have to deal with tobacco stains on your teeth and clothes.
Your breath will smell better, and you'll be able to kiss your loved ones without brushing your teeth first.
Any sores inside your mouth will heal, and you'll be able to taste and enjoy food with more pleasure.

You won't have to duck out of meetings or gatherings to chew.
You'll save the money, time and energy required to keep up a tobacco habit.

;
, Quitting smokeless tobacco requires a deeply personal commitment to eliminating tobacco from your life. Starting with a firm sense of purpose is the only sure way to get through the mental and physical cravings that make quitting tobacco products so difficult. Your reason for quitting must be more important to you than feeling the pleasure of chewing tobacco. Here are some common reasons people quit chewing tobacco:


Health concerns. Using chewing tobacco leads to mouth, throat, esophageal, and stomach cancer, as well as other health concerns like increased risk of heart disease and stroke.Sometimes it takes knowing someone else who has been affected by one of these diseases to come to grips with the enormity of the health damage tobacco products can cause.






Noticeable physical side effects. Chewing tobacco can cause tooth loss, receding gums, brown or yellow teeth, and bad breath. After a certain point these visible and uncomfortable side effects may become bothersome enough to stimulate your drive to quit.






Time and expense. Taking a dip and making sure you have somewhere to spit the juices can make little dents in your day and add up to a great inconvenience over time. Chewing tobacco can also be expensive. The time and expense eaten away by chewing tobacco aren't usually compelling enough reasons to quit on their own, but they may add to your sense of purpose.






Relationship issues. Sometimes it's easier to quit for someone else than it is to do it for yourself. If your partner or children have been imploring you to quit, you may find that the idea of regaining your health for their sake is a worthwhile reason to go tobacco-free.







, Having a concrete date in mind is important when you're quitting chewing tobacco. You could quit cold turkey, but the success rate is higher for people who have a plan in place instead. Picking a date gives you time to prepare yourself emotionally and physically for the tasking days to come.


Pick a date about a month away. This will give you time to get ready, but it's not so far off that you'll lose determination.






Consider picking a date with special meaning to you. Many people pick their birthday (which won't work if it's too far away, of course), a holiday, or some other meaningful date. As the birthday or holiday approaches, the festivities surrounding it will have added poignancy since it's the day you'll be changing your life for the better.






Make a firm commitment to quit on your chosen date, then mark it on your calendar and let anticipation build.






Notify your family, friends, coworkers, and other important people in your life about your quit day. You'll need their encouragement and support as the day approaches.







, Quitting chewing tobacco is definitely possible to do on your own, but it can help your chances of succeeding if you draw on outside resources to assist you. Doctors, therapists, and support groups are in place to help you get through this difficult process more easily.


Consider getting a prescription to help you quit. Varenicline and bupropion are prescription drugs that help people quit harmful habits over time. You could also get nicotine patches to help with the physical withdrawal symptoms. Talk to your doctor about whether taking one of these drugs is the right choice for you. Make an appointment well in advance of your quit date. If you decide to use a prescription, you'll have to start taking it one or two weeks before you quit.






Talk to your dentist about your intention to quit. Your dentist will provide motivation by telling you about the changes your mouth will undergo once tobacco is no longer causing damage, and he or she might be able to point you toward helpful resources as well.






Talk to a therapist. Discuss your feelings of anticipation, excitement and fear with someone who can help you sort through the emotions that come with making such a big life decision. A therapist can also help you put a plan in place for dealing with withdrawal, which is as difficult emotionally as it is physically.






Join a support group. Nicotine Anonymous and other support groups give you the chance to talk about what you're going through with people who have been there. Consider joining one in your area, or meet with friends who have quit chewing tobacco and are willing to share their experience with you.







, The less nicotine that's in your system on your quit day, the better, because you'll be used to chewing less and dealing with cravings. You chew less tobacco the day you decide to quit, and continue decreasing the amount you chew as quit day approaches.


Try chewing half or one-third the amount that you currently chew. When you feel a craving, wait as long as possible before chewing.






Decide not to chew in certain settings. For example, if you're going to see your child perform in a school play, leave your chew at home for those few hours.







, Are there certain people, places or events that make your cravings for chewing tobacco more intense? Everyone has triggers that cause us to fall back on bad habits. Naming them and eliminating them from your life will go a long way toward helping you stop chewing tobacco.


If there are certain people with whom you normally chew tobacco, let them know you are quitting, and that you'd appreciate if they didn't chew around you anymore. If they can't or won't stop, you'll have to avoid spending time with them while you're trying to quit, and maybe for a long time to come.






Maybe the smell of a bonfire or the sound of a bat cracking a baseball makes you want to have a chew. As much as you might love familiar smells and sounds that you associate with the pleasurable feeling of chewing tobacco, you'll have to avoid them until you know they won't trigger a relapse.






Some triggers can't be avoided. Stress, fear, and other internal triggers are part of daily life. Just knowing that these feelings can act as triggers can help, because you'll have a plan in place for facing them head-on.







, When quit day draws near, take measures to make sure the spaces you occupy on a daily basis are free of temptations. This important step can make a big difference during the first week or two after you quit.


Throw away all traces of tobacco. Don't save half-empty cans or any type of memorabilia that could entice you to chew ""just one more time."" Throw it all away and make sure the trash gets collected before the sun comes up on quit day.






Replace tobacco-stained or scented clothing and other items. Give yourself a fresh start with new shirts, sheets, and other items that typically take on the smell of tobacco.
Stock up on chew alternatives. Many find that having something else to chew helps quell withdrawal cravings. Fill your pantry with items like chewing gum, beef or turkey jerky, fruit chews, or fake chew., When quit day has finally come, that's it. Your cravings will be intense, but chewing tobacco, or ingesting it in any other form, isn't an option. Stay true to your commitment to end your dependency on tobacco today.


Reach for your chew alternatives when you feel the urge to have something your mouth.
Eat as much as you want. Trying to diet and quit tobacco at the same time is too difficult; you can always cut back on calories after your habit is under control.






Stay active. Working, running errands, and exercising can help distract your mind and body from cravings.







, Avoid spending time with people who chew tobacco, and stay away from places or events where you used to enjoy chewing tobacco. It's important, especially during the first few weeks, to protect yourself from these pitfalls.


Using alcohol often leads people to fall back on tobacco use. Avoid drinking, especially during the first few weeks after quit day.






Start new habits. Everyday activities like watching TV or driving to work may be linked to your desire to chew tobacco. Simple changes like watching TV in a different room or taking a different route to work can take your mind off of chewing tobacco.
If you feel your resolve weaken as a result of an internal trigger, like stress, call a help line, a member of your support group, or your therapist.

, Many say that the mental addiction to tobacco is tougher to defeat than the physical addiction. You many find that in the first few days and weeks of quitting, your personality seems to have changed. You're experiencing what every former user experiences: withdrawal. Take control in the following ways:


Don't give in to rationalizations. Recognize these harmful thoughts for what they are, and have a plan for getting past them. For example, if you think to yourself, ""What's the harm in chewing just one more time?"" recognize that the thought is not based on reality, grab a chew replacement, and go for a bike ride.

Other rationalizations include, ""You have to die of something,"" ""It's a free country,"" ""I'm going to enjoy my life to the fullest,"" and so on.Get alone time when you need it. Quitting tobacco may make you extremely short-tempered with your family, friends and coworkers. When you feel yourself heating up during a conversation, politely excuse yourself. If you don't think you can get through a party without being short with someone, avoid it. People will understand, and in a few weeks you'll be back to your regular self.
When you're having a hard time, read the statement you wrote describing your reasons for quitting. Remember what a good decision this is, and how much it will pay off in the end.

, After two or three weeks, the intense cravings will subside, but that doesn't mean it will be easy to remain tobacco-free. You'll have to continue dealing with triggers rationalizing thoughts. Use the methods that worked to get you through the initial hump, and ditch the ones that didn't help.


If you found that exercising helped, consider joining a gym, joining a team, or signing up for a race. Fill up your days with a good habit that takes the time, money and energy you previously would have spent on chewing tobacco.






You may find that eventually you don't need to chew gum or another chew replacement, but if you continue enjoying the feeling of chewing, keep doing it. Some people worry about gaining weight when they quit tobacco, so if this is a concern for you, consider chewing sugar-free gum, carrot sticks or another healthy substitute.

, Set milestones - two weeks tobacco-free, two months tobacco-free - and celebrate each one. Use the money you saved on chewing tobacco to buy yourself a reward, take a trip, or take a loved one out to dinner. Quitting tobacco is hard work, and you deserve to feel amazing!

, Slipping, or giving in to the impulse to chew just one time, is a common occurrence for former tobacco users. If you slip, assess why it happened and make sure you're prepared to face down the trigger or rationalizing thoughts that caused you to turn to chewing tobacco. The important thing is to make sure the slip doesn't turn into a relapse to your former daily chewing tobacco habit.


Take slips seriously. Call your therapist or support group to talk through what happened. Write down your thoughts and remind yourself why quitting chewing tobacco is important.
If you relapse, go back to the beginning. Think about what worked and what didn't, and try again. With a strong purpose and a solid plan, eventually you'll be able to kick this habit for good.

, Your doctor will very likely have a recommendation for a medical supply store or website from which to obtain your specific catheter.It is possible that the doctor's office will send you home with one, but other times you will need to purchase one yourself. Note, these catheters generally need to be replaced after several uses or can be one time use only. Ensure that a spare is always available.


Some medical supply companies include DVDs that you can watch to demonstrate how to insert a catheter. Try looking for one of these options if you are worried you might forget your doctor's technique. When in doubt call doctor's office or home health nurse for help.

Make a rule about no phones out during mealtimes, even if you eat alone.On occasion, go for a walk without your phone. If possible, attend a social event and leave your phone at home.

, Oftentimes, big commitments are hard to maintain. Change takes time and you may not go from being a computer junkie to spending 2 hours a day technology free. If you're struggling to make a transition, try making small 5 to 15 minute commitments.


Promise yourself you'll take a 15 minute walk 3 times a week. Try to honor this commitment no matter what occurs. This may feel more doable than a goal like, ""I'll spend an hour a day working out instead of using the computer.""Scheduling tiny pockets of time can add up.

Be aware of what you're wearing.,
Rely on automatic devices.,
Rest easy.",How to Urinate Without Touching the Toilet1," Women have long been searching for ways to avoid touching the toilet. It hardly seems fair that men can stand when you have to sit, right? Fortunately, the marketplace has responded to women's needs. There are now funnel-like devices for sale that allow women the ease of standing while urinating. When you're shopping, look for what is known as a Female Urinary Device.You'll want to shop around. There are many FUD's available, and most are pretty affordable. Pick the style and size that's right for you. For example, if you plan to transport the FUD frequently, try picking a smaller option. Don't worry if you don't love it--there are others you can try!;
, Most women have tried the squat/hover method, and most would agree--you need tips on how to do it better. For the least messy results, try placing your feet fairly wide apart (think wider than hip-width). This will create a steady base. Then hover towards the seat while leaning slightly forward.Many women find it useful to try to balance their hands or elbows on your thighs while leaning forward to prevent wobbling.
Strengthen your thighs. The stronger your legs, the easier the squat will be for you. Try doing multiple reps of strengthening exercises with light weights. Think squats and lunges. Yet another benefit of hitting the gym!, Some outfits are simply easier to manage when faced with a dirty public restroom. Ideally, you'd always be wearing a skirt with no underwear when faced with the need to hover, but that's not reality. If you're wearing something more complicated, such as a jumper, you'll need to take extra precautions.


After you've rolled down the top of your jumper, focus on the bottom. Gather up the wide legs of your outfit in your hand to avoid them dragging on the floor. Then, slowly back up in hover position until you are over the toilet.Other troublesome garments include shorts and pants. Practice lowering these only as far as absolutely necessary so that they avoid dragging on the ground. You'll also want to practice balancing with your shorts around your knees.

, Technology can be your best friend in a dirty bathroom. Many public toilets are not only equipped with automatic flushing devices, but with automatic clean seat covers. Seek out restrooms with these upgrades. The less surfaces you have to touch, the better you will feel about the situation., Although they look horrifying, public toilets actually present a much lower health risk than many people realize. In reality, your odds of catching a disease or infection from a toilet seat are incredibly low. You are much more likely to become ill from bacteria living on the sponges in your kitchen. So don't worry too much if you haven't managed to perfect your squat!"

See your physician for a urine ""ACR"" to test your kidney function.The urine ""ACR"" stands for the ""albumin to creatinine ratio."",
Understand that you may receive a ""random"" urine test or a 24-hour test.If you and your doctor opt for a ""random"" sample, you will be asked to submit a one-time urine sample to the lab which can give a snapshot view as to the amount of protein present in your urine at that time.,
Ask your doctor for a ""urinalysis"" to gain additional information about your kidney function.In addition to the more basic test of looking for protein in your urine, a ""urinalysis"" also examines your urine under the microscope checking for any red blood cells, white blood cells, or other unusual things that may be present in your urine.,
See your physician for a blood test to evaluate your kidney function.There are a few different things that can be measured in a blood test that can provide valuable information to your doctor about your kidney function.,
Interpret the significance of your creatinine and eGFR results.Creatinine is a waste product that accumulates in the blood.,
Receive BUN (blood urea nitrogen) and creatinine clearance tests.BUN is another waste product that can build up in the blood when the kidneys are not functioning adequately, and is hence used as a potential sign of kidney disease or acute kidney impairment.,
Have your blood pressure measured.In addition to receiving both urine tests and blood tests, if your doctor suspects that you may have a kidney problem (either acute or chronic) it is key that you receive regular blood pressure measurements as well.,
Get tested for diabetes.,
Receive further kidney evaluations as necessary.If your urine and blood tests show evidence of kidney disease, you may need to proceed with further investigation such as imaging and/or a kidney biopsy.",How to Test Kidney Function," Albumin is a protein that is normally present in your blood, and that should generally NOT be filtered in excess quantities through your kidneys into your urine. It is for this reason that protein in your urine (such as albumin) can be indicative of kidney disease.


If your urine ACR comes back ""positive,"" the test should be repeated for confirmation.
You need at least 3 measurements of elevated protein (albumin) in your urine over 3 or more months in order for it to be diagnostic of chronic (ongoing) kidney disease.;
, Technically, the 24-hour urine test is more accurate than just providing one sample, as it allows your doctor to calculate the average amount of protein in your urine over a full day. However, it is also more cumbersome as you will need to collect ALL of your urine over the course of 24 hours, every time you go.


It is important to discuss the pros and cons of each option with your doctor.
A random urine sample may be sufficient to diagnose protein in your urine.
If your results are borderline, however, you may be asked to complete the 24-hour urine test for a more detailed assessment of the amount of protein in your urine over the course of a full day.

, If your urine is positive for red blood cells or white blood cells when the doctor looks under the microscope, this is oftentimes a sign of kidney damage.


Blood cells are normally too large to be filtered through the kidneys.
Therefore, their presence in the urine can indicate problems with the kidneys' filtering system that would allow such large cells to get through.

, These can all be measured via the same blood test. They include: the creatinine, the eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate), the BUN (blood urea nitrogen), and the creatinine clearance.


The results you receive on these blood tests will be very effective at testing your kidney function.
They will indicate to your physician whether there are any signs of kidney disease - either acute (short-term) problems, or signs of chronic and ongoing kidney troubles.

, With normal healthy kidneys, the creatinine waste product is effectively removed from the blood via the kidneys which filter it out through the urine. When you have kidney disease, however, the rate at which creatinine is filtered and removed from your blood slows, leading to a build-up of this waste product that can subsequently be detected on blood tests.


The purpose of measuring creatinine is that it provides insight into your kidney function, and also allows your doctor to calculate the eGRF (the estimated glomerular filtration rate).
The eGFR is not a quantity that is directly ""measured"" via the blood test; rather, it is calculated (approximately) based on your creatinine reading.
The calculated value for eGRF that your doctor comes up with based on your creatinine results is another important way to evaluate kidney function, because it gives insight as to the rate at which the glomeruli in your kidneys are filtering blood.
A creatinine level between 0.5-1.5mg/dL is considered normal in men, and 0.6-1.2mg/dL is considered normal in women.An eGFR above 60mLs/min/1.73 square meters is considered indicative of normal and healthy kidney function (as long as you do not have other signs or symptoms of kidney disease). An eGFR below that is diagnostic of kidney disease.

, The downside to BUN is that this waste product may also be elevated in other disease states, such as for patients with congestive heart failure, or in the midst of a heart attack or in shock. The benefit to BUN, however, as opposed to simply using the creatinine waste product measurement, is that an elevated BUN is less likely to have false positive results than an elevated creatinine.


The creatinine clearance rate is when the creatinine measurement in your blood is compared to the creatinine measurement in your 24-hour urine test.
Your physician can then determine the rate at which creatinine is being filtered from your blood through your kidneys into your urine.

, This is because high blood pressure may contribute to kidney disease. If your blood pressure is high, talk to your doctor about dealing with that as soon as possible.


A high blood pressure is defined as a reading over 140 systolic (the top number) or over 90 diastolic (the bottom number).
Generally, your doctor will perform a few blood pressure measurements over time in order to get your average (and to ensure that he or she does not diagnose you with high blood pressure based on just one blood pressure reading, but rather, based on several).
There are several treatments available for high blood pressure (medically called ""hypertension"") if you are found to have it.
Getting your blood pressure under control will likely have a beneficial effect on improving your kidney function, as well.

, It is important to understand that diabetes is a major risk factor for kidney disease.If you have diabetes, you need to be screened for kidney disease at least once a year, even if you have no signs or symptoms that are suspicious of kidney disease. This is because there is a very strong correlation between diabetes (particularly diabetes with continually uncontrolled blood sugar levels) and the development of kidney disease as a complication of elevated blood sugar levels.


To get tested for diabetes, you can have your glucose levels as well as your HbA1c (Hemoglobin A1c, a long-term measure of your sugar levels) measured via a blood test.
Following through with all recommended treatments for diabetes, if you are indeed diagnosed with it, is key to delaying the development of kidney disease and/or to preventing it from becoming worse, if you already have it.

, Directly looking at your kidneys, either with an imaging test or with a biopsy, can help your doctor to diagnose the underlying cause of your kidney problems, if this remains unknown.


Imaging tests and/or biopsies are generally reserved for more severe cases where the underlying cause of your kidney disease remains unknown.
These additional investigations may be key in helping your doctor create an appropriate treatment plan.

Confirm the presence of a UTI before treating your baby.,
Get your baby started on antibiotics.,
Consider paracetamol or acetaminophen.,

Consider using cantharis.,
Try lycopodium clavatum.,
Try borax.",How to Treat UTI in Babies," The first step in treating your baby's UTI is a visit to your doctor to get a urine sample taken. Then, they'll send the sample to the lab for a culture sensitivity test to confirm the UTI and to determine the causative bacteria. Only then can you know which course of treatment is best for your child.


If your baby is less than three months old, your doctor may advise hospitalization. Intravenous administration of antibiotics in such young babies is recommended, and it will likely heal the infection within 48 hours.
However, if your baby is more than three months old your doctor may advise hospitalization only if he/she is dehydrated, has a persistent high temperature above 38 °C (100 °F), has an underlying urinary tract condition, or a family history of kidney diseases.

Babies who are more than 3 months old and do not display the above symptoms can be treated at home after consulting a pediatrician to assess the severity of the infection.

;
, Antibiotics are the mainstay of western medicine for treating UTIs since they can control these infections within 48 hours once treatment is started. Amoxicillin and clavulanate, ampicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and nitrofurantoin, are usually preferred in the treatment of UTIs in babies. Once you confirm the UTI infection with your baby's doctor, he or she will prescribe any one of these oral antibiotics to treat your baby:Amoxicillin and clavulanate are available commercially as Augmentin and Augmentin XR. They can be administered orally in the dosage of 20mg/kg/day in divided doses given thrice a day for 3-7 days. Severe infections may require divided doses of 40mg/kg of amoxicillin.Ampicillin or Omnipen is also administered orally; 12.5 to 25 mg/kg of ampicillin can be given every 6 hours for 3-7 days.Trimethoprim/sulfhamethoxazole is available as Bactrim. It is also administered orally, and its recommended dosage is 5-7 mg/kg/day given 6 hourly for 7 days. This antibiotic is also used for UTI prophylaxis or to prevent the recurrence of these infections.1-2 mg/kg of bactrim administered orally in divided doses can prevent the recurrence of UTIs in babies.Nitrofurantoin is available as Macrobid and is recommended in an oral dosage of 5-7 mg/kg/day to be given in divided doses 6 hourly for 7 days. Nitrofurantoin is also recommended for UTI prophylaxis. Two divided doses of 1-2 mg/kg body weight/ day are prescribed for this purpose.You will have to use the antibiotic syrups or suspensions available for pediatric use if your baby is not old enough to swallow pills.
Dosage calculations are generic and based on weight. However, make sure you consult a doctor before using these medications.



, You can give your baby one of the pediatric paracetamol or acetaminophen suspensions available at the pharmacy to bring down fever and reduce pain arising from the UTI. 10-15 mg/kg can be given orally or through rectal suppositories. Check with your doctor to determine the exact dosage that is right for your situation.You can give up to 5 doses every 24 hours if required.However, be wary of overdosing. Talk to your doctor about how much is appropriate for your baby.

, Oral antibiotics are usually administered through a medicine dropper or oral syringes for babies that are too young to take pills. Here's how to correctly administer oral medication to your baby:


Wash your hands. Washing your hands reduces the number of microbes on your hands, lowering the risk of contamination.
Shake the medication, if instructed. Commonly, baby medications are suspensions. Drug components settle on the bottom of the liquid giving you an uneven mixture of dosage. Shake it to get an even dose.
Measure the correct dosage in the oral syringe or dropper.
Hold the infant upright. An upright position prevents your baby from breathing in the medication to his or her lungs, which can be fatal.
Administer the medication between the baby’s gum and cheeks slowly, one drop at a time. Allow the baby to swallow. This prevents aspiration and gagging.
Give water or the baby’s regular milk through their bottle. This flushes out the taste from your baby's mouth, which may be unpleasant.
Wash your instruments and hands to avoid contamination.

, Fluids will flush out the bacteria from your baby’s urinary tract, make the urine less concentrated or acidic, reduce inflammation, and prevent dehydration. See that your child passes urine at least 6-8 times in 24 hours.You can give fluids in the form of water and breast milk to babies below 6 months of age. Babies old enough to take top feed and semi-solids should be fed plenty of water, milk, and fresh juices to increase their fluid intake.

Make sure you dilute the fruit juices before administering them, as some of them can increase the acidity of urine.



, If your baby is old enough to consume semi-solid or solid food and drinks besides milk and water, be cautious as to what you feed him or her. Avoid giving your baby pomegranates, citrus fruits, and tomatoes while the infection lasts as these fruits could increase urine acidity too. In addition, carbonated drinks can irritate your baby’s urinary tract, so avoid giving them to your baby as well.


Keep your baby on a diet of more bland, basic foods and drinks. Stick to water, diluted juice, breast milk, and cereals, vegetables, and sweeter, less acidic fruits.

, If your baby's diaper is soiled or full, immediately change it – bacteria love urine and baby poop. Clean the genital with an antimicrobial baby wipe. You can use antimicrobial soaps in cleaning the genital area also. In wiping the genital area of the infant, here's what to keep in mind:


Wash your hands. Again, this reduces the number of microbes on your hands and prevents cross-contamination.
For a male baby, wipe from the tip of the urethra, that is the genital opening, to the base of the penis in a circular motion, then to the anus. This technique avoids contaminating the cleaned area.
For a female baby, wipe from the surrounding area of the vagina in a stroke away from it, from front to back. Discard the baby wipe. Then wipe from the clitoris to the anus twice with clean baby wipes. Discard the wipes.
Wash your hands. Once more, this prevents cross-contamination, this time keeping you from getting sick.

, Once a day, bathe your baby with warm water and hypoallergenic soap. This keeps your baby's body (and genitals) clean, preventing the spread and growth of bacteria. Be sure to dry off your baby, too!


In a small tub, be careful not submerge the baby in the water; instead, hold the baby in a position where the head is higher than his/her feet. Start cleaning from the head down to the toes. This method makes them more comfortable in addition to being an efficient way of bathing hygienically.

, The use of cotton diapers or cloth diapers are encouraged for babies with recurring UTIs. These diapers do not encourage bacterial growth unlike their disposable counterparts. Cotton/cloth diapers provide greater ventilation and make the babies comfortable too.


Fitting them to your baby is just like a regular disposable diaper, but it is washed after use.
However, you must also buy the other necessary accessories needed such as pins and a bucket or trash can with a cover for storing soiled diapers.

, Antibiotics and other conventional medicines sometimes cause side effects and kidney damage. Long-term use of antibiotics could also make your baby resistant to the effects of some antibiotics in the future. Hence, alternative therapies like homeopathy are considered reasonable options to help treat and prevent UTI in babies.


Most importantly, homeopathic medicines are generally regarded as safe for babies as they have minimal or no side effects. These medicines go through a process of potentization to dilute the original or crude medicinal substance and to activate its medicinal properties. These extreme dilutions make these drugs safe and effective in the treatment of a number of illnesses.

, This is a popular remedy that's often used for especially painful UTIs. Cantharis 30 orally once a day for 15 days should help cure the infection, especially if your baby exhibits the following symptoms:


Crying on passing urine or afterwards
Cloudy urine mixed with blood
Passes frank blood from the urethra
Extreme restlessness
Redness of the genitals

, This remedy is similar to cantharis and is often indicated for similarly painful UTIs, where children cry after passing urine due to pain in the urethra, have cloudy urine with reddish brick like sediments, and in those who urinate more during the night. Lycopodium 30 orally once a day for 1 month may relieve these symptoms.


Lycopodium is also known as club moss, running pine, ground pine, lamb’s tail, fox tail, and vegetable sulphur. It is available in certain pharmacies, vitamin and supplement, and health food stores. However, before treatment, consult your doctor to find out if this is safe and appropriate for your child.

, Borax is sometimes recommended for children with urinary tract infections that are so painful they may shriek or cry before beginning to urinate, as they know the pain is coming and, as a result, are afraid to urinate. The child also cries on any downward motion. Borax 30 orally once a day for 15 days can be effective in such cases.


It also may help treat UTIs in people who are sensitive to noise and suffer from motion sickness.

Plan ahead.,
Create a barrier.,
Use toilet paper to flush.,
Wash your hands.",How to Urinate Without Touching the Toilet2," Of course you'd love to just not have to deal with bathroom germs, but that is not realistic. Instead, plan your bathroom breaks to coincide with being near the cleanest possible area. If you're on a road trip, scope out gas stations that have a great reputation for being clean. Use social media and travel websites that post a lot of reviews to help with your research.


Also, wear clothes that are easy to manage. Loose fitting clothing that is easy to manipulate is your best bet.
You can also plan ahead by thinking about how to navigate the room or stall while touching as few surfaces as possible. For example, touch up your make-up in the car. Then you will have to spend less time in the restroom, and will therefore touch fewer surfaces. , If you don't want to either squat or touch the seat, you need a barrier. Utilize the paper liners that are in many public restrooms, taking care to flush them when you're done. If a liner is not available, you can line the seat with fresh toilet paper to protect your tush.Try traveling with your own supply of paper liners. Small travel packs are often available at convenience stores, and can eliminate a lot of your problems.

, The handle of the toilet is actually one of the filthiest parts of any bathroom. Often it can be tempting to use your foot to flush. Resist this urge! This can actually cause mechanical issues, which could result in you getting some backsplash from the toilet. Instead, use a piece of toilet paper and use your hand to flush., Most of the germs in bathrooms are a result of people not washing their hands. They touch many surfaces and the result is contamination. Take care to wash your hands many times a day (not just after using the restroom) to help protect your health."

Understand the function of the kidneys and urinary system.,
Consult your doctor before starting a kidney cleansing fast.,
Reduce the amount of food you eat during the days leading up to your fast.,
Determine what your fluid intake should be.,
Adopt a liquid diet for 3 days that includes water, juice, herbal teas and vegetable broth.,
Eat watermelon to cleanse kidneys after your 3 day fast.,
Ease yourself slowly out of the fast by eating raw vegetables.",How to Understand a Kidney Cleansing Fast," The average person is born with 2 kidneys. They are a component of your body's urinary system, along with the ureters and the bladder. The kidneys have a number of functions, including balancing body fluids, balancing body chemicals, removing waste products and releasing essential hormones. They are essential to your other organs because  they process and rid the body of waste products, including chemicals, salt and excess water. The following steps will analyze how the elements of a kidney cleansing fast affect the body.;
,


Some people are at risk for kidney disease. If anyone in your family has had kidney disease, it is a good idea to get blood pressure, blood and urine tests to determine your overall kidney health.
A kidney cleansing fast may also inhibit medication absorption.

,


Fasting often increases feelings of hunger. This early reduction in diet can help to curb your hunger.
For some people this may be the only step required; eating a healthy diet and increasing your fluid intake may be enough to cleanse the kidneys.
Many kidney disease patients are asked to limit their intake of food that is high in protein, cholesterol and sodium. The kidneys are responsible for processing these substances, and this change in diet can allow the kidneys to rest before, during or after the cleanse.

, Most kidney cleansing fasts last about 3 days and they recommend that you consume half of your body weight in ounces. For example if you weigh 180 lbs. (81.6 kg), you should drink 90 oz. (2.66 l) of water each day.


Fluids are essential to a kidney cleansing fast because your kidneys filter and clean around 200 qt. (189.27 l) of fluid from your blood every day. About 198 qt. (187.377 l) are absorbed and 2 qt. (1.89 l) continue on to the bladder to form urine.
Many cleansing fasts recommend using distilled water because it does not have the mineral content of tap water. This also allows your kidneys to rest by limiting the number of minerals your kidneys will have to process.

, Avoid alcohol, caffeine and dairy products.


Liquids help to rehydrate the body, which is essential to preventing kidney stones, which are crystalline deposits that form when a person is dehydrated and too much of a substance, like calcium, is in the urine.
Teas made from celery seeds or nettles act as natural diuretics. Parsley and bearberry are commonly used in teas as they aid the digestive and urinary systems.
Alcohol, caffeine and milk products act as diuretics, which cause you to urinate more frequently and get rid of fluids very quickly, thus dehydrating the body before essential fluids are absorbed.
Vegetable broth is made by boiling vegetables or vegetable peels, including carrots, celery and beets for an hour, and then straining and drinking the nutrient-rich fluid. Drink this broth 2 to 3 times a day to combat electrolyte and potassium loss.

,


Watermelon is a natural diuretic, but unlike alcohol and caffeine, it does not seem to strain the kidneys. A watermelon cleanse helps the liver to process ammonia, a waste from protein digestion, and deliver it to the urea. This also eases strain on the kidneys, while ridding the body of excess fluids.
There are many ways to derive this benefit from watermelon. It can be cut up and eaten whole (with seeds) or juiced. The seeds can be made into tea, and the flesh can be made into soup.

,


Any change in diet should be slowly adopted to avoid lightheadedness, nausea or hunger. After eating vegetables for a few days, incorporate small amounts of protein, and then move back into a normal, healthy diet.

Discuss your concerns with your primary health care provider.,
Understand the blood test.,
Understand the urine test.,
Get the blood sample.,
Get the urine sample.,
Await your test results.",How to Test for Kidney Disease1," Tell your doctor about any symptoms you may be experiencing.


Symptoms may include puffiness of the eyes, hands a feet; passage of bloody, cloudy or tea-colored urine; excessive foaming of the urine; passing less urine or difficulty passing urine; fatigue and loss of appetite; persistent generalized itching.Your doctor will then order you to undergo a series of standard tests. The National Kidney Foundation recommends two simple tests to check for kidney disease, one assessing your blood and one that assessing your urine.;
, It's important to keep yourself informed about what these tests measure and what information they provide about your kidney function. Staying informed can also help keep anxiety at bay.


The blood test is called the Glomerular Filtration Rate. It measures how much blood your kidneys filter each minute. This is known as your GFR (glomerular filtration rate). This test shows how well your kidneys are working.The normal value for GFR is 90 or above. A GFR below 60 is a sign that the kidneys are not working properly., The urine test checks for protein in your urine, which can be a sign of kidney disease. When the filters in the kidneys are damaged, protein leaks into the urine.


This test has several different names, including a check for ""proteinuria,"" ""albuminuria,"" or ""microalbuminuria."" It can also be called a ""urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio."", You will have to visit a medical lab clinic where a technician will draw a standard blood sample from your arm.Your health care provider may ask you to temporarily stop taking any medications that could affect the results. These include antibiotic, stomach acid, and chemotherapy medicines.The risks of a blood test are minimal. In rare cases, people might experience excessive bleeding, fainting or lightheadedness, or infection.Some people feel moderate pain when the needle is inserted into the arm. Most, however, feel only a little prick. After the sample is drawn, there might be some throbbing or a slight bruise, but it should not last for long.The sample is then sent to a lab for testing.

, In most cases, you will be asked to give a small urine sample while at your doctor's office. There is no special preparation required for this test. There are also no risks associated with providing a urine sample.


In rare cases, you may have to collect all of your urine at home for 24 hours. To do this, you will need to get a special container from your doctor.The sample is sent to the lab for testing.

, Your doctor will contact you once the results are available. It's best to meet with him or her to discuss the potential diagnosis and treatment plan if the results are positive for kidney disease.

Observe and carefully monitor your child’s health.,
Be aware of the chances that each grade of reflux has of resolving without surgery.,
Determine if dysfunctional voiding is a part of the problem.,
Treat the dysfunctional voiding to combat the reflux.,
Understand that urinary tract infections (UTIs) are also a condition that can lead to reflux.,
Treat your child’s UTI with antibiotics.,
Have a culture taken to determine if your child really has a UTI.,
Talk to your doctor about continuous antibiotics to treat recurrent UTIs.,
Schedule regular sonogram appointments for your child.",How to Treat Urinary Reflux in Children1," Lower grades of reflux resolve without surgery in most children. This usually occurs as the bladder and its ureteral valve undergo growth.


If children with lower grades remain free of recurring infections, new kidney injury is uncommon.;
, The chance of the reflux resolving depends somewhat on how old your child is when he or she is diagnosed. The longer the child has had reflux, the less likely that it will resolve on its own. The intensity of the reflux is described as a ‘grade’, with grade 1 being the least intense, and most likely to resolve without surgery The overall likelihood of the reflux eventually resolving without surgery is roughly:


Grade 1: 80 to 90%.
Grade 2: 70 to 80%.
Grade 3: 50 to 60%.
Grade 4: 10 to 20%.
Grade 5: 5 to 10%.

, Voiding dysfunction refers to several common conditions in which children have abnormal urination patterns with and without moderate to severe constipation. Some common signs that your child is dealing with dysfunctional voiding include:


Frequent urination with urgent running to the bathroom or daytime wetting.
Urination may be infrequent, perhaps two to three times a day or less.
Keep in mind that parents may be unaware of constipation if their child does not recognize or admit to it.

, Treatment of voiding dysfunction usually requires some combination of bladder retraining, behavior modification, medications, and pelvic floor biofeedback therapy. Most large pediatric medical institutions have specialists or programs that can assist in developing a treatment program specifically for your child.


You can also read about treatments for voiding dysfunction here.

, Children, mostly girls, with dysfunctional voiding are prone to recurrent UTIs. In general, after age one, girls have UTIs more frequently than boys.The risk of a girl getting a UTI, in general, can be diminished by good hygiene in the genital area (keeping clean and dry, wiping front to back, and wearing cotton underwear all help), and drinking enough water to void a dilute urine 5 to 7 times a day. Common symptoms of UTIs include:


A burning sensation when urinating.
Unusual-smelling urine.
Fever.
Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

, When a UTI is suspected, an antibiotic with broad effectiveness against most of the usual bacteria is selected until the urine culture result is available (urine cultures will be discussed in the next step). The usually takes 24 to 48 hours.


Most uncomplicated UTIs in children are treated for about 7 days. For more serious infections, treatment should be for 10 to 14 days or more.
Common antibiotics include: Amoxicillin, Trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and Nitrofurantoin.

, Take your child to a doctor to have a culture taken to see if the child has bad bacteria, which can cause the infection, in his or her urinary tract. The culture may take a few days to a week to be processed.


If the culture is negative, any antibiotic treatment can be discontinued.
If the culture is positive, the choice of antibiotic may be changed to select the one with the most specific effectiveness. Your provider will receive this information with the urine culture result.

, Children with frequent UTIs, especially those with reflux, can receive long-term (months to years) treatment with “low dose” antibiotics; this is called antibiotic prophylaxis. The rationale is that daily small doses of antibiotics will “suppress” bacterial growth in the urine and prevent the UTI from developing.

, During observation or medical management, periodic kidney and bladder sonograms can document normal kidney growth and can make sure that no new kidney scars have formed. If the sonogram is not sufficient or inconclusive, a kidney scan test called a DMSA renal scan has a very high sensitivity for kidney scars."
"
Assess with your doctor whether additional tests are needed.,
Get an ultrasound test.,
Get a CT scan.,
Undergo a kidney biopsy in a hospital.",How to Test for Kidney Disease2," Your physician will inform you about whether the results of the basic lab tests were conclusive. He or she may recommend subsequent tests to confirm those results or to assess the level of kidney damage.

, A kidney ultrasound is a noninvasive exam that produces images, which are used to assess the size, shape, and location of the kidneys.You will need to make an appointment for an ultrasound, usually at a special clinic or medical center that does renal ultrasounds.
The technician will explain the procedure and you may need to sign a consent form authorizing the procedure.
Typically, no prior preparation, such as fasting or sedation, is required before an ultrasound.The technician will pass a transducer over your abdomen after applying some gel onto the area about to be imaged. A transducer is a prob-like device that produces sound waves that bounce off the tissues of the body and make echoes. The echoes are then sent to a computer and translated into images of your kidneys.

, This test, called a Computed Tomography (CT), uses contrast dye to picture the kidneys. It may also be used to look for abnormalities and obstructions in the kidneys.You will need to make need to make a special appointment for a CT scan, usually at a special clinic or medical center that does renal CTs.
The technician will explain the procedure to you and you will need to sign a consent form authorizing the procedure if it involves the use of contrast dye.
In preparation, you need to withhold food and drink before the test.During the test, you will lie on a scan table that slides into a large, circular opening of the scanning machine. As the scanner rotates around you, X-rays will pass through the body for short amounts of time.The X-rays absorbed by the body's tissues are detected by the scanner and sent to the computer. The computer then transforms the information into an image., You will have to schedule this procedure in advance and plan to stay in the hospital for at least 12 hours.Most kidney biopsies are percutaneous, meaning through the skin. In most cases, you will not be put to sleep with an anesthetic, but instead given medication to make you drowsy, while the area is numbed.
The doctor will cut the skin and inserts the needle to the surface of the kidney. He or she with then draw the sample. The area may feel sore or tender for a few days and you may see some blood in your urine. Consult your doctor if these symptoms last."
