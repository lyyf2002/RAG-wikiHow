Talk to your child’s doctor about surgical correction.,
Consider using endoscopy to treat your child.,
Consider open surgery as a treatment for high-grade reflux.,
Know that laparoscopic surgery is less frequently used in children.",How to Treat Urinary Reflux in Children2," The main goals of treatment are to preserve normal kidney growth, prevent progressive kidney scars, and avoid recurrences of serious kidney-related infections. When the effectiveness of medical management is compared to surgery in the general reflux child population, there are no great differences between the two in reaching these goals. However, in those whose medical therapy fails to prevent these reflux-related consequences, surgery is considered.


There are two basic methods to surgically correct reflux: minimally invasive endoscopic treatment and surgical repair.

, Bladder endoscopy is performed using a cystoscope (cystoscopy). The cystoscope is a thin, flexible, lighted telescope-like tube that enables the surgeon to look into the bladder and perform some tasks like tissue sampling and injections. The endoscopic procedure for reflux is often referred to as Deflux, which is the name of the material used to eliminate the reflux.The Deflux procedure is done through the cystoscope. Deflux is a viscous biodegradable gel. No actual surgical incision is required for this procedure. Using the cystoscope, the surgeon injects Deflux to create a bulge just below or within the urethra where it enters the bladder. The bulge reduces the size of the opening, allowing it to close during bladder contraction to eliminate reflux.
After the procedure, the urine may be light pink for a while and your child may have some discomfort when urinating for about a day. Acetaminophen can be used for the pain—follow the dose instructions on the package since this comes in many strengths.

, Open surgery for reflux is a treatment choice for high-grade reflux, particularly when the reflux is associated with more extensive abnormalities of the ureter or bladder.


Your child will be hospitalized following the procedure and pain management provided. This open surgery is much like any other procedure, but should be less painful. If everything goes well, your child should then be released from the hospital if she is eating, drinking, and urinating without problems.

, Laparoscopic surgery also has been used in this setting, but the frequency of unsatisfactory results or complications is higher than open surgery.

Consult with your doctor.,
Find a rheumatologist.,
Take NSAIDS to manage your symptoms.,
Consider disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.,
Ask about including steroids in your RA treatment.,
Keep taking your meds.",How to Treat Rheumatoid Arthritis1," Medications play a vital role in slowing the progression of RA symptoms, so it’s important that you work with a regular health care provider that you trust to create a drug therapy treatment plan. With their knowledge of your personal history and specific case, they will be able to determine the best prescriptions for you.Honest communication is imperative. You should be comfortable telling them what’s going on, especially when it comes to your medication and how it’s affecting you.
If you are in the market for a regular health care provider, it’s best to find one who has experience with RA.;
, These specialists can either be seen exclusively, or you can ask if they will work in conjunction with your regular health care provider. They should have no problem sharing your case. If they do, you might want to shop around. Universities, teaching hospitals, and doctor rating websites are good sources for locating possible specialists in your area.


Look for a rheumatologist who encourages their patients to learn all they can about RA.A good RA specialist is someone who views you as a partner in creating your personal treatment plan.

, Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB) and naproxen (Aleve) are commonly used in RA to help manage pain, swelling, and inflammation. They can be obtained over-the-counter or in higher doses as a prescription.


The weaker, over-the-counter versions have few side effects and low risk compared to higher dose prescriptions, but they can only help manage the symptoms, not slow the disease.Higher dose symptoms can include upset stomach, increased blood pressure, anemia, and increased risk of heart attack and stroke., DMARDs such as Trexall, Arava or Plaquenil can alter or slow RA's progression and are meant for long-term use. They are not without possible side effects, but this is different for every person.They can be taken with other types of pain relievers.
Liver damage and increased risk of infection are the most serious possible side effects.
DMARDS are the cornerstone of treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. These medications include the following: methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, and other agents with a more limited role.

, Your doctor will help you decide if they are right for your treatment plan. These drugs slow joint damage while reducing pain and inflammation. However, they are powerful and possibly dangerous, making them more useful against acute flare-ups.Glucocorticoids are useful and are effective in suppressing the symptoms of RA. They have also been implicated in the impact on disease progression. However, due to toxicities they are not ideal for long term management.
They can be taken as pills, liquids, or shots.
They can cause a myriad of side effects such as high blood pressure, diabetes, elevation in liver enzymes, sores in your mouth, nausea, vomiting, loose stools, CNS findings, alopecia, fever, hematological abnormalities, and weak bones., If you want to have the best chance of managing your RA symptoms and slowing or altering its progress, it is vital to adhere to the drug-therapy put in place with the help of your doctor. The success or failure of this therapy is directly reliant upon adherence.30 to 80 percent of RA patients only take their medication half of the prescribed time, adversely affecting their treatment."

Participate in physical therapy.,
Seek the help of an occupational therapist.,
Experiment with mind-body therapies.",How to Treat Rheumatoid Arthritis2," The overall goal of physical therapy is to keep you moving and to build strength, flexibility, and overall physical fitness in order to relieve symptoms and promote health.A good therapist will create an exercise program specifically geared to your needs and ability.
With their knowledge of how bones, joints, and muscles work together, your therapist can help guide you and prevent any unnecessary injuries.

, Occupational therapy is focused on assisting you in completing basic daily tasks. This therapy works well to improve your quality of life, which goes a long way to improving not only physical health but emotional and mental health as well.A therapist can show you how to perform tasks without stressing your joints.
They can introduce assistive devices to make certain tasks easier for you.
They may create a home exercise program to increase your range of motion.

, In general, mind-body therapies are practices that allow your mind to help your body overcome discomfort, illness, and injury. The pain of RA and the side effects of medication can cause stress and depression, which can trigger RA symptoms. Mind-body therapies can reduce stress and lift depression, making them a great addition to an RA treatment plan..Examples include tai chi, yoga, meditation, hypnosis, biofeedback, and various relaxation techniques."

Apply heat and cold.,
Exercise.,
Eat an RA supportive diet.",How to Treat Rheumatoid Arthritis3," Even if you have no physical therapist, it is easy to use self-care to reduce pain and swelling caused by RA with the application of heat and cold therapies. Heat is great for stiff joints while cold numbs pain and reduces inflammation.Use heat on your joints for approximately 15 minutes by applying a hot pack, taking a bath, or taking a shower. Heat relaxes muscles and eases your pain.
Use cold treatments such as massaging joints with ice, applying cold packs, or soaking joints in cold water to dull pain.
You can alternate between heat and cold applications. For instance, you can use warm water for 3-to-4 minutes, and then use cool water for 1 minute.

, As painful as it might sound, exercise geared to the needs and capabilities of the individual is a cornerstone of RA treatment. Even without the help and knowledge of a physical therapist, low-impact aerobics and exercises that build strength and flexibility can be extremely beneficial.Gentle activities such as walking and swimming work very well.
A physical therapist can be of great assistance in creating an exercise program tailor-made for you., Although the scientific evidence is inconsistent at this time, there are many studies and testimonials that suggest eating certain foods and avoiding others may help with RA symptoms.In general, a balanced diet (which according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration should be centered on plant-based foods) seems the best over-all way to go, but you can also try adding or removing foods thought to either promote or fight inflammation.Foods to add: cold water fish; fiber from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains; extra-virgin olive oil.
Foods to avoid: meats grilled or fried at high temperature, and omega-6 fatty acids found in processed snacks and most cooking oils.

Hydrate wisely.,
Maintain a healthy diet.,
Limit or eliminate alcohol and smoking.,
Exercise regularly.,
Follow instructions on over-the-counter pain medication.,
Control underlying conditions.,
See your doctor.,
Discuss treatment options with your doctor.,
Treat complications with medication.,
Consider end-stage treatments.",How to Support Kidney Function," Because the kidneys help flush out waste products and drugs, some people might think that over hydrating can benefit their kidney function. But there are no studies that support this and instead recommend drinking four to six glasses a day. This amount should be sufficient to support your kidneys’ function.Stick to water, which is the best option to keep you hydrated without added sugar, caffeine, or other substances to your diet.
Drink more if you are active, especially in the summer. Add 8 ounces of water for every hour you’re active.;
, The kidneys can generally tolerate a lot of different foods, but most kidney problems are related to other medical conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure that can be controlled by food.Eating a healthy and nutrient rich diet can help support your kidney functions and may also have the benefit of managing other conditions.


Choose a balance of healthy foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, dairy products, lean meats, and beans.Avoid too much sodium. Don’t add salt when cooking or buy high-sodium processed foods.Eliminate fast food and limit salty snacks except for very rare occasions.
Select foods with lower levels of potassium such as apples, carrots, cabbage, green beans, grapes, and blueberries.Limit or avoid high potassium foods like bananas, oranges, potatoes, spinach and tomatoes.Limit protein sources. Choose lean meats such as chicken or fish and trim off any fat you see. Bake, grill, or broil your meats instead of frying them.You can also get protein from sources like vegetables, fruits, whole-grain breads, and non-sugary cereals., If you drink alcoholic beverages and/or smoke, either quit or limit your intake.Both can increase your risk for high blood pressure and kidney disease, or a worsening of the disease if you already have it.Men should have no more than two drinks per day and women no more than one.Speak to your doctor about starting a program to quit smoking if you are having difficulties either going cold turkey or gradually weaning yourself off of tobacco., Getting exercise can promote your overall health, but can also help counteract the dangers of kidney disease.Getting some moderate activity most days of the week can support your kidney function and ward off weight that may cause kidney problems or other health concerns.Speak to your doctor before starting any exercise regimen.
Aim to get at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise five days a week. You can do a variety of activities such as walking, running, jogging, swimming, biking, or even dancing.Regular exercise and a healthy diet can help you maintain a healthy weight, which lowers your risk for kidney disease., If you are suffering from pain from your kidneys or any other area and want to use over-the-counter pain relievers, make sure to follow the packaging instructions. Taking too much pain medication can cause kidney disease or make existing kidney problems worse.Consider avoiding NSAID pain relievers if you already suffer from kidney problems. These include ibuprofen and naproxen sodium.Ask your doctor if these medications are safe for you to take.

, Certain conditions, including high blood pressure and diabetes, can cause or increase your risk for kidney disease. By managing any underlying causes, you may be able to support your kidney function.Monitor your blood pressure regularly at home or a doctor’s office. You target blood pressure should be less than 140/90 mm Hg.Check and control your blood sugar if you have diabetes.Watch your cholesterol levels to make sure they’re within a healthy range.Your doctor can order blood tests to check your levels.Remember to take any medication for underlying conditions your doctor prescribes., If managing lifestyle and underlying conditions doesn’t improve how you feel, if you’re feeling worse, or if you suspect that you may have kidney disease, schedule an appointment with your doctor. She can run tests and come up with a treatment plan specifically for you.Tell your doctor any signs and symptoms you may have and describe how you feel.Let her know about any medications, supplements, or other substances that you’re taking.Take a list of questions you may have.Answer any questions your doctor has about your condition.

, Once your doctor has diagnosed what is causing problems with your kidneys, discuss your treatment options with him. Depending on the severity of your case or underlying causes, he may suggest continuing to support your kidney function with lifestyle, taking medication, or even undergoing dialysis., Certain medications may help treat complications that arise from kidney disease. Take these to see if they help support your kidney function. Your doctor may prescribe medications that:


Lower high blood pressure, such as an ACE inhibitor.
Decrease water retention and swelling
Lower cholesterol, such as statins
Treat anemia, such as the supplement erythropoietin
Protect bones, such as calcium and Vitamin D supplements.Your doctor may also suggest a lower protein diet to reduce waste products in your blood., You may get to a point where your kidneys can’t keep up with ridding your body of waste and fluid. If this is the case, you may have end-stage kidney disease, which will more extensive care.Speak to your doctor about what you need to avoid complete kidney failure. She may suggest:


Dialysis, which can filter and remove waste from your blood or body fluids.Kidney transplant, which requires surgery to implant a donor kidney into your body. You’ll have to take medication for the rest of your life to prevent your body rejecting the donor kidney."

Try to quit smoking if you have Graves' disease.",How to Treat Hyperthyroidism," Because the hormone affects your heart rate, you can have a faster heartbeat, an irregular heartbeat, or a pounding heartbeat due to hyperthyroidism. You'll usually feel an irregular or pounding heartbeat, but you can check to see if your pulse is 100 bpm or more.To check your heart rate, find your pulse. Use a stopwatch to time 15 seconds while counting beats. Multiply that number by four to get your beats per minute. So if you have 25 beats or more in 15 seconds, you should talk to your doctor.;
, That is, you may be more prone to sweating or notice the heat more. You might also have hot flashes., You may also notice a tremor in your hand, which is related to the hormone., If you're having issues with breathing, you could have a hyperthyroid problem. Pay particular attention to your breathing when you're sitting to see if you have trouble with it then., With too much of the hyperthyroid hormone in your body, your weight can fluctuate. Most people lose weight.Oddly, the disease can also cause an increase in appetite., Hyperthyroidism can make you irritable. In fact, you may find your moods swing from one extreme to another. Additionally, it can affect your concentration., You may find you are having to go to the bathroom more often, and your menstrual cycles could change, either becoming heavier, lighter, or irregular.However, your periods are most likely to become lighter, or you may not have them at all., If you find yourself exhausted or notice that you seem weaker than usual, it can also be a symptom of hyperthyroidism., With hyperthyroidism, your thyroid can become enlarged. Check for swelling near the bottom of your neck in the front., You may notice thinning hair, brittle hair, dry skin, bulging eyes, or thinning skin.,, If you have several of the symptoms above, check with your doctor. Ask to be tested for hyperthyroidism., That is, many of these symptoms can point to other diseases, so your doctor may not immediately lean towards hyperthyroidism., The main way to check for hyperthyroidism is to have blood drawn. Your blood will then be tested for its TSH level. TSH, or the thyroid stimulating hormone, is produced by pituitary gland. If you have too much of the thyroid hormone, the level of TSH will be pushed down because the thyroid is already stimulated too much. Therefore, if your level of TSH is low, you likely have hyperthyroidism.Your doctor may decide to run additional tests, such as checking the levels of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4, or looking for antithyroid antibodies.

, Hyperthyroidism is caused by other problems, often by either Graves' disease or overproducing nodules. Your doctor can screen for these problems.To screen for the cause, your doctor may use radioactive iodine. Your thyroid uses iodine when creating hormones, and your doctor can check to see how much iodine it has absorbed. If it absorbs too much, it means your thyroid is likely making too much of the thyroid hormone thyroxine.Another way to screen for the cause is through a thyroid scan. You are injected with a radioactive substance, which allows the doctor to create an image of your thyroid.Your doctor may also examine your thyroid with a thyroid ultrasound. This procedure uses sound waves to create an image of your thyroid and does not use ionizing radiation.

, The purpose of antithyroid medication is to change the rate that the thyroid creates hormones by slowing it down. The main medication used today is methimazole.This treatment takes anywhere from 1 1/2 months to 3 months to work.One problem with this treatment is it doesn't always work permanently.Another issue is the drugs in this category can cause liver damage. Propylthiouracil is more likely to cause liver damage than methimazole, which is why it is used less often., The point of the iodine is to shrink your thyroid glands to slow down production. It may take up to half a year to work effectively.One problem with this treatment is it can slow down production too much, so you may end up needing to take a replacement hormone., A more extreme option is to have your thyroid removed completely using surgery, so that it can't produce more of the hormone thyroxine. However, you will, of course, need to take a hormone replacement with this option, as your body needs that hormone to survive., You may also need to take drugs to treat the symptoms. For instance, beta blockers, normally used to treat high blood pressure, can treat heart palpitations.Beta blockers can also help with symptoms such as nervousness and sweating., You may need to increase your calorie intake if your weight loss has negatively affected your health or if you have lost muscle mass. Protein can help both with increasing your weight and building muscle., For instance, try meditation or yoga to help lower your stress level.For a simple meditation technique, try closing your eyes. Breathe in slowly for four counts, and then breathe out slowly for four counts. Repeat until you feel yourself calming down.

, To help protect yourself against conditions such as osteoporosis, you can take a vitamin D supplement to help your bones absorb calcium.If you're an adult male under age 71, you should be taking 1,000 milligrams a day. Women should take 1,000 milligrams per day, as well, until you reach age 51, when you should be taking 1,200 milligrams per day., Caffeine can make certain side effects of the disease worse, such as the fast heart rate and anxiety. Be sure you pay attention to hidden caffeine. For instance, you may not realize that chocolate contains some caffeine., Smoking can put you at risk for developing Graves' ophthalmopathy."

Common corticosteroids that are prescribed by an MS specialist for for MS include prednisone (usually taken orally) and methylprednisolone (usually administered intravenously). Though often effective, corticosteroids carry numerous unpleasant side effects, including insomnia, elevated blood pressure, mood swings/irritability, and fluid retention in the body., Plasma exchange, also known as plasmapheresis, helps many MS patients during a period of MS attacks. During plasmapheresis, plasma is drawn and the blood cells mixed with albumin (a protein solution) before being returned to the body.Plasma exchange is primarily used in patients with new symptoms, severe symptoms, or symptoms that have not responded to other treatment methods like steroids.Plasma exchange may be performed when you are under the care of an MS specialist.

, Many people experiencing an MS attack/flare up suffer from symptoms like blurred vision or exceptionally spastic muscles.One way to help reduce the issues related to muscle control and regain control of your limbs is through physical therapy, though some experts recommend using physical therapy exercises in conjunction with a course of corticosteroids for maximum effectiveness., Many people suffering from MS experience painful muscle stiffness and/or muscle spasms. This may target any part of the body but seems to be most prevalent in the legs. Taking muscle relaxants can help reduce spasms and ease the pain associated with muscle stiffness.Commonly-prescribed muscle relaxants for MS patients include baclofen (Lioresal) and tizanidine (Zanaflex)., A common symptom of MS as the disease weakens the nerves and muscles is the loss of bladder and bowel control.How you manage these symptoms will vary, depending on the severity and advancement of your MS. To help manage bladder and bowel problems, your doctor may advise you to:


Stay on schedule - a daily schedule can be extremely helpful for bowel problems.But it can also be helpful for managing urinary problems. By staying on a regular schedule and ""training"" your bladder to prolong the need to urinate until the next scheduled bathroom break, you may be able to increase your ability to control your excretory needs.Do Kegel exercises - Kegel exercises strengthen the muscles in your pelvis, which can help improve bladder control.To start out doing Kegel exercises, you'll need to squeeze/tense the muscles you use to control the flow of urine. Hold the squeeze for three seconds, then release. Repeat the process 10 to 15 times per session, and try to practice at least three times each day. As you strengthen your muscles, add one additional second each week until you're able to tense the muscles for 10 seconds at a time.Take medication for your bladder - there are a number of medications that can help control the muscles which may be contributing to your bladder problems. Common medications for bladder problems include Darifenacin (Enablex), Fesoterodine (Toviaz), Imipramine (Tofranil), and Oxybutynin (Ditropan).Eat more fiber - Adding fiber to your diet, in conjunction with drinking more fluids, may help manage some bowel problems. Try eating whole grain breads, cereals, and fresh fruits and vegetables, or ask your doctor about taking a fiber supplement.Use stool softeners - if you experience frequent constipation, talk to your doctor about taking a stool softener to help facilitate bowel movements.Talk to your doctor about any over-the-counter medications you're considering, especially if you experience diarrhea., Though the symptoms of MS may limit your ability to engage in physical activity, some patients find that physical activity can help improve physical and mental wellbeing. Common activities include exercise, yoga, and meditation., You may find some relief of your muscle spasms and pain by trying cannabis, if you live in a place that permits its medical use.The American Academy of Neurology recognizes that medical cannabis, when smoked or taken orally (extracts as well as synthetic cannabinoids), can help patients suffering from a number of MS symptoms.However, marijuana is not for everyone. Talk to your doctor about the potential benefits and risks of using marijuana.


In the United States, 23 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws that allow patients with qualifying conditions to legally purchase or grow, possess, and use medical marijuana.The use of medical marijuana is also permitted in Canada.Find out if your state, province, or country permits the use of medical marijuana by searching for medical cannabis laws in your region. If you live in a place that permits the medical use of marijuana and you believe that it may help with your MS symptoms, talk to your doctor about the benefits and side effects of medical marijuana.

, Beta interferons are frequently prescribed and monitored by an MS specialist to manage relapsing forms of MS. These medications are injected intravenously and have been proven to reduce both the frequency and the severity of MS relapses. Liver damage is a possible side effect of using beta interferons, so it's important to have regular blood tests performed by your doctor to monitor your liver enzymes for damage.Common beta interferons include interferon beta-1a (such as Avonex and Rebif) and interferon beta-1b (like Betaseron and Extavia).

, This medication must be prescribed and monitored by an MS specialist. It is administered intravenously and it can help control the body's immune system attack on the body's myelin nerve sheaths. This protein may help reduce the number of relapses a patient experiences, and may delay or even prevent permanent disability.Copaxone is a commonly-prescribed glatiramer acetate medication., Dimethyl fumarate is an oral medication prescribed and monitored by an MS specialist that can help reduce MS relapses. It is typically taken twice a day. Side effects may include diarrhea, flushing, nausea, and a lowered white blood cell count.Tecfidera is a commonly-prescribed dimethyl fumarate., This medication that is also prescribed and monitored by an MS specialist can help reduce the frequency of relapses by preventing your immune system from attacking the nerves in your brain and/or spinal cord. Taking fingolimod may also delay or even prevent permanent disability.Fingolimod is typically taken orally, once each day.Taking fingolimod may slow your heart rate and cause high blood pressure or blurred vision. Your doctor will monitor your heart rate for at least six hours after administering your first dose of fingolimod., Teriflunomide is prescribed and monitored by an MS specialist. This medication is taken orally, once each day, to prevent or reduce MS relapses. Teriflunomide can have numerous side effects of varying degrees of severity, including liver damage and hair loss. Teriflunomide should not be taken by women who are pregnant or who may become pregnant, or by the male partner of a woman who may become pregnant, as it can cause severe damage to a developing fetus., Natalizumab may help prevent immune cells from traveling to the brain and spinal cord, thereby reducing the chances of nerve damage at these sites. It is often effective at treating relapsing forms of MS, though it may also increase the risk of experiencing a viral infection in the brain.Talk to your doctor about the benefits and potential risks of natalizumab.


A prescription and monitoring by an MS specialist is required.

, Alemtuzumab works by targeting a protein that is located on the surface of immune cells in your body. It also depletes your body's white blood cell count, which may reduce the chances of nerve damage, but it also carries risks. Some patients have an increased risk of infections and autoimmune complications due to the reduced white blood cell count.Alemtuzumab is prescribed and monitored by an MS specialist, administered over five consecutive days, then followed up with another three days of drug infusions one year after the initial treatment., Mitoxantrone is an immunosuppressant that may help treat severe and advanced-stage MS. However, its use is typically limited due to the risk of heart damage and blood cancer.Talk to your doctor about the benefits and potential risks of using mitoxantrone.


This drug also requires a prescription and monitoring by an MS specialist.

Heal viral septic arthritis without medication.,
Take an antibiotic.,
Undergo fluid withdrawal.,
Consider physical therapy once healing begins.,
Take an anti-inflammatory pain reliever.,
Rest the joint.,
Raise the joint.,
Protect the joint.,
Apply a cool compress.,
Exercise once healing begins.",How to Treat Septic Arthritis," Your doctor may diagnose the cause of your septic arthritis as a virus. Most cases of viral septic arthritis won’t require any antibiotics. Instead, your doctor may allow the infection to heal on its own and/ or ease pain and swelling with drainage.Recognize that you may need surgery to treat tissue damage even if the infection heals on its own.
Viral etiologies of septic arthritis are rare, while bacterial infection is quite common.;
, If bacteria are the cause of your septic arthritis, your doctor will likely prescribe an antibiotic. Risk factors include diabetes, increasing age, rheumatoid arthritis, joint replacement, recent surgery, skin infection, alcoholism, IV drug use, and articular corticosteroid injection. You may need oral antibiotics or an intravenous injection. Antibiotics generally stop the infection within a few days or weeks.Be aware that if you have a severe case of septic arthritis, you may require a long course of antibiotic treatment.
Ask your doctor about any side effects your prescribed antibiotic may have. Side effects include: nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting.Diarrhea could be a sign of C. Difficile Colitis (C. Diff.), an infection of the colon caused by antibiotic use.
Take the entire course of your prescribed antibiotic, even if you are feeling better. This can minimize the risk of the infection getting worse or coming back., Another common medical treatment for septic arthritis is removing infected fluid from the joint. This is also called synovial fluid drainage. Withdrawal not only drains infected fluid, but can also ease pain and swelling and prevent further damage to your joint.Your doctor may remove fluid by:Needle aspiration, or arthrocentesis, is a bedside procedure in which your doctor drains/taps the infected fluid by inserting a needle into the joint space.
Arthroscopy, in which your doctor inserts a flexible tube with a video camera into your joint through a small incision. The doctor then inserts suction and drainage tubes to remove the fluid. Your doctor may leave the tubes in your joint for a few days to get rid of all of the fluid.Open surgery, which a doctor usually performs for severe infections or those in large joints such as the hip.Surgery can wash out the infected joint and may also remove any damaged sections.This treatment is common in patients with infection from an artificial joint replacement.

, Your doctor may suggest physical therapy once your septic arthritis begins to heal. Physical therapy is often used to treat severe septic arthritis with joint damage.It can help you regain mobility, improve your range of motion, and build muscle to prevent further damage to your joint.Talk to your doctor about physical therapy to ease your septic arthritis. Your doctor can let you know if it’s a appropriate for your case and may suggest a specific therapist for you., Septic arthritis is often painful. It may also cause swelling or inflammation at your joint even after having fluid withdrawn. Taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDS, can ease your pain and any inflammation.You can use an over the counter NSAID or have your doctor prescribe one for more serious pain.Select an NSAID such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve), and celecoxib (Celebrex).
Follow the dosing instructions your doctor provides. If your doctor doesn’t suggest guidelines for taking the medication, follow the instructions on the product label.

, Your doctor will likely prescribe rest to treat your septic arthritis. This includes not moving the joint or surrounding area as much as possible. In some cases, your doctor may splint your arm to provide it more rest.Rest is the first part of a commonly used treatment that is known as RICE. RICE stands for:


R= REST
I= ICE
C= Compression
E= Elevation

, Your joint may continue to swell even after fluid withdrawal. If this happens, raise the joint above your heart.This can aid drainage of the fluid and reduce swelling. It may also ease pain.Use a wedge, pillows or other props to raise the affected joint above your heart.

, In addition to resting and raising your joint, it’s also important to protect it from further injury or damage. This includes taking all of your prescribed medications. You should also do avoid knocking or bumping the joint against anything as this may cause further pain, swelling, or injury.Leave on splinting until your doctor instructs you to remove it. Splints can protect the joint and remind you to not hit it on anything., Pain and swelling are typical symptoms of septic arthritis and may linger even as you begin to heal. Putting a cool or cold compress on the affected joint can reduce swelling and relieve any pain or discomfort you have.Use ice or a cool washcloth as a compress.
Apply your cool compress for 20 minutes at a time as often as you need it.Wrap an ice pack or bag of frozen peas or corn in cloth to protect your skin from getting numb. If this happens, remove the pack., If you are taking an antibiotic and/or underwent fluid drainage as well as rested your joint, you may start to feel better within a few days.As you feel better, try gentle and low-impact exercise. This can help speed your recovery.Ask your doctor if you are healthy enough to exercise, even if it is light. Your doctor may suggest physical therapy instead of exercise in some cases.
Choose a low impact type of exercise such as walking or swimming. Things such as bicycling may be too much, especially if your septic arthritis is in the knee or hip.
Always follow the instructions of your doctor and physical therapist and do not push yourself too hard without asking and getting their approval first. Know your limits!

Educate your teen.,
Tell them if you have had this issue in the past.,
Listen.,
Remind them that they’re not to blame.,
Find a way to talk to a resistant teen.,
Brainstorm with your teen.,
Try using an enema or something to relieve constipation.,
Cut down on the drinks at night.,
Consider a bed alarm.,
Establish a regular bedtime.,
Consider special underwear and mattress covers.,
Assure that they are helping during the cleanup.,
Recognize that puberty does not “cure” bedwetting.,
Identify a doctor.,
Be honest with the doctor.,
Consider medication.,
Consider surgery, if necessary.,
Consider therapy if the issue is not medical.,
Reassure your teen that it’s okay.",How to Talk to a Teen About Bedwetting," Your teen may be feeling like they are the only one who deals with this issue, as this is not something other teens are likely to share. However, you should reassure them that bedwetting is common to many teens, 1 – 3%, which actually translates to millions of people across the world. The term “enuresis” is defined as the inability to control one’s bladder. It can be caused by anything from genetics to hormone issues to very deep sleep.Present the information that you have learned about the potential causes behind your teen’s bedwetting and tell them what you have learned.
Continue to assure them that they are not alone.
Consider printing off articles for them to read themselves.;
, One other point that can be a great source of comfort to your teen is knowing if you have also undergone the issue. In many cases, bedwetting is genetic. Telling your teen that you also wet the bed at their age can help them feel less to blame for the issue and more likely to be responsive to talking and finding solutions., Your teen has likely not shared information about their bedwetting with a single other person and would probably hide it from you as well, if they could. Take some time to ask your teen if they want to talk about it or lend them a shoulder cry on.


Listen without being judgmental.
Allow them to vent for a while without giving any advice. Just let them let it all out.

, Though they may understand that this issue is both medical and genetic, your teen will still likely feel a tremendous amount of guilt and embarrassment if the issue continues. When an incident occurs, reassure them that it’s okay, that you love them, and that everything will be fine.Remind them that you will be with them every step of the way.
Though it can be difficult to deal with, do not judge your teen for this, but instead show them empathy and compassion. Do not get angry, and try not to show any exasperation.
Remember that no one wants to wet the bed. Work on finding solutions.
Remain calm when they have accidents. Don’t yell, scream or punish them for this.

, Your teen may in fact be too embarrassed or upset about bedwetting to even discuss the issue. In this instance, you must get a bit creative so that you can work towards creating solutions. Consider writing your teen a letter about the research you have done, share with them if you have had this issue, and propose remedies.


Don't force solutions on your teen at this point, such as buying them a bed alarm. It's important to get the conversation going and start to break down barriers so you can talk about solutions together.

, Before you start trying the different remedies for teen bedwetting, take some time to sit down and talk to your teen about what they would like to try. Present different options to them so they feel educated, and ask which one they'd like to try first.

, Though many consider bedwetting to be an issue solely of the bladder, recognize that other organs can play a factor, as well. Sometimes, a teen who is suffering from constipation can wet the bed. Suggest to your teen that they use an enema or other substance that relieves constipation.Don’t force them but do remind them that this has worked for others in the past.

, One very simple solution is to have your teen cut down on the amount of beverages they are drinking before bed. Your teen could simply be drinking too much before bedtime and their bladder reacts in their sleep.Consider having your teen not drink anything at least one hour before bed.
Also, make sure that your teen urinates before bed every night.

, One way other teens have overcome bedwetting is by utilizing a bed alarm. A bed alarm is slept on and goes off should it detect any moisture. This helps assure that your teen is not sleeping in urine throughout the night and can prevent them from fully emptying their entire bladder on the mattress. In many teens, this has been effective in completely ending their bedwetting., Sometimes, teens wet the bed because they have an irregular sleep pattern and their body is not sure when the bladder should be active or not. Work with your teen to determine a bedtime that works well with their school schedule and see if this helps to end or lessen the bedwetting.Consider following this routine on the weekends as well to keep up the regularity.

, Many companies make sheets or mattress covers and underwear specifically for bedwetters. Consider purchasing these special sheets or a bed protector for your teen to alleviate damage to your mattress. Rubber sheets or mattress pads can be particularly useful. Special underwear like Icon Undies can be helpful for the teen who wets the bed but wants to still sleepover at a friend’s house. These underwear prevent leakage.The National Association For Continence (NAFC) also sells a dry night solution kit comprised of overnight underwear, washcloths, and underpads amongst other items.

, If you are the parent or a caretaker of the teen, you may feel responsible in assuring that the mess after the bedwetting gets cleaned up. Though the bedwetting is not your teen’s fault, they certainly do have a responsibility in cleaning up the mess. Require that they wash the sheets and clean the mattress themselves after each time and assist them when necessary or should they ask for help.


You may need to show them the first few times, as they may be unfamiliar with washing clothes or with mattress cleaning.
Make sure they are keeping good hygiene practices, too. They should shower after having an incident.

, Your may find that certain doctors or websites will tell you that bedwetting is something your teen will grow out of. And while this may be true for some, you should still treat the issue like you would any other medical concern. Hoping for the day when this will end will not in fact make it end, but employing certain tactics in conjunction with seeking medical assistance can help assure that your child sleeps dry more and more often., Take some time to look online for doctors and see if any specialize in this area. You will likely want to seek out the help of pediatricians or perhaps a urologist. If you cannot find information online, call around to different offices to see if doctors have any experience in this area. Seeing a doctor is an important part of treatment, as the doctor can identify if the bedwetting is caused by a larger health issue.


Consider scheduling an appointment after school hours so that your teen doesn’t miss any school.

, Your teen may be too embarrassed to talk to the doctor about their issue, but you should encourage them to do so and to do so honestly. If, however, they are unwilling to do so, you will need to step in and tell the doctor about the problem. They will likely need to know your teen’s diet, the frequency of the bedwetting, and if there are any triggers.

, There are many medicines out there to help those who suffer from bedwetting, and many of these medications are highly helpful in addressing and correcting the issue. Allow your teen to consider this option and make that choice for themselves. Research the medication to see what potential side effects exist.Some of the medications that exist are desmopressin, which makes the kidney produce less urine, or darifenacin, which relieves bladder spasms.

, The doctor may likely suggest surgery to your teen. If you have tried several at home remedies and none of those have been effective at ending or reducing the bedwetting, you may want to talk to your teen about considering this option. There are three forms of surgery typically prescribed.Sacral nerve stimulation is a surgical process in which sacral nerve roots are stimulated by neural modulation and can be helpful for those whose bedwetting was not alleviated by at home remedies.
Another surgery is clam cystoplasty, in which the bladder is cut and a piece of intestine is inserted to make the bladder more stable and to make more room for urine.
The final form is detrusor myectomy, which involves removing a portion of the bladder muscle to strengthen bladder contractions.
Give your teen some time to think about these options. Do some research at home. Call your doctor if you have more questions and then make a final decision.

, You may find that no amount of home remedies or medical attention will help your teen. In this instance, you should begin exploring roots of the problem that are non medical. Consider taking your child to see a therapist to work through these issues.


For instance, your teen may be having a difficult time at school or may even be getting bullied.
In some instances, teens who are bedwetting may have been a victim of sexual abuse.
Your teen may be having a bad, recurring dream that is causing them to wet the bed.

, All of this information may feel overwhelming to your teen. Talks of surgery, medication and therapy can feel very scary and off-putting. Remind your teen that everything is going to be okay and that you’ll be there to help them every step of the way. If they should have more bedwetting experiences, that is okay, too. Remind them that you love them regardless and will help them through this.

",How to Use a GoodNites Bed Mat2,", Some signals include the paper and/or paints themselves (if they have been prepositioned beforehand).

,, Make sure the top two tabs are in approximately the same place, as to take up the area covered by the paints and a portion of the paper.


Don't worry, if the area underneath the table doesn't have an area that is suitable to the product sticking to it (for the bottom two tabs). If the product hangs down, just be careful. It's sometimes useful if the product hangs (as to give you more surface area to work with for spills, as if the paint drips, it first has to run more onto the mat before it runs onto the clothing underneath).






Think about positioning the mat in landscape position, so that the tabbed areas are to the left and right of the drawing area, if the child has a small perspective of their working area (school-age children may enjoy this convenience).

Avoid or limit your intake of dairy products.,
Eat low-fat foods.,
Follow a moderate-fiber diet.,
Eliminate gas-forming foods from your diet.,
Eat several small meals rather than a few large meals each day.,
Always stay hydrated.",How to Treat Crohn’s Disease Naturally with Home Remedies1," As sufferers of Crohn's disease are prone to inflammation of the intestines and diarrhea, it is better to limit your consumption of dairy products - especially if you are lactose intolerant.


This is due to the fact that lactose found in dairy products is not easily digested by the intestines causing stomach pain, inflammation and diarrhea.
Examples of dairy products include: butter, milk, yogurt, and cheese.;
, It is not advisable to eat foods that are rich in fat. This is due to the fact that most foods that contain fat are harder to digest.


Fat will just pass through the intestines without being digested, thereby worsening inflammation and diarrhea. That is why you need to cut down foods that are high in fat and stick to a low-fat diet.
Examples of low-fat foods include: low-fat yogurt, cereals, oats, lean meat, tuna, lean beef, chicken meat without skin, white fish, cottage cheese, egg whites, dried beans, lentils, and boiled potatoes.

, In most people, following a high-fiber diet is good for overall health, however eating a lot of fiber-rich food is not advisable for people with Crohn's disease. This is due to the fact that high fiber foods can induce bloating, making diarrhea worse. Try to eat small meals and include a small amount of soluble fiber with every meal, such a serving of vegetables or fruit with a lean protein source and a small amount of brown rice.


Some sufferers will tolerate some high-fiber foods better than others, so it's a good idea to observe which foods are causing your symptoms and to adjust your diet accordingly.
Avoid foods that are labeled ""high-fiber.""

, Since bloating is a symptom of Crohn’s disease, it is better to avoid foods which increase your body's production of gas as these types of food can aggravate your bloating.


Excess gas can irritate the inflamed intestine causing more abdominal pain and bloating. Examples of gas-forming foods to be avoided are: cabbage, broccoli, beans, alcoholic drinks, and soda.

, Small meals are more easily digested than larger ones. Therefore, eating smaller meals can reduce the chances of acid rebound.


The stomach usually produces large amounts of gastric acid when large amounts of food are eaten. This will then result in increased gastric irritation within one to three hours of eating due to the remaining gastric acid in the stomach.

, It is important to avoid dehydration, especially when experiencing diarrhea. Severe dehydration is dangerous, so replacing lost fluids and electrolytes is very important.


Drinking water is essential for your overall health and bodily functions. It is recommended that you drink water in between meals to avoid dehydration.
Drinking 8 to 12 glasses per day is recommended.

Protect yourself from other infections.,
Get plenty of rest.,
Exercise regularly.,
Do not smoke.,
Eat a nutritious diet.,
Build a support network.",How to Treat Lupus1," Aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as naproxen sodium and ibuprofen can help reduce the pain and inflammation from mild lupus symptoms.As an added benefit, these drugs can also alleviate other symptoms of lupus, such as fever and arthritic pains.


Though these drugs are a cheap and convenient temporary solution to lupus flareups, they shouldn't be used as a permanent “fix.” Long-term and/or high-dosage NSAID use can cause stomach and kidney damage.Consult your doctor before starting even this relatively mild treatment option, as some NSAIDs (especially ibuprofen) have been linked to life-threatening infections like meningitis in people with lupus.;
, The sun’s UV rays can trigger lupus flareups.Lupus can also cause increased light sensitivity. Avoid excessive exposure to sunlight and always cover up or apply a high-SPF sunscreen when you can’t avoid sun exposure.

, Since lupus affects your immune system, you should shield yourself against infections.Keep up with annual flu and pneumonia vaccinations, and take other precautions such as not sharing glasses/utensils and washing your hands often with warm, soapy water.

, Fatigue is a common symptom of lupus, making an adequate amount of sleep essential for optimum health. Get a full eight hours of sleep each night.If you suffer from insomnia, try to create ideal sleeping conditions by sleeping in a cool, dark, quiet environment. You should also try to engage in a relaxing activity before bed that doesn’t involve a TV or computer screen.


Adequate sleep can also help bolster your immune system against other opportunistic infections.
You may also need to take short breaks or naps during the day when feasible.Listen to your body and don’t get frustrated with your need to rest.

, Physical exercise helps to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (which is a serious concern for lupus patients), and it also combats depression. Additionally, exercise has proven effective at helping those with lupus recover from a flareup.The American Heart Association suggests thirty minutes of moderate cardio five days a week, but don’t push yourself too hard. This can be anything that gets your heart rate up—from brisk walking to playing sports., Smoking puts you at a higher risk of stroke, heart attack, and other cardiovascular conditions, the risk of which is already elevated for lupus patients.Smoking can also complicate the effects of lupus on your heart, lungs, and blood vessels., A healthy diet will boost your immune system, as well as helping to limit kidney and gastrointestinal complications related to lupus.Choose options rich in fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, and lean meat protein.


Avoid foods that appear to aggravate any gastrointestinal symptoms.
You can find more information on the staples of a healthy diet at How to Eat Healthy.

, Lupus patients often suffer from chronic pain, which can sometimes be severe or even debilitating. Combined with the fact that lupus patients usually need to avoid sunlight, this can lead to isolation and depression for those with the disease. In addition to living a healthy lifestyle, it's important to rely on your friends, family, and loved ones for support as you learn to live with lupus. The emotional benefits of a support circle can't be overstated.Look into lupus support groups in your area as well. You may find sharing with those with firsthand knowledge of your condition beneficial."

Use slippery elm.,
Take marshmallow.,
Include turmeric in your diet.,
Take folic acid and iron supplements.,
Increase your intake of vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with Crohn’s disease and may worsen the symptoms if you already have the disease.",How to Treat Crohn’s Disease Naturally with Home Remedies2," This herbal remedy is usually used as a home treatment for digestive disorders such as Crohn’s disease.


It is classified as a demulcent, which is a substance that defends the irritated and inflamed smooth muscles of the digestive tract, promoting its recovery and healing.
The therapeutic range of slippery elm is 60 mg to 320 mg a day. The slippery elm powder can be mixed with a glass of water and can be taken 3 to 4 times a day.

, This is not the same marshmallow that kids love. It is a medicinal perennial herb that is used to treat ailments of the stomach and the intestines, such as those caused by Crohn’s disease.


This herb is classified as a demulcent like slippery elm, which protects the inflamed tissues and facilitates their recovery. At the same time, it is also an emollient (a substance that provides lubrication) which soothes the mucous membranes of the digestive system.
This herb is taken as a tea by steeping 2–5 grams (0.071–0.18 oz) of dried leaf or 5 grams (0.18 oz) of dried root in a cup of boiling water. The tea is then strained and allowed to cool. It can be taken 3 times a day.
However, marshmallow is to be avoided if you have diabetes, since it can increase blood sugar levels. It might also interfere with other drugs taken orally so it is best to take it one hour after taking other oral medications.

, Turmeric is a spice that is closely related to ginger. It is found in abundant amounts in curry.


Research has shown that Crohn’s disease patients who took turmeric reduced their symptoms and lessened their need for other medications.Therefore, due to the strong anti inflammatory and antibacterial properties of turmeric, it has been used as an herbal remedy to treat Crohn’s disease.
The usual therapeutic dosage of turmeric is 1 to 2 grams (0.035 to 0.071 oz) per day. Increasing your consumption of food such as one serving of chicken curry or curry rice is enough to meet your daily intake of turmeric.

, Folic acid and iron must be naturally present in our body at normal levels to ensure that our body is producing the healthy blood cells needed to distribute adequate amounts of oxygen and nutrients to other organs in our body.


Unfortunately, people with Crohn’s disease naturally steer clear of cruciferous vegetables and nuts, which are rich sources of folic acid and iron.
A good remedy would be to take an iron + folic acid supplement of 60 mg of iron and 400 micrograms of folic acid in a tablet at least once a day to supplement your deficiency of these minerals.

, This is because vitamin D serves as a powerful anti-inflammatory agent that acts to normalize the function of our digestive system.


The best source of vitamin D is sun exposure (at least 15 minutes a day) because sun exposure acts as a catalyst to synthesize vitamin D in our body.
Vitamin D supplements are also available by taking at least one gel capsule of 1000 IU of vitamin D supplements a day to prevent the symptoms of Crohn’s disease.

Avoid drinking alcohol.,
Avoid certain substances that can cause gastric irritation.,
Manage your stress levels.,
Perform regular exercises.,
Do breathing exercises.,
Spend time doing things you enjoy.",How to Treat Crohn’s Disease Naturally with Home Remedies3," Drinking alcohol has many detrimental effects on the body and having Crohn’s disease only provides another reason not to drink it. This is due to the fact that alcohol has a depressive effect on the digestive system.


Alcohol also contains acetaldehyde which is toxic for the body. This toxin irritates the stomach lining and intestine.
It also increases gastric acid production, which worsens symptoms of Crohn’s disease.

, Crohn’s disease is a chronic inflammation of the stomach and intestinal linings. Therefore it is important to avoid substances that irritate the digestive system further. Examples of such substances include:



Cigarettes: The nicotine found in cigarettes increases gastric acid production that irritates gastric lining. When too much gastric acid is produced, the mucus normally found in the stomach (that serves as protective layer) is damaged, causing stomach and intestinal ulcers.

Spicy foods: Capsaicin is found in chili peppers, which are used as spices in food. Capsaicin is an irritant which causes a burning sensation when eaten. It also causes irritation to the esophageal and stomach linings.

Caffeine: Caffeine may cause increased gastric acid production leading to delayed healing of stomach ulcers. Examples of caffeine-containing substances are coffee, tea, and sodas.

, Stress can cause a flare-up of Crohn’s disease, as stressful situations can trigger symptoms of the disease.


Whenever the body is under stress, the immune system is overactive – calming yourself down helps to limit the worsening of symptoms.
The normal digestive pattern changes whenever a person is under stress, stomach activity is affected causing slower absorption and increased gastric acid production. Stress can be managed through relaxation techniques.

, Exercise helps to relieve tensed muscles and anxiety.. Swimming, jogging, bicycling, and running are all recommended forms of exercise for sufferers of Crohn's disease. Doing exercises 3 to 4 times per week for 30 to 45 minutes can provide great relief.

, Deep and slow breathing can help to relax tensed muscles. Try inhaling through your nose slowly for up to 5 seconds, then exhale through your mouth for up to 7 seconds. You can do this several times per day - it is best done during the morning and evening.

, Engaging in recreational activities can help you to avoid dwelling on your health issues. You can go shopping, watch television programs, surf the internet or just simply spend time with your loved ones. This can bring comfort and relief especially if you are currently on a stressful situation.

Experiment with biofeedback.,
Try treating with acupuncture.,
Consider homeopathy.",How to Treat Crohn’s Disease Naturally with Home Remedies4," Biofeedback is an alternative treatment method for patients suffering from diseases relating to the immune system. Crohn’s disease is sometimes triggered by an overly sensitive immune system which causes severe inflammation in the small intestines as well as generalized abdominal pain.


Therefore, biofeedback could be an effective method in controlling the symptoms of Crohn’s disease. In this method of treatment, the patient is usually hooked to a machine that transmits electric signals to gain a feedback of the body’s responses to the sent signals.
This information regarding our body’s feedback is used by the doctor to adjust the frequency and intensity of the electrical signals to be sent in future treatments. The machine then converts these signals to cue the body on a better reaction and response with regards to the abnormalities the body is currently experiencing.
The theory behind biofeedback is to allow the body to adapt better and to heal faster the natural way in combating Crohn’s disease. The frequency of the sessions depends on the physician as to the extent of the disease and depending on the severity of your symptoms of Crohn’s disease.

, Acupuncture has its origin in traditional Chinese medicine. With acupuncture fine needles are inserted into the skin at certain key locations around the body.


The acupuncturist determines the key anatomical areas where the needles are to be inserted. This promotes the body’s release of endorphins (the body’s natural painkillers), helping to control the pain and inflammation in the digestive system.
By stimulating the body’s natural healing processes and defenses, the acupuncturist aims to boost the body’s immune system in fighting off infection and inflammation, as well as to reduce symptoms of Crohn’s disease.
Experiment with acupuncture sessions at least once a month to see if the symptoms of Crohn's disease improve.

, Homeopathy is a special branch of alternative medicine where diluted substances derived from plants, animals, and other substances are used for the treatment of certain diseases, such as Crohn’s disease. In Crohn’s disease, homeopathic treatment is highly individualized depending on your symptoms.


Consult a homeopath regarding homeopathic treatment for Crohn's disease.

See your physician often.,
Use corticosteroid medications.,
Ask about antimalarial drugs.,
Use immunosuppressive medications.,
Take intravenous immunoglobulin (IVGs).,
Take anticoagulants to prevent blood clotting.,
Consider more powerful painkillers.,
Avoid certain types of medication.",How to Treat Lupus2," Your doctor will have a variety of medication options available to help alleviate pain and other symptoms. Your doctor will also have general information on how to minimize flareups.They may also refer you to a rheumatologist, who specializes in diseases such as lupus. Together, they will help you manage your medications and keep your symptoms and side effects in check. Keep regular appointments to help find the best medication (or combination of medications) for your specific symptoms. You should also see your doctor whenever you have a flare. Common symptoms involved with a lupus flareup include:Severe fatigue and fever
Pain, swelling, or stiffness in your joints
Chest pain
Confusion or memory loss
Shortness of breath

, Corticosteroids (prednisone, cortisone, etc.) have anti-inflammatory properties. Corticosteroids fight the painful inflammation that can accompany lupus's autoimmune response. Your doctor will want to monitor your use of corticosteroids because long-term use can lead to side effects such as:Weight gain
Susceptibility to bruising
Increased potential for infection
High blood pressure
Osteoporosis (bone thinning)

, Your doctor may prescribe antimalarial drugs—hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) and chloroquine—in conjunction with corticosteroids or other medications. They most often treat lupus symptoms such as skin rashes, mouth ulcers, and joint pain.These options can require long-term use to measure results, but side effects are typically mild. They include:Upset stomach and blurred vision (reduced by taking with food)
Insomnia
Anxiety
Dizziness
Retinal damage (in very rare cases)

, Your doctor may prescribe immunosuppressive medicines—azathioprine (Imuran), leflunomide (Arava), and methotrexate (Trexall)—for serious cases.However, your doctor will monitor the use of these drugs carefully since they reduce your body’s ability to fight off other infections. Side effects include:Increased risk of infection
Damage to your liver
Decreased fertility
Higher risk of cancer
A newer medication in this class—belimumab (Benlysta)—also helps relieve lupus symptoms in some cases. Benefits of the drug include less severe side effects, often limited to nausea, diarrhea, and fever., Immunoglobulin is a term for a body's natural antibodies, which, under normal conditions, help fight disease and infection. In IVG therapy, antibodies are isolated from another person's donated blood, then injected into your body intravenously (through a vein). IVG can boost a person's immune function without increasing the autoimmune response that causes lupus symptoms


Due to an expensive, time-consuming delivery process, your doctor will only prescribe this option in severe cases.

, People with lupus are more likely to suffer from blood clots. If a blood clot occurs in a deep vein, in the heart, or in the brain, it can cause potentially life-threatening conditions such as deep-vein thrombosis, heart attack, or stroke. Your doctor may prescribe anticoagulants to thin your blood if he or she decides that you are at a greater risk for blood clots.The most serious side effects of blood thinners are increased susceptibility to bleeding and gangrene of the skin., Sometimes, in severe cases of lupus, the pain can become too great for anti-inflammatory treatments to manage. In these cases, your doctor can prescribe powerful painkillers, usually opiates like oxycodone.

, Some common medications can aggravate lupus symptoms. If you take one of these medications, work with your doctor to see if you can replace them with other medications or otherwise minimize their effects with regard to lupus. Some drugs that have negative interactions with lupus are:


Sulfa-containing antibiotics (sulfonamides)
Hydralazine
Procainamide
Mynocycline
Supplements that contain alfalfa

Take fish oil supplements.,
Take dehydro-epiandro-sterone (DHEA) supplements.,
Take vitamin D3.,
Use turmeric.,
Try astragalus.",How to Treat Lupus3," Initial studies have shown promise with an increase of the omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil supplements.Additionally, omega-3 fats are the “good” fats that can have a positive effect on your cholesterol and heart health.


Common side effects include burping, nausea, and a lasting fish taste in your mouth., DHEA does not affect lupus directly, but studies have shown that it reduces the dosage of prescribed corticosteroids necessary to help stabilize symptoms., Those deficient in levels of vitamin D3 have shown to have more symptoms and flareups.Taking a low daily dosage can help stabilize vitamin D levels and reduce flareups.

, Turmeric has also been shown to reduce symptoms and flareups.However, turmeric can interact with anticoagulant medications, so always consult your doctor before adding turmeric to your regimen., Astragalus seems to reduce the activity of an overactive immune system, but more study is necessary.Do not take this herb without first discussing it with your physician, especially if you take lithium or a medication to suppress your immune system.

Take medications that alleviate symptoms.,
Understand that in severe cases, surgical intervention may be necessary.",How to Treat Crohn’s Disease Naturally with Home Remedies5," There is no medication that can be used to directly treat Crohn’s disease. Medications are used in the context of treating the symptoms rather than curing the disease. The following medications are used in managing the symptoms:



Sulfasalazine: This medication that treats inflammation caused by gastric and intestinal irritation.

Prednisone: This is a corticosteroid medication that also treats inflammation.

Azathioprine: This is an immunosuppressive medication that works by blocking synthesis of DNA, RNA, and proteins that interfere with cellular metabolism, thus preventing inflammation.

Ampicillin: This is an antibiotic that is used in treating bacterial growths in the intestine and stomach.

, For severe cases of Crohn’s disease, surgical intervention may be necessary. Surgery is done if symptoms do not respond to any natural or medical treatment. Surgery does not cure the disease rather it removes area where there is bleeding, blockage, inflammation, ulcers, or abscess.


However, it usually takes more than one surgery as there are high chances for recurrence. Common surgical procedures that are performed to alleviate Crohn's disease are ileostomy and intestinal resection surgery.
Ileostomy is a surgical procedure commonly performed in patients with Crohn’s disease. It is a surgical opening of the small intestine which brings the end part of the intestine to the surface of the stomach. This procedure is usually done if all of the large intestine is affected.
Intestinal resection surgery. There are other cases where only the affected part of the intestine is removed. The diseased section is cut out and the healthier parts on either side are connected. Ileostomy is not necessary when intestinal resection surgery has been performed.

Go to a hardware store such as Ace, Lowes, or Home Depot and purchase a roll of plastic sheeting.,
Once you get the roll of plastic home you'll need a utility knife or pair of scissors to cut the plastic sheet.

,
When you cover the bed with the plastic, place it directly on top of the box spring.,
You also have to take into account the size of the bed-twin, double, queen, or king size, and then cut the plastic to fit the size of the mattress.

,
After covering the box spring with the plastic, place one of the fitted mattress pads over the plastic then cover it with the fitted top sheet.,
Besides using the plastic for a bed wetting sheet the plastic sheeting can be used for numerous household tasks such as drop cloths for painting, covering outside materials such as firewood and mulch, for remodeling projects,yard work, as well as many other jobs.

,
Periodically check the plastic to notice any wear and tear.,
Put the plastic over the bed for a while and see how the person feels about it.,
As mentioned above, another option for a homemade waterproof sheet to cover the bed is to use vinyl sheeting sold at craft stores such as Jo Anne Fabrics.,
Although the bed is covered in plastic, it's still a good idea to have the incontinent person sleep in diapers whether pin-on diapers covered with plastic pants, disposable diapers with tape tabs (known as disposable briefs), or you can use both types of diapers but have the person wear pin-on diapers and plastic pants on some nights and the disposable diapers on other nights.",How to Use Hardware Store Plastic Sheeting as a Bedwetting Sheet," Plastic sheeting comes in different thicknesses and sizes.It also comes in black or clear. The most commonly used thickness is 6 mil, although hardware stores also sell plastic in 4, 3, and 2 mil thicknesses. Some people have complained about traditional vinyl mattress covers tearing and ripping and since the hardware store plastic is very tough it should last for a long time. Plastic sheeting is measured in thousandths of an inch or ""mils"". The higher the mil, the thicker and more durable the plastic is. 6 mil plastic would be the best choice for this purpose because when the person shifts positions in bed and moves around it causes a certain amount of wear and tear on the plastic and since 6 mil plastic is thicker, it should last longer than thinner plastic. The only drawback of using this material for bedwetting protection is that it makes a ""crinkling""(i.e. rustling) sound when the person moves around in bed. The crackling sound can be minimized, however, by covering the plastic with fitted mattress pads as described below. The advantages of using 6 mil plastic is that since it is thicker it is more durable and will be less likely to tear.;
,, Cut the plastic so that it covers the mattress from the top of the mattress to the bottom. Also, make sure the plastic is long enough on both the left and right sides so that in touches the floor, that way you can tuck it under the bed which prevents the plastic from coming loose or bunching up. Do not cover the corners of the mattress with the plastic sheet because when you put the mattress pads and fitted sheet over the plastic it has a tendency to slip off the bed.

,, Run your hand over the fitted top sheet to see how much crinkling noise the plastic makes. If you feel the child, teenager, or incontinent adult can sleep on the bed with just one pad covering the plastic then just use one of the fitted mattress pads. Ask them if the crinkling noise bothers them and if they say that it does, tell them that you'll place another fitted mattress pad over the plastic to lessen the sound. You can buy mattress pads for around $20.00. There are two types of mattress pads-waterproof and non waterproof. You can buy a quilted waterproof mattress pad for added protection, but it's not really necessary since you have plastic over the box spring.

,, Even though this type of plastic is very durable it's still a good idea to check it once in a while just to be on the safe side. If you notice any holes or rips,there are two things you can do. You can either use some type of waterproof tape to put over the hole or tear, or you can replace the plastic with another piece. Hardware stores such as Lowes and Home Depot should have waterproof duct tape(or other types of tape) for this purpose. Make sure the tape is waterproof or when the person wets at night they'll pee through the plastic, ruining the box spring. This is another advantage of having a roll of plastic for this purpose - you can just cut off another sheet to put over the bed or you can repair the plastic, whereas if a vinyl mattress cover rips you have to go back to the store to purchase another one or you have to go online to buy another one. Alternatively, you can cut off several sheets of plastic from the roll and alternate using the different sheets. For instance you can cut off 4 sheets to use during the month. At the end of the first week you can put the second plastic sheet on, at the end of the second week you can put the third sheet on, etc. Rotating the plastic sheets will reduce the wear and tear of any one of the sheets.

, If they can't get used to it you can always purchase vinyl sheeting from fabric stores such as Jo Anne Fabrics. This option is discussed in the next step.

, Vinyl is a type of plastic. Jo Anne Fabrics sells vinyl sheeting in different thicknesses. The vinyl comes in both clear and frosted clear. I've used the 12 gauge frosted clear vinyl as a bedwetting sheet and so far it's worked really well. This plastic also makes a crinkling sound so you'll also have to cover this to muffle the rustling sound. The wikiHow article Purchase Vinyl Sheeting from a Fabric Store to Manage Bedwetting discusses this in greater detail

, For information about the different types diapers available for older children and teenagers with bedwetting problems see the wikiHow articles Choose Pin on Cloth Diapers for Older Children and Teenagers With Bedwetting Problems and Choose Bedwetting Diapers for an Older Child or Teenager If they're embarrassed about wearing diapers the wikiHow article Encourage Older Children and Teenagers to Wear Diapers for Bedwetting offers a number of methods for encouraging them to wear overnight diapers as well as ways to make them feel less ashamed about it.

If the person finds the cloth diapers and plastic pants too uncomfortable to wear during the warmer times of year, such as spring and summer, switch to disposables during that time. The plastic sheeting is not meant to be the primary form of protection, it's meant to be used as a fail safe in case the urine leaks through the diapers. If the moisture leaks through the diapers you'll have to wash both the fitted mattress cover and the mattress pads. You'll also need to wipe the plastic sheet off and hang it up to dry. You can use a clothesline for this purpose.

Use a waterproof mattress protector.,
Use extra protection.,
Have the child wear a disposable bedwetting diaper to bed.,
Use the bathroom instead of having any protection at all.,
Use a bedwetting alarm to alert the child when it notices moisture.",How to Protect a Bed from Children's Bedwetting," Place this underneath the child's fitted bedsheet to keep the mattress from getting wet.;
, Use an extra layer of waterproof padding, such as a Goodnites Bedmat or a disposable waterproof pad. Place this on the bed in the area of the child's potential wetting-area for more targeted protection.

, Don't use normal diapers designed for traditional daily use, as they aren't designed for the increased amount of use between changes without being spotted. If the bedwetting child soaks through the diaper, it will continue to soak out into the surrounding area (which may include the bed) and wearing a diaper may help to protect it from becoming too wet, as if the child hadn't been wearing a diaper at all that night. Use a specific bedwetting-styled diaper, as bedwetting diapers are designed to absorb more moisture at night, and thereby prevent the frustration of finding wet sheets the next morning.

, Have the child use the bathroom before going to bed, and wake the bedwetting children up once every hour or two to use the bathroom every night. This will force them to retrain their brain to urinate only into the toilet and not onto the bed. Though it maybe difficult and time-consuming for you, it is also a very effective way to protect a bed from bedwetting.

, However, don't always rely on the alarm to solely alert the child - by the time the bedwetting alarm activates, it's often too late to stop the stream.

Be patient.",How to Manage Bedwetting in Older Children and Teenagers," Bedwetting can be divided into primary or secondary enuresis. Someone with primary enuresis has wet the bed since she was an infant, and has never had urinary continence for more than six months. Secondary enuresis occurs after at least six months of urinary continence.Nocturnal enuresis is three times more common than daytime wetting and affects 2.8 percent of older children. It occurs three times more often in boys. Secondary causes account for less than 25 percent of cases.Some young adults who have daytime bladder issues, including an overactive bladder, may also experience nocturnal enuresis.;
, If a child has parents who experienced nighttime incontinence, they have a 40–77% chance of having bedwetting problems also. Other risk factors include delayed physical maturation, constipation, overactive bladder, small bladder capacity, problems with certain hormones (including antidiuretic hormone), as well as social and emotional stress.


Events involving emotional distress such as a move to a new house or school, or other major life event, may trigger bedwetting.Sexual abuse can also cause the onset of secondary enuresis.If you suspect your child is a victim, seek expert help with your physician or through a sexual abuse and assault resource agency right away.Keep a calendar. Keeping track of wet and dry nights may help identify patterns.

, Certain medical conditions can cause bedwetting, including urinary tract infections, sleep disorders, hormonal conditions, issues with nerves that supply the bladder, and diabetes. These require a diagnosis from a physician.The physician will discuss with you your child or teen’s hydration history, daytime urine voiding patterns, sleep history, number and episode history of bedwetting incidents, as well as behavior and emotional status.The examination may also include a urinalysis and urine culture to rule out infections. In some cases, x-rays or other tests may be ordered. Most children and young adults with enuresis have normal urine tests.Have your physician reassess your child after the initial diagnosis to monitor progress and fine-tune any recommended treatments., Imipramine, desmopressin, and oxybutynin are three medications that are used to treat nocturnal enuresis in children and young adults.Antibiotics will be used to treat any urinary tract infections.


Imipramine is classified as an antidepressant and carries with it some risk for suicide, as well as serious physical side effects.Discuss these with your physician.
Desmopressin is a drug used to control the amount of urine made in the kidneys, and can reduce the number of bedwetting episodes.It is effective in approximately 40 to 60 percent of children.Oxybutynin reduces bladder muscle spasms and is available in several forms, including a topical patch., Considered to be a safe and highly effective form of behavioral conditioning, a bedwetting alarm consists of a special sensor for wetness placed in the child’s pajamas or on the mattress of the bed that triggers a vibration or sound, waking the child.Bedwetting alarms can range in cost from $50 to $150. While insurance usually does not cover the cost, flexible spending account funds can be used to purchase the alarm.Consider cost, durability, reliability and ease of set-up when purchasing an alarm.Most physicians recommend a vibratory alarm over a sound device since it is more effective at waking up children who are sound sleepers., This can help reduce mattress damage and reduce the amount of laundry after a bedwetting incident.


Place towels or other absorbent material between the waterproof cover and the bottom sheet
Use a blanket that can go straight into the washing machine and dries quickly.
If necessary, make up a spare bed or couch ahead of time to encourage your child to go back to sleep quickly after a bedwetting event.

, Having clean pajamas, and bedding in your child’s room can help with quick and easy changes during the night.

, Some children may benefit from feeling like they can take charge of the situation. This includes stripping and remaking the bed, and operating the washing machine.

, Make sure your child drinks enough liquids during the day, so he does not feel dehydrated before bedtime. Your child or teen should avoid tea, soda, coffee, or energy drinks that contain caffeine, which acts as a diuretic. Limit liquids before bedtime.There is some evidence that food allergies may increase bedwetting, so be sure to discuss your child’s reactions to food with your doctor. Have your child eat less salt. Salt can cause the body to retain more fluids, so steer him clear of salty snacks like chips., Sleeping away from home can be a source of anxiety for children and teens suffering from nocturnal enuresis.


Make sure your child knows to go to the bathroom before bedtime. Emptying the bladder completely may help reduce the risk of wetting the bed during sleep.
Provide your child with absorbent, disposable underwear. There are discreet and effective products on the market for helping older children and teenagers manage bedwettings.Send your child with an extra set of clothes, as well as a waterproof storage bag for wet clothes.
Discuss the issue with the other adults involved. Making them aware can make a bedwetting incident less traumatic for the child.
Talk to your child's doctor about medication. Having a child take antidiuretics for the short time she is away from home may help., He may suffer from shame and embarrassment. Remind him that it is not his fault, and maintain a low-key attitude after accidents.Parental punishment for bedwetting at any age is inappropriate. It is strongly associated with childhood depression and reduced quality of life., There are a number of online resources to help manage bedwetting.These can be an important component of dealing with the psychological effects of bedwetting and can complement more formal care.Some sites include message boards, which may be especially helpful for teenagers seeking reassurance.

, Bedwetting can be a source of major anxiety and distress and the incidence of depression, sadness, and social fear is higher in children who regularly wet the bed.Regular therapy can help your child and your family manage these symptoms.The therapist may help your child with behavioral modifications including positive reinforcement systems, awakening programs, or other methods., There’s no need for your friends or workmates or even the child's grandparents to know there’s a bedwetting problem in your family. By providing your child or teen with incontinence supplies, a safe space to discuss her feelings, and other behavioral or medical treatment, you can help her overcome the feelings of shame and guilt associated with bedwetting., Most children and teenagers “grow out of” bedwetting, sometimes even without treatment.Without treatment, 15% of children who wet the bed outgrow it with each passing year."

Limit your fluid intake.,
Reduce or eliminate caffeine and alcohol.,

Do your laundry regularly.,
Talk to your roommate.,
Consider living alone.",How to Manage Bedwetting in College," The simplest solution to reducing incontinence is to reduce or limit how much you drink. While you should always drink enough water throughout the day to stay healthy, you can consolidate your fluid intake and time it so that your bladder is not as full at night.Try to consume most of your fluids in the morning and early afternoon so that your bladder will be less full when you go to sleep at night.
Never restrict your fluid intake to the point of dehydration. If you feel thirsty or if your urine is dark in color, drink water.;
, Caffeine and alcohol both act as diuretics, which increase your need to urinate.Caffeine and alcohol can both lead to dehydration as well, which can increase your need to drink water after consuming these chemicals.


If you must consume caffeine, try to limit your consumption to the morning and early afternoon. Do not eat or drink anything containing caffeine beginning at dinner time so that any caffeine in your system has passed by bed time.
Avoid all caffeine consumption in the evening, as this can increase the chances of bedwetting and also affect your ability to sleep at night.

, Some people avoid using the restroom during the day, either because it's inconvenient or because they don't realize they have to go. By forcing yourself to urinate at regular intervals, though, you may be able to reduce your need to urinate at night.Most people urinate an average of six to seven times within a 24 hour period.Training your body to urinate every two to three hours throughout the day can help get your body more used to passing urine during waking hours.

, In addition to urinating more during the day, some experts recommend what's called a double voiding before you go to bed. This entails urinating once when you start your bedtime routine (brushing your teeth, putting on your pajamas, etc.) and again just before you fall asleep.Double voiding may be particularly effective when combined with a restricted fluid intake and more frequent daytime urinations.

, Bedwetting alarms are equipped with a sensor that detects moisture in your underwear. When the sensor activates it sets off an alarm or a silent vibrational signal to wake you up. You can purchase bedwetting alarms online or through a medical distribution store in your community.While a bedwetting alarm may not be much help at preventing accidents early on, they will help train your bladder over time.
With continued use, your body will be able to recognize the signs of a full bladder and wake you up before you have an accident.
If you use a bedwetting alarm that makes an audible sound, you may have to explain to your roommate (if you have one) what the sound is.
It may be easier to remain discreet if you use the vibrating alarm, as this will not produce an audible sound.

, There are many possible reasons why an adult may have ongoing issues with wetting the bed. For many adults this problem simply requires some behavioral modification, but many people suffer from underlying medical conditions that can cause incontinence.Talk to your doctor if behavioral treatments have not helped your bedwetting problem. Common medical complications associated with bedwetting include:


a hormonal imbalance
overwhelming stress
a urinary tract infection
sleep apnea
diabetes
prostate problemschronic constipation

, Though there is no simple ""cure"" for bedwetting, there are a number of medications your doctor may prescribe to help reduce urine production and/or control overactive bladder. Some medications may cause side effects, including dry mouth, dizziness, and blurred vision.Commonly-prescribed medications for incontinence include:


Desmopressin
Imipramine
Darifenacin
Oxybutynin
Tolterodine
Trospium chloride
Solifenacin

, Surgical options are usually considered when other methods have failed. These procedures involve implanting artificial devices or surgically altering your bladder to provide you with better bladder control.Some surgical options for incontinence include:


Sacral nerve stimulation: in this procedure, your doctor will implant a device that stimulates the nerves in your body to help reduce muscle contraction that would otherwise cause incontinence.
Clam cystoplasty: during this procedure, a piece of your intestine is surgically implanted in your bladder to increase the size of your bladder and reduce overall bladder activity.
Detrusor myectomy: in this surgical procedure, your doctor will remove some or all of the exterior muscle that surrounds your bladder. This can help give you increased control over your bladder functions.

, A mattress or sheet cover will not reduce or prevent nocturnal incontinence, but these items can help make cleanup easier. You can purchase a mattress cover or sheet protector online or at many houseware retailers.Mattress covers may be made of waterproof materials, like vinyl, or they may be made of absorbing materials.
Sheet protectors can be put down over your sheets to help simplify the cleaning process.

, Absorbent underwear can help reduce the risk of urine soaking your clothing and bedding at night.You can purchase absorbent underwear at your local pharmacy or grocery store, or through an online retailer.


Absorbent underwear come in both disposable and reusable forms.

, The most noticeable consequences of nocturnal incontinence are soiled clothing and bedding. These embarrassing markers of bedwetting can alert others to your problem if they're noticed. The best way to avoid others noticing your soiled linens is by doing laundry frequently and keeping clean clothes and bedding on hand near your bed at all times.


If you have one or more roommates, try to do your laundry when they aren't around whenever possible.
Don't put off washing soiled linens. Launder your wet clothing and bedding early the next morning before class so that they do not start to smell.
Be sure to change out of wet clothing right away to prevent rashes and other skin irritations from developing.

, The decision to tell someone about your bedwetting problem is a difficult one. You may feel embarrassed and want to hide your problem, but if you live with a roommate they may realize that you've been wetting the bed. If you decide to talk to your roommate, do so when you're both alone and can have a serious conversation.


Remind your roommate that your problem is a medical one. It's not something to be laughed at or joked about.
Establish your boundaries with your roommate. If you don't want anyone else to know about your problem, make this clear and ask your roommate to be respectful of your wishes.
If your roommate does find out (or if you decide to tell them), reiterate that you're taking precautions and trying to correct the problem. Let your roommate know that they'll never have to directly deal with your problem and that you'll be responsible for handling it.

, It may not always be feasible, but living alone may make it easier to cope with your bedwetting problem while you get it under control. Ask someone from student housing if it's possible to pay more for your own dorm room, or look into off-campus housing options.

Realize that bedwetting is normal.,
Reduce stress in your child's life.,
Help your child build urinary control.,
Avoid waking up your child at night.,
Make the environment a comfortable one.,
Think about using a reward system.",How to Prevent Bed Wetting1," Although it may be inconvenient for you and embarrassing for your child, bedwetting is normal behavior in children. You can rest easy knowing that in many cases bedwetting will come to an end as your child grows older. Until then you can patiently and calmly work with with your child until she has outgrown the ages most commonly associated with bedwetting.Bedwetting is common in children of up to around five years of age.
Nearly 10 percent of children in this age group will wet the bed.
Never punish your child for wetting the bed. Make it clear you are there to help her.
Although bedwetting is common in children you may still want to have your doctor check for any medical issues that might be causing it.;
, One common cause of bedwetting in children is stress. Stress can be caused by many different things in your child's life and reducing that stress will lower the chances of him wetting the bed. Work with your child to reassure him about any stressful issues to help him stop his bedwetting.Moving to a new home can be stressful on a child. Making him feel comfortable in his new surroundings can help reduce that stress.
Bullies at schools are a serious source of stress in a child's life. Work with your child and school staff to stop the bullying if this is an issue.

, Whether it's due to weak muscles or undeveloped habits, your child can benefit from practicing control over when she urinates. This can help reinforce the idea that there are times when it is appropriate to urinate as well as help strengthen her ability to hold urine throughout the night.Ask your child to try holding her urine for a few minutes after she feels the urge to use the restroom.
Don't extend this period of waiting beyond 10 minutes.

, Although it may seem helpful, waking your child up during the night to remind him to urinate can actually hurt your efforts. This can send the wrong messages and may prevent your child from listening to the natural cues that his body is giving him. Let your child sleep normally, helping him only if he has a bedwetting accident., Your child may be trying to use the toilet at night but might feel uncomfortable doing so. This might be due to her finding either her bedroom too far away from the bathroom to feel safe or maybe the bathroom is too dark at night. Talk with your child to learn if she might be nervous about the bathroom to help prevent bedwetting issues., Children will generally respond well to rewards that are given when they demonstrate certain behaviors. The same idea can work with bedwetting troubles. Think about giving your child a reward for nights that he doesn't wet the bed in order to build positive associations with dry nights.Putting a gold sticker on the calendar for every night without bedwetting can be a good idea for a reward. Once the child has a certain number of stickers, reward him with a small toy or fun activity.

Having wet clothing pressed against the body for prolonged periods of time may also cause some skin irritation. You may want to remove the soiled clothing before you change the sheets to reduce the chances of discomfort and skin irritation.Keep extra undergarments and/or pajamas near the bed if bedwetting is a frequent problem. This can make it easier to change your clothes when accidents occur.
Consider bagging up soiled garments until they can be washed. This will help prevent odors from filling the room.
Keep a plastic bag near your bed so you can bag up soiled clothes more easily. If you're traveling or staying at someone else's home make sure you bring a plastic bag to keep near you at night.;
, Showering is best after an accident, if at all possible. If you're at home and your family or roommates know about the problem you may choose to bathe. If you're staying with someone who doesn't know about your problem, there are more discreet ways of cleaning up.Use wet wipes to clean off the affected areas, which may include the groin, buttocks, and thighs.
Use a clean towel or disposable paper towels to thoroughly dry off the soiled parts of the body.
If urine-soaked clothing was touching the skin for prolonged periods of time before you woke up, you may want to consider using a talc-based body powder. This can help manage moisture on the skin and prevent irritation and rashes.

, Once you're clean, you'll want to put on a pair of dry undergarments and/or pajamas. The soiled garments should be put in a laundry hamper or wrapped up in a plastic bag to prevent odors from lingering in the bedroom.


If bedwetting is a frequently-occurring problem you may want to consider leaving an extra pair of undergarments and/or pajamas near the bedside on a nightly basis.This can make cleaning up much easier and more discreet.

, Never yell at or punish someone for wetting the bed. Whether it's a child or an adult, no one wants to wet the bed. Be kind and offer assistance any way you're comfortable doing so.


If your child wets the bed, help the child get clean and change their clothes.
You should also involve the child in changing/cleaning the sheets, as this will help teach the child what to do in the future.

, Any soiled linens should be immediately stripped off and put in a laundry hamper or sealed in a plastic bag. The bedding will need to be washed, and if you plan on going back to sleep your room may smell by the morning if it's not properly stored overnight.Proper storage of soiled linens is particularly important if you have a roommate or don't want others to know about your bedwetting issue.
You may want to have a designated laundry basket for soiled linens. You can also keep plastic trash bags handy near your bed so that you can seal the soiled laundry up and contain the smell.

, If you find that you're having a difficult time cleaning up the bed, you may need to ask someone for help. This may be particularly relevant if you're spending the night at someone else's house.


Wake up someone you can trust to help you clean the bed. A relative or close friend would be ideal.
Say something like, ""I'm really sorry but I'm not feeling well and I had an accident. Can you help me clean up?""

, Depending on how much urine is released, you may need to clean the mattress in addition to changing the bedding. You'll want to focus on absorbing any residual urine and treating the spot to prevent stains and odors.Dab at the wet spot with a dry towel.
Spray the affected area with an upholstery cleaner or an enzyme-based pet odor remover. You can purchase these products at most general housewares stores and many grocery stores.
If you don't have an appropriate cleaner at home you can make one quickly and easily. Mix one teaspoon of dish detergent into one cup of warm water, then transfer the mixture into a spray bottle or dab it in with a towel.

, If bedwetting is a frequent problem, the mattress may begin to smell over time. You can remove some odors from the mattress by treating it with baking soda.Sprinkle baking soda on the affected area. Apply the baking soda generously; some accidents may require an entire box of baking soda to properly absorb the odors.
Baking soda needs time to absorb odors. You can leave the baking soda on your mattress until the morning and vacuum it up then; if you do, just put a clean, dry towel down between the baking soda and the bed sheet.

, Absorbent underwear is the first line of defense against bedwetting. These products will not prevent bedwetting, but they will make cleaning up much easier and quicker. Absorbent undergarments come in both reusable and disposable forms. They are made for children and adults of varying body sizes.You can purchase absorbent undergarments at most pharmacies and grocery stores.

, Mattress covers are designed to protect your bed in the event that urine soaks through your clothing and sheets. These products can help prevent wetness and odors from reaching the mattress, making clean up much quicker and less labor-intensive.There are many types of mattress covers, including waterproof, absorbent, and even sheet protectors.
You can purchase mattress covers at many department stores or through an online retailer.

, Reducing the quantity of fluids you consume can help reduce the chances that you'll need to void your bladder during the night. This is particularly true of the quantity and type of fluids consumed later in the day, as drinks consumed closer to bedtime are more likely to affect your body at night.


Fluids should be especially limited in the afternoon and evening. Try to limit your evening fluid intake to approximately 1/5 of your overall daily fluids.Go to the toilet twice before bed: once when you begin your bedtime routine, and once more right before you go to sleep.Avoid caffeine and alcohol. These diuretics are also considered bladder irritants and may contribute to increased urination and bedwetting.Restricting fluids is especially important for children and seniors. Children have smaller bladders that are still developing and seniors have weaker bladders due to age. Adult women who have birthed children may also have weaker bladders.

, Bedwetting alarms can be helpful to individuals of all ages who experience incontinence. The alarm is strapped to the body and goes off at the first sign of urination to wake you up right away. Over time, this may help condition your body to wake up when you need to urinate before you actually wet the bed.Bedwetting alarms can be programmed to emit sound or to vibrate. This feature may be convenient if you want to remain discreet about your bedwetting.
Bedwetting alarms are easy to clean when they get soiled.
These alarms are sensitive enough to pick up on a very small amount of urine, but not so sensitive that they will go off when sweat is detected.

, Your doctor can help determine whether there are any underlying medical issues that may be contributing to your bedwetting problem. Your doctor can also prescribe medication to help you manage your condition. Don't delay seeing a doctor if there are any changes in the frequency or type of voiding you experience, as this may be a sign of more serious problems.


Your doctor may perform a variety of tests, including a physical exam, a urinalysis and urine culture, uroflowmetry exams, and post-void residual urine measurements.See your doctor immediately if you experience cloudy or bloody urine, painful urination, or daytime incontinence., Your doctor can prescribe a variety of medications to help you manage your bedwetting.Commonly prescribed medications that your doctor may recommend include:


Desmopressin — helps regulate how much urine the kidneys produce. Side effects include nausea/vomiting, changes in appetite, headache, tiredness, restlessness, and irritability.Oxybutynin — relaxes the bladder muscles so that it can contain more urine without needing to urinate during the night. Side effects include headache, dry mouth, constipation, diarrhea, and feeling ill.
Imipramine — has the same effect as oxybutynin. Side effects include dry mouth, headache, dizziness, and increased appetite.

See your child’s pediatrician.,
Ask your child’s pediatrician about medications.",How to Stop Wetting the Bed1," Nearly 15% of children still wet the bed by the time they reach five years of age.Though this number tapers off, you generally shouldn’t worry about bedwetting up until the age of seven.Prior to that, a child’s bladder and control can still be developing.;
, In the hours leading up to bedtime, try to reduce the amount that your child has to drink.Note that this does not need to be over the course of the entire day. On the contrary, encouraging your child to hydrate in the morning and early afternoon can actually help cut down on evening-time thirst.If your child is thirsty in the evening, especially if they are participating in sports or other physical activities, do offer them water.


If your child’s school allows it, send him or her to school with a water bottle to avoid excessive fluid intake in the late afternoon and evening., Caffeine is a diuretic, which means that it can lead to a need to urinate.While you should generally avoid giving young children caffeine anyway, it’s especially true when trying to help stop bedwetting., In addition to caffeine, you should try to cut out other possible bladder irritants in the evening that can lead to bedwetting. These include citrus juices, dyes (particularly juices with red dyes), sweeteners, and artificial flavorings., In the late afternoon and into the evening, encourage your child to use the toilet roughly every two hours.This will help avoid a sense of urgency over the evening.

, Many children use the bathroom at the start of their bedtime routine as they get ready to change into pajamas, brush their teeth, etc. “Double-voiding” means having your child use the bathroom then and then going a second time directly before actually going to sleep., Pressure from your child’s rectum due to constipation can manifest as bedwetting. To make matters more difficult, children often feel too embarrassed to discuss constipation, but this simple issue comprises up to a third of all instances of bedwetting in children who otherwise have control.If you confirm that he or she is constipated, try a fiber-rich diet for several days. If this doesn’t make a difference, then see your pediatrician. There are many good options to help children with constipation.

, Though the process is frustrating, you should never resort to punishing your child for bedwetting.Your child likely feels embarrassed by the occurrences and wants to stop just as much as you want him or her to stop. Instead of punishing failure, try rewarding the successes on nights when your child stays dry.You can reward your child with anything from playing a game, stickers, to a favorite dish for dinner. Use what you know he or she enjoys.

, Waking your child up before you go to bed to have him or her use the bathroom again will resort in a frustrated and poorly rested child.You don’t want to wake your child on instances when it’s not necessary either. Instead, try a bedwetting alarm. These devices clip to underwear or a pad on the mattress and beep as soon as they detect moisture, allowing your child to get up and go only when a bedwetting incident is imminent., Bedwetting in children can indicate a more serious issue in a minority of cases. To be safe, see your pediatrician, so he or she can test for:Sleep apnea
A urinary tract infection
Diabetes
Abnormalities of the urinary tract or nervous system

, Since children typically outgrow bedwetting, medications aren’t usually recommended by most pediatricians.However, some are available as a method of last resort. These options include:Desmopressin (DDAVP), which boosts a natural anti-diuretic hormone to make less urine at night. However, these drugs have side effects and can also affect sodium levels, and you must monitor your child’s fluid intake while on the drug.
Oxybutynin (Ditropan XL), which can help cut down on bladder contractions and cause greater bladder capacity.

"
"
Go to the bathroom often.,
Limit fluid intake before bed.,
Use an alarm.,
Ask about medication.,
Set an alarm for a random time.,
Ask your doctor about surgical treatments.,
Consider alternative treatments.",How to Prevent Bed Wetting2," If a bladder is overly full during sleep the chances of wetting the bed increase. To lower the likelihood of bedwetting caused by a full bladder it can be useful to urinate more frequently during the day. Keeping the bladder empty will make bedwetting less likely.Try to use the bathroom more frequently before bed.
Children should go to the bathroom every night just before bed.
Make sure you or your child feel no urges to urinate before sleeping.

, Drinking a large amount of liquid before going to be bed can be a likely cause of bedwetting. Consuming too much liquid before bed can cause the bladder to become overly full. Avoid drinking too much of anything before bed to lower the chances of wetting the bed.Try to drink fluids earlier in the day and reduce the amount in the evening.
Some drinks like soda, coffee, tea or hot chocolate can increase the need to urinate. These should be avoided at night.

, If bedwetting becomes a persistent problem you may consider using a bedwetting alarm. These alarms are worn near the underwear and will constantly monitor for rises in moisture levels. If the device senses an increase in moisture it will sound an alarm and wake the person up.


Hearing the alarm can retrain a person to awaken before or just as bedwettingoccurs.Some systems will make use of a pad on which the person sleeps. This pad measures moisture levels and alarms if it detects a rise in those levels.
Alarms may vibrate instead of making a loud sound to awaken the sleeper. This might be ideal if the child or adult sleeps near other people to avoid waking others up.

, In serious cases medication may be prescribed to help manage bedwetting. Currently, there are three types of medication that are commonly prescribed to treat bedwetting. These medications will either increase the amount of urine the bladder can contain or reduce the amount it produces. The following three medications are the most commonly used:Desmopressin will reduce the amount of urine production.
Oxybutynin will relax the bladder to avoid bedwetting.
Imipramine will allow the bladder to contain more urine.

, Using an alarm clock to wake up at night to urinate can help with bedwetting. However, the body may get used to a regularly set alarm which can make this method less effective. To counter this, set the alarm for a different time each night that will wake someone up to use the bathroom, lowering the chances of bedwetting., If most other methods have failed and bedwetting still persists, your doctor may suggest surgical treatments. These treatments are operations that will physically alter the bladder to reduce or eliminate the occurrences of bedwetting. Talk with your doctor to learn more about the following procedures:Sacral nerve stimulation will work to reduce the nerve response in the detrusor muscle, resulting in less issues with incontinence.
Clam cystoplasty will place a piece of intestine between two halves of the bladder.
A Detrusor Myectomy will remove the surrounding muscle near the bladder to reduce the amount of contractions in favor of stronger contractions.

, If conventional treatments fail or are undesirable there are alternative and complementary treatments that might be considered. These treatments can be used by themselves or in conjunction with other methods. The following list details some of the more common alternative treatments:Hypnosis
Psychotherapy
Acupuncture
Chiropractic treatment

Discover the common causes of bedwetting.,
Talk with your doctor.,
Know what to expect from your doctor visit.",How to Prevent Bed Wetting3," Although it can be an unpleasant condition, bedwetting has some well known causes that you can likely identify. However, these causes may be more or less serious in regards to overall health. Take a moment to look over the following common causes of bedwetting:Drinking too much fluid before bed
A bladder that produces too much urine or is too small to contain much urine
Not waking up when feeling the urge to urinate
Constipation
Emotional issues or disturbances
Diabetes
Nerve issues
Urinary tract infections
Diuretics or some sleeping aids

, If bedwetting is a persistent problem for you or your child it can be a good idea to speak with your doctor. Although bedwetting is common in children under five years of age there may be other medical issues causing it. Your doctor will also be able to prescribe treatment after identifying the cause of the bedwetting.Your doctor will be able to diagnose the cause behind the bedwetting.
A doctor can discover if bedwetting is caused by a more serious medical issue.

, During your visit with your doctor you or your child will be asked various questions regarding the bedwetting issue. Knowing what your doctor might ask ahead of time can help you think about the condition and provide accurate and informative answers. Take a moment to review the following common questions that you might be asked about bedwetting:How often the bedwetting occurs.
How problematic the bedwetting is.
The age of the person having difficulties with bedwetting.
The sleeping arrangements in your home.

Limit fluid intake at night.,
Avoid too much caffeine or alcohol.,
Treat constipation.,
Set a bedwetting alarm.,
Check the side effects of your medications.,
Look for other signs of sleep apnea.,
See your doctor.,
Ask about medications.,
Ask about surgical options.",How to Stop Wetting the Bed2," If you limit the amount of fluids you drink in the few hours preceding bedtime, then your body will produce less urine overnight, making you less likely to wet the bed.This does not mean cut back on your overall fluid intake. You should still aim to drink around eight glasses of water each day. Simply try to consume them in the morning and afternoon hours. Staying hydrated is equally important since dehydration can also lead to adult bedwetting., Both caffeine and alcohol are diuretics, which mean they cause the body to produce more urine. Alcohol also dulls your body’s ability to wake you in the night to urinate when you have to go, leading to instances of bedwetting.Avoid caffeinated beverages and excessive intake of alcohol at night.

, Constipation can place pressure on your bladder lowers your control during the night.If your instances of bedwetting happen in conjunction with instances of constipation, then you should try adding more fiber to your diet, which you can get from leafy greens, legumes, and other plant-based sources.


You can find more information about treating your constipation by reading How to Regulate Bowel Movements.

, Bedwetting alarms can also help teens and adults who need to train their bodies to react to the need to urinate. A bedwetting alarm attaches to the underwear or pad on the mattress and beeps or buzzes the second it senses moisture, allowing you to get up and void your bladder before a full bedwetting incident occurs., Several medications have shown an increase in bedwetting as a possible side effect. Check to see if your medication regimen may be responsible, but always consult your doctor before you alter your schedule of prescription medications. Some drugs that may cause bedwetting include:Clozapine
Risperidone
Olanzapine
Quetiapine

, If you also snore loudly and wake in the morning with chest pain, headaches, and sore throat symptoms, then you may suffer from sleep apnea.Bedwetting is another symptom associated with the condition for adults who have otherwise had no prior problems with controlling their bladders.


If you believe you have sleep apnea, then you should see your physician for diagnosis and treatment options.

, If your instances of bedwetting don’t happen in coordination with excessive drinking or constipation, then you should see your doctor. Secondary enuresis (bedwetting in those who’ve otherwise shown long-term bladder control) is usually a symptom of another issue. Your doctor will want to run tests to rule out several other conditions, including:Diabetes
Neurological disorder
Urinary tract infection
Urinary tract stones
Prostate enlargement/cancer
Bladder cancer
Anxiety or emotional disorders

, You can look into several medication options to help control adult bedwetting. Ask your doctor which option might be best for your specific case during your consultation. Options include:Desmopressin, which causes your kidneys to produce less urine.
Imipramine, which has proven effective in up to 40 percent of cases.
Anticholinergic medications, which treat over activity of the detrusor muscle and include darifenacin, oxybutynin, and trospium chloride.

, These options are limited to cases of severe overactivity of your detrusor muscle, and they likely only apply if you have problems with daytime incontinence as well as bedwetting. Surgical options are a last resort. Your doctor might discuss:Clam cystoplasty — This surgery increases bladder capacity by placing a patch of intestine into an expanding incision in the bladder.
Detrusor myectomy — This procedure removes a portion of the detrusor muscle and helps strengthen and reduce the number of bladder contractions
Sacral nerve stimulation — The surgery decreases the activity of the detrusor muscle by altering the nerve activity that controls it.

Have a discussion with them regarding the matter.,
Tell them step-by-step what the diapering process entails.,
Know what prefold your going to use.,
When diapering, have them sit in the middle of the diaper and pin them on.",How to Pin a Cloth Diaper on an Older Bedwetting Child1," It's very likely an older child will be embarrassed about their parents and older siblings being involved in private matters such as these, as children get older they become more skittish about their older siblings and parents helping out with personal hygiene such as bathing, getting dressed, and other things along these lines. Before the diapers are put on for the first time, it would be a good idea to have this conversation with the child or children a few days beforehand, such as after the diapers and plastic pants are ordered, that way they are prepared. The parents can put their mind at ease and let them know that in some cases even incontinent adults need assistance diapering themselves for various reasons.


Let the child know that the reason you're diapering them (as well as their older siblings if you decide to have them help out too) is that using safety pins can be somewhat tricky—it can be difficult using the pins and there is the potential for sticking one's self. Tell them that over time they'll be able to do this on their own.

, Tell them what to expect when the parent or sister puts the diapers on them - and do it some hours before their first diapering.Tell them also how they can cooperate to make their diapering as easy as possible. Let them see and touch the cloth diapers and plastic pants they are going to wear and let them ask any questions they may have and listen to their concerns.

, There are a couple of prefolds that are easiest to use for pin-on style diapers—the “angel wing” fold and the “newspaper” fold. For parents new to using safety pins these seem like the most hassle free methods. Each of the methods are described below.

, The child needs to be positioned so the child has enough padding in both the front and back.

Lose weight if you're too heavy.,
Use moist heat for osteoarthritis.,
Use cold therapy for inflammatory arthritis.,
Take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).,
Get regular exercise.,

Consider taking glucosamine and chondroitin supplements.,
Get stronger prescription medications from your doctor.,
Ask your doctor about steroid injections.,
Consider infrared therapy.,
Try acupuncture treatments.,
Consider surgery as a last resort.",How to Treat Arthritis in the Knees," As a general rule, people who are overweight or obese suffer more arthritis because of the increased amount of pressure on their joints — especially weight-bearing joints such as the knees, hips and low back.Furthermore, overweight people are more likely to have flat feet and fallen arches, which promotes ""knock knees"" (also called genu valgum). Genu varum is hard on knee joints because it causes misalignment of the thigh (femur) and shin (tibia) bones. Thus, do your knees a favor by losing excess weight. The best way to lose weight is by increasing cardiovascular exercise (such as walking or cycling) while decreasing your daily calories at the same time.


Most people who aren't especially active only need about 2,000 calories daily to maintain their body processes and still have enough energy for some exercise.
Reducing your daily caloric intake by only 500 calories can result in about 4 pounds of lost fat per month.Swimming is a fantastic exercise for arthritis sufferers to lose weight because your body is buoyant and no pressure is put on your joints.;
, Osteoarthritis (OA) involves some inflammation, but not nearly as much as either types, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), gout attacks or psoriatic arthritis (PA). Instead, OA involves wearing out of the knee cartilage, formation of bone spurs, grating sensations, pain, loss of flexibility and stiffness, particularly first thing in the morning after many hours of disuse.As such, moist heat is a much better choice for OA instead of ice because the warmth dilates blood vessels (larger diameter) around the knee, improves circulation, loosens up muscles and helps to alleviate joint stiffness.


Apply moist heat first thing in the morning or after not using your knee for long periods of time. Avoid electric heat sources because they can dehydrate the skin and muscles around the knee.
Microwaved herbal bags work well for knee arthritis, especially the ones that are infused with aromatherapy (lavender, for example) because they tend to have relaxing properties.
Consider soaking your legs (or entire lower body) in a warm Epsom salt bath, which can significantly reduce stiffness and pain, especially within the joint and surrounding muscles.Nearly 30 million middle-aged and elderly Americans have been diagnosed with OA somewhere in their body.

, Using cold therapy, such as crushed ice, ice cubes, frozen gel packs or veggies from the freezer, is much more appropriate and effective for inflammatory types of arthritis that involve severe swelling and redness.Cold therapy causes blood vessels to constrict (smaller diameter) and reduces the amount of blood flowing to an area, which helps to control inflammation and pain. Gout, RA and PA can all affect the knee and typically create considerable throbbing pain and disability — making it very difficult to walk and impossible to run.


Some form of cold therapy should be applied to your inflamed arthritic knee(s) on a regular basis, especially after any sort of exercise, for 10–15 minutes or until your knee(s) feels numb to touch. Start with two to three per day and increase from there if it seems to be helpful.
Always wrap crushed ice or frozen gel packs in a thin towel before placing it around your knee in order to prevent frostbite or skin irritation.
The best places to put the cold therapy is on the front and sides of the knee, which is close to where the joint space and inflammation is.
Inflammatory types of arthritis are more common in the elderly, but they also afflict younger adults and even children.

, Consider taking over-the-counter NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve) or aspirin for short-term relief of pain and inflammation.However, these medications can be hard on your stomach and kidneys, so it's best not to rely on them for longer periods of time — much more than a few weeks. It helps to take NSAIDs with food (on a full stomach), preferably non-acidic varieties, to reduce the risks of stomach irritation and ulceration.


Alternatively, some over-the-counter pain killers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) are effective for mild-to-moderate knee arthritis, but they don't reduce inflammation.Pain relievers (called analgesics) can be hard on your liver and kidneys, so always follow recommendations.
Pain relieving creams and gels applied directly to your arthritic knees is another option, and one that's better for your stomach. Capsaicin and menthol are natural ingredients found in some creams that distract your brain from pain by making your skin tingle.

, Some exercise for your legs is important because the muscles around your knees sort of act as secondary shock absorbers for the joints and help reduce impact. Thus, the stronger the muscles surrounding your knee joints (thigh, hamstring and calf muscles), the more stress or impact they can absorb or dissipate.However, not all exercise is appropriate for your knees — high impact exercises such as jogging, running, tennis and climbing stairs will make arthritic knees worse. Stick to walking and cycling, either outside if weather permits or at your local gym


Gym exercises that increase quadriceps (thigh muscles), hamstring and calf strength without inflaming knee joints include mini-squats, leg presses and leg extensions. These leg exercises should be pain-free and done with limited knee flexion — not greater than 45 degrees.
Some exercise, at least walking, should be done every day. If going to the gym is your thing, then aim for three times weekly.
Switch from high impact activities to swimming and water aerobics in the pool. The buoyancy of the water reduces the stress on your knees, but still works out your leg muscles.

, Dietary factors play a role in either irritating or helping soothe arthritis. Diets high in refined sugars tend to make arthritic pain worse, whereas diets rich in omega-3 fatty acids have a mild-to-moderate anti-inflammatory effect on the body.Omega-3 fats can be particularly helpful for controlling the pain of RA, but not for slowing its progression.


The three omega-3 fatty acids found in food are called ALA, EPA and DHA. Unfortunately, the standard American diet tends to be low in omega-3 fats and too high in inflammation-promoting omega-6 fats.
Fish, plants and nut oils are the main dietary sources of omega-3 fats. EPA and DHA are found in cold-water fish (salmon, mackerel, tuna), whereas ALA is found in flaxseed oil, canola oil, soybeans, hemp seeds, pumpkin seeds and walnuts.If supplementing with fish oils or seed-based oils to get omega-3 fatty acids, aim for 1,000 mg 2-3X daily for noticeable anti-inflammatory effects.

, Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are substances naturally found in all joints. Glucosamine essentially acts as a lubricant, whereas chondroitin allows the cartilage to absorb more water and be a more effective shock absorber. Both compounds can be taken as supplements, and although the research is somewhat mixed, the evidence suggests that they can be helpful for reducing the pain of all types of arthritis — particularly large weight-bearing joints such as the knee.Glucosamine can also increase mobility in mild-to-moderate cases of OA, especially in large weight-bearing joints such as the knees.
Glucosamine sulfate is often made from shellfish, which can lead to allergy concerns, so be cautious when supplementing with it. Glucosamine hydrogen is made from vegetable sources, but may not be as effective compared to the sulfate type.
An effective dose for arthritic knees is about 500 mg three times daily, but it often takes two to four months to get noticeable results.

, Make an appointment with your family doctor to confirm if you have arthritis in your knees. Your doctor will likely take x-rays and blood tests to confirm a diagnosis of OA, RA or other types of arthritis, such as gout. If the arthritis is causing lots of pain and stiffness, over-the-counter medications may not be strong enough to lesson the symptoms. In such cases, your doctor will likely prescribe stronger anti-inflammatories.


COX-2 inhibitors (celecoxib, meloxicam) are strong types of NSAIDs that may cause fewer stomach problems.They are commonly prescribed for OA of the knee.
Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are commonly used to deal with the pain and slow the progression of RA by reducing an overactive immune system.DMARDs include methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, etanercept and adalimumab.
Classic signs of arthritis on x-ray are: loss of joint space due to thinning cartilage and bone spurs that stick out from the femur or tibia bones., An injection of corticosteroid medication (cortisone) into a knee joint can quickly reduce inflammation and pain, and allow normal movement of the joint pretty quickly.Corticosteroids are hormones that display powerful anti-inflammatory properties and are made by the body's adrenal glands. They are injected by an orthopedic surgeon under anesthesia. The most commonly used preparations are prednisolone, dexamethasone and triamcinolone. The effects of the medications are short-term — lasting from weeks to months typically.


The number of cortisone injections you can get each year is limited because it can worsen knee joint damage over time.
Potential complications of corticosteroid knee injections include local infection, excessive bleeding, tendon weakening, local muscle atrophy and nerve irritation/damage.
Steroid injections can be relatively expensive if your insurance doesn't cover it.

, Using low-energy light waves (called infrared) is known to be able to speed up wound healing, decrease pain and decrease inflammation in a variety of joints, including the knees.Use of infrared radiation (via a hand-held device or within a special sauna) is thought to penetrate deep into the body and improve circulation because it creates heat and dilates (opens up) blood vessels. Furthermore, there are virtually no negative side effects of infrared therapy.


In most cases, significant knee pain reduction occurs within hours after the first infrared treatment, which lasts between 15 and 30 minutes per session.
Pain reduction ranges from 40% to 100% better after treatment and is often long lasting — weeks or even months.Health professionals most likely to use infrared therapy on joints include some chiropractors, osteopaths, physiotherapists and massage therapists.

, Acupuncture therapy involves sticking thin needles into specific energy points within your skin/muscle in efforts to decrease pain and inflammation and to potentially stimulate healing.Acupuncture is gaining popularity as an arthritis therapy and some studies indicate that it can relieve pain and improve function in people with OA of the knee.Acupuncture is relatively painless and has an excellent safety record — the only risks are local bruising and infection. It seems to be worth a try if your budget allows for it, as it isn't covered under most health insurance plans.


Acupuncture is based on the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, and alleviates pain and inflammation by releasing the hormone serotonin and other substances called endorphins.
Acupuncture is much more mainstream now and practiced by a variety of health professionals including some medical doctors, chiropractors, naturopaths, physiotherapists and massage therapists — whoever you choose should be certified by NCCAOM.

, If conservative home-based remedies and non-invasive treatments from your doctor aren't effective at reducing the symptoms of your knee arthritis, then surgery may have to be considered. Surgery should only be done in severe cases of arthritis where the knee joint is severely damaged and all other modes of treatment have failed. There are many types of surgical replacements, ranging from minor arthroscopic surgery to complete knee replacement surgery.Surgery is more common for advanced OA and not as common for inflammatory types of arthritis, unless the cause is clearly understood or the entire knee joint is destroyed.


Arthroscopic involves inserting a small cutting instrument with a camera attached into the knee to clean up pieces of torn cartilage. Recovery time is quick — a week or two, depending on the extent of damage.
Cartilage grafting involves adding healthy cartilage into a damaged knee meniscus. This procedure is usually considered only for younger patients with smaller areas of damaged cartilage.
A synovectomy involves removing the knee joint lining that's been inflamed and damaged by RA.
An osteotomy involves reshaping or sanding down the leg bones that form the knee joint — the tibia and/or the femur.
An arthroplasty is a total or partial knee replacement. The damaged cartilage and bone is removed and replaced by an artificial knee joint made of metal and plastic. This surgery is the most invasive and takes the longest amount of time to recover from.

Cover the diapers with a pair of plastic pants (or “rubber pants” as they're called by many people even though this is a misnomer).",How to Pin a Cloth Diaper on an Older Bedwetting Child4," There are a couple of ways to do this, you can put them on the child while they are lying in bed or on the changing pad—in this case you have the child lift up their legs and bend them in a 90 degree angle, slide the leg holes of the pants over the child's feet then pull the pants up over their bent legs, have them lower their legs, slide the pants up, have the child lift up their bottom, then slide the pants over the diaper. After the pants are put on, turn the child over and make sure the pants are completely covering their diaper in order to prevent the diapers from leaking and getting the bed all wet. Or you can have the child stand up, step into the plastic pants, then pull them over the diapers. Some kids want to put on their own plastic pants as it gives them a feeling of some control over their being diapered for bed.

Regulate sleep schedule.,
Regulate fluid intake.,
Take bathroom breaks.,
Buy products to help with prevention and cleanup.,
Reward children for their efforts.",How to Deal With a Bedwetting Problem1," Get your child on a regular sleep schedule with a consistent bedtime, preferably before your own. It will be easier for them to control their bedwetting if they have a consistent sleep routine. Make sure they go to the bathroom right before bedtime.;
, Try reducing fluid intake later in the day, particularly right before bedtime. Reducing fluid intake after dinner will help ensure the bladder isn’t full upon falling asleep. Eliminate caffeine from your child’s diet. Caffeine tends to increase urination and may affect your child’s sleep, which could make bedwetting worse.If you or another adult in your life is struggling with bedwetting, reduce alcohol and caffeine intake. These are irritants to the bladder and increase urine production.
Adults should also reduce sweetener substitutes, citrus juices, highly spicy foods, carbonated beverages, sugar, honey, milk, and milk products. However, you should still stay hydrated with at least 1,500 milliliters (50.7  fl oz) of water every day.

, To prevent bedwetting from occurring during the night for you or your child, regulate bathroom breaks throughout the day and night. Typically, children should be urinating four to seven times per day.Adults typically urinate six to eight times per day.To help make bathroom breaks at night easier:


Wake your child up before you go to bed, if they’ve gone to bed before you, for another bathroom break. Your child will eventually adapt to this and start getting up to go to the bathroom on their own.Using bedwetting alarms is probably the most effective therapy to treat bedwetting in children older than 7. These alarms use a moisture-activated sensor, which attaches to the child's underwear. A small pin-on battery-powered alarm awakens the child. On average, this treatment will work in 60 days; relapses can occur, but treating again with this treatment is usually successful. The devices that are commonly used, which are usually about $50-$60, are WetStop, Dry Night Training System, and Nytone Enuretic Alarm.
Regular alarms can be used as well. Set alarms for random times to wake you up at night, otherwise your body might get too used to using the bathroom at a set time.Keep in mind that this may be inconvenient if you live with or share a bed with someone else.
Leave a nightlight on in the bathroom for easier bathroom breaks for children.
Ensure the bedroom has easy access to a bathroom.
Keep a fresh pair of pajamas and a fresh set of sheets near the bed for easy cleanup.

, There are many products that can help adults and children both prevent bedwetting and deal with the effects of bedwetting. These products will help make cleanup much easier for you or your child, will reduce the damage done to the bed and linens, and will help reduce the shame of bedwetting.Waterproof mattress pads and covers are ideal because they're machine washable, protect the mattress and sheets from accidents, and are easy to remove in the event of an accident.Pull-up diapers for children, disposable adult diapers, and protective underwear for adults are great options because they're cheap, easily disposable, and absorb large amounts of urine while keeping other clothing dry.
Enuresis alarms are useful because they go off as soon as any urination hits the bed. This will wake you or your child up and stop the bedwetting from continuing. This may be inappropriate if the alarm frightens your child too much or if he shares a room with a sibling.Bedside commodes and toilet base risers make it easier for elderly individuals with limited mobility to go to the bathroom., Creating a reward system will help to reinforce non-bedwetting behavior. Reward your child with praise and privileges when they make efforts to prevent bedwetting, such as going to the bathroom before bed or getting up in the night for a bathroom break. Reward your child for accident-free nights or for nights when they help to clean up if they do have an accident.Keep it simple and highlight one behavior you want to reward at a time.
Choose a limited amount of rewards for your child to pick from.
Ensure rewards are meaningful for your child and realistic for you to give.
Use a sticker chart to stay on track. Give your child a sticker immediately to reinforce the good behavior. Keep track of your child's progress by placing the stickers on a chart or calendar. Once your child has earned an agreed upon number of stickers, he can trade them for rewards.
Avoid punishment or negative reinforcement of your child, such as yelling at him or taking away his toys after bedwetting.While you should reward children for their efforts in staying dry, remember that bedwetting is an involuntary process and child has no control of it. Therefore, child should not be reprimanded or made to feel guilty about bedwetting.

Reassure and support your child.,
Stop blaming and shaming.,
Encourage and involve.,
Encourage emotional expression.,
Deal with social embarrassment.,
Be understanding.,
Normalize bedwetting.,
Consult a psychotherapist.",How to Deal With a Bedwetting Problem2," Seek supportive counseling if your child is upset by their bedwetting. Know that bedwetting is commonly cured spontaneously after a child reaches 5 years of age. Also understand that bedwetting is an entirely involuntary process; the child has no control over the behavior, and so your child should not feel guilty or be punished. Acceptance of the bedwetting by a child's parents is important and may speed up the spontaneous resolution of the bedwetting., If your child wets the bed, do your best not to blame them or make them feel ashamed. If they feel ashamed, they’ll be more likely to keep wetting the bed and keep it a secret from you. Shaming and blaming can lead to lower self-worth and lower self-esteem. Acknowledge any shame your child may feel. Acknowledge any frustration you might feel. You can say to your child, “I know you feel bad this happened again, and this is tough for me, too. But it’s not a big deal. We can handle this.”Remember to praise and acknowledge your child for any dry nights they have.

, Encourage your child to be involved in the cleaning-up process after bedwetting. You can ask her to help you change the sheets, put her soiled clothes away, or rinse her soiled underwear. This will help her start to take on some sense of control over her bedwetting.You can say, “It’s okay, honey. Why don’t we get you into some fresh sheets and clothes and you’ll feel better. Can you help me make your bed?”

, If anxiety or stress play a role in your child’s bedwetting, encourage them to express their feelings. Perhaps your child is anxious and wetting the bed because of a recent transition, such as a move, a divorce, or a new sibling in the family. Perhaps your child is stressed because of bullying or teasing at school. Talking to them about these stressors will allow them to feel more comforted, calm, and secure, which will reduce bedwetting behavior., The shame and embarrassment that comes along with bedwetting is worse for adults and young adults, who might think of bedwetting as a “kid problem.” However, it’s actually fairly common for both kids and adults, and both kids and adults tend to avoid social situations because of potential bedwetting. Remind yourself or your child that bedwetting is fairly common, involuntary, and unintentional. If your child has siblings or guests in the house, put a stop to any teasing that occurs because of bedwetting.If your child is attending a sleepover or camp, help them develop a plan to prevent bedwetting or deal with it once it occurs. Encourage them to go to the bathroom before bed and have a change of clothes handy. Teach them how to use a waterproof bed pad in their sleeping bag or how to dispose of things like pull-ups. Let the adult in charge know about their bedwetting, so that your child knows an adult is looking out for them if they need help when an accident occurs., Be understanding if your child or loved one does not want to talk about their bedwetting. Especially be understanding of their privacy by not talking about the bedwetting in front of others.

, If you have experienced bedwetting yourself in the past, talk with your child or loved one about it. This will help them feel understood and less alone. Normalize the experience for them, as it’s something many children experience and many children get through with time., Hypnosis, guided imagery, and psychotherapy have been helpful in some cases where bedwetting is more severe or when there is significant anxiety related to bedwetting.Finding a psychotherapist who specializes in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy will help you implement behavioral strategies, as well as talk through any anxiety, shame, and unhelpful thoughts associated with bedwetting."

Consult a physician.,
Keep a log.,
Take medications.,
Consider surgery.",How to Deal With a Bedwetting Problem3," You or your child could be suffering from a medical or mental health condition that’s contributing to bedwetting. These include urinary tract infections, diabetes, food allergies, anxiety, and ADHD. Make an appointment with your doctor to address and treat these potential underlying concernsMost children who suffer from bedwetting are “normal” physically and emotionally, but may experience a combinations of factors contributing to their bedwetting including genetics, a smaller bladder capacity, a tendency to sleep deeply, and difficulty recognizing a full bladder when asleep.Most adults who struggle with bedwetting do so because of a medical or physical cause.Some possible causes include:genetics, hormone imbalance, urinary tract infections, prostate problems, and small bladder capacity.

, Keeping a diary or log of times you or your child wet the bed will help your doctor narrow down the cause. You should include:When the accidents occur during the day and/or at night
Frequency of the accidents
When the bedwetting began
Type and quantity of fluids consumed
If bedwetting occurs just at home or in other environments, too
Other symptoms along with urination, such as pain
If constipation or stool accidents are also present

, Ask your doctor for prescription medications to help reduce or stop bedwetting. The most commonly used medication for bedwetting is desmopressin (DDAV). It is an effective and safe medication when used as directed. It's available as a nasal spray and in tablet, but it is not recommended for the children younger than 6. If the child responds well to the drug, the program is maintained for several months and then the child is weaned off the DDAVP. It may not cure the cause of bedwetting, but can control the symptoms. There are many different types of medications, some which reduce the amount of urine produced and some which relax your bladder. Consult with your physician to determine which would work best for your needs., Surgery should be the last thing you consider, as it’s a more invasive option. Consult your doctor and make sure you’ve exhausted all other options beforehand. Surgery options include:Sacral nerve stimulation, where bladder muscle activity is decreased.
Clam cytoplasty, where bladder capacity is increased.
Detrusor myectomy, where bladder contractions are strengthened and decreased.

Talk to your doctor.,
Get a medical diagnosis.,
Try topical treatments.,
Try systemic treatments.,
Take a new oral treatment.,
Try over-the-counter medications.",How to Treat Both Psoriatic Arthritis and Psoriasis1," Consulting with your doctor should be your first response if you detect any symptoms of psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis. They will be able to diagnose your condition and advise you as to what actions you should take to manage it.Don’t neglect to mention any of your symptoms to your doctor.
Your doctor will also want to know about your family history. People with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis often have a family member who also has it.;
, Depending on the nature of your psoriasis and/or psoriatic arthritis, your doctor might do a skin biopsy in order to learn more about your condition. This is a routine procedure in which the doctor will numb a portion of psoriatic skin, then scrape some of the cells away for examination beneath a microscope.Your psoriatic arthritis might also require closer examination, and your doctor might perform an x-ray.

, Topical treatments include creams, lotions, and shampoos applied to the skin that can relieve your psoriasis. These treatments contain either corticosteroids, salicylic or lactic acid, or retinoids as their active ingredient. Your doctor will help you determine which topical treatment — if any — is right for you.Corticosteroids are drugs that mimic cortisol, a naturally occurring hormone that reduces inflammation and immune system activity.Retinoids are a class of drugs produced using vitamin A. They enable better cell communication, limit skin cell production, and promote healthy skin.
Salicylic or lactic acid treatments are used to reduce the thick layers of scaly skin that build up over time due to psoriasis. These acidic treatments are often combined with moisturizing creams and/or corticosteroids.
You might also try a dandruff shampoo and mild soap to reduce unnecessary irritation of the skin.
Topical steroids can cause skin irritation if too much or too high of a concentration is used for too long. Always use the lowest percent that still helps the symptoms.

, While topical treatments are used to treat isolated, localized patches of psoriatic skin, more widespread or persistent cases of psoriasis require a more aggressive approach. There are a number of drugs that could be effective against psoriasis. Methotrexate, cyclosporine, and biologics are the most common systemic drugs.Methotrexate combats psoriasis by slowing down the growth of skin cells.Cyclosporine, like methotrexate, slows down cell growth and suppresses the immune system. You should be able to see a difference in symptom severity after about two weeks.
Biologics are a class of drugs, not a specific medication. They are applied through an IV drip or an injection. Biologics are useful for limiting inflammation of the skin. TNF-alpha inhibitors are one of the most common biologics. They prevent inflammation of the skin and joints associated with psoriasis.Methotrexate can lead to liver damage, kidney failure, and flu-like symptoms. Other systemic drugs like cyclosporine can lead to ulcers, flu-like symptoms, high blood pressure, and increased chance for infection. Talk to your doctor if you experience these or other adverse side effects after beginning your treatment. Your doctor will probably adjust your dosage or switch you to another medication. Minimize the force of these side effects by exercising regularly and eating a healthy diet of primarily whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.
Systemic drugs are usually taken daily in liquid or capsule form. Consult your doctor for specific use directions.
Your doctor may give you oral steroids for flare ups or at a low dose for treatment. Oral corticosteroid treatment may cause several adverse effects. For instance, you might experience emotional instability, psychosis, anxiety, and depression. You might also develop high blood pressure, diabetes, and an increased likelihood for infections. You can minimize many of these effects with regular exercise. Working out 30-60 minutes each day has benefits for both the mind and body. If you suffer from prolonged depression, psychosis, or other disruptions to your emotional or mental well-being, talk to a therapist. Let your doctor know, too, as they might be able to put you on a different medication with fewer side effects.

, New “small-molecule” treatments can target molecules within immune cells that cause inflammation, reducing inflammation and swelling of the joints. Apremilast (marketed commercially as Otezla), for instance, can be taken twice daily as a tablet and can effectively manage swollen joints associated with psoriatic arthritis. These drugs are only available with a doctor’s prescription, so talk to your doctor if you’re interested in obtaining a new oral treatment.Similar treatments include ustekinumab (Stelara) and secukinumab (Cosentyx).Side effects of apremilast include depression and weight loss. Monitor your weight carefully and if you notice yourself becoming too thin, increase your caloric intake. If you suffer with depression as a result of taking apremilast, talk to friends and family to cheer you up, and let your doctor know. They might recommend you see a therapist, or dial back your medication’s dosage in order to relieve your depression.
Side effects of ustekinumab and similar drugs include an increased risk for certain types of cancer, swelling of the brain, fatigue, an increased incidence of infection, and headaches. If you have a headache, try an over-the-counter pain reliever like acetaminophen. Consult your doctor for advice on how to best deal with cancer, infectious diseases, and swelling of the brain.

, There are a number of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that can help relieve pain from cracked, inflamed skin as well as pain in joints afflicted with psoriatic arthritis. Common over-the-counter options include ibuprofen and naproxen sodium.Commercial varieties of ibuprofen include Advil and Motrin IB.
Aleve is the most common commercial variety of naproxen sodium.
Over-the-counter medications have few serious side-effects, but you might experience bloating or gas, dizziness, abdominal pain, mild itching, or nausea. If you experience any of these side effects, discontinue use of the medicine and try an alternative.
Take extra caution with regular use if you are at risk for, or have a history of, stomach ulcers or bleeding or kidney problems. Tell your doctor about any non-prescription medications you take.

Try protective undergarments.,
Consider using a mattress cover.,
Try an underpad or overlay.,
Try a bedwetting pad alarm.,
Try a wearable alarm.,
Consider how the alarm sounds.,
Know that with nighttime alarms, you may need to help.,
Try a daytime alarm, too.,
Use vinegar.,
Try a product containing enzymes.,
Explore combination products, too.",How to Choose the Right Incontinence Product for Kids," Protective, waterproof undergarments can limit the frequency of wetting the bedding and mattress. However, some argue that this may interfere with the child’s motivation to be dry. On the other hand, changing soaked bedding and pajamas once or more a night quickly becomes very tedious. For this reason, protective undergarments might be seen as a necessary part of treatment.Here's a solution to consider that embraces both strategies:


Purchase both washable, absorbent cloth underwear and vinyl pants. Cloth underwear is worn under the vinyl pants. This allows the child to be able to feel wet, while limiting or preventing urine from soaking everything else.
Keep in mind that different strategies may work for different kids or one might work better at particular times (such as when traveling or visiting others).;
, To protect expensive mattresses from stains and odors, which can be particularly difficult to remove, try a waterproof mattress cover. These covers protect the mattress from urine and can easily be cleaned and deodorized. What's more, they're relatively inexpensive—especially vinyl mattress covers.Mattress covers come in several sizes. Fitted covers fit the same way a fitted mattress sheet fits, with elastic to hold the cover onto the mattress from underneath. Zippered covers encase the entire mattress and zip closed for a secure fit that won't come loose from tossing and turning in the night. Deep mattress covers are sized to fit mattresses that are especially thick, such as pillow-top mattresses.
Protective bedding comes in several forms, all effective in protecting the mattress and/or bedding. With many products available, you'll be able to find one that easily fits your budget and needs.

, These can be used over or under the fitted sheets on your child's mattress—they are the same thing just used in different ways. These products are also known as “rubber sheets.” A waterproof layer is situated under an absorbent material to protect bedding as the absorbent material is soaked with any urine.The main advantage to overlays is that they can be removed and replaced by a dry one very easily. Since they're on top, it's a relatively easy process.
Some products are washable and reusable. However, disposable overlay pads can be particularly convenient when traveling.

, When you believe that your child is ready and motivated to stop wetting the bed, a bedwetting alarm may offer the most effective solution. The basis for the alarm is to arouse the child immediately upon wetting, prompting him or her to rise and finish in the toilet. When this happens repeatedly, the child is conditioned to awake when his or her bladder is full—before any bedwetting occurs.The pad alarm is positioned on the bed beneath the child; this type of alarm is not attached to your child's undergarments. The pad alarm may work very well if your child remains in one place while asleep, otherwise this type of alarm may not be effective.
Some alarms require 2 steps to shut off, making it more difficult to turn it off without arousing.

, Wearable alarms may be wireless, attached to the underwear, or even built in the underwear. Many of the alarm units are attached to the bed shirt to make it harder to ignore. That being said, some kids find the wearable systems to be uncomfortable, in which case, there may be poor cooperation on your child's part. Ultimately, wearable alarms have evolved to solve the problem of bedwetters missing the pad-style alarms.In choosing between pad and wearable alarms, take into account your child’s temperament, motivation, distance from your bedroom, and ease of arousal. The same principle applies for mattress products as well.

, All of these devices work by detecting moisture. When this occurs, an alarm or warning vibration is triggered. When deciding what to purchase, remember that a vibrating signal will not alert the parents, although alarm and vibration together may be useful.The volume of some alarms is adjustable. This may be useful for particularly sound sleepers or to provide a sufficiently loud signal that you can hear. Some of the alarm units can sit by the bedside, making them more easily heard.
Also, some products offer, at additional cost, a remote unit that can be located by the parents' bedside if they need to be awakened as well.

, A parent plays an important role in alarm training.If the child does not quickly arouse and go to the bathroom, the parent must promptly awaken the child. Eventually, most kids with uncomplicated bedwetting will start responding on their own.


Many children who wet the bed are described as sound sleepers, and indeed many are. This often raises concerns from parents that their child will not awaken when the alarm is triggered. In fact, at the beginning of alarm treatment, this is the rule, not the exception.
It is quite interesting that a significant portion of children who stop wetting the bed after using the alarm do so by sleeping through the night dry rather than needing to awaken and go to the bathroom.

, Most of the causes of daytime wetting have one thing in common: timing. The strategy of timed voiding is to get children with urinary urgency and incontinence to empty their bladders on a strict schedule that gets them to the bathroom before they have the urge to go. This also helps them to understand the feeling of a full bladder before wetness occurs.In addition, there are daytime alarms that attach to the underwear during the day to sense wetness and alarm similar to a nighttime alarm.


To optimize bladder training, a regular alert is very useful. At home, this can occur using an alarm clock or smart phone that can be set to multiple times. In school and while at play, consider an alarm watch that can be set to alert as often as is recommended by your doctor. Aim for 2 hour intervals if your child can manage this without the urge to urinate.
You will need to alert your child's teacher to the plan so that your child is allowed to use the bathroom when the alarm goes off.
Some children feel embarrassed when the alarm goes off frequently during the school day followed immediately by going to the bathroom. This may be addressed by using an alert watch that has the option to vibrate rather than give an audible signal.

, Clothing, bedding, and mattresses are very vulnerable to urine stains and odor. Dried urine stains can be particularly difficult to remove so the sooner the items are cleaned, the more success you should expect. And then, even with washing, the odor may return. One of the most popular home remedies to win this battle is using vinegar as a cleaner.To clean a mattress, blot out the stain as much as possible. Then slowly saturate the stain with a mixture that is 50/50 vinegar and water. Let it dry, and then flip your mattress over and do the same to the other side.To clean your laundry, add 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar to your regular laundry detergent and wash your clothes as usual., For heavily soaked or stained fabrics, or those with persistent urine odor, use an enzyme-containing product. If heavily stained or strongly smelling, several applications may be necessary.A large amount of fresh or dried urine can be difficult to remove from a mattress. After blotting as much wet urine from the mattress as you can, apply an antibacterial urine enzyme solution. It is important to add a sufficient amount of the solution to completely saturate the involved area so that the enzymes and cleaners can penetrate the urine completely.

, There also are products that combine detergents, stain removers, and enzymes as a single solution. These include OdorZyme, DP (de-pee) Stain & Odor Remover, Kids ‘N Pets Stain and Odor Remover, SCOE10x Odor Eliminator, and Urine-Erase Stain and Odor Remover.Using deodorizers and perfumed fabric softeners usually are only temporary, and the odor will frequently return. There are numerous detergent products that also contain enzymes for removing pet and human urine smell, breaking down the proteins in the urine and making removal easier.

Reduce stress in your life.,
Exercise regularly.,
Eat anti-inflammatory foods.,
Lose weight.,
Avoid skin/joint injuries.,
Take care of your hands.,
Be careful with sun exposure.",How to Treat Both Psoriatic Arthritis and Psoriasis2," If you have a high-pressure job, or are facing other obligations that cause excessive stress, take some time to relax. Stress could cause or worsen psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. If you’re prone to anger or other forms of emotional imbalance (including depression and anxiety) you should find ways to reduce your stress.Learn to recognize feelings of anxiety. You might feel as if an icy hand has gripped your heart, or feel sick to your stomach with worry and anticipation of something bad happening.
When you feel yourself getting frustrated or angry, close your eyes and breathe in slowly through your nose for three seconds. Exhale out of your mouth for five seconds. Remind yourself that your anger will pass. Repeat several times until you feel relaxed.

Use positive self-talk to work yourself out of anger, depression, or anxiety. When a negative thought comes into your mind — for instance, “I am not going to do well on this project” — counter it with a positive, relaxing thought. For instance, you might respond to a negative thought by thinking “I am going to do well on this project, just as I have on so many others before.”Get more sleep. Lack of sleep leads to higher levels of irritability, depression, and anxiety. Adults should get seven to nine hours of sleep each night.

, In order to prevent and reduce the severity of psoriasis, integrate exercise into your daily schedule. Exercise can reduce the stress and anxiety that lead to depression and anxiety, and can help you reduce inflammation and pain in psoriatic limbs.For instance, you could walk to the store or to work. If you have low energy levels, try walking for just 10 minutes each day. After a week, start walking 20 minutes each day. After another week, increase your walks to 30 minutes. Continue in this way until your walks reach 60 minutes.
Try tai chi and gentle yoga for strengthening and stress reduction. Studies show that tai chi can improve arthritis pain, as well as increase balance and reduce stress.Ride a bike. Riding a bike is a great way to relax stiff muscles. You could ride your bike outside, at the park, or visit your local gym and use the stationary bike.
Swimming is also a great way to ease psoriatic pain or reduce stress. Water will help you float, making movement easier.

, Some people believe that eating anti-inflammatory foods can help reduce the swollen, painful joints associated with psoriasis. Foods with high levels of anti-inflammatory compounds — like cold-water fish, fruits and vegetables, seeds, and nuts — could produce an improvement in your condition.On the flip side, you should avoid eating foods that are known to increase inflammation. These foods include red meat, vegetables in the nightshade family (potatoes, tomatoes, and peppers), refined sugars, dairy products, and processed foods.

, If you’re overweight, you might be more likely to develop psoriasis and less likely to experience success during treatment. To lose weight, you need to ingest fewer calories than you burn.For example, if you ingest 1,000 calories each day, but burn 2,000 calories each day, you will use fat to make up for the extra energy you didn’t consume.
The best way to figure out your daily caloric needs is to invest in a quality fitness tracker to help you monitor what you’re eating and how much exercise you’re getting.
As you lose weight, you can use the fitness tracker to post your progress to social media. When your friends and family see all the effort you’re making, they’ll encourage you to keep going, which will in turn give you the energy you need to make even more progress.
Assuming you’re already exercising and eating a healthy diet based primarily of fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds, you’re on the right track. Add some lean protein (about 20% of your daily calories) like soy, tofu, and nuts.

, Some skin injuries can set in motion a long-term biological reaction, known as the Koebner response. The Koebner response could produce psoriasis long after you sustain an injury. For instance, sunburns, vaccinations, and scratches might result in psoriasis later.Be careful playing sports. Injuries to the elbows or knees — even if they are not severe — could produce psoriasis later. Always wear knee pads and elbow protectors.

, In order to minimize the harm psoriasis causes your hands, keep your hands as clean and dry as possible. Trim your nails regularly and clip any hangnails you might have. Use hand moisturizer and don’t neglect to work it into the webbing between each finger.In addition, you might consider wearing gloves in order to minimize the embarrassment caused by psoriasis.
Don’t bite your fingernails.

, Sunlight can help clear psoriasis, but you must be careful not to overdo it and put yourself at risk for skin cancer. In addition, sunlight can cause some medications to be less effective, while it can intensify the side effects of other medications. Talk to your doctor or dermatologist to determine how many times a week you should expose yourself to the sun and for how long.Sunscreen blocks the rays that can help psoriasis, but it also protects your skin from burning and skin cancer. Ask your doctor if it is appropriate for you to go into the sun without sunscreen for a short period — about five minutes — and then apply.
Some medical professionals recommend sun exposure three times weekly.

Look for swollen fingers or toes.,
Check for foot pain.,
Pay attention to pain in your lower back.",How to Treat Both Psoriatic Arthritis and Psoriasis3," Psoriatic arthritis might cause your fingers or toes to bulge and take a more tube-like shape. Some people compare the appearance of toes and fingers affected by psoriatic arthritis to sausages. The swelling might extend to the hands and feet themselves, as well as their respective fingers and toes.Note that there are other forms of arthritis that might need other types of treatment, such as gout, which can also present in a similar fashion.

, If you have psoriatic arthritis, you might experience foot pain where your tendons and ligaments meet your bones. The pain might be especially acute near the back of the heel or the sole of your foot., One of the common consequences of psoriatic arthritis is a condition known as spondylitis. Spondylitis causes inflammation between your vertebrae and within the joints connecting the spine and pelvis."
"
Look for patches of red skin.,
Look for a silvery sheen.,
Check for deformities of the nails.,
Monitor for irritation.",How to Treat Both Psoriatic Arthritis and Psoriasis4," Red, inflamed skin is the most obvious and common symptom of psoriasis. These patches may appear anywhere on the body and vary in size and shape. The red color can vary from a brighter red to a dull pinkish-white., The red patches caused by psoriasis are often covered by a rougher whitish or grayish layer of skin not unlike a scab. This second layer of raised skin is often referred to as a “silvery sheen” or “silvery scales.” This rough, scaly skin might flake off when rubbed or touched.If your psoriasis is on the scalp, this white, dead layer of skin might appear similar to dandruff.

, If you have psoriasis, you might have vertically-oriented striping or discoloration of the nails. You’ll probably also experience pitting of the nails – small holes or indentations in the surface of the normally smooth nail. The nails could become thick and rough. In extreme cases, your nail might become detached from the nail bed.These nail deformities could occur with your fingernails or toenails.

, As you might imagine, cracked, rough, scaly skin is also incredibly irritating. If your skin feels itchy and irritated as well as raised and inflamed, you almost definitely have psoriasis; however, no matter how irritated it is, do not pick or scrape your skin. This will only cause bleeding and further irritation."

The disease is most common in women over twenty years old and may be genetic.Common symptoms include enlargement of the thyroid gland, sensitivity to heat, tremors in the hands or fingers, unexplained weight loss, erectile dysfunction, menstrual changes, reduction of libido, bulging eyes, frequent bowel movements, thickening of the skin on the tops of feet, and heart palpitations.Graves’ ophthalmopathy can include loss of vision, light sensitivity, inflammation of the eyes, double vision, pain in the eyes, puffy eyelids, and exophthalmos or bulging eyes.
Graves’ dermopathy, while uncommon, occurs when the skin on the shins and tops of feet reddens and thickens.;
, These mental symptoms can include depression, anxiety, mood disorders, and sometimes cognitive dysfunction. Understand that even after medical treatment for hyperthyroidism these psychiatric manifestations may remain and the person may need psychiatric treatment, such as psychotropic drugs., People with Graves’ disease need to consult with a doctor or endocrinologist to manage their disease. Many people have success treating the disease with medications such as beta blockers and anti-thyroid medications. For others, radioiodine therapy or thyroid surgery are viable treatment options. People with eye symptoms can benefit from eye drops, special lenses for glasses, and external radiation to mitigate inflammation., Try contacting the Graves' Disease & Thyroid Foundation.

Ask them if there are things you can do to make life a bit easier. Urge them to be clear about specific tasks you can help them accomplish.


Try saying, “Ken, I know you get overwhelmed when you have to go see the endocrinologist. Would it help if I came with you?”
You could also say, “Honey, I know you’ve developed insomnia because of the Graves’ disease. Since you’re sleeping less, would it be helpful if I get the kids up in the morning?”

, More often than not being diagnosed and living with an autoimmune disease is overwhelming and can be frightening. It is critical that you listen to what your loved one is saying when they talk about the physical, psychological, and emotional manifestations of the disease in their daily lives.


Consider a daily check-in. This could be as simple as asking, “Kyla, how are you feeling today?” This allows the person a space to talk about their needs and day-to-day experience living with the disease.

, Physical and emotional stress can trigger the onset of Graves’ disease as well as disease flare-ups. Encourage the person to work with a mental health professional to come up with a plan for managing stress to manage and prevent flare-ups.Suggest the person seek the help of a mental health professional who specializes in stress management and has experience working with people suffering from chronic disease.
Sit down with your family member and make a list of day-to-day stressors and possible ways to alleviate some of the stress. For example, if washing the dishes stresses out your family member because of hand tremors you should offer to take over that task.

, The psychiatric manifestations of Graves’ disease can be severe. Oftentimes patients need psychological and/or psychiatric help as they navigate these symptoms. Urge them to make an appointment with a mental health professional like a psychologist or psychiatrist.


Encourage the person to contact their health insurance company to find out what mental health services are covered by their insurance plan.

If the smell of the liquid on the bed is really strong, you can add vinegar to the wash. The vinegar will help to remove the smell.If you are worried about the liquid staining the sheets, you can run the spot under hot water with a few dabs of laundry detergent. Then, wash the sheets as normal.

, Take the sheets out of the washer and smell them. If the odor is gone, put the sheets in the dryer on a gentle cycle. If the odor is still present, wash the sheets again using vinegar. Then, put the sheets in the dryer., Soak up as much of the excess liquid as you can on the mattress by blotting it with a clean towel or cloth. Blot the liquid until there is very little left on the surface of the mattress.Do not rub the mattress to remove the liquid, as this will just make the liquid absorb more into the mattress.

, Take a few teaspoons of baking soda and sprinkle it on the mattress. Let it sit on the mattress for a few minutes. The baking soda will help to absorb any remaining liquid on the mattress and remove odor.After the baking soda has been on the mattress for a few minutes, vacuum it up.

, Use an all-purpose cleaner for fabric on the mattress. You can also make your own cleaner by combining one part warm water and one part white vinegar. Spray the cleaner on the mattress and let it sit for three to five minutes.Make sure you cover all of the wet areas on the mattress with the cleaner. You can apply several layers of the cleaner to the mattress if the smell is strong.

, Use a dry towel or cloth to blot the mattress once the cleaner has been absorbed. Blot the entire mattress well. This will prevent mold in the mattress and ensure the mattress is as dry as possible., Sprinkle the mattress one more time with the baking soda. Then, let the mattress air dry for at least 18 hours. This will ensure the mattress has time to completely dry.You may need to sleep somewhere else for the night if you were planning on sleeping on the mattress. Do not try to sleep on the mattress until it is completely dry.

, Once the mattress has time to dry, use a vacuum to clean up the baking soda. You can then put the mattress outside or in an area with good ventilation in your home. This will allow any remaining smell to fade away.

Touch the mattress to confirm it is dry before you use it again. You can also smell the mattress to confirm the smell is gone.

, To protect the bed in the future, invest in a mattress cover made of plastic. The mattress cover will sit over the mattress and prevent liquid from absorbing into the mattress. You can find plastic mattress covers at your local hardware store or online., If you do not like the sound or feel of a plastic cover, you can get a washable protector made of breathable fabrics. The protector can then fit over the mattress and be washed in the washing machine when needed. Look for washable protectors for the bed at your local hardware store or online., Get bedding that is easy to wash and maintain, especially if there is a chance the bed will get wet in the future. Bedding made of cotton is easy to clean and does not hold stains. You may invest in a few sets of bedding that is easy to wash so you can rotate them as needed."

Make a plan.,
Treat acute symptoms.,
Work toward recovery.",How to Treat Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)1," Physical/occupational therapy is a highly personalized and highly effective form of a treatment and recovery for CIDP. In order for it to work for you, it is essential to have a long-term plan with a dedicated therapist (or therapists).This plan should include:


Treating acute symptoms.
Moving through recovery (step-by-step).
Physical therapy practice for home.;
, While you are still experiencing the “acute stage” of the disease (meaning that symptoms are still worsening), you may have very little mobility. You may not be able to tolerate much active movement. Physical therapy can still play a role.During this phase, physical/occupational therapists can:


Help you to sit, stand, and move in ways that will cause the least amount of pain.
Perform gentle, passive range-of-motion exercises on you to minimize atrophy.
Introduce breathing exercises that can help with the pain.

, As a you begin to recover motor control and sensation, physical therapy can become less passive, and more active (or active-assisted). In this phase, physical/occupational therapists can help you to slowly strengthen your muscles and stretch your tendons. Through the help of physical therapy, may patients make full recoveries.During this phase, physical/occupational therapists can:


Expand your activities gradually.
Increase repetitions before increasing intensity.
Teach you energy conservation techniques.

Ask your doctor if a medication-based treatment is right for you.,
Take corticosteroids.,
Try intravenous immunoglobulin therapy.,
Undergo plasmapheresis.",How to Treat Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)2," For some patients, the symptoms of CIDP are mild and manageable without medications. Talk to your doctor about whether you might benefit from medications, or if your CIDP can be managed with physical therapy alone., Corticosteriods, such as prednisone, are often the first treatment offered to people with CIDP. This medication may be given by mouth daily, or injected monthly, with doses decreasing over time.It can take 5-8 weeks to see improvements with steroid medication.
Corticosteroids have been shown to improve coordination, strength, and speed.
Side effects include irritability and weight gain.

, Intravenous immunoglobulin (or IVIg) is a sterile solution of antibodies taken from thousands of healthy people, and injected into your arm. This solution is given via IV over a period of 2-5 days.Ideally, this procedure is repeated each month.
Side effects can include headache, fever, chills, rapid heart beat, muscle aches, and high blood pressure.

, Plasmapheresis (also called plasma exchange) is a procedure whereby plasma is removed from the blood and replaced with another fluid. This is done through a catheter inserted under the collarbone. Initially, plasma exchange is done five times (every other day for ten days).Benefits can last around 3-4 weeks (when procedure is not repeated).
Rare complications can include abnormal heart beat, salt imbalances, red blood cell damage, low blood calcium, infection, and/or bleeding.

Learn about CIDP.,
Look for symptoms.,
Undergo tests.",How to Treat Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)3," CIDP is rare autoimmune disorder that causes your body to attack its own tissues. In CIDP patients, the body fights against the myelin sheaths that protect the nerves, which can lead to nerve damage. This condition is closely related to Guillain Barré syndrome (GBS), but it is considered to be a “chronic” version.CIDP has a variety of forms, including:


Sensory predominant CIDP.
Motor dominant CIDP.
Lewis-Sumner syndrome (LSS).

, Symptoms can include both motor and sensory impairments that progress over a period of 8 weeks.Some of these symptoms may include:


Weakness.
Numbness.
Difficulty walking (especially on stairs).
Tingling.
Pain.
Fainting spells (while standing up).
Burning in the extremities
Sudden onset of back and/or neck pain that radiates through the limbs.
Dizziness.
Difficulty breathing.
Bowel and bladder problems.
Nausea.
Eye twitching (ranging from mild to severe).
Twitching or shaking in other parts of the body.

, CIDP can only be diagnosed by a medical professional. If you have been experiencing any of these symptoms, contact your doctor. Your doctor or neurologists will want to run a series of tests.These may include:


Physical examination.
Electrodiagnostics tests (EMG or NCS).
Blood tests.
Urine tests.
Lumbar puncture.
Sural nerve biopsy.

Invest in an air conditioner.,
Set up an indoor fan.,
Keep your shutters or blinds closed.",How to Stay Cool when You Have MS1," To beat the heat, invest in an air conditioner and set it up in your living space. You may get a cheaper, portable model that you can set up in a room as needed. Or you may invest in a permanent air conditioner that cools your home. Weigh the costs against your ability to be comfortable in your home, especially if you live in a climate that often gets hot or warm.If you find air conditioners too noisy and expensive, you can try getting an air cooler instead. An air cooler works by drawing air through water. However, air coolers can be less effective than an air conditioner, especially in humid climates.;
, Floor fans and desk fans can be a good, cheap option for staying cool indoors. Set up floor fans in rooms you use often. Have desk fans in spots where you plan to sit and relax for long periods of time. You can also use handheld fans to stay cool when you move or walk around.If you find being indoors really hot and uncomfortable, try putting a bucket of ice in front of the fan. This will then blow cool air into the space and make it easier for you to cool down.

, Draw the shutters or blinds and keep them closed throughout the day to block out the sunlight. This can help to keep the temperatures in your home lower and more comfortable. Then, open the windows at night to let in cooler air.Get in the habit of keeping your shutters or blinds closed during the day and opening the windows at night so your home stays cool and comfortable.

Do exercise earlier in the day.,
Take cool baths or showers.,
Drink lots of water.,
Have cooling foods.",How to Stay Cool when You Have MS4," To avoid getting overheated, plan your workouts for the morning rather than later in the day. The sun tends to get hotter during the day, making you more susceptible to overheating if you workout in the afternoon.You may create a workout plan where you wear breathable workout clothing and always exercise in the early morning. Set up a fan and a cool compress so you can cool down after your workout to avoid getting overheated.

, Make it a habit to take cool baths or showers during the summer months to avoid aggravating your MS. Try not to take cold baths or showers, as this can lead to illness. Instead, have cool or lukewarm baths and showers on a regular basis.Take a cool bath or shower before you plan to go outside on a hot day. This will help bring your body temperature down and keep you cool when go outside. For example, you may take a cool bath before going outside to garden or to workout.

, Stay hydrated on hot days by drinking at least six to eight cups of water a day. Put ice cubes in your water to keep it cold.

Keep in mind that age is the most significant risk factor for developing prostate cancer.,
Factor in your ethnicity.,
Consider your family history.,
Examine your diet as a factor.",How to Know if You Have Prostate Cancer1," Men younger than 40 have a rare incidence of prostate cancer, but the chances increase rapidly after 50 years of age. Statistics show that 6 out of 10 cases of prostate cancer are found in men 65 and older.It has been hypothesized that the increase risk with age may be due do DNA and anti-cancer protective mechanisms becoming weaker with age and thus more susceptible to cellular and genetic mutations. Mutations often lead to abnormal cells, such as cancer.;
, According to the National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society, prostate cancer is more common in men of African descent than in white or Hispanic men.Additionally, the age of the onset of prostate cancer is also earlier in black men. A study of 12,000 men showed that 8.3% of blacks and only 3.3% of white men were diagnosed when they were less than 50 years of age. Studies have also shown that black men also have higher PSA levels (prostate-specific antigen levels, which is one test used to determine a diagnosis) and more advanced stages of disease at the time of diagnosis.This may reflect a combination of dietary and genetic factors; however the exact cause is unknown., A positive family history plays a role in the development of prostate cancer. Having a father or brother with prostate cancer doubles a man’s risk for developing the disease. The risk is higher in men with several affected relatives.


For example, men who have the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations have a higher incidence of prostate cancer. The BRCA2 gene mutations seem to be associated with more aggressive and advanced stage of prostate cancer at time of diagnosis.Studies have shown that certain mutations in inherited genes may potentially raise the risk for prostate cancer but accounts for a small fraction of cases.

, Men with diets high in animal fat may be at slightly higher risk of developing prostate cancer. Studies have shown that excess animal fat, especially from red meat and high-fat dairy, can stimulate the growth of prostate cancer.A diet low in fruits and vegetables may also increase risk for developing prostate cancer."

Don’t rely on symptoms alone.,
Look for decreased urination force and speed.,
Pay attention to more frequent urination.,
Look for blood in your semen.,
Note any new pain in the lower back, hips, or thighs.",How to Know if You Have Prostate Cancer2," While symptoms do accompany some stages of prostate cancer, there are almost no symptoms in the early stages. Consult your doctor concerning your risk factors to determine the best screening regimen for you. If you do experience any of the following symptoms, it is very important to schedule an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible.

, Several prostate cancer symptoms are tied to urination. You may notice that no matter what you do, you urinate more slowly and with decreased force. You may also experience burning while urinating dor similar reasons.


The urethra (a tube that carries urine from your bladder through your penis) passes through the center of the prostate gland. Tumor growth enlarges your prostate enlarges, which then presses on the urethra. This results in a weak urine stream and inability to start and stop urinating quickly.Obstructive symptoms usually indicate significant progression of the disease. Symptoms of urinary obstruction can also increase the likelihood that the cancer has metastasized to the bones or lymph nodes., You may find yourself getting up several times during the night to urinate. Tumor growth can constrict your urethra, which makes it more difficult to empty your bladder completely. The urethral compression also causes the bladder to fill more easily, additionally causing the urge for frequent urination., Semen passes along a series of tubes and structures on the way to the urethra for ejaculation. The pressure from a growing tumor can cause blood vessels along this path to break and leak blood into your semen. You will notice a pink color or bright red blood in your semen (which is normally a milky white color)., This is usually a “bony pain” that feels deep and throbs, often for no apparent reason. You may find it starts randomly and is difficult to relieve.


This type of pain may indicate metastatic prostate cancer meaning that the cancer has spread into your bones. The pain is a result of the cancer spreading into the spine and pressing on your spinal nerves.The tumor may be big enough to compress the nerves of the spinal cord, which can cause numbness.

Learn the screening guidelines.,
Consider getting screened based on your age.,
See your doctor.,
Consult your doctor about other test options.,
Consider your Gleason score.",How to Know if You Have Prostate Cancer3," Different organizations (American Cancer Society, American Urological Association, American College of Physicians, etc.) differ in their screening recommendations. While some recommend yearly screenings after a certain age, the CDC does not recommend PSA-based screening in men unless they have symptoms.The most important factors in prostate cancer screening for the individual rely on personal, informed decision making.

, While different medical organizations have differing opinions on when and how to be screened for prostate cancer, it is generally a good idea to consider screening at:40 years of age for the highest risk individuals — Men at the highest risk have more than one immediate family member who has been diagnosed with prostate cancer at a relatively early age.
45 years old for those with high risk — This population generally includes African American men and individuals with one close relative (father, son, or sibling) who has been previously diagnosed with prostate cancer before the age of 65.
50 years old for men with an average risk — Average risk is essentially all other men. Note that this only applies to those with a life expectancy beyond the next 10 years due to the slow-spreading nature of prostate cancer.

, While you may be able to identify symptoms that suggest prostate cancer, only your doctor will be able to accurately diagnose the disease. If you have symptoms and risk factors for prostate cancer, your doctor will initially perform two tests and weigh the results along with your symptoms (if any) to determine the next step. These initial tests include:A digital rectal exam (DRE), which is where your doctor inserts his finger into your rectum and presses on your prostate to feel for abnormalities relating to size, firmness, and/or texture.
A prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level test, which measures a protein made by the prostate. This involves drawing blood to check your PSA levels. In general, a PSA under 5 ng/mL is considered normal, and a PSA above 10 ng/mL indicates a risk of cancer. However, a high PSA level may also indicate non-cancerous conditions such as infection or inflammation.
A continuous rise in PSA level may indicate prostate cancer., Your doctor may also order a biopsy with an ultrasound probe. This means taking a small tissue sample from your prostate, which a lab will examine for cancer cells.MRI and PET/CT scans may also be used to evaluate the stage of your cancer. These imaging devices help determine the size of your prostate and the metabolic activity of the prostate (cancer cells are metabolically more active than normal cells and therefore can be detected by PET scan). These scans may be able to detect any metastatic lesions as well.

, Pathologists grade prostate cancer using the Gleason score. The grade indicates the cancer’s appearance and how quickly it is growing. The pathologist will grade on a scale of 1 – 5. 1 means the cancer tissue looks very much like normal prostate tissue, and 5 means the cells are abnormal and scattered throughout the prostate, indicating an advanced stage and aggressive cancer.The higher the Gleason score, the more likely that the cancer will grow and spread quickly. Based on this number, your doctor will know which type of treatment to pursue."
"
Ask your doctor for a prognosis.,
Look into a radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer.,
Ask your doctor about radiation therapy for locally invasive prostate cancer.,
Consider options for metastatic prostate cancer.",How to Know if You Have Prostate Cancer4," Generally, if the disease is localized to the prostate, it is curable. If the cancer is susceptible to hormone treatments, the prognosis is considered to be favorable. The three-year survival rate for prostate cancer is 100% for local invasion, 99.1% for regional invasion, and 33.1% for distant metastasis., If the cancer is only in the prostate, it can generally be treated with a radical prostatectomy, which means surgically removing the prostate.For older males with a life expectancy of less than ten years who have not displayed symptoms, it may be advisable to observe the condition before committing to surgery. This is because surgery on the prostate can cause additional complications that include urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction., For prostate cancer that has progressed beyond the prostate to local regions of the body, radiation therapy is usually prescribed. In addition, deprivation of androgens (hormones that maintain male characteristics) may help to decrease the spread of the disease. When the prostate cancer has become locally invasive, treatment aims to decrease the spread of the cancer., Once the prostate cancer has invaded other parts of the body, treatment regimens will usually entail reducing the amount of testosterone produced in the body, which can be a more radical approach to reducing androgens than with locally invasive disease.Anti-androgens — These medications will aim to block androgens from expressing their effects on the proper hormonal tissue receptors in the body to reduce testosterone production.GnRH antagonists — These medications will bind to receptors in the pituitary gland and help to suppress the production of testosterone.
Luteinizing hormone-releasing agonists — These medications will also affect the androgen producing pathways of your body to reduce testosterone.
Orchiectomy — This procedure calls for the complete removal of the testes. This is usually reserved for patients who are non-compliant with their medications."

Keep a journal.,
Pursue your interests and hobbies.,
Remind yourself that each day is important.,
Surround yourself with positive people.,
Stop negative self-talk.",How to Stay Positive when You Have MS1," One way you can keep your spirits up is to write in a journal. In a journal, you can write your private feelings. This includes any frustration, sadness, or happiness. Putting the words down on paper or typing them out can help you let go of bad feelings so you can move on from them and stay positive.Writing in a journal also helps you learn how to express your feelings. This can help you if you want to talk to others about your feelings, like in therapy or support group.
You can also create an online blog if you feel comfortable sharing your experiences with others who can relate and provide encouragement.;
, Sometimes, when you have MS it may feel like that’s all you think about. That can drain your energy and leave you feeling negative. Try to redirect your thoughts by pursuing your interests and hobbies. This helps you to have something you enjoy talking about, stay happy and positive, and ensure that you’re living a fulfilling life.For example, you may read books, garden, travel, or sew. Take up an old hobby or try new hobbies. Find ways to engage in activities and follow interests so you have something positive in your life.
If MS has taken away the ability to do your favorite hobby, find a new hobby that you can do and enjoy with your current abilities.

, With MS, you will probably have good days and bad days. On good days, you can probably do anything. On bad days, getting out of bed may be difficult. Living with MS means that you may feel some days that your body is weak and each step you take in a day is a struggle. However, remember that each day and each moment is important. Try to live life to the fullest each day to your best ability. Keep fighting and going even if everything, including your body, is against you.During bad days, tell yourself, “I want to live my life to the fullest. I want to create memories. I want to live in each moment.”

, Positivity can be contagious. When you surround yourself with positive people, your attitude will change and you will start to feel positive. If you surround yourself with negative people, you will give into that negativity. When you have MS, it is extremely important to find people who can lift you up instead of bring you down.This means you may need to let go of some people who feed your negativity. You may need to have a talk with negative people and tell them, “I do not want this negativity around me. I am focusing on being positive. Can you be positive with me?”
Try finding a support group that has positive people in it. You may also look for people at work who are positive instead of negative. Surrounding yourself by positive people can make a huge change.
You can also work on acquiring a positive mindset by watching or reading about others with disabilities who are still engaged in life despite their disability. This may help you see your situation in new, positive ways.

, It is easy to get into the habit of negative self-talk. You may get frustrated with your body and what you can’t do, and say things to yourself that are defeatist and damaging. To stay positive, work on lifting yourself up instead of bringing yourself down.For example, tell yourself things like, “I am frustrated because I am fatigued, and that is okay. However, I will not let my frustration bring me down or ruin my day” or “My MS is only part of me and doesn’t control all of me. I can be happy and positive despite some of my setbacks.”
Do your best not to isolate yourself; isolation can increase negative self-talk.

Reduce your risk with your reproductive choices.,
Breastfeed your children.,
Consider permanent sterilization.,
Maintain a healthy weight.",How to Help Prevent Ovarian Cancer1," Although scientists aren't sure why, you can reduce your risk for ovarian cancer by making certain choices about having children and controlling your fertility.


You can reduce your risk for ovarian cancer by having at least one baby. Studies show that the more pregnancies you have, the more you can reduce your risk.You can also reduce your risk by using birth control pills (containing both estrogen and progesterone) for at least five years.A history of breast feeding or hysterectomy may also reduce the risk of ovarian cancer in women.;
, If you do have children, breastfeeding is one way to reduce your risk for ovarian cancer, though scientists are still not sure why.Try to breastfeed for at least a year, which has been connected with a moderately reduced risk of ovarian cancer. Breastfeeding is also linked with reduced risk for breast cancer and is great for your child's health., While this is a drastic option, it is most likely to be effective. If you are over 40, done having children, and at a high risk for developing ovarian cancer, talk to your doctor about whether you should have your reproductive organs removed. There are a few permanent sterilization options that have been shown to reduce the risk of ovarian cancer by as much as 70 to 96%,. Your options include:having your tubes tied.
having your ovaries removed.
getting a hysterectomy.

, Studies show that women who were obese during early adulthood are more likely to develop this type of cancer, so you can potentially reduce your risk by maintaining a healthy weight.If you do develop ovarian cancer, being overweight can also hinder your ability to recover and reduce your chances of survival.

Apply vitamin E. Vitamin E contains antioxidants and will help your mouth sores heal.,
Try over-the-counter painkillers.,
Ask your doctor about medications for mouth sores.",How to Heal Mouth Sores Caused by Chemotherapy," The bristles of a toothbrush may aggravate your symptoms, so opt for an extra soft toothbrush. Brush after every meal, and before bedtime. This will minimize bacteria and reduce oral ulcers.It will also reduce the risk of the ulcers becoming infected.


Avoid toothpastes with alcohol in them, which could irritate your mouth.
Use a fluoride toothpaste that is otherwise as plain as possible — look for one without added color or bleaching agents.
If your mouth gets sore when brushing, soften the toothbrush with warm water prior to using it.;
, In addition to brushing your teeth, regular flossing can help with sores. It can cut down on bacteria, lessening the likelihood of a mouth infection. Make sure to floss your teeth every day.If your gums bleed, do not floss in areas that are bleeding. Floss only between teeth where the gums do not bleed. Check with your oncologist that this is normal — you may wish to speak with your dentist as well to confirm your gums are healthy.

, Rinse your mouth after you eat, and several times throughout the day. This dislodges many food particles and prevents unnecessary irritation. Stick to solutions made with baking soda and salt. Commercial mouthwashes may hurt your mouth.You can make a mouthwash using 1/4 teaspoon of salt or a teaspoon of baking soda mixed into an 8-ounce cup of warm water. Baking soda can create an alkaline oral pH, which helps sores heal faster.
After rinsing your mouth with your solution, rinse it again with plain water.

, If you wear dentures, wash them after every meal to avoid introducing bacteria or irritants. If your dentures bother you, you may want to skip wearing them until your mouth sores have healed., A dry mouth will make your sores worse; therefore, keeping your mouth moist is vital to healing mouth sores.Drink a lot of water throughout the day.
You should also suck on ice chips. In addition to keeping your mouth moist, ice chips will numb some of the pain from your sores.
Sugar-free gum and hard candy can also help keep your mouth moist by encouraging the production of saliva. Choose gum that does not contain menthol.

, When making food choices, do not select anything difficult to chew. This will aggravate sores, prolonging the healing process. Go for softer foods you can chew without pain.Things like scrambled eggs, cooked cereals, and mashed potatoes are good when recovering from mouth sores.
You can also eat other foods that are soft and moist.
If any food seems to be aggravating your mouth sores, stop eating it immediately. Avoid condiments, spicy foods, nuts or any other foods that might be allergens.

, Chewing too much food at once can irritate mouth sores and prolong the healing process. Instead of eating breakfast, lunch, and dinner, strive to eat four to six small meals throughout the day.It can also help to cut your food into small pieces.
Eating slowly can also lessen pain associated with mouth sores.

, Chemotherapy can make you feel very sick, but it’s important to try to eat plenty of healthy foods. Make sure to choose healthy foods that do not injure the soft tissues of your mouth.It's important to get a lot of fruits and vegetables into your diet. You will need the vitamins and nutrients provided by plant-based foods to keep you strong throughout chemotherapy.

, Smoking cigarettes, cigars, pipes, and chewing tobacco harms the inner lining of your mouth, and can also cause cancer and other health problems. If you are undergoing chemotherapy, smoking is very likely to produce and mouth sores and make them far more painful and prone to infection.Quitting tobacco can be very difficult, so talk to your doctor about a plan to help you quit. Your doctor can help provide you with things like the nicotine patch to slowly wean you off cigarettes.
You should also ask friends and family members for support as you try to quit smoking. If you know anyone who smokes, ask that they not do so in front of you.

, Some foods can make mouth sores worse. Sharp foods, or very acidic foods, should be avoided if you want your mouth sores to heal properly.Acidic and spicy foods tend to irritate the mouth, so stay away from things like citrus fruits and salsas.
Sharp foods, and very crunchy foods, should also be avoided. Stay away from things like chips, pretzels, and crackers.

, Alcohol can irritate your mouth sores and make your symptoms more painful. Do not drink alcohol until your mouth sores are healed. There may be other risk factors associated with drinking alcohol when on chemo, so make sure to talk to your doctor about alcohol consumption.As with smoking, ask family members and friends for support when tapering off alcohol. Request that people not drink in front of you.

, If possible, make an appointment with an oncological dentist before chemo. You can ask your doctor for a referral to such a dentist. A good dentist can help you take steps to get your mouth as healthy as possible prior to treatment.

, Ovarian cancer almost always occurs in women who are middle-aged or older.


Nearly ninety percent of women who develop ovarian cancer are over the age of 40, and the average age is about 60 years old., You are at a greater risk of developing ovarian cancer if someone in your family has had it, either on your mother or father's side. This might include your aunt, mother, or grandmother, or any other close female blood relative.In some cultures and generations, discussing cancer, especially cancers of the reproductive organs, may be taboo. If you think your family might not have told you about a family history of ovarian cancer, be sure to ask for information from family members who might know.
Hereditary syndromes include Lynch Syndrome, which increases the risk of ovarian cancer along with breast, colon, endometrium, and other cancer syndromes. Other hereditary cause of ovarian cancer are mutations in BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 this is the Breast-Ovarian Cancer Syndrome, and these mutations are under intense investigation by doctors and scientists as root causes of cancer.

, Certain medical conditions might put you at a greater risk of developing ovarian cancer. These include:if you have had breast, uterine, or colorectal cancer, or melanoma.
if you have endometriosis.
if you have taken estrogen by itself, without progesterone, for ten or more years; this can include Hormone Replacement Therapy.if you have a specific genetic mutation called BRCA1 or BRCA2, which is associated with Lynch Syndrome.

Explain the procedure and make sure consent is provided.,
Sanitize your hands and wear gloves.,
Reassure the patient / person and tell them to lay on their side.,
Apply warm lubricant to your index finger.,
Insert your finger into the anal canal gently.,
Feel for any abnormalities.,
Remove your finger and clean the area when finished.,
Get an anorectal exam if you have blood in your stool.,
Get an exam if you're a man and have trouble urinating.,
Incorporate an anorectal exam into your yearly physical.",How to Give a Rectal Exam," If you are a medical professional who will be performing an anorectal exam, then your first step should be to explain to your patient what the exam entails. Then, have the patient sign a consent form if they agree to undergo the procedure.


You could explain the procedure by saying something like, “For this exam, I will be inserting a gloved finger into your rectum to check for abnormalities. You may experience some pressure and/or discomfort, but the exam only take a minute or two.”;
, Before performing any type of physical exam on a patient / person it's important to wash and sanitize your hands because you don't want to transfer any bacteria, viruses or parasites to them.Using warm water with soap is usually adequate, but you may want to use an alcohol-based sanitizing gel also. Dry your hands thoroughly and then put on a new pair of nitrile or latex-free examination gloves.


In the medical field, digital rectal exams (DRE) are typically done by your family doctor, gynecologist, proctologist, or nurse practitioner.
Proctology is the branch of medicine that deals with problems of the anus, rectum and colon.

, Giving and receiving a digital rectal exam can be awkward or embarrassing for people, so acting professional and reassuring the patient / person is important.After explaining the procedure in general, ask the patient / person to remove their bottoms, lay of their side (typically left side down), bend their knees and place their hands near their chest — this is essentially the fetal position or on their left side with their knees flexed. Keep them covered with a gown or blanket for privacy and warmth. Place a protective pad under their buttocks as well.


DRE can be done with the patient / person standing. Women may be examined as part of the pelvic exam therefore they may be laying back with their feet in stirrups. Men are often examined while they are standing up, unless they are feeling nervous and then laying down may be more comfortable. Laying on their side is often more relaxing and provides better access to the anal canal.
To feel more comfortable, it may be best to have a DRE carried out by someone of the same gender. Man on man or woman on woman, a request for a nurse to be present is also an option.
It may also help ease anxiety and vulnerability to have a friend or family member present during the exam.
Position and drape the patient for warmth as well as privacy.

, As a courtesy and to prevent the patient / person from being too shocked and uncomfortable, make sure the lubricant is warmed up a little before applying some to your index finger. Even room-temperature gel can feel cool and cause the anal canal to contract, which makes the digital exam more challenging. The goal is to have the anal tissue as relaxed as possible, so inserting a finger doesn't become uncomfortable or painful.


Sometimes a rectal examination is carried out using a local anesthetic in order to numb the anal area and reduce discomfort. This is particularly true if the examiner has large fingers and the examinee has an especially tight anal sphincter.Electric gel warmers are inexpensive and can be purchased at medical supply stores. Alternatively, most gels and lubricants can be warmed in a microwave for 20-30 seconds.

, Once your finger and the anus is lubricated with warm gel, part the patient's / person's buttocks and slowly insert your index finger. It's best to ask the patient / person to take a deep breath during the insertion of the finger in order to relax them and prevent them from contracting their anal sphincter.To facilitate the insertion of the finger, slowly rotate or twist your hand at your wrist in a back and forth motion.


Right before inserting your finger, quickly assess the anus for any abnormalities, such as hemorrhoids (swollen blood vessels), warts, rashes or fissures (tissue tears).After your finger is fully the rectum, assess the anal tone (strength) by asking the patient / person to bear down and try to squeeze your finger.

, Once inside the rectum, use your index finger to feel for any abnormalities, such as unusual bumps, hard spots, soft spots or fissures.Rotate your finger clockwise then counterclockwise to feel the entire internal circumference of the rectum. You can also palpate the prostate gland (in males) through the wall of the rectum. Feel anteriorly (towards the front) for the prostate, which has two lobes with a cleft between them.


A healthy prostate gland is smooth to the touch and not painful upon probing.If pressing on the prostate gland hurts, it may be a sign of benign growth, infection or cancer.
It's normal to feel like urinating when the prostate gland is pressed / probed from the anal canal.

, Once you're finished with your assessment, slowly remove your index finger and examine the glove for the presence of any blood and/or mucus.Then clean off any lubricant around the anus and remove and dispose of your gloves, and wash your hands. Allow the patient to wipe themselves off in privacy with some soft tissue paper and let them know they can get dressed.


To remove your soiled glove, take your index finger of your other hand (which should be clean), place it under the cuff of the soiled glove, then pull down towards your fingers and peel it off.
The exam itself shouldn't cause bleeding, so if you see blood on your glove that could be a signs of hemorrhoids or another internal problems.
After the procedure, check to see how the patient is feeling, especially if he was nervous before the procedure began. Also, keep in mind that going from a laying to standing position can make some people feel faint, so encourage the patient to do this slowly and observe them for a few minutes.

, If you notice blood in the toilet when you defecate (poop) or while you're wiping yourself afterwards, then schedule an appointment with your doctor. If your doctor suspects you are bleeding from somewhere in your digestive tract (large intestine or colon, particularly), then they may want to perform a colonoscopy.Common reasons to see blood include hemorrhoids, small anal fissures and broken blood vessels from straining or wiping too hard.


More serious, but unusual causes for blood include: anorectal cancer or some form of irritable bowel syndrome, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease.
A normal finding means your doctor didn't find anything obvious, but an anorectal exam does not rule out all problems. Other tests, including a colonoscopy or x-ray, might be needed.
A DRE is typically performed without using any drugs or anesthesia because it's seldom painful.The exam only takes a few minutes to complete.

, Another common reason to get an anorectal exam is to check the male prostate gland for abnormal growth or tenderness.The prostate is a walnut-sized gland that secretes fluid during ejaculation that protects and nourishes sperm cells. The prostate is located near the bladder and in front of the rectum, which makes it easy to check during a DRE. An enlarged or inflamed prostate causes internal pelvic pain and problems with urination, such as dribbling and trouble initiating.


In men, a DRE is done to check the size of the prostate gland and to look for abnormal bumps or tenderness. Slow benign prostate growth is very common (but not serious) in America men older than 50 years. However, a malignancy is serious and further tests and early detection increase the chances of recovery. Go for yearly checkups or more often if you think there might be a problem.
If your doctor thinks your prostate feels abnormal, they will likely order a blood test and look for your prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. High PSA levels sometimes indicate prostate cancer.
Another test to help diagnose a prostate problem is a prostate ultrasound (transrectal ultrasound), which is often done in conjunction with a glandular biopsy (tissue sample).

, Instead of waiting for a problem or noticeable symptoms to occur in your lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract, get regular anorectal exams. Most doctors recommend adding a DRE to your routine yearly physical exam, regardless if you're male or female.Men should consider a DRE with a proctologist as part of an annual prostate screening exam, particularly if they are older than 40 years. An annual digital exam and fecal occult blood testing (a sample of your stool) is recommended if you are over 40 years old. Women should get these tests done in conjunction with their annual gynecological exams.

For men, a DRE is often done standing and bent over at the waist as it's easier to access the prostate gland.
Uterine and ovarian cancer can also be tested for in women when a DRE is done along with a vaginal exam.In addition to rectal bleeding and urinary issues, other reasons for getting a DRE include: a change in bowel habits, pelvic and/or abdominal pain, and discharge or bleeding from your urethra.

You may also have muscle weakness or pain. You should stop taking this antibiotic if you have any of these symptoms.

Ciprofloxacin: This antibiotic can help to improve your symptoms, including inflammation of your gut. It has rare side effects, including a tendon rupture. You are at a greater risk of a tendon rupture if you are also taking corticosteroids.

, Your doctor may also suggest that you try taking other medications like anti-diarrheals and over-the-counter pain relievers to reduce inflammation. You may take several of these other medications in addition your prescribed medication. You may try the following other medications:Anti-diarrheals: This could be a fiber supplement that you can buy at your local drugstore or a diarrhea medication if you are experiencing severe diarrhea. Though some people with Crohn's disease avoid fiber, your doctor may suggest a fiber supplement based on your body's reaction to the disease.

Pain relievers: Your doctor may suggest you buy acetaminophen over-the-counter. But you should avoid other common pain relievers like ibuprofen and naproxen sodium, as these drugs can make your symptoms worse.

Supplements and vitamins: Your doctor may also recommend that you take iron supplements if you have chronic intestinal bleeding to ensure your body has enough iron. You may take Vitamin B-12 shots to ensure you have enough Vitamin B-12 in your body, as Crohn's can cause vitamin deficiency such as b-12 due to malabsorption and surgical removal of portions of the GI tract. Calcium supplements will help maintain bone strength that could be lost due to the side effects of prescribed medications and malabsorption associated with Crohn's.

Keep an eye out for forgetfulness or difficulty focusing.,
Know about other common symptoms.",How to Recognize Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis1," Keep a daily journal and take note of the specific times of the day when you feel fatigued. Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms of MS, with 80% of people with MS experiencing fatigue and lassitude. Lassitude is a severe type of MS-related fatigue and manifests itself in the following ways:Fatigue typically occurs on a daily basis.
Fatigue is exacerbated by heat and humidity.
Fatigue onset can occur early in the morning, even after a good night’s sleep.
Fatigue interferes with daily activities.;
, One of the first symptoms of MS is numbness or tingling of the face, arms, legs, or body. If you experience numbness, consult a doctor immediately. While this is a symptom of MS, it is also a symptom of other conditions which may require urgent treatment.This numbness could range from mild to severe.
If you experience severe facial numbness, take extra precautions when eating or chewing, since you may accidentally bite your tongue. If you experience severe numbness in other parts of your body, be careful around sources of heat, like fires or boiling water.

, With MS, you may feel lightheaded or feel like the room is spinning around you. However, conditions other than MS, like a middle ear inflammation, could cause these symptoms. Consult with your doctor for proper diagnosis., The pain and distress associated with MS can lead to persistent anxiousness or extreme irritability.Depression is another common symptom of MS. If you suspect you may be depressed, be it because you feel down, hopeless, or have little interest in doing things, visit the Mental Health America website at for a free depression screening.

, These could range from blurry vision to pain when moving your eye to double vision. There are different management approaches for each of these vision symptoms, so check with your doctor for the appropriate course of action to take., MS can cause cognitive changes. These changes are the first symptom of MS for many individuals affected by the disease. You may experience foggy memory, difficulty processing information and concentrating, slowed verbal fluency, or difficulty retaining new information., Some symptoms of MS typically arise in the latter stages of the disease. These include muscle weakness and sexual, bladder, or bowel problems."

Prepare for changes in food taste.",How to Gain Weight During Chemotherapy," Since preventing weight loss is easier than trying to gain weight during treatment, keep an eye on your weight. Get on the scale at least three times a week. It’s easy to lose track of how much you are losing when you are experiencing the side effects of chemotherapy. Your healthcare team will look for trends in your weight. A 1 to 2% loss over a week or 5% loss over a month are causes for concern. Put another way, this equates to a 150-pound person losing about 3 pounds in a week or 7.5 pounds in a month.Don't stress if you do lose weight immediately after a chemotherapy treatment. This is normal. Your healthcare team wants to track your weight to determine whether or not you can regain that loss by the time you arrive for your next treatment.
While you're tracking your weight you may also want to record your moods, activities, how you feel, foods you eat and any exercise you get to determine what combination helps you gain weight.;
, Your doctor may prescribe a medication to treat nausea and vomiting at the time of or days following your treatment. Anti-nausea drugs are available as an IV medication, pill, liquid, patch or suppository.Chemotherapy treatments can cause anticipatory nausea and vomiting, which happens when you experience the symptoms of chemotherapy the day before you get the treatment. Or, some patients get delayed symptoms a day or two after treatment.


These drugs usually fall into the category of corticosteroids, serotonin antagonists, dopamine antagonists, NK-1 inhibitors, cannabinoids, motion sickness treatments, anti-anxiety drugs and stomach acid blockers.

, Because the chemotherapy affects your bone marrow and immune system, you are more at risk for infections. Fever and infections will reduce your appetite, making it harder to maintain a healthy weight. Always wash your hands carefully after using the bathroom, being in public, or around family and friends.If a friend or family member is sick and infectious, use caution or avoid being around the person until the disease can't be transferred to you.

, Before you start exercising, get approval from your cancer doctor, find a partner to exercise with, avoid using public facilities that have an increased risk of infections, and know that you should stop if you feel disoriented, notice sudden onset of nausea and vomiting, shortness of breath, irregular heartbeat, chest pain, leg or calf pain, bone pain, or unusual fatigue.A supervised resistance and aerobic exercise program is helpful for cancer patients, especially because too much rest will lead to weakness, muscle loss and reduced range of motion.Exercise will:


Improve physical ability
Improve balance and reduce the risk of falls and broken bones
Reduce muscle wasting from inactivity
Lower the risk of heart disease and osteoporosis
Improve self-esteem
Lessen nausea and lower the risk of anxiety and depression
Improve your quality of life
Improve your appetite

, Talk with your doctor about limiting how much alcohol you drink before and after chemotherapy treatments, since most chemotherapy agents are metabolized through the liver, just as alcohol is. If your liver is metabolizing alcohol, this can change the way in which the chemotherapy medication is used in the body and can cause drug interactions.This can cause liver damage which increases nausea and vomiting, triggering more weight loss.If you're dealing with mouth sores, you may notice that even a little alcohol in mouthwash can irritate mouth sores and make them worse. This will make eating more painful and increase the potential for greater weight loss., Your doctor may prescribe a combination of megestrol acetate (Megace), corticosteroids and anti-anxiety drugs to reduce your weight loss and prevent muscle loss. The dosage of each may need to be adjusted through the course of your treatment, depending on your condition.Other medications that may be considered include Oxandrolone or Dronabinol. Oxandrolone is used to promote weight gain after a trauma. Dronabinol is used to treat anorexia, nausea, and vomiting in patients who are undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy to treat cancer.Sometimes your lack of appetite or weight loss is caused by another treatable condition, such as depression, pain or anxiety.Your physician can help with medication or recommendations for behavioral therapy which will reduce your depression or anxiety and increase your appetite.

, Before you start your first treatment, make sure you have lots of pre-cooked foods and snacks you know you enjoy already prepared. Stock your pantry and fill your freezer. You should also ask friends and family to help you with shopping, cooking, and cleaning while you're feeling badly. Planning ahead for eating will make it easier to focus on treatment plans and regaining your strength.Talk with your healthcare team about measures you should be taking to prevent constipation.

, Avoid eating just a few large meals, which can make you feel nauseous. Instead, eat your biggest meal when you feel the hungriest during the day. Throughout the day you should eat every few hours, without waiting until you feel hungry. You should also include small snacks. Pack things like trail mix or whey protein shakes to make up the difference in calories if you can't eat a full meal.


Drink most of your fluids between meals instead of with meals. Fluids will fill your stomach and make you feel like you are full but without having consumed enough calories for that meal.
For example, you may find that you are hungrier in the morning when you wake up after chemo starts than after the end of a long day. In this case, make breakfast your biggest meal., If you find that eating solid foods is difficult or unappetizing, start eating soups or drinking smoothies to get your calories. Try to use protein-fortified milk when cooking or mixing up beverages. To make protein-fortified milk, mix 1 quart of whole milk with 1 cup of nonfat instant dry milk. Beat the mixture until the powder dissolves, about 5 minutes. Or, try some of the following soup and smoothie suggestions:For a tangy protein smoothie: Blend ⅓ cup of cottage cheese or plain yogurt, ½ of cup vanilla ice cream, ¼ cup of prepared fruit-flavored gelatin (you can use an individual ready-to-eat snack cup), and ¼ cup of low-fat milk until they're combined. Drink immediately.
For hearty soups, make sure to include beans or meat and plenty of vegetables. You might try making a turkey minestrone or chicken and white bean soup.
For a high-protein milkshake: Blend 1 of cup protein-fortified milk, 2 tablespoons of butterscotch sauce, chocolate sauce, or your favorite fruit syrup or sauce, 1/2 cup of ice cream, and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract till combined. Drink immediately.

, You'll need to add approximately 250 calories per day to your usual meals. This can mean adding a glass of milk to each meal, eating peanut butter and crackers or trail mix during the day, or a scoop of premium ice cream at night.You will also need more protein to help build muscle and cells. Drink a glass of whey protein each day to help boost your calories and your protein.


High-quality whey protein has a distinctive flavor which not everyone enjoys. The powder comes in a variety of flavors which can be mixed with milk or with water. Test the flavors with sample packets and the fluid you mix it with to decide which flavor combination you like the best.

, Research has shown that fish-oil supplements can help prevent muscle and weight loss as well as combat malnutrition.Fish oil high in omega-3 fatty acids helps to maintain or gain muscle mass. Krill oil supplements are also high in omega-3 fatty acids.


Omega-3 fatty acids are also found in walnuts and tuna fish.

, Chemotherapy is given through the bloodstream to kill fast growing cells throughout the entire body. This means it can kill the cells in your digestive tract, triggering weight loss. Losing cells in your digestive tract can cause:Mouth sores
Dry mouth or swelling in the mouth
Poor appetite
Vomiting and/or diarrhea
Changes in the ability to taste food
Fatigue and constipationDental and gum problemsSome chemotherapy drugs can damage the nervous system which triggers other symptoms that affect weight loss, such as stiff neck, loss of balance, severe headaches, weakness or numbness, significant pain, fatigue, and depression., Some tumors produce small proteins (cytokines) that can reduce your appetite and cause nausea. The location of the tumor may also place pressure on the digestive tract. This can make you feel full or create problems when swallowing food. You may also lose your appetite simply from the anxiety of dealing with the disease. This anxiety can trigger the weight loss.You should know that:Not everyone gets the same side effects from the same medications.
The severity of the side effects will also vary.
There are medications and choices you can make that will help prevent and alleviate some of the side effects.
Although side effects are unpleasant, they must be weighed against the benefits of treating the cancer.
Most of the side effects associated with loss of appetite and weight loss will resolve fairly quickly, over a couple of weeks or months. But, the time it takes to regain energy and appetite will vary from person to person.

, Weight loss reduces the energy and nutrients your body needs to recover. Because chemotherapy kills other rapidly dividing cells, your body needs adequate nutrition to replace those cells. Poor nutrition makes healing and recovery more difficult.For example, if your body must take protein from your body for healing this will also reduce your stamina and energy making cooking and eating more difficult. If you can prevent weight loss during treatment or gain weight after losing it, you'll improve the potential success of the chemotherapy.


Significant weight loss immediately before starting chemotherapy or during treatment is associated with an increased risk of poor outcomes.Research shows that patients who were able to stabilize their weight reported better outcomes., Chemotherapy can change the way food tastes, making it hard to have a healthy appetite. You may notice that food isn't as flavorful, tastes too salty, tastes too sweet, or things (like meat) don't taste right. Fortunately, there are several things you can try to adjust to these changes. For example:If food isn't as flavorful, add sauces, syrups, or garnishes to your food that boost salty, sweet or spicy flavors.
If food tastes too sweet, add salty or sour flavorings or dilute your beverages. You can also add things like yogurt, buttermilk, or coffee to balance out overly sweet things.
If food tastes too salty, add a little sugar to counteract the salt. You should also look for low-sodium products or rinse canned vegetables before using them to remove excess salt.
If meat doesn't taste right, try replacing it with another protein such as beans, cheese, tofu, nut butters, yogurt, fish, or poultry.

Avoid foods that can be triggering.,
Do not drink alcohol or smoke tobacco.",How to Reduce Inflammation in Crohn's Disease2," Though adjusting your diet cannot cure Crohn’s disease, it can help to reduce your symptoms and make recurrences of the disease less common. You may try doing a low-fiber diet so your body is able to digest your food properly.You may opt to bake or steam fruits and vegetables rather than eat them raw. This can make them easier for your body to digest. You should also avoid high-fiber fruits like apples.
You should avoid eating foods high in processed sugars as the sugars can irritate your symptoms.
You may also have food high in antioxidants, such as blueberries, cherries, and tomatoes as well as squash and bell peppers.
You should eat foods high in B vitamins, calcium, and magnesium. If you are going for a low-fiber diet avoid whole grains and have dark, leafy greens like spinach or kale.

, You can also adjust your diet so you eat smaller portions throughout the day. This can help you avoid overwhelming your gut and make it easier for your digestive system to function properly. You may try to break up your meals so you have five to six small meals a day rather than three large meals a day.You may create a daily food schedule and plan out your meals. You may try doing a low-fiber diet in which you eat smaller meals throughout the day to see if this diet improves your symptoms, including inflammation.

, You may also try to avoid foods that can trigger or aggravate your symptoms. You may try cutting out dairy products, spicy foods, and food high in fat from your diet to avoid triggering your symptoms. Some people with Crohn’s disease also avoid eating foods that contain gluten.You may work with a dietician to help you identify your own trigger foods and create meals together to avoid them while making sure you get all the nutrients you need to stay healthy.

, You should avoid drinking alcohol, as it can irritate or trigger the symptoms of Crohn’s disease. You should also stay away from caffeine.Avoid smoking tobacco products, as it can make your symptoms worse. If you smoke, you should try to quit.

Discuss your surgical options with your doctor.,
Understand what will happen during the surgery.,
Take steps to recover after the surgery.",How to Reduce Inflammation in Crohn's Disease3," If you have tried adjusting your diet and using medications to no avail, your doctor may recommend surgery to reduce your symptoms. Many individuals with Crohn’s disease will require at least one surgery, but surgical intervention will not cure the disease.Keep in mind the benefits of surgery for Crohn’s disease are often temporary and the disease may recur. Your doctor should make sure you maintain your medication after surgery so you have a lower risk of recurrence.
Your doctor should outline the risks involved in your surgery before you go under the knife. Depending on the type of surgery performed, risks may include infection as well as malabsorption, which is when your body is not able to absorb nutrients due to a malfunctioning small intestine post surgery. You may also be at risk of developing ulcers, strictures and pouchitis due to the surgery., Your doctor may recommend you do a resection surgery, in which the inflamed area of your intestine is removed and the gap is attached to the healthy sections of the intestine. You will be under general anesthesia for the surgery.Your doctor may also recommend an ileostomy, a procedure in which digestive waste is diverted away from your inflamed large intestine so it has time to heal. During the procedure, the end of your small intestine will be disconnected from your colon and re-routed through a hole in your abdomen, known as a stoma. The surgeon will attach a bag to the opening to collect waste products for a temporary period of time.
Depending on your symptoms, you may also need surgery to close any fistulas or to drain abscesses due to your illness. Your doctor may also recommend you get a strictureplasty, a procedure that widens a section of your intestine that has become too narrow.

, You may require an adjustment period of one year post-surgery. You may also have many bowel movements throughout the day at first. As you recover, your bowel movements should lessen.You may also need to chew your food well and avoid any foods that might irritate your stomach. Your doctor will likely recommend that you drink plenty of water every day after the surgery.
Though you may recover successfully from the surgery, your symptoms could still come back later. Your doctor should put you on medications to lower the risk of your symptoms returning.
If you have having trouble adjusting to the lifestyle changes that occur after surgery you may benefit from joining a support group. You can discuss your own sources of anxiety and troubles with other who have or ate having similar experiences. Ask your doctor about support groups in the area or visit Crohn's & Colitis Foundations of America at http://www.ccfa.org/ and United Ostomy Associations of America at http://www.ostomy.org/Home.html

This is known as scanning speech. You may also notice that you slur words or speak nasally, as if you had a cold. These could all be symptoms, however rare, of MS.A speech or language pathologist can often help overcome these speech problems.

, This is otherwise known as tremor and can manifest itself multiple ways:When moving. This type of tremor, known as an intention tremor, worsens when you try to reach for or grasp something or when you try to move your hands or feet to a particular spot.
When supported against gravity. For example, if you are sitting, you may experience this type of tremor, known as a postural tremor.
When the body is at rest. This is known as a resting tremor.
Jumpy eye movements. This is known as nystagmus.

, Acute episodes of hearing deficit have been reported by people with MS. However, hearing loss is rarely associated with MS, so consider having your hearing evaluated to rule out other potential causes., These could take the form of episodes of unconsciousness with jerking movements of the extremities, bouts of unconsciousness without jerking movements, or being unable to respond to external stimuli despite appearing awake. Seizures only occur in about 2-5% of people with MS."

See your doctor.,
Get tested.,
Review your treatment options.",How to Recognize Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis3," Make an appointment with your doctor if you are experiencing symptoms that resemble MS. Your doctor can recommend next steps and, if need be, make an MS diagnosis.


Don’t wait to make an appointment. Seeing your doctor sooner rather than later means you can start any necessary treatment earlier. This may help alleviate your current symptoms.

, Arriving at an MS diagnosis involves using specific tests to rule out other diagnoses. A diagnosis of MS typically involves blood tests to rule out other conditions and an MRI to obtain detailed images of the brain and spinal cord. Your doctor might also suggest a lumbar puncture and/or an evoked potential (EP) test., Different medications are used to manage the symptoms of MS, modify the disease course, and treat relapses. Your doctor may prescribe symptom-specific medication. To learn more about medications typically used to treat specific symptoms, visit the National Multiple Sclerosis Society website at "

What does he or she particularly enjoy? Keep the foods they crave around the house and easily accessible.


Some examples of calorie and protein dense foods are milk shakes, cheese, smoothies, pudding, chicken, eggs, lean red meat, fish, yogurt, ice cream, peanut butter, almond butter, whole grain toast, lentils, spinach and garlic.;
, Examples of high-calorie and protein snacks include:


Half a cup of nuts and a fruit
2 graham crackers or a slice of whole grain bread with natural peanut or almond butter
A mix of carrots, cherry tomatoes, cucumber or celery sticks with canola or olive oil based dressing
Popcorn trail mix consisting of 1 cup of popcorn made with canola oil and missed with quarter cup of nuts and 2 tablespoons of raisins






Low-fat yogurt with 2-3 tablespoons chopped nuts
1 cup of whole grain cereal with skim milk
Fruit smoothie consisting of 6 ounces of low fat vanilla yogurt, half a cup of skim milk, a cup of berries







, A major symptom of chemotherapy is having a dry mouth (xerostomia). Aside from it being important to hydrate, constantly drinking healthy fluids combats this symptom, too.Water, flavored water, coconut water, smoothies, liquid nutrition supplements, ice cream, sorbet, sherbet, pudding, fruit based popsicles, crushed ice, herbal teas, decaffeinated coffee and teas are all good examples of non-caffeinated beverages.
Nutritional supplements such as Ensure and Boost are good as well.

, Most of taste is actually smell. If you surround the patient with foods that smell good, you may be able to spike their appetite. The scent could entice them to at least try the food, or entertain the notion of eating.


What foods do they like? Mint, cinnamon, coconut, apple? Studies show that any connection an individual has between scent and food can get the appetite going and increase salivation., Prescription medications such as steroid hormones may be used to increase the patient’s appetite. A commonly prescribed steroid hormone is Megace (megestrol acetate) which is a lemon-lime flavored oral suspension taken by mouth (usual dose is 480 to 600 mg/day).


The dosage may vary depending on the patients’ needs and should be determined by his/her doctor.

, Eliminating or minimizing logistical barriers may encourage a patient receiving chemotherapy to eat. Grocery shopping or cooking meals may be difficult for a patient on chemotherapy due to fatigue. Offer to help out in any way you can to ensure they're eating properly.


Ask friends, family and neighbors to grocery shop for the patient.
Buy pre-cooked meals ahead of time and freeze them.

, If they know you are concerned and they know that it's best for them to eat (even when they're not hungry), they may eat -- as long as it fits into their schedule. Give them a routine that includes healthy meals several times a day. If you can eat with them, that's even better!


Have them eat 5-6 small meals a day, rather than large meals. This keeps their body functioning at 100% and to reduce chemo complications.

, A dietician can help you plan meals and snacks that will provide adequate nutrition to gain or maintain weight. A dietician will work with the patient to identify foods they like to eat to create a personalized “healthy eating plate."", A common side effect that interferes with intake of nutrition is nausea and vomiting. Nausea may be minimized by selecting bland, soft foods, maintaining fluid intake to avoid dehydration, eating six to eight small meals a day, and using anti-nausea medications.There are several anti-nausea medicines and the patient may have to try different ones to determine the one that works best for him/her. Commonly used medications include:


Ondansetron (Zofran), 8 mg SL every 8 hours, prior to meals by mouth.
Granisetron (Kytril), 2 mg once per day or 1 mg twice per day by mouth.
Palonosetron (Aloxi) 0.25 mg over 30 seconds intravenously.

Dosages listed are the most commonly prescribed and may not be suitable for all patients. The patient’s physician should determine dosing.



, These are the common symptoms encountered after administration of chemotherapy drugs. These have significant effects on the lifestyle of the patient. A patient may diminish food intake fearing these symptoms.


To combat diarrhea, eat a low-fiber diet. Reduce intake of food containing high fiber such as coarse grains, vegetable and fruits. Eat food like apples, bananas and lentils which are low in fiber. And be sure to drink plenty of fluids.
To combat constipation, eat a high-fiber diet. Enhance intake of food containing high amounts of fiber such as fresh fruits, coarse grains and vegetables.

, Dry mouth is the side effect of chemotherapy drugs. It is called xerostomia.This can have a significant effect on the eating pattern and diet of the patient.


Make sure the patient maintains good oral care. Use half to a full teaspoon of baking soda mixed in water to wash out the mouth. Don’t use commercial mouth washes having alcohol; the alcohol will enhance drying of the mouth.

, Intake of some of chemotherapy drugs will alter the taste buds. This, obviously, will make the patient want to eat less. However, it's incredibly important that nutrition intake isn't diminished. To combat this:


Replace your metallic utensils with plastic utensils.
Suck on lemon-flavored candy. This will keep your mouth fresh.
Add mint (or other spice or herb) to the food to change the flavor.

, Most of chemotherapy drugs have an irritating effect on the mucosa of the mouth. This will cause the development of mouth sores that are very painful. This pain decrease urges to eat. Again, adequate, healthy nutrition is necessary, so this must be fought.


Have them eat soft food which requires less chewing. This will reduce the time the food is in contact with mouth mucosa, reducing pain.
Avoid foods containing acids like oranges and lemons. Citrus flavor is fine, but the fruits themselves are highly acidic.

, Difficulty in swallowing is called dysphagia. It is generally caused by the effect of chemotherapy drugs on digestive system. Soft food should be eaten to help to improve the dysphagia.


Soft foods pass easily through the throat and food pipe. Food may be crushed or watered down to make it soft.

, During chemotherapy, nutrition needs to increase. Yet due to the decrease of appetite, intake of food decreases. This has a devastating effect on health. To counter this, encourage the patient to eat healthy food, ensuring that every bite counts.


Focus on energy-concentrated food. Food should contain plenty of energy per bite. These foods include foods like butter-added snacks and milkshakes fortified with crushed dry fruits.
Try some new food other than your routine meals. This can help you stimulate appetite.

, While on chemotherapy, the power of your body to fight infections is lowered. Due to this, it's important to pay more attention to food safety. Contaminated food will make you sick.


Wash the fruits and vegetables thoroughly before you eat. Keep them submerged for an hour in water before eating.
Don’t eat stale food. Throw spoiled food away.
Always try to eat freshly cooked food. Keep perishable food refrigerated until cooked.

Consider what type of surgery patients have just undergone when deciding what to include in the meals you fix.,
Understand how chemotherapy treatment generally affects the mouth, throat and stomach when deciding what meals to prepare for cancer patients.,
Select foods containing vitamin C, a critical nutrient for cancer patients because it helps regenerate their bodies supplies of vitamin E, improves iron consumption and helps promote healing of wounds.,
Serve plenty of iron-rich meats to cancer patients if they are able to chew.,
Maintain an impeccably-sanitary food preparation area and cook all foods thoroughly while fixing meals for cancer patients.",How to Fix Meals for Cancer Patients," The types of foods you include in cancer patients' meals will depend upon the organs impacted by the surgery and which foods the patients' systems can tolerate.


Post-surgery patients need to consume as many foods rich in protein and calories as they can handle in order for wounds to heal and to keep up energy for subsequent medical treatments, such as chemotherapy or radiation, required after recovering from cancer surgery.
If any portion of the digestive system was removed, consider serving only meals that are easy to consume and digest. This could include nutrition supplement drinks, whole milk, pudding, mashed potatoes and gravy, ice cream and other foods rich in calcium, carbohydrates and essential vitamins.
For patients whose digestive systems are compromised due to surgery, avoid fixing meals that include gas-causing foods and beverages including legumes of any kind, broccoli, cucumbers, radishes, peppers, soft drinks, beans and cabbage.
Patients who have intact digestive systems will generally be able to handle foods that are more substantial in texture. Their meals can include fried foods, those prepared with sauces and gravies, salad dressings and sandwich spreads like peanut butter and chicken or tuna salad with plenty of mayonnaise. Fat-free dressings and low calorie spreads are not appropriate for cancer patients' meals.;
,


The purpose of the chemo drugs is to kill the fast-growing cancer cells, but in doing so, it also usually kills off other fast-growing cells in the mouth, throat and stomach. Chemo generally makes patients' mouths and throats feel very raw, greatly affecting the ability to taste foods that were favorites before treatment. A raw feeling throat can also make swallowing quite painful, especially for highly-textured foods.
Foods to avoid preparing for chemo patients include anything that is highly acidic or too texture-rich. When the mouth and throat are already raw from treatment, serving citrus fruits or juice, or any food that is bulky and requires a lot of chewing will only make patients feel worse and potentially lower the appetite.

,


If patients are undergoing chemotherapy, there are still plenty of vitamin C-rich foods that are not highly acidic and still soft enough to chew or mash for easier consumption. These include cantaloupe, banana, cauliflower, sweet potatoes, cherries, mango and pears.
One easily-consumed liquid that is rich in vitamin C, pear juice, isn't nearly as acidic as citrus juices. Cancer patients may also find frozen treats made from strawberries and cherries to be appetizing and well-tolerated as they are low-acid, sweet, and melt in the mouth. Patients with a raw or sore mouth and throat may also find the coldness of the melting frozen treat to be soothing.

,


For those not dealing with chemo-raw mouths, beef or pork are healthy choices. Chicken and fish (especially highly-nutritious salmon) are easier for cancer patients to tolerate if their sense of taste and ability to chew are not yet back to normal after healing from chemotherapy because they have a milder flavor when prepared without a lot of seasoning and their texture is not as dense as other meats.

,


While cleanliness is always important, it is even more critical for cancer patients, especially those going through chemotherapy or radiation as these treatments compromise the immune system. A meal not prepared with sanitary utensils, cutting surfaces and cooking dishes could introduce potentially harmful germs into cancer patients' bodies. Under-cooking food could have a similar toxic effect.

",How to Diagnose Pancreatic Cancer," Being difficult to diagnose, it's so important to not ignore a bunch of recurring symptoms that are chronic/nagging (irritating):Abdominal pains and/or back pains
Nausea/digestive difficulties
Loss of appetite
Unexplained weight loss
Jaundice
(There is a summary discussion of symptoms before the ""Tips"" section below.)

, Why? When these tests were studied in connection with diabetes, a large majority of the participants found to have pancreatic cancer were also diabetic. It was reported that using all three tests in harmony significantly improved the sensitivity for results specific to detecting pancreatic cancer.Cancer marker testing can be worthwhile if you and your doctors have some reasons to suspect there are symptoms of pancreatic cancer. Tests are not conclusive, because some markers can be caused by several other problems.
Be aware that there is not one simple test or set of defined symptoms that can readily screen for/or detect pancreatic cancer.

, One of the first signs of pancreatic cancer can be jaundice, which is the yellowing of the skin, eyes and mucus membranes due to too much bilirubin in the bloodstream.Jaundice is associated with liver disease, although pancreatic cancer often causes nearby organs, liver and gallbladder to swell, which leads to dysfunction. Look at your skin and eyes in a well-lit mirror to check for yellow discoloration.


Jaundice also causes itchy skin, so be on the look out for that also.
The parts of the eyes that turn yellow are called the sclera (the ""whites"") not the iris, which is typically colored either brown, blue or green.
To confirm jaundice (if the yellowing is not so obvious), your doctor may test your urine for bile or order a blood test.;
, One of the first signs of pancreatic cancer can sometimes be a diffuse abdominal aching and soreness, although many people don't feel any pain until the cancer is advanced. The pancreas gland is located underneath the stomach and behind intestines — pretty much in the middle of your belly. It secretes insulin (for blood sugar control), hormones and digestive enzymes. If your belly soreness doesn't go away after a week, contact your doctor.


Palpating (deeply touching) your pancreas for mild-to-moderate swelling is difficult and virtually useless for doctors because the gland is positioned behind and close to other organs. Because pancreatic cancer often causes the liver and/or gallbladder to swell, which are easier to palpate and detect, the condition may be misdiagnosed as liver cirrhosis or cholecystitis.
Due to abdominal tenderness, fatigue and diarrhea, the early stages of pancreatic cancer can mimic infections, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and irritable bowel syndrome.

, Another early sign of pancreatic cancer -- as well as in most other types -- is a general feeling of tiredness, fatigue and weakness.This is because pancreatic cancer may block the flow of digestive fluids -- and also, cancer cells tend to use lots of resources, burn lots of energy and trigger your immune system to work harder. As such, the early stages of cancer can feel like you're about to come down with a viral infection, but without the coughing, sneezing, runny nose, etc.


During the early stages of pancreatic cancer, you'll likely experience unexplained tiredness in the evenings and lose motivation to exercise or even leave your home.
The fatigue and tiredness from cancer is typically not alleviated very much by getting lots of sleep.
Because your muscles aren't getting enough nutrients (glucose) and energy during cancer development, they'll likely feel weak and maybe even a little shaky with normal use.

, One of the main functions of the pancreas gland is to produce the hormone insulin, which shuttles glucose sugar from the blood and into cells, from blood vessels, to be used for energy. Therefore, when the pancreas is cancerous and dysfunctional (not making enough insulin), blood sugar stays in the blood and levels tend to be high.When your blood glucose levels get too high, you feel lethargic (tired and fatigued), thirsty, weak, irritable and tend to have more headaches.


High blood glucose is measured by a simple blood test. You can buy inexpensive electronic devices at your local pharmacy that can read blood glucose levels, if you think you may have an issue to check regularly.
Diabetes involves reduced production of insulin (or lessened sensitivity to it), but it's not typically due to cancer. On the other hand, pancreatic cancer almost always leads to diabetes at some stage.
There are actually multiple types of pancreatic cancer depending on what cells are involved (adenocarcinoma, glucagonoma, insulinoma, islet cell tumor, VIPoma).Some types trigger diabetes sooner than others.

, Another potentially early sign of pancreatic cancer is chronic diarrhea. Also, if your stool is clay-colored or consistently lighter in color than normal, then that indicates low amounts of bile.Diarrhea develops with pancreatic cancer because not enough digestive enzymes are released into the small intestine to properly digest food and absorb nutrients. Be concerned and contact your doctor if a bout of diarrhea lasts longer than a week or so.


Another clue that your pancreas is dysfunctional by not producing or releasing enough fat-digesting enzyme (bile) is that your stool will look greasy, smell worse than usual and tend to float in the toilet bowl.

, As pancreatic cancer progresses, the signs and symptoms tend to get more noticeable quite quickly. One of the first significant symptoms is moderate-to-severe diffuse upper abdominal pain usually described as burning or gnawing in nature. The pain may also radiate to your mid back (thoracic spine) area.The intense pain is what sends most pancreatic cancer patient to the doctor for the first time.


The intense pain can be caused by digestive enzymes destroying surrounding tissue and/or a growing tumor putting pressure on nearby nerves.
In addition to strong prescription drugs such as morphine, your doctor may recommend injecting an alcohol-based substance into certain abdominal nerves to block the pain — its called a celiac plexus block., Another more advanced sign of pancreatic cancer is moderate-to-severe nausea and chronic vomiting.The nausea tend to be fairly unrelenting as it waxes and wanes throughout the day, whereas the vomiting is typically on a daily basis — sometimes multiple times per day. Eating becomes very difficult and often keeping liquids down can be a challenge with advanced pancreatic cancer.


The intense pain combined with the constant release of adrenaline and other stress hormones tends to be the cause of the nausea and vomiting.
Chronic vomiting can quickly lead to dehydration and loss of electrolytes (mineral salts), which can trigger severe muscle cramps and heart palpitations.

, A number of factors may cause weight loss in people with pancreatic cancer. In general, cancer causes wasting away (cachexia) due to the amount of energy the cancer cells can burn. Furthermore, abdominal pain, nausea and, possibly, vomiting make it difficult to eat and maintain a healthy weight.If you're losing excessive weight (you'll probably notice it from your face and waist first), see your doctor as soon as you can to get it checked out.


Even if you can eat and keep it down, your body will have difficulty absorbing nutrients from food because your pancreas isn't producing enough digestive enzymes.
This is why enzyme supplements are often recommended for pancreatic cancer patients because they aid in digestion and help to maintain weight.

, Your doctor or an oncologist (cancer specialist) will likely order a series of blood tests once you present with any or all of the above-mentioned symptoms. Several types of blood tests are useful to help diagnose pancreatic cancer and rule out other causes of abdominal symptoms, such as: complete blood count, liver function tests, serum bilirubin, kidney function test and looking for various tumor markers.Tumor markers are substances that can sometimes be found in the bloodstream of a cancer patient. Two that are related to pancreatic cancer are called CA 19-9 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA).
These tumor markers are not elevated in all people with pancreatic cancer and some who don’t have any cancer might have higher levels for some other reason, so they are not really accurate indicators but are relatively cheap and non-invasive so are helpful in determining whether or not to test further.
Looking at hormone levels is useful as some (such as chromogranin A, C-peptide and serotonin) are often elevated in people with pancreatic cancer.

, Once in the hands of an oncologist who strongly suspects pancreatic cancer (based on telltale symptoms and blood tests), a number of imaging tests will be performed. Common diagnostic tests include: a CT scan and/or an MRI of the abdomen, endoscopic ultrasound of the pancreas and endoscopic retrograde cholangio pancreatography (ERCP).Once a test strongly suggests cancer, more detailed tests are done to see if the cancer has spread — this methodology is called staging.


An endoscopic ultrasound uses a device to take images of your pancreas gland from inside your abdomen. The endoscope is sent down through your esophagus and into your stomach to take the images.An ERCP uses an endoscope to inject dye into your pancreas, then an abdominal x-ray is taken to highlight the bile ducts and other parts of the gland..

, Once a number of tests have seemingly confirmed a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, a final procedure to be completely sure and to determine which cells are most involved is called a pancreatic biopsy or tissue sample.Biopsies require anesthesia and can be done in three different ways: percutaneous, endoscopic and surgical.


A percutaneous biopsy (also called fine needle aspiration) involves inserting a long, thin, hollow needle through the abdominal skin and into the pancreas gland in order to remove a small piece of tissue / tumor.
An endoscopic biopsy involves inserting an endoscope down the esophagus, through the stomach and into the small intestine to get close enough to the pancreas to cut off a tissue sample.
A surgical biopsy is most invasive because it involves making incisions into the abdomen and inserting a laparoscope to get a sample and look around to see if the cancer has spread.

, Since early signs and symptoms may be ambiguous, they are often not associated with the pancreas until the disease is quite advanced. Early issues include:Moderate abdominal and/or back pain
Nausea (not vomiting)
Loss of appetite (food is less desirable)
Unexplained significant weight loss
Yellow jaundice (which also causes itchy skin)

Begin treatment for mesothelioma.",How to Determine If You Have Mesothelioma," Most cases of mesothelioma have been linked to asbestos exposure. Asbestos is a naturally occurring fiber found in rocks, minerals, and soil.Because of its flame-retardant properties, it was used in a great deal of industrial manufacturing until 1971. Those who worked with asbestos were the most likely to be diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma. If breathed in or swallowed, asbestos fibers can lead to fatal tumors.


Asbestos is much less common now than it was in the early and mid-20th century because of the known mesothelioma risks; however, it can still be found in some products and older buildings might still have asbestos in the insulation.Mesothelioma can be caused by asbestos exposure that occurred 20 – 50 years previously. Even if you are no longer around asbestos, you might still be at risk for mesothelioma.;
, If you currently are, or ever have been, in a profession that might expose you to asbestos, your risk factors for mesothelioma are higher than the rest of the population.Professions that are most at risk for asbestos exposure include:Construction work
Demolition work
Plumbing
Industrial labor
Labor on a shipyard
Gas mask manufacturing
Firefighting
Mining
Manufacturing and installation of building insulation

, Secondary exposure to asbestos can also cause mesothelioma. This was first discovered when the wives and children of men who worked in asbestos-contaminated environments were diagnosed with the disease.The asbestos fibers remain on your clothes or on your person and can be breathed in by those close to you, such as family members, roommates, or close friends., The average age of mesothelioma diagnosis is 69. This condition is very rare in those under the age of 45, but it still occurs.The reason why mesothelioma tends to affect older adults is twofold: 1) Mesothelioma can manifest decades after initial exposure. 2) Asbestos is not as common in industrial environments as it had been in the past. There are roughly 3,000 diagnosed cases of mesothelioma in the United States each year., Zeolites are minerals related to asbestos and are found naturally in rocks and soils. Zeolites work similarly to asbestos and cause similar symptoms and diseases. Zeolites are commonly found in parts of Turkey, where mesothelioma is more common than elsewhere., Chest radiation — including radiation used to eradicate other kinds of cancers — can heighten your risk of mesothelioma. While the chances of mesothelioma are very, very slight, those with higher doses of chest radiation are more likely to be diagnosed with mesothelioma than other populations., Most diagnoses of mesothelioma happen when a patient reports a symptom or a change in their body.Pay attention to your body and to your health so that you can report any significant changes to your doctor.


This is especially important if you might have been exposed to asbestos at any point in your life.

, Pleural mesothelioma affects the tissue surrounding the lungs. This is the most common form of mesothelioma, accounting for 75% of diagnoses.Asbestos fibers embed themselves in the tissues, leading the body to attack these tissues and develop serious tumors that can make it difficult to breathe normally. Symptoms of pleural mesothelioma include:Shortness of breath
Painful cough
Pain underneath the ribs
Weight loss
Fever
Fatigue and exhaustion
Finding lumps in and beneath your chest tissue

, While less common, peritoneal mesothelioma can also be caused by asbestos exposure and has noticeable symptoms. These include:Stomach pain
Stomach swelling
Finding lumps in your abdomen
Sudden weight loss
Constipation

, It is more difficult to determine whether a patient has pericardial mesothelioma or mesothelioma of the testicles based on their symptoms because these symptoms mimic other conditions. These kinds of mesothelioma are also particularly rare and unlikely; however, it is still important to know these symptoms, especially if you have experienced asbestos exposure. These symptoms include:Chest pain
Pain or difficulty breathing
Pain, swelling, or lumps in the testicles

, Many of the the symptoms of mesothelioma can be caused by less serious illnesses and conditions. It is important that you do not panic, even if you find that you are experiencing these symptoms.You will need to consult a physician, but you should not jump to any conclusions about whether or not you have mesothelioma. Only medical tests administered by a doctor can make an official diagnosis.

, If you begin to experience these symptoms, it is imperative that you get in touch with your doctor right away. Even though mesothelioma is very rare, it is a serious enough condition that you do not want any delays in your treatment.Moreover, these symptoms might be caused by other conditions or illnesses that require treatment, such as pneumonia, infection, or other kinds of cancer.

, If you have known asbestos exposure and/or you experience symptoms of mesothelioma, make an immediate appointment with your physician. Mesothelioma is not a curable disease, but treatments can extend life and reduce pain. Treatments are most effective when provided early in the course of the illness.Most likely your regular physician will see you for your initial appointment; however, it is possible that you will be sent to a lung specialist or stomach specialist immediately, depending on your symptoms., The first step in mesothelioma diagnosis is getting a full medical workup by a physician. If your doctor suspects mesothelioma, you will likely be asked about possible exposure to asbestos. Provide your doctor with information about your health history, work history, and the onset of symptoms.Be sure to tell your doctor about any medications that you are currently taking as well as any recent life changes you have experience, especially unexplained weight loss .Even if you are not sure whether you have been exposed to asbestos, tell your doctor if you work in one of the higher-risk professions for mesothelioma, such as construction, demolition, firefighting, industrial work, or in shipyards., Your doctor will likely wish to perform a physical examination by feeling for possible lumps, listening to your chest and heart, and examining any other unusual signs and symptoms.A physical exam will help your doctor begin to pinpoint the cause of your symptoms and determine your general state of health.

, After an initial physical exam, your doctor may order imaging scans of your chest and abdomen. An x-ray of your chest and a computerized tomography (or CT) scan of your stomach and chest will help your doctor determine whether there is anything abnormal in your chest organs, such as a thickening of your tissues or abnormal pockets of fluid.A chest x-ray or CT scan by itself cannot give a firm diagnosis of mesothelioma, but it can indicate to your doctor whether more tests are needed.Some doctors will take chest x-rays and CT scans of patients who have been exposed to asbestos but who have not yet experienced any symptoms; however, it is unclear whether such early scans are useful in early diagnosis.These scans are also useful in helping determine how far mesothelioma has spread and how advanced it is, if mesothelioma is in fact the diagnosis., PET scans help determine whether or not an abnormality is cancerous and how far a cancer might have spread. Your doctor will inject you with a mildly radioactive substance, often a kind of sugar. Cancerous cells will absorb this material more quickly than other cells. A camera will then take pictures of your body, with the more radioactive parts lit up. This will help your doctor understand whether or not you have cancerous cells and where these cells might be located in the body., Some doctors will want to test your blood to help in their diagnosis. These tests currently have limited utility, however, since other tests are more reliable. Mesothelioma patients tend to have higher levels of osteopontin (a protein often found in bones and teeth) and soluble mesothelin-related peptides in the blood. These substances can be detected in blood tests., If you have abnormalities in your imaging scans or blood tests, your doctor will likely want to test your tissue using a biopsy. In a biopsy, a number of cells are removed from your body (often using a needle) and are tested underneath a microscope.This will help determine whether or not cells are cancerous as well as what kind of cancer they might have. Note that a biopsy is currently the only surefire way to diagnosis mesothelioma.There are different biopsy methods depending on where in the body the abnormal cells are located. Most biopsy procedures are non-surgical and can be accomplished with a fine needle; however, some biopsy procedures require deeper surgical incisions in order to access the abnormal tissues.If your biopsy reveals mesothelioma, you might require new imaging scans to determine the scale, stage, and spread of the cancer.If your biopsy reveals mesothelioma in the lungs, you will likely have to take a Pulmonary Function Test, which will help your doctor see how well your lungs are functioning and how well you are breathing., If you have a positive diagnosis for mesothelioma, your doctor will likely begin treatment options immediately. These treatments are similar to treatments for other cancers and will likely be supplemented with treatments to minimize pain and other symptoms. Note that mesothelioma is not a curable disease, but treatments can lengthen and improve the quality of your life.These treatments include:


Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy drugs can help shrink tumors and reduce painful symptoms such as fluid build-up.Radiation. Radiation can help kill or shrink cancerous tumors.It can also keep the cancer from spreading.Surgery. Your doctors might suggest that cancerous tissue, portions of your lungs, or portions of your chest lining be removed.In more advanced cases, your doctors might perform surgery to remove fluid from the lungs and chest."

Follow up with your oncologist.",How to Diagnose and Treat Esophageal Cancer," Difficulty of swallowing (also called dysphagia) is one of the most common symptoms of esophageal cancer.During the early stages, you may feel occasional “sticking,” especially of harder foods (such as meat, bread, and apples) as you swallow. If this happens, see a doctor.
This condition will worsen as the cancer advances. Eventually, it may progress to a point at which you cannot swallow any solid food.;
, Unintentional weight loss, especially of ten pounds a month or more, could be a sign of cancer.Many different kinds of cancer can produce weight loss, but in esophageal cancer, particularly, this symptom might be exacerbated by difficulty swallowing.
Vomiting within a few hours of eating is another possible symptom of esophageal cancer; vomiting and other GI related complications, such as diarrhea arise as the cancer spreads to the intestines.
Whether the issue turns out to be cancer-related or not, it’s best to see a doctor if you notice unexplained changes in your weight.

, A feeling of pain around or behind your breastbone can indicate esophageal cancer. See your doctor if you are experiencing chest pain of any kind, and if the pain is severe, get help immediately., Some people with esophageal cancer have symptoms of indigestion or heartburn, characterized by an uncomfortable burning feeling in the chest. If you notice this symptom, make an appointment with your doctor.Heartburn is caused by stomach acids irritating the esophageal lining after eating a meal, especially with spicy or overly-seasoned foods. If heartburn is not recognized and treated, it can put some people at risk for Barrett's, which is a pre-cancer condition that requires close monitoring., If your voice becomes hoarse for no apparent reason, see a doctor. Consistent hoarseness can also be a sign of esophageal cancer., Your family history (genetic factors) as well as past illnesses provide important clues about your risk of developing esophageal cancer.


If you have a history of Barrett’s esophagus or high grade dysplasia, you have an increased risk of developing esophageal cancer. Neither of these conditions are symptoms of cancer, per se, but they do warrant extra caution and regular monitoring.
Esophageal cancer is more common in men than in women.Obesity can increase your risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma.Squamous cell carcinoma seems to occur more frequently in people who drink, smoke, or are exposed to environmental factors that cause chronic irritation and inflammation of the esophagus.Race also plays a role: adenocarcinoma is more common in white people, and squamous cell carcinoma is more common in black people., If you have any of the symptoms of esophageal cancer, contact your doctor for an appointment. He or she will ask you about your symptoms and order appropriate tests.

, In consultation with your doctor, you may decide to schedule a barium swallow. During this test, you will swallow a chalky fluid, called barium, followed by X-ray imaging.The barium swallow test reveals the inner structure of the esophagus, and with it, any small bumps or raised areas in the lining.
Please note that although a barium swallow can reveal the presence of an obstruction, it is not sufficient alone to diagnose esophageal cancer. Further tests, such as a biopsy, must be performed to make that diagnosis.

, If your symptoms and/or the results of the barium swallow warrant it, your doctor may also do an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) with a fine needle biopsy.During this test, your doctor will look through your esophagus using a scope that is guided by an ultrasound. He or she will look for the plaques, nodules, ulcerations, or masses that are characteristic of esophageal cancer.
In addition, he or she will perform a biopsy by taking tissue from your esophagus for testing. This biopsy will show whether or not you have esophageal cancer and, if so, what type.

, If you do have esophageal cancer, your doctor may order a PET/CT, which is a sensitive imaging test that combines a PET scan with a CT scan.During this exam, you will drink a liquid called 18-F fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), wait for 30 minutes for your cells to absorb the solution, and then lie on a table as images are taken of your body, from your head to your knees.Tumor cells, like regular cells, need glucose to survive, and they have a high metabolism rate; as a result, areas that “light up” on the scan provide information about the extent of your cancer and how aggressive your tumor cells are., Talk to your doctor about your specific circumstances. There are two main types of esophageal cancers: adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Further, in the United States and Europe, a “TNM” staging system is used to describe esophageal cancer.The “T” indicates how deeply the tumor has penetrated through your esophagus.
The “N” indicates whether the lymph nodes around the esophagus have cancer cells in them.
The “M” indicates metastasis (cancer that has spread to any other areas of your body).

, Your doctor can explain the different treatment options and what to expect.


The treatment options usually consist of a surgery, chemotherapy and radiation., Esophagectomy is one possible treatment for esophageal cancer. Although there are several variations of the operation, the underlying principle is the same – the surgeon removes the part of the esophagus with the tumor.This operation will take place first in your abdomen (to free the stomach) and then in your chest to remove the part of the esophagus with cancer. This is followed by re-attaching the stomach to the remaining esophagus.One common variation on the esophagectomy is an Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy. It can be done either transthoracic (with a large open incision in the chest) or minimally-invasive (using specialized equipment and robotic technology).If done in the minimally-invasive way, you’ll have smaller incisions, less blood loss, fewer post-operative complications, a shorter hospital stay, and better preservation of pulmonary function after the operation., You doctor may decide that chemotherapy should be administered alone to manage symptoms or in conjunction with other treatment modalities. Chemotherapy consists of receiving cancer-killing drugs through an IV or oral medication.Chemotherapy may be administered prior to surgery to shrink targeted tumors, or after surgery to kill any cancerous cells that are left behind.If you are in poor health and cannot manage surgery, chemotherapy may be your main treatment modality.
Unfortunately chemotherapy drugs have many side effects, including nausea, vomiting, and hair loss. It is important you understand the possible adverse effects prior to therapy so you can prepare for them appropriately.Chemotherapy can also be combined with radiation therapy, which is known as chemoradiation.

, Another treatment option for esophageal cancer is radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-energy radiation to shrink cancerous tissues. Radiation therapy can be administered from outside the body or through a tube down the throat to make direct contact with the targeted tissue.Your doctor may choose radiation therapy as an alternative to surgery if you are not healthy enough to undergo a surgical procedure.
Side effects of radiation therapy include skin irritation, nausea, and fatigue, among others.

, Some patients with esophageal cancer require jejunostomy tubes (feeding tubes), either in the immediate post-operative period or for a longer time..


If you are unable to swallow food or unable to get enough nutrition through your mouth, the j-tube will be placed through your abdomen into the jejunum (the second part of your small intestine).
Liquid nutrients can be given through this tube. Ask your doctor about how long you will have to take your nutrition through a feeding tube.

, Some surgeons send their esophagectomy patients to the intensive care unit briefly after surgery, while others admit patients directly to their hospital room.Ultimately, you will have to teach your body how to eat again, which can be a slow process. Most patients are able to go home seven to ten days after surgery.
During the surgery, a j-tube will have been placed into your intestine. This will allow you to receive enteral feedings (tube feedings) during the healing process. They will be started slowly a day or two after your surgery and slowly increased in amount.
About seven days after your surgery, another barium swallow will be performed to ensure there are no leaks around the anastomosis (the region where your remaining esophagus was sewn to your stomach).
You will then start to sip water and other liquids, followed by advancing to soft foods.

, Before sending you home, the nurses and doctors will provide your caretakers with extensive information about how to care for you and manage your nutrition. A home health nurse may also be assigned to help you during the initial weeks after your surgery., In the months following surgery, you may experience difficulty swallowing, reflux, pain, and fatigue. You may also encounter what is called “dumping syndrome” – a problem that occurs when food goes into the small bowel too fast and cannot be digested properly.Signs of “dumping syndrome” include flushing, nausea, cramping, and vomiting. Speak to your doctor, but know that it usually resolves itself within a short period of time.

, Some patients experience post-operative problems even three or more years after surgery. These problems can include shortness of breath, problems with eating, reflux, diarrhea, and fatigue.Your doctor may recommend you take antacids or motility drugs to relieve some of these symptoms.

, Your oncologist can confirm that you don’t need any more treatment. He or she may want to see you on a routine basis for the foreseeable future, as well, in order to monitor your condition and make sure the cancer does not recur.

Observe any changes to your breast.Although most men do not spend a lot of time feeling or examining their breast tissue, it is still possible for men to get breast cancer (although it is much more rare than it is for women).,
Watch for any skin changes in your breast area.Potential changes to be aware of include redness, scaling, dimpling, or puckering of the skin on or around your breast.,
Notice any changes to your nipple.Discharge from your nipple, a nipple that turns inward, or other changes such as redness or scaling around your nipple are all causes for concern.,
Be aware of the risk factors.Although male breast cancer is rare (it account for less than 1% of the total breast cancer cases among men and women), it is still possible.,
Receive a physical exam.The first step to diagnosing breast cancer in men (after you have had signs or symptoms causing you to be concerned) is to receive a physical exam from your doctor.,
Obtain a mammogram.A mammogram is a specialized form of x-ray designed to look at the breast tissue.,
Consider an ultrasound.An ultrasound is another way to examine suspicious masses in the breast tissue, and to evaluate the level of concern as to whether or not they could be cancerous.,
Opt for a biopsy.A biopsy is where a needle is inserted into the suspicious sample of breast tissue, and some cells are withdrawn for examination under the microscope.,
Perform diagnostic testing on the cancer itself.If breast cancer is found, you will then receive further testing to evaluate specific details about the cancer that can provide insight into the best course of treatment.",How to Diagnose Breast Cancer in Men," Therefore, if you do feel an abnormal lump or bump in your breast area, take note of it and go in to see your doctor for a formal evaluation.


Things to look for include lumps (usually painless), and/or thickened areas of breast tissue that feel abnormal to you.
Your doctor will be able to provide additional information when he or she examines your breast area, and will let you know whether or not further diagnostic testing is needed.;
, Book an appointment with your family doctor if you notice any of these changes. It is always better to be examined by your physician, and to be safe rather than sorry.

, Book an appointment with your doctor sooner rather than later for further examination, and possible diagnostic testing.

, Risk factors that increase a man's likelihood of developing cancer of the breast include:


Age. Men in their sixties and seventies have the highest incidence of being diagnosed with cancer of the breast.
Estrogen levels. Men with higher estrogen levels are also at a higher risk. All men have estrogen to some degree (just as all women have some testosterone), but the level of estrogen in men is significantly lower in women. With that said, men who have are receiving estrogen hormone therapy as part of a sex-change procedure are at higher risk of developing breast cancer. Also, men who are overweight or who have liver disease are at higher risk, as both of these health issues lead to increased estrogen in the body. Excessive estrogen stimulation may be due to hormonal therapies, hepatic dysfunction, obesity, marijuana use, or an inherited condition.
A positive family history. If breast cancer runs in your family, you are also at a higher risk of developing it at some point in your life (although the risk is still very low compared to the women in your family). An inherited mutation in BRCA also increase the likelihood of cancer in males.
Radiation exposure. If you have had radiation to your chest area in the past (such as a CT scan), this also increases your risk.

, Doctors are trained in how to evaluate the feel of breast tissue, as well as any lumps, bumps, or other abnormalities that may be found. They can then let you know whether they feel the risk of a possible cancer is high enough to warrant further diagnostic testing.


When you show up in your family doctor's office, he or she will feel the tissue around your breasts for any unusual lumps. Your doctor will also look for abnormalities to the nipple, or to the skin surrounding your breast, that may be indicative of breast cancer.

, It is the general screening test for women, and is used in men who show a high enough clinical suspicion of possible breast cancer. The mammogram in itself is not officially diagnostic, but it is a further investigative tool that can provide your doctor with valuable information. If the mammogram looks suspicious, your doctor will ask you to proceed with further testing at this point.


For a mammogram, your breast tissue is compressed in a way that provides the best possible view, and is then imaged using technology similar to an x-ray.
The procedure is non-invasive and can be completed with a short day visit to the hospital (where the mammogram machines are most often located).

, Your doctor may recommend this evaluation, depending upon the level of certainty that he or she has around your diagnosis. Definitive diagnosis of breast cancer is usually obtained via a biopsy.


An ultrasound is also normally done in the hospital setting, and requires nothing more than a short visit during the day.
A gel is placed on the skin over your breast, and the ultrasound probe is then run over your skin (on top of the breast area) to provide the doctor with a view (based on sound waves) of what is going on underneath your skin.
A specialist will ""read"" the ultrasound results and assess whether or not there is a suspicion of cancer.
If the suspicion of cancer is high on your ultrasound test, you will be asked to proceed with a biopsy.

, This is the final diagnostic test that confirms for sure whether or not you have breast cancer, and can also inform your doctor as to the specific subtype of cancer if you do have breast cancer.


The biopsy is usually reserved for later on as it is a more invasive test, which is why a mammogram and/or an ultrasound usually precede it.

, Further things that can be tested for include:


Whether the cancer is positive for estrogen and/or progesterone receptors (this can be true even in male breast cancers).
Whether the cancer is positive for other ""markers"" that may affect treatment.
Whether the lymph nodes in the armpit are affected in addition to the breast tissue.
Whether the cancer has spread (metastasized) to any other areas of the body.
Based on all of this information, your doctor will discuss prognosis and a treatment plan for you moving forwards.

Other conditions like pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS) or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have symptoms that are very similar. So if you do have these symptoms, it does not mean that you definitely have cancer. But it does mean that you should get checked. Symptoms include:A distended or bloated abdomen that doesn’t go away
Pain in your pelvis or abdomen that doesn’t go away
Loss of appetite, feeling full quickly, or nausea associated with eating
Weight loss
Constipation
Urinating more frequently;
, Some things may increase a woman’s risk of developing ovarian cancer. These risk factors don’t mean that you will develop it, but just that your chances may be somewhat higher. If you think you are at a higher risk, ask your doctor if you should be checked regularly.Ovarian cancer is most likely to occur when a woman is over 50 years old.
Some people may have a genetic predisposition to developing ovarian cancer. This may be true for women with the breast cancer gene 1 (BRCA 1), breast cancer gene 2 (BRCA 2), or mutations that are related to Lynch syndrome and colon cancer. Having these mutations does not mean you will develop cancer, but it means your risk is higher. If you have a family history of these cancers, you should tell your doctor.
Using estrogen hormone replacement therapy over a long period of time with a high dosage may increase your risk.Menstruating for a long period of time may increase the risk. For example, this would include women who started their periods before age 12, women who menstruated until they were over 50, women who have not been on hormonal contraception, or not been pregnant. This occurs because each time a woman ovulates, the ovaries rupture to release and egg. The tissue then heals, with a small risk of abnormal cell growth occurring during the process.
Fertility treatments may increase the risk.
Smoking increases your risk of ovarian cancer and other cancers.
Medical conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome and endometriosis may make you more vulnerable to ovarian cancer.

, Ovarian cancers are categorized based on where the cancer cells begin.Epithelial tumors are the most frequent kind of ovarian cancer. In this type of cancer, the tumor starts in the outside layer of the ovaries. Roughly 90 percent of ovarian cancers are epithelial tumors.
Stromal tumors start in the parts of the ovaries that produce hormones. These types of ovarian cancers make up about 7 percent of the total.
Germ cell tumors are very rare, making up only about 1 or 2 percent of the total number of ovarian cancers. In this type, the tumors start where the eggs are produced.

, During a pelvic exam your doctor is likely to do several things which will help evaluate whether you have ovarian cancer. These include:Inspecting your abdomen and genitals.
Feeling your uterus and ovaries by putting gloved fingers in your vagina and simultaneously using the other hand to press your uterus and ovaries against the fingers in your body. This may be slightly uncomfortable, but should not cause pain.
Looking inside your vagina with a speculum

, Depending upon what your doctor found during the pelvic exam, it may be advisable to get more information through additional tests. These tests can help the doctor evaluate the size and shape of your ovaries:An ultrasound
An X-ray
A CT scan
An MRI scan

, Some types of ovarian cancer cells make a protein referred to as CA125. This means that high levels of it may signal cancer. This is, however, not a screening test – it is used when there is already a concern for cancer. Other conditions can also raise the level of this protein, so it must be done in connection with other tests. Some other conditions that elevate the level of this protein are:Endometriosis
Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
Fibroids
Pregnancy

, These tests will let the doctor test directly for cancerous cells:Laparoscopy. During this procedure the doctor inserts an tiny camera through a little cut in your abdomen and looks at the ovaries directly.
A biopsy. The doctor may take a small sample of tissue from your ovaries and test it to see if it is cancerous.
Abdominal fluid aspiration. During this procedure the doctor uses a long needle to extract some fluid from your abdomen. That fluid will then be examined to see if it has abnormal cells in it.

, This will help you to understand how far along it is. There are four commonly used categories:Stage 1: The cancer is only in the ovaries. It may be in one or both ovaries.
Stage 2: The cancer is also in the pelvis or uterus.
Stage 3: The cancer has spread to the abdomen. It may be in the lining of the abdomen, bowels, or lymph nodes in the pelvis.
Stage 4: The cancer has spread beyond the abdomen. It may be in other organs such as the liver, spleen, or lungs.

, This will help you to understand how aggressively your doctor expects the cancer to grow.Low grade cells are cancerous, but grow slowly.
Moderate grade cells are more abnormal and grow faster than low grade cells.
High grade cells are highly abnormal and grow aggressively.

, The best course of action will depend on your particular situation including your overall health, the stage, and the grade of the cancer. Most treatment plans incorporate:Surgery to remove as much of the cancerous tissue as possible
Chemotherapy to kill cancerous cells

, Cancer is both physically and emotionally exhausting. You will be more physically and psychologically resilient if you have emotional support.Talk with trusted friends and family members
Seek out a support group where you can talk with people who are also experiencing similar things
Reduce your stress by giving yourself time to rest and to sleep. You may need more than the usual 8 hours of sleep per night.

Notice symptoms of an enlarged spleen.",How to Diagnose Polycythemia Vera2," These pose one of the complications associated with polycythemia vera. If you experience a lot of nosebleeds, for example, this could be from polycythemia vera. Similarly, if you have bleeding gums, bruise a lot, or experience bleeding in your gut, you may be experiencing some of the complications of polycythemia vera.Too many red blood cells can also result in other problems like peptic ulcers and gout.Polycythemia vera can also lead to acute leukemia., Polycythemia vera can lead to red and itchy skin on your arms, hands, feet or legs. If your skin feels very itchy in a warm bed or after a shower, you may be experiencing one of the complications of this disease., If you have this disease, your blood will thicken and slow down which can cause clotting. In turn, blood clots can induce serious health concerns such as heart attack.If you experience any of the symptoms of a heart attack, you should contact emergency medical help.


Common symptoms of a heart attack include pain or tightness in your chest, aches in your chest and arms, pressure in your neck or jaw, nausea, indigestion, heartburn, cold sweat, quick breathing, lightheadedness and fatigue., If you have polycythemia vera, your spleen may be working extra hard and may become enlarged.In your diary or health journal, write down any pain or discomfort you are feeling. See if these symptoms match the common symptoms for an enlarged spleen:Not being able to finish a meal
Feelings of discomfort or pain on the upper left side of the abdomen
Feeling of fullness on the upper left side of the abdomen

Ask your doctor for blood tests.,
Review the blood test results with your doctor.,
Get a bone marrow biopsy.,
Ask your doctor whether test results indicate a gene mutation.,
Ask your doctor if there are any other tests you could take.,
Talk to your doctor about next steps.",How to Diagnose Polycythemia Vera3," Blood tests are one of the common ways of diagnosing this disease. The blood count changes often occur slowly — polycythemia vera is actually most commonly diagnosed when a patient is receiving blood testing for other reasons. Your doctor may do a complete blood count in order to figure out whether you have an excessive number of red blood cells. They may also do blood tests to figure out whether your hemoglobin or hematocrit counts are high, which is another indicator of polycythemia vera. To figure out which type of polycythemia vera you have, your doctor may also test your levels of erythropoietin hormone.Ask your doctor:“Can you do a blood test to determine whether I have polycythemia vera?”
“What should I do to prepare for the blood test?”

, You should ask your doctor about the results of your blood test, which they may inform you about in person or over the phone. You should be aware of the test results that would indicate a positive diagnosis of polycythemia vera: Increased number of red blood cells
More platelets or white blood cells
Higher hematocrit measurement
Higher hemoglobin levels
Low levels of erythropoietin

, You should ask your doctor whether a bone marrow biopsy or aspiration would be appropriate. Your doctor will take a sample of your bone marrow material. If they do an aspiration, they will take out a liquid part of your bone marrow. Once they finish the tests, ask your doctor whether the tests showed that your marrow is overproducing blood cells. You could ask:“Are the results of my test back?”
“Is my bone marrow producing too many blood cells?”
“Does the biopsy indicate that I have polycythemia vera?”

, Bone marrow or blood test results may also indicate the presence or absence of the gene mutation that is associated with polycythemia vera. You should inquire with your doctor about this gene mutation:“Do the test results indicate the presence of the gene mutation associated with polycythemia vera?”
“Do the test results show the gene mutation JAK2 V617F?”

, Your doctor may try some other tests such as looking at your vitamin B12 level, the oxygen saturation of your blood or a comprehensive metabolic panel test. Alongside your blood tests, these tests can help your doctor determine whether you have the disease., If you were positively diagnosed with polycythemia vera, you should talk to your doctor about treatment options. Unfortunately, the disease cannot be completely cured and will be treated more as a chronic condition, with your doctor monitoring your health for complications. Treatment will focus on decreasing the signs, symptoms and complications associated with the disease. For example, your doctor may prescribe low-dose aspirin, a procedure called phlebotomy, medications like hydroxyurea and therapies to reduce itchy skin.Inquire with your doctor about treatment options:


“How can we tackle this disease?”
“What are the best medications available for treating polycythemia vera?”
“Will I have to undergo the phlebotomy procedure?”

Be aware of the risks of ear candling.,
Have a friend or family member assist you.,
Size the tapered, or small, end of the candle to your ear.,
Wash your hands and your ear.,
Cover your head with a damp towel.,
Sit upright for the candling process.,
Rub the area behind your ear.,
Put a paper plate or pie tin over your ear.,
Position the tapered end of the candle in your ear canal.,
Light the large end of the candle.,
Burn the candle for approximately fifteen minutes.,
Trim the candle every two inches.,
Allow the candle burn to within 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm).,
Observe debris on the candle stub.,
Clean the ear.,
Repeat the ear candling on the other ear.",How to Use Ear Candles1," Alternative medicine practitioners are strong advocates for the benefits of ear candling, but many medical doctors believe that candling is ineffective and dangerous. Being aware of the risks and concerns about ear candling can help you make an informed decision if it is the best way for you to remove your ear wax.Studies by otolaryngologists (ear, nose and throat doctors) have shown that ear candling can cause burns, blockages in the ear canal, ear infections, and ear drum perforations even if you use the candle according to the packaging.Most medical doctors believe that ear candling is ineffective for removing wax.;
, It can be difficult to perform ear candling by yourself. Have a friend or family member assist you during the process. This can help minimize the risk of burning yourself or causing other trauma to your ear., The candle should be fitted to the size and contours of your ear. This can help ensure the most safe and effective candling process.Use the scissors to trim the end, making the opening slightly larger so it fills the ear canal.
Make sure the opening is passable. There should be a clear pathway from one end of the candle to the other. If necessary, use a sharp, pointy object to remove any obstruction from the small end.

, Before you begin candling your ear, wash your hands and wipe off your ear. This can minimize the risk of spreading bacteria that may cause an infection.Use a soft soap that is antibacterial and antimicrobial.


You can wash your hands with a simple and basic soap.
You may want to use an soft soap that is antimicrobial and antibacterial.
Wipe off your ear with a moist cloth., Moisten a large towel with some water and cover your head and upper torso area. This can help prevent a flame or any ashes from hitting you during the candling process.Make sure to cover your head, hair, shoulders, and upper torso., It will be easier and safer for you to sit upright during the ear candling process. This can help ensure that falling ashes don’t contact or burn you.Be careful; if you do not do this correctly, you could burn yourself. Physicians often do not recommend using ear candles because of this risk.

, Before you begin the candling procedure, massage the area around and behind your ear. This can help relax you and stimulate circulation in your ear area.Massage the area behind your jawbone, around your temple and your scalp.Rub for at least 30 seconds to open up the area around your ear., Cut a small hole in either a paper plate or pie tin and place it over your ear. This can help ensure that you don’t get burned with the flame or falling ashes.Use any type of paper plate or pie tin, which you can buy at most grocery stores.
Make sure the hole corresponds to the size of the end of the ear candle. Fit the candle into this hole and hold it up over the ear being cleaned.

, Place the small end of the candle in the paper plate or pie tin and then position the tip of the candle in your ear canal. This can help ensure a safe and effective candling procedure.Keep the candle in a vertically upright position. When sitting upright, the candle should be at an approximately 30 degree angle., Have your assistant light the large end of the candle with a lighter or match. This will start the candling process and can help ensure that you safely light the candle without burning yourself.You will know if the candle is properly in place if no smoke escapes from between your ear and the small end of the candle.
If you do not have a secure fit, readjust your position or the candle. It is important to get the secure fitting. If this takes a while, you may need to try again using a new candle.

, It should take about 15 minutes for the candle to burn down to the desired length. This can help minimize the risk for burning and maximize the amount of wax you’re able to remove., As the candle burns, trim it into a bowl of water every couple of inches. This can keep ashes or flames from falling close to and burning you.You can remove the candle to trim it into the bowl of water.Simply replace it securely in the canal when you’re finished.

, After the candle has burned down so there is only about 3 inches (7.6 cm) remaining, ask your assistant to extinguish the candle in the bowl of water. This can minimize your risk for getting burned by the candle.If the burn takes a while, have your assistant check the small end's opening after a few minutes to make sure it is not obstructed. If necessary, use a toothpick to swiftly clear the opening and reinsert the candle in the ear.

, Once you’ve removed the candle stub from your ear canal, you may be able to observe a mixture of ear wax, debris, and bacteria on the stub. This may help you to assess if you removed the wax or need to repeat the candling procedure.If you put the candle into water immediately, you may not see any wax., Once you’ve finished the candling process, clean the outer area of your ear and ear canal. Be careful not to push any wax or remnants back down into the ear.You can use a cloth or cotton swab to clean the ear. Just make sure to not put a cotton swab all the way into your ear, which can push wax further into your ear or perforate your ear drum., If both of your ears have a wax buildup, repeat the process on your other ear. Be sure to follow the steps closely and according to the product packaging. This may prevent burning or other trauma in your ear."

Follow the ""wait-and-see"" approach.,
Take antibiotics.,
Use decongestants.,
Undergo a myringotomy.",How to Treat Otitis Media1," Most of the time, the human immune system can fight off and heal ear infections with a bit of time (usually in two to three days).The fact that most ear infections can actually clear up on their own has led a number of physician associations to support the ""wait-and-see"" approach, which essentially means administering pain relief but not treating the infection with antibiotics.The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians recommends the ""wait-and-see"" approach for children from six months old to two years old who experience ear pain in one ear and for children over two years who have pain in one or both ears for less than two days and have a temperature of less than 102.2 degrees.Many doctors support this approach because of the overuse of antibiotics which has lead to an increase of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In addition, antibiotics can't treat an infection caused by a virus.;
, If the infection does not go away on its own, your doctor will likely prescribe a 10-day course of antibiotics, which can treat the infection and potentially shorten some symptoms. Commonly prescribed antibiotics include Amoxicillin as well as Zithromax (the latter case if you are allergic to penicillin). Antibiotics are often prescribed for individuals who suffer from frequent infections or for those with severe and extremely painful infections. In most cases, the antibiotics should clear up the infection. Potential side effects include rashes, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.if there are concerns about antibiotic resistance in the area, doctors will prescribe a drug that is a combination of amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin) instead. The clavulanate prevents the bacteria from deactivating the amoxicillin, preventing resistance.
Note that antibiotics will not be prescribed if the infection is caused by a virus or fungus, as antibiotics would not be effective in these cases.
The usual dose for adults with OM is 250 to 500 mg, by mouth, three times a day for 10 to 14 days.
For children ages six and up who have a mild to moderate infection as determined by the doctor's assessment, a shorter course of antibiotic treatment (5-7 days instead of 10) may be prescribed.Always complete the full course of antibiotics. Even if symptoms improve partway through the course of antibiotic treatment, make sure to finish the full prescription. If you are prescribed enough for 10 days, then you need to take the antibiotics for 10 days. However, you should notice improvement within 48 hours. A persistent high fever (of over 100.4°F or 38°C) suggests resistance to that particular antibiotic and you may need to acquire a different prescription.
You should consult your doctor after the course of antibiotic treatment has ended to check on on the infection., Using an over-the-counter decongestant or medication can help drain the fluid accumulating due to the infection. You can get them in the form of nasal sprays or as oral medication and they can be purchased at most pharmacies. Be sure to follow any instructions on the label. Be aware that there is little evidence that decongestants improve the healing of ear infections and for this reason they are not usually recommended.Nasal decongestant sprays should not be used for more than three days at a time. Longer term use has been linked to ""rebound"" swelling of the nasal passages.
While the ""rebound"" swelling is less common with oral decongestants, some people experience palpitations or a rise in blood pressure.
Do not give decongestants to children with ear infections. Although adults can use decongestants with an ear infection, children should not. Because their anatomy is different, decongestants will reduce the ability of the body to drain the thickened fluids and will prolong the infection.
Consult your doctor before using any nasal decongestant spray or oral decongestants.

, Ear surgery may be an option in cases of frequent ear infections that don't clear up through antibiotics. The surgery, called a myringotomy, involves draining the fluid from the middle ear and inserting a ventilation tube into the ear drum. Usually, you will need to be referred to an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist to determine whether this surgery is appropriate.In this outpatient surgery, an ENT specialist will surgically place the tympanostomy tube into the eardrum through a small incision. The process should help ventilate the ear, prevent the buildup of more fluid, and allow existing fluid to drain completely from the middle ear. Some tubes are intended to stay in place for six months to two years and then fall out on their own.Other tubes are designed to stay in longer and may need to be surgically removed.The eardrum usually closes up again after the tube falls out or is removed."

Stop when you have felt your ears un-pop. Repeat if the first yawn didn't work. You will know it when the pressure re balances. You'll not only hear and feel a pop, you'll suddenly hear much clearer than you had when your ears were popped.
Tilt your head back and thrust your jaw forward. Looking to the sky will put your Eustachian tubes into the proper position. Thrusting your jaw forward may help promote a yawn, and may open your Eustachian tubes and relieve the pressure.;
, If yawning doesn't work, chewing gum—or even mimicking the act of chewing gum—might. The movement helps equalize the pressure between the inside and outside of your ear. As can yawning, chewing gum can be done as a preventative measure, as well. Start chewing a stick of gum when you know you'll be dealing with altitude changes, and head the blockage off at the pass.









Chew a large piece of gum. We're talking Bubblicious, not Stride. The chewing motion needs to be large enough to open your throat and equalize the pressure in your ears. If you don't have anything to chew, make comically-large fake chewing motions, as if you'd bit off more than you could chew. Literally.

, Similar to chewing a piece of gum, sucking for a while on a hard candy, mint, or some kind of lozenge can equalize the pressure. Don't chew it–you're not just eating candy!–but suck on it for a while to create the pressurizing effect.








, The drinking motion combines many of the already-effective techniques all in one. Pour yourself a large glass of water, tilt your head back to position your Eustachian tubes, and take large gulps to help equalize the pressure in your ears. Done correctly, you should feel them unpop and any pain should be relieved.








, If you've just gotten out of the water and feel that irritating water-pressure-pain, you can use gravity by bending over at the waist, the popped ear parallel to the ground. Place the pad of one of your fingers across–not in–your ear, moving it on and off, like a toilet plunger. This can help to gently change the pressure in your ear and unpop them or change the pressure enough to expel any water that's gotten caught.









Never stick your finger into your ear. You're not trying to dig the water out, you're just trying to change the pressure. Sticking your finger too far into your ear can cause hearing damage.

, Sounds complicated, but it's simple. The concept of the Valsalva maneuver to apply counter pressure to the Eustachian tubes by exhaling gently.









Pinch your nose, close your mouth, and gently attempt to exhale through your nose. This should open them up, allow the pressure to equalize, and return your ears to normal.
Be extremely gentle. The Valsalva maneuver does not need to be forced, and if done too hard and too frequently, can irritate and inflame the Eustachian tubes, which will make it that much harder to clear them.
For some people, it helps to bend over while doing this to get it to work. Bend down as if you were stretching by touching your toes. Alternately try the Valsalva maneuver, then release the pinch on your nose and suck in a big breath of air. Continue alternating these two things, while bent down, to help relieve pressure and pop your ears.

, If your ears consistently remain popped, your condition could be from a more serious sinus problem which is causing persistent inflammation. See your doctor, who may suggest that you take an over-the-counter pain medication, a nasal spray, or an antibiotic.In the meantime, take steps to reduce your ear pain or infection.








, If you still can't un-pop your ears, talk to your doctor about an ear popper. The ear popper helps to equalize pressure on the inside and outside of your eardrum, thus un-popping it. While it's expensive, and may need to acquired by prescription, it may be just what the doctor ordered.








, If you're experiencing congested sinuses as a result of cold or allergy, your ears can become plugged and throw your equilibrium off balance, making them feel as if they need to pop. To correct the issue, address your congestion by flushing your sinuses regularly and gently with warm salty water. Using sinus rinses as directed can be safe and effective, but keep in mind that they need to be cleaned and used properly to avoid infection or other complications.








Neti-pots are widely available and can be used by filling with warm, distilled water mixed with a little salt. Tilt your head over the sink and pour water into one nostril, so it flows through your sinus cavity and out the other nostril. It feels kind of funky the first time, but offers serious relief to a clogged sinus.
If your sinuses are so plugged the water has trouble making it all the way through, the change in pressure might still be enough to relieve the congestion and relieve the clogged sensation in your ears. It's worth a shot.
Make sure you clean your neti-pot after each use and use only distilled or sterile water to avoid introducing any harmful bacteria into your system.

, Be proactive in protecting yourself against clogged sinuses and plugged-up ears. If you regularly struggle with your sinuses, don't wait until you've got a powerful pain and pressure in your ears to figure out how to unpop them. Head that pressure off at the pass by addressing your sinus issues with over-the-counter medication.








, If you're sick and want some relief for clogged ears, draw a warm bath and lay back with your ears under the surface of the water. Tilt your chin back and swallow hard a few times to see if your ears can unpop that way. The change in pressure can help to equalize your ears, and the steam from the hot water can also help to relieve your congestion issues. After you get out of the bath, if you're still feeling pressure, bend over so your ear is parallel to the ground and use your finger to create some pressure, as described above.








, Blowing your nose is essentially a version of the Valsalva maneuver, with the added benefit of relieving a stuffed-up nose. Use a tissue and plug one nostril at a time, blowing very gently out of the other. This should help to equalize the pressure in your ears.









It's important to be extremely gentle. Making a big nose trumpet into a tissue can make it worse, forcing blockage into your ear canal and making your ears feel as if they need to pop worse. Be very gentle.

, Try to get the water you gargle as warm as possible without burning the inside of your mouth.Add about a teaspoon of salt to a coffee mug of water and dissolve. Gargle repeatedly, taking one minute breaks in between gargles. Finish the entire mug of warm water and then take at least a 30 minute break before trying again.








, If you suspect that the pressure imbalance in your middle ear is due to a buildup of earwax, it could be helpful to unplug your ear first and then try some of the suggestions listed in the article. Here's how you do it:









Mix equal parts vinegar and 70% isopropyl alcohol. This solution will help loosen up the wax in your ear and unblock it.
Lean your head gently to the side and apply a few drops of the vinegar solution into the ear with a medicine dropper.
Keep your head tilted for a short while and then return it to its normal position. You may feel the vinegar solution run back down out of your ear. Repeat with the other ear.
Flush your ear out with a little bit of water. While the vinegar solution will evaporate because of the alcohol content, it's probably a good idea to flush the ears afterwards. Apply a few drops of water in a medicine dropper to the ears while your head is tilted sideways before tilting the head over to encourage discharge.

, It's not the most pleasant taste or sensation, but it sure will get your mucus running. (Capsicum is reputed to help with mucus buildup.) Blow your nose and move your jaw around when the mucus really starts flowing. You may experience a popping in your ears.







, Developed at the turn of the 20th century, craniosacral therapy seeks to re-balance the ""natural rhythm of cerebrospinal flow."" Although it's used for a wide range of disorders and therapies, it may be helpful in correcting the pressure imbalance in the Eustachian tubes that creates congestion in ears.









Many of craniosacral therapy's claims are unproven.If you're desperate for alternatives though, it can't do any harm.

, Acupuncture can be used to treat everything from ligament pain the foot to jaw discomfort and even ear inflammation. Visit an acupuncturist and talk to them about your problem if you've tried every trick in the book and still can't get your ears to pop.

Know the risk factors for prostate cancer recurrence.,
Ask about the size of your initial tumor.,
Learn about cancer staging.,
Study the levels on the Gleason score.,
Ask your doctor about use of the Han tables for knowing how to determine prostate cancer recurrence.,
Take steps to lower your risk of prostate cancer recurrence by having your prostate checked regularly after cancer treatment.,
Educate yourself about the various risk factors and available tests so you can take charge of your health after a prostate cancer diagnosis.",How to Determine Prostate Cancer Recurrence," One factor is whether there was cancer in the lymph nodes at the time of the initial diagnosis. Cancers that spread to the lymph nodes around the pelvic region increase the risk for a recurrence of prostate cancer later on.;
, As a general rule, the larger the initial tumor, the greater the risk of a recurrence. Although tumor size isn't the only way to learn how to determine prostate cancer recurrence, larger tumors may mean the patient should have more frequent diagnostic tests to catch a recurrence of prostate cancer early on.

, When it comes to predicting the recurrence of prostate cancer, the staging of the initial cancer may be one of the best indicators. More advanced cancers often have a higher rate of recurrence. The staging also impacts the treatment protocol and the future outlook for the patient.

, This method for grading prostate cancer offers insight into the advancement of the disease as well as the risk factors for prostate cancer recurrence. At grade 1, cancer cells look very much like normal prostate cells. In grades 2 through 4, the patterns of the prostate cells begin to vary. By grade 5, cells no longer resemble normal prostate cells and are scattered haphazardly throughout the area. Higher Gleason scores usually mean more aggressive cancer and a higher risk for recurrence.

, These tables, developed urologists Misop Han, M.D., Alan W. Partin, M.D., Ph.D., and Patrick C. Walsh, M.D., are based on data collected from numerous cancer patients to help predict the risk factors for prostate cancer recurrence, both before and after surgical treatment.

, The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test continues to be one of the most administered tests to determine a recurrence of prostate cancer. The simple blood test measures PSA levels in the blood, which can detect the presence of disease in the body. A similar, but newer, test, known as the AccuPSA is specifically used for early detection of a recurrence of prostate cancer after a radical prostatectomy.

, By knowing your risk factors, possible signs of prostate cancer and the various diagnostic tests available to you, you can effectively lower your risk factors for a prostate cancer recurrence in the future.

Wipe the outside of your ear.,
Apply an over the counter eardrops to remove wax.,
Try oil or glycerin drops to soften wax.,
Irrigate wax plugs.,
Vacuum your ear canals.,
Dry out your ear.,
Avoid cleaning too often or with instruments.,
Talk to your doctor about professional treatment options.",How to Use Ear Candles2," You can clean the outside of your ear canal with a cloth or paper tissue. This may help remove discharge or any wax that has worked its way outside of your inner ear.Use a soft cloth to wipe around the outside of your ear and on your outer ear canal.If you like, you can wet the cloth slightly with warm water.Wrap a paper tissue around your finger and gently wipe your outer ear and outer ear canal with the tissue., For those people with minimal to moderate amounts of earwax, use an over the counter wax removal preparation. This can help clear any impacted wax.Most over the counter drops are mineral oil and peroxide solutions.The hydrogen peroxide will not dissolve your wax, but help it move through the ear canal.When using hydrogen peroxide, lie on your bed with your head to its side and a towel placed under your head. Pour (or use a rubber bulb) a small amount of H2O2 into the ear. The ear will start to feel warm and you will begin to hear a bubbling sound. This is normal. Roll your ear over onto the towel to let the peroxide drain out. Repeat on other side. If you have any ear discharge consult a doctor immediately.
Make sure to follow the package instructions for using the products to help ensure you don’t cause further problems.
If you have an eardrum perforation or suspect that you may, do not use an over the counter preparation.The symptoms of a perforated eardrum include bloody or pus-filled discharge from your ear, hearing loss, or a ringing sound in your ear.You can purchase over the counter earwax removal drops at most pharmacies and some large retailers.
Cerumenolytics (peroxide & mineral oil) can lead to complications including allergic reactions, otitis externa, transient hearing loss, and dizziness.

, In addition to over-the-counter wax treatments, you can also use simple household oils or glycerin drops to relieve wax plugs. These treatments soften ear wax, making it easier to clear out of your ear canal.You can use baby or mineral oils as a treatment.Place one drop of baby or mineral oil in each ear and let it sit for a few minutes before allowing it to drain out.You may also try olive oil.However, one study found that water was more effective at removing ear wax than olive oil.There are no studies about how often its helpful to use oil or glycerin drops, but no more than a few times a week should be fine., Irrigating, sometimes called “syringing,” is one of the most common methods of removing wax plugs from the ears.Try washing your ear by irrigation if you have large amounts or stubborn ear wax.You’ll need a medical syringe to use this method, which you can buy at most pharmacies.Fill the syringe with body temperature water. Using cooler or warmer water may cause dizziness or vertigo.Hold your head upright and gently pull the outside of your ear upward to straighten your ear canal.Inject a small stream of water into your ear canal by where the wax plug is located.Tilt your head to drain the water.You may need to perform an irrigation several times in order to clear away the impaction.One study showed that injecting a small amount of water or oil into your ear before irrigation may help remove the wax more quickly.Never use a water jet device designed for teeth to irrigate your ears!, You can purchase a suction device or vacuum to remove earwax. Although studies show that this treatment is ineffective, you may find it works for you.You can get earwax suction devices at many pharmacies or large retailers.

, Once you’ve removed your ear wax, it’s important to dry your ear thoroughly. This can help ensure that you don’t get an infection or experience other problems.You can use a few drops of rubbing alcohol to dry out your ear.A hair dryer set to low can also help dry out your ear., Understand that every person needs a certain amount of wax to help prevent ear infections. Avoid cleaning your ears too often or using instruments such as cotton swabs to help keep a healthy amount of wax in your ears.Only clean your ears as often as you feel they require it. If you notice you need to clean your ears daily or excess discharge, see your doctor.Using instruments such as cotton swabs or hair pins can force wax into your ear instead of removing it, and may cause infection or other problems.Using instruments can also perforate your ear drum and lead to infection or hearing loss., If you can’t remove your wax at home or experience other problems such as severe hearing loss, talk to your doctor about your different treatment options for wax plugs. This can help ensure that you get the most effective, least invasive, and most painless treatment for your impacted cerumen.


Your doctor may recommend professional treatments or options that you can use at home, including drops and irrigation."
"
Use a warm compress.,
Administer pain medication.,
Administer ear drops.,
Change your sleeping position.",How to Treat Otitis Media2," Place a warm, moist washcloth over the affected ear to lessen the pain and throbbing ache. You can use any warm compress, such as a hot towel wrung out in warm-to-hot water, against the ear for immediate relief.Alternatively, you can use a cup of rice or salt, heated in a pan on the stove until it is warm – but not too hot — and bundled into a sock or washcloth. Place it over your ear. It will stay warm longer than a wet washcloth will.

, Your doctor may recommend the use of over-the-counter acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin IB, Advil) to relieve pain and ease any discomfort.Be sure to follow the dosage specified on the label.


Adults should take up to 650 mg of acetaminophen, or 400 mg of ibuprofen every four to six hours, depending on how much pain you are experiencing.Do not take more than 4grams in total for all of these combined within 24hrs.
The amount of painkillers children should take are based on their weight. Read the directions that come with your medication to determine how much your child should be given.Never give aspirin to children or teens (under 19). Aspirin has been linked with Reye's syndrome, a rare condition that can cause severe liver and brain damage in children and teenagers. You should not give aspirin to anyone under 19.Consult your physician if you have questions., If you are in considerable pain, your doctor may prescribe ear drops, such as antipyrine-benzocaine-glycerin (Aurodex) to relieve pain as long as the eardrum remains in tact and not torn or ruptured.The normal prescription is to add three or four drops of the medicine to your ear canal twice a day for seven days. Lie on your side to properly put the drops in your ear, and then stay lying on your side for 60 seconds so that the drops have time to sink in.To administer drops to a child, warm the bottle by placing it in warm water. This will make the drops less of a shock to the ear since they won't be freezing cold. Have your child lie down on a flat surface with the infected ear facing you. Administer the drops as directed on the label. Follow the recommended dosage and do not use more. Follow the same procedure if you are administering drops to another adult or yourself.

, To relieve pain and help drain the fluids that have built up in your ears, you can change the position you lie in when you get in bed at night. Put a bunch of pillows under your head to keep your head elevated so that the fluids will drain from your ear tubes.

See your doctor before attempting any of these remedies.,
Use garlic oil or coconut oil at home.,
Chew Xylitol gum.,
Use apple cider vinegar.,
Eliminate dairy products from your diet.",How to Treat Otitis Media3," Some people try natural antimicrobial remedies before seeing a doctor. This can actually be very dangerous, as you cannot tell if the child is actually suffering from a perforated eardrum, a tumor in the ear canal, a cut in the skin in the ear, or something else more severe than a simple ear infection. Applying a home remedy may aggravate these conditions and/or may mask a doctors ability to detect them when she looks inside the ear. if the child has a perforated eardrum, doing this could also seriously risk causing deafness in that ear.

, Both garlic and coconut oils have antiviral and antibacterial properties and have long been used for treatment of infections at home. Garlic oil can be made at home from several cloves of garlic and coconut oil should be virgin and cold pressed to have the best results.Make your own garlic oil at home by crushing a couple cloves of fresh garlic and soaking it in olive oil on very low heat for 30 minutes. Coconut oil is widely available at grocery stores and health food stores.
To use, place two or three drops of the oil of your choice in the affected ear and lay down for 10 minutes on the other side of your head up so that the oil doesn’t drip out.
Never put oil in an ear in which you believe the eardrum may have ruptured. The oil may damage the inside of the ear if it goes through the eardrum.

, Xylitol is a natural sweetener or sugar substitute. There are studies that show that Xylitol may keep the number of ear infections you get to a minimum because it fights against bacteria that can grow in your ear and cause infections. Chew two pieces of gum containing Xylitol five times a day.However, chew this gum with caution. The Xylitol can kill the bacteria responsible for the development of ear infections, but frequent chewing can also increase the potential for temporomandibular joint syndrome and lead to the erosion of your teeth due to artificial flavors and preservatives., Another natural antimicrobial remedy is apple cider vinegar. There is some anecdotal evidence—though no firm scientific support—that vinegar may be effective in helping relieve ear infections. Dilute the vinegar, using one part vinegar to one part water, then fill the ear canal with the solution, plugging it with a cotton ball or washcloth or lying on the opposite side. After five minutes, drain the ear by turning over, with the affected side facing down.You could also apply three to four straight drops of apple cider vinegar into the affected ear with a syringe and then lie on the opposite side for a few minutes to let it settle.

, Although the most recent research shows that dairy products probably do not increase mucus production, there are case studies in which people report that it does. If mucus production increases it can block the eustachian tubes and increase the risk of bacterial growth."

Take note of visible symptoms related to the ear.,
Keep track of symptoms related to the ""common cold."",
Look for signs of hearing problems.,
Understand the potential complications.,
Make an appointment with your doctor.",How to Treat Otitis Media4," The most common symptoms of OM include ear pain or ear tugging (if the child can't yet verbalize pain), fussiness, fever, and even vomiting. In addition, a child may eat or have trouble sleeping normally because lying down, chewing, and sucking can alter the pressure in the ear and cause pain. Adults will also experience pain, a sensation of pressure, and increase discomfort while lying down.Given that the age group most commonly affected from ear infections and fluid ranges from three months to two years old, parents or primary caregivers will be required to give as much information and history as possible to the doctor on their children's behalf. Thus, it's important to keep track and careful record of any noted symptoms.
If you notice any discharge of fluid, pus or bloody discharge, see a doctor immediately., Ear infections are considered secondary infections that follow the ""common cold"", or the primary infection. You should expect to see a few days of nasal discharge or congestion, cough, sore throat, and a low fever, all typical symptoms that accompany colds.Most colds are due to viral infections and, given that there is no treatment for viral infections, there is usually no reason to seek medical attention. Only seek medical attention if the fever cannot reaches temperatures higher than 102°F (38.9°C). Keep track of all symptoms of the cold, as your doctor will want to know about the primary infection. The cold should last for a week. If you don't see improvement after a week, visit your doctor.

, The middle ear is normally filled with air which transmits sound waves. When the middle ear is filled with fluid during an infection sounds will be different or reduced. Some people complain that it sounds like listening to sounds under water. Signs that proper hearing may be impacted include:Failure to respond to soft sounds or other noises
The need to turn up the TV or radio to a louder volume
Talking in an usually loud voice
General inattentiveness

, Most ear infections don't cause long-term complications and often go away on their own within two to three days. However, frequent infections can result in some serious complications, including:Speech or developmental delays — In young children, hearing loss could result in developmental delays in speech, particularly if they are not yet verbal.Impaired hearing — Although slight difficulties in hearing are common with ear infections, more severe hearing loss can be a result of ear persistent infections or fluid, which can in some cases cause damage to the eardrum and middle ear.Spread of infection — Infections that remain untreated or that do not respond to treatment can spread to other tissues and should be addressed immediately. Mastoiditis is one possible infection that can result in the bony protrusion behind the ear. Not only can this bone become damaged but pus-filled cysts can also develop. In a few rare cases, severe middle ear infections can spread into the skull and affect the brain.Tearing of the eardrum — Infections can sometimes result in a tearing or rupturing of the eardrum.Most tears usually heal within 3 or so days, but in a few exceptional incidences, surgery may be required., If you suspect an ear infection may be at work, see a doctor to confirm the diagnosis.The physician will examine the ear using an otoscope, a small instrument that looks like a flashlight. This helps the doctor see into the eardrum.You may be referred to a specialist in ear, nose and throat (ENT) disorders (otolaryngologist) if the problem is persistent, frequent or unresponsive to treatment."

Unplug ears that are clogged due to a cold.,
Do the Valsalva Maneuver.,
Take a decongestant.,
Use a nasal spray antihistamine.,
See a doctor.",How to Unplug Ears1," Colds can often lead to sinus congestion, which in turn, block your eustachian tubes—which are connected to your middle ear and the back of your nose. When this gets stopped up, it can lead to a great deal of pain.;
, Not only is this good for blockage due to colds, it's also very handy for pilots, airline passengers, and divers.








Pinch your nose to plug your nostrils. Exhale like you are trying to breathe out of your nose. Resist the urge to blow too hard as it might hurt the eardrum.
There may be a small pop sound associated with the relief of pressure when using this remedy but it should not be accompanied by any pain.

, This will help clear the sinuses, and return your hearing to some semblance of normalcy.








, In the event your sinus blockage is caused by allergies, an antihistamine may be just the thing you need.








, If your ear pain is serious, see your doctor or specialist, who may prescribe meds such as topical nasal steroids, or use ventilation tubes to drain any fluid and relieve pressure.








"
"
Recognize the symptoms.,
Wriggle your jaw.,
Perform the Valsalva maneuver.This maneuver, which attempts to force air through the blocked passage and reestablish air flow, should always be performed gently.,
Try the Toynbee maneuver.Like the Valsalva maneuver, the Toynbee maneuver is intended to open blocked Eustachian tubes.,
Blow up a balloon through your nose.,
Swallow with your nose pinched.This is called the Lowery maneuver, and it’s a little harder than it sounds.,
Place a heating pad or warm washcloth against your ear.,
Use nasal decongestants.Ear drops won't be able to unclog your congestion because the ear is blocked up.,
Take antihistamines if your problem is caused by allergies.While antihistamines aren't usually a primary method of Eustachian blockage treatment, they may help alleviate the congestion from allergies.",How to Unclog the Inner Ear or Eustachian Tube1," Whether from cold, allergies, or infection, swelling will prevent Eustachian tubes from opening and allowing air to pass. This results in pressure changes, and sometimes, the accumulation of fluid in the ear. When this happens, you will feel the following symptoms:Ear pain or a feeling of ""fullness"" in the ear.
Ringing or popping sounds and sensations that don't come from the outside environment.
Children may describe popping as a “tickling” sensation.Trouble hearing clearly.
Dizziness and trouble keeping balance.
Symptoms might be heightened when you rapidly change altitude — for example when flying, riding an elevator, or hiking/driving through mountainous areas;
, This very simple maneuver is known as the first technique of the Edmonds maneuver.Simply jut your jaw forward, then wriggle it back and forth, from side to side.If the ear blockage is mild, this action can pop your Eustachian tube open and reestablish normal air flow.

, When you try to blow out through blocked passageways, the air pressure in your body is affected. The sudden rush of air when you release your breath can cause a rapid change in blood pressure and heart rate.Take a deep breath and hold it, closing your mouth and pinching your nostrils shut.Try to blow air out through your closed nostrils.
If the maneuver is successful, you will hear a popping sound in your ears, and your symptoms will be relieved.

, But instead of having the patient manipulate air pressure through breathing, it relies on the air pressure adjustment of swallowing. To perform this maneuver:Pinch your nose closed.
Take a sip of water.
Swallow.
Repeat this process until you feel your ears pop and open back up.

, It might look and feel silly, but this action, called the Otovent maneuver, can be effective for equalizing air pressure in your ears. Buy an “Otovent balloon” either online or at a medical supply store. This device is just a normal balloon that has a nozzle that fits into the nostril.If you have a nozzle around the house that will fit securely into the balloon opening and your nostril, you can make an Otovent balloon of your own at home.


Insert the nozzle into one nostril, and pinch the other nostril closed with your finger.Try to inflate the balloon using only your nostril, until it is about the size of a fist.
Repeat the process on the other nostril. Repeat until you hear the “pop” of free air flow in the Eustachian canal.

, Before swallowing, you have to build up air pressure in your body by bearing down like you’re trying to have a bowel movement. When you’re holding your breath and blocking your nose, it will feel like you’re trying to blow air out through all of your blocked orifices. Some people find it difficult to swallow under these circumstances because of the increased air pressure in the body. Be patient, though, and keep at it. With enough practice, it could pop your ears open.

, This can both ease any pain you might experience and treat the blockage. The gentle heat of a warm compress can help break up congestion, unclogging the Eustachian tubes.If you use a heating pad, you should place a cloth between the heating pad and your skin to avoid burns.

, Because the ears and nose are connected through tubes, a nasal spray is an effective way to treat Eustachian tube blockage. Angle the nasal spray bottle through the nostril toward the back of the throat, almost perpendicular to the face. Sniff as you spray the decongestant, hard enough to draw the fluid into the back of the throat, but not hard enough to swallow it or pull it into the mouth.


Try one of the equalizing maneuvers after using a nasal decongestant. They might be more effective at this time.

, Talk to your doctor about whether this is a good option for you.


Note that antihistamines are usually not recommended for people with ear infections.

Wear earplugs when swimming.",How to Treat Itchy Ears," Is it coming from deep inside your ear canal, or does your ear itch on the outside on the cartilage or lobe? Internal itchiness could be an early indicator for a cold, for example, while external itchiness could be related to an allergic reaction to something in your environment.If you recently had your ears pierced and you are experiencing itchiness or soreness in the lobe, you may have a mild infection in the new piercing. Make sure you handle your pierced ears with clean hands, and treat them with a cotton ball soaked in rubbing alcohol a few times a day. If the infection worsens or persists, see a doctor.Dry skin on the outer ear can cause itchiness. If the dry skin appears on places like your ears, face, or scalp, it may be a common condition called seborrheic dermatitis. Simple over-the-counter dandruff shampoos or products with ingredients like salicylic acid, zinc, or coal tar can help treat this condition. Wash the affected area with a medicated shampoo or soap once or twice a day.;
, You might be having a mild allergic reaction to something in your environment—even a new shampoo, or a new set of earrings. If you recently changed your hygiene routine or started using a new product, try eliminating that product or going back to what you did before.


Read labels on all personal hygiene products. Make sure nothing you use contains any ingredients you have a history of reacting badly to. Your ears can react to allergens the same way as other parts of your body, so an allergic reaction could be causing your itchy ears., Sometimes, these devices can cause itching in the ear by trapping water in the ear canal. This can also lead to a mild infection over time. If you wear either of these things regularly, take them out and clean them thoroughly. Allow them to dry completely before putting them back into your ear.
Hearing aids need to be properly fitted to your ears. If they don’t fit properly, they might irritate the sensitive skin inside your ears and cause itchiness and irritation., It’s unlikely, but a bug may have gotten into your ear while you were sleeping. If you suspect this may be the case, see a doctor to verify, and they can remove the bug.Don’t worry—bugs in ears aren’t very common. But, if you happen to live in a place with a high bug population, and those bugs are often in the same room where you sleep, then you might be at a higher risk for this to happen.

, If you seem to have very little wax in your ears, this could be the source of the dryness and subsequently the itchiness in your ears. Lack of earwax is one of the causes of dry skin in the ear, which can make your ear feel irritated and itchy.Try not to stick anything in your ears, even to check for wax. Let a doctor look in with a scope. They will be able to see how much wax is in your ear, and you won’t risk damaging the delicate parts of your inner ear., There are many different brands and types of ear drops that you can buy at your local drug store. Make sure you read the labels and pick a drop that is made specifically for itchy ears.


If your ear is itching due to an allergy or outside cause, these drops may help alleviate the irritation. Just make sure you don’t use more than the dosage on the packaging calls for., You can use olive, mineral, or vegetable oil. Place the oil container inside of a warm glass of water to slowly warm the oil. Before putting any in your ear, make sure you test it on the inside of your wrist to make sure that it isn’t too hot.Don’t put more than a few drops of warm oil into your ears at a time. Wait a few hours for the oil to absorb and moisten the inside of your ear canal before applying anymore.
The oil will work as a moisturizer for the skin inside of your ear. But, you don’t want to use oil that is meant for your body, such as baby oil or scented oil. These could cause further irritation.
You can also try a traditional blend of mullein oil and garlic. You can make your own by steeping mullein flowers and chopped garlic in olive oil over low heat for 4 hours, or you can purchase pre-made mullein garlic oil. Place a few drops into the affected ear 2-3 times per day.When using oil to treat painful or itchy ears, you can also place a few drops of oil onto a cotton ball and tuck the cotton ball into your ear overnight to allow the oil to absorb into your ear more slowly., This can be used to loosen ear wax and also to kill bacteria that might be present in the ear canal, causing it to feel itchy or irritated. Tilt the affected ear towards the ceiling and put in 2-3 drops of hydrogen peroxide. Wait a moment or two; you might hear a bubbling sound in your ear. Then, tilt your ear back down to drain the peroxide out.Using this method too often could backfire and lead to your ears drying out, or cause an infection. If this remedy doesn’t help after 1 or 2 tries, cease using the peroxide and seek medical advice., Use warm water to dilute some rubbing alcohol. Then, use a plastic syringe or ear bulb to place a few drops of this solution into your ear. Let it sit for a moment, then drain it out. You can use the bulb or syringe to remove the solution, as well.Water and alcohol mixed together will flush bacteria from your ear, and remove any loose debris (like dust, or bugs) as it cleans the inside of your ear.Don’t let this mixture sit too long, and don’t use too much of it. Let it sit for just a few moments, then drain it out. Make sure you get out any remaining liquid from your ears.

, If your itchy ears are caused by an oncoming cold or allergies, antihistamines can help ease the irritation. Try allergy medicines containing diphenhydramine.Carefully read all labels on any medications. Take only the recommended dosage. Some antihistamines and allergy medicines can cause drowsiness, so if you need to operate machinery or go to work, make sure you take a brand that is specifically labeled as non-drowsy., If all else fails, go see your doctor. If you try these remedies and none of them seem to work, even after a few attempts, don’t continue these remedies. There might be something more serious at work, and a doctor should be your next stop.#* Ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialists are trained specifically in these areas of the body. If you have a condition that your primary care doctor is concerned about, he or she may refer you to one of these specialists for further care., Though this is a relatively common practice for many people, it’s actually very dangerous to use cotton swabs to clean the inside of your ear canal. You can ultimately do more damage than good.Ear wax protects your ear canal from water and infection. Using a cotton swab or anything smaller to clean it out will actually only create more problems for your ears., Use a cotton ball, some warm water, and mild soap to gently clean the outside of your ears. Keeping the outside clean will help keep debris and allergens out of your ear canal, and keep your ear from feeling irritated.You can even do this in the shower with a clean washcloth. Just make sure you don’t stick anything into the inner part of your ear. Clean only the outside, and make sure you get all the soap off if you use it., You can also use cotton balls in your ears when swimming or even showering. This will keep water and debris out of your ears, and prevent an infection from occurring from water getting trapped in the ear canal.Also wear earplugs when attending loud concerts or other noisy events. Try to keep the volume low on your earbuds when listening to music. Loud noise may damage your inner ear over time, and cause eventual depletion of your hearing."

If you smoke, talk to your doctor about the best way to reduce or eliminate your tobacco use., There is some evidence that your diet can affect your risk for breast cancer and other types of cancer. The Mediterranean Diet may be particularly helpful for reducing your risk of getting breast cancer. A good diet can also help you maintain a healthy weight, which is an important factor in breast cancer prevention.The Mediterranean Diet is recommended by the Mayo Clinic for breast and heart health. This diet focuses on plant based nutrition (fruits, vegetables, mixed nuts, and legumes), use of healthy fats (olive oil, canola oil), and a reduced intake of salt and red meat., Not only is exercise good for your body, but it helps you to maintain a healthy weight. Studies show that people who are physically active are less likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer. Try to exercise at least four hours a week., Avoid radiation-based medical imaging techniques, like X-rays, CT scans, or PET scans, unless you and your doctor feel that they are medically necessary. Exposure to radiation can put you at risk for breast cancer and other types of cancer., Long-term exposure to hormones in hormone replacement therapy or hormonal birth control has been linked to an increased risk of developing breast cancer. If you are taking or considering birth control pills or other forms of hormone-based therapy, talk to your doctor about the potential risks and benefits. Discuss how you can limit or reduce the dose and duration of your therapy in order to minimize the risk of developing breast cancer., Not all mothers are able to breastfeed, but if it works for you and your child, breastfeeding can be beneficial to your breast health. Breastfeeding has been shown to reduce the risk of developing breast cancer."

, If you're reading this article as a precaution, you may be able to forestall the problem. Before you get in an airplane, or drive over that mountain pass, break out the chewing gum or hard candy.









The action of chewing, swallowing, even yawning, will open up your Eustachian tubes, allowing the air pressure to equalize.
This also works if you are experiencing the problem. Continue chewing, yawning, and swallowing until your ears quit popping.

Insert the tip of the syringe just into the opening of the ear canal, pointing slightly up and sideways, so you aren't directing the water directly at the eardrum.
Squeeze the bulb of the syringe hard enough so that it dislodges the wax, but never squeeze forcefully. It will sound like you're in a windstorm, and may tickle a bit.
Make sure the tip of the syringe doesn't block the water and cerumen exiting your ear canal, and don't be alarmed at the goop that comes plopping out.
Repeat until your ear is cleared, then dry with a soft cloth.
You may notice a very distinct difference in your hearing, for the better.

Ask for medicated nasal sprays.Though you can try to use normal, over-the-counter nasal sprays to treat your blockage, you may find more success with prescription decongestants.,
Take antibiotics if you have an ear infection.,
Talk to your doctor about a myringotomy.,
Consider getting pressure equalization tubes.,
Treat the underlying cause.",How to Unclog the Inner Ear or Eustachian Tube2," If you suffer from allergies, ask the doctor if she recommends a steroid and/or antihistamine nasal spray to help resolve the issue.

, While Eustachian tube blockage is often short-lived and harmless, it can lead to painful and disorienting ear infections.If your blockage progresses to that level, contact a medical professional for a prescription for antibiotics. Your doctor may not prescribe them unless you also have a fever of 102.2°F (39°C) or higher for 48 hours.


Follow dosage instructions for antibiotics precisely. Finish the entire antibiotic cycle, even if your symptoms seem to resolve before you’ve finished it.

, In severe cases of blockage, the doctor may recommend surgical treatment reestablish airflow to the middle ear. There are two types of surgery, and a myringotomy is quicker option. The doctor will make a tiny incision in the ear drum, then suction out any fluid that's trapped in the middle ear. It seems counter-intuitive, but you actually want the incision to heal slowly. If the cut stays open long enough, the Eustachian tube swelling can go down to normal. If it heals quickly (within three days), fluid may collect in the middle ear again, and the symptoms may persist.

, This surgical method has a higher likelihood of success, but is a long, drawn-out process. Just as with a myringotomy, the doctor will make an incision in the eardrum and suction out the fluid that's accumulated in the middle ear. At this point, he will insert a small tube into the ear drum to ventilate the middle ear. As the eardrum heals, the tube will be pushed out on its own, but this can take six to 12 months. This method is recommended for patients who have chronic problems with blocked Eustachian tubes, so discuss it carefully with your doctor.


You must protect your ears entirely from water while pressure equalization tubes are installed. Use earplugs or cotton balls while showering, and use specialized ear plugs while swimming.
If water passes through the tube to the middle ear, it can cause an ear infection.

, Clogged Eustachian tubes are usually the result of some type of illness that causes mucus and tissues swelling, blocking the normal passage of air. The most common causes of mucus accumulation and tissue swelling in this area are colds, the flu, sinus infections, and allergies.Don't allow these conditions to get out of hand and progress to inner ear problems. Seek treatment for cold and flu as soon as symptoms appear, and talk to your doctor about ongoing care for recurring conditions like sinus infections and allergies.

Perform a self-examination at least once a month.,
Visually examine your breasts.,
Familiarize yourself with how your breasts change during the month.,
Get an evaluation if you have concerns.,
Visit your physician annually for a check-up.,
Get a mammogram regularly.",How to Defend Yourself Against Breast Cancer2," Regular breast self-examinations are not a reliable way to detect early signs of breast cancer. However, they are still a useful tool for understanding the normal condition of your breasts, and in some cases can help you detect changes that may be linked to breast cancer or other conditions.Ask your doctor to demonstrate the proper way to conduct a breast exam, and what to look and feel for during the exam.
To perform the exam, hold your right arm above your head and gently feel your right breast and nipple area with your left hand. Move around your breast in a circular pattern with your fingers. Feel for any lumps or tissue that seems irregular compared to the rest of your breast tissue. Repeat the process and examine your left breast.

, Look for bulges, lopsidedness, or any dimpling that may occur when you raise your arm above your head.

, If you menstruate, be aware of normal changes in your breasts that are related to your menstrual cycle. Try to perform your regular breast exams at a time when your breasts are not tender or enlarged due to menstruation or pre-menstrual symptoms.

, If you notice any changes or symptoms that you find worrisome, contact your doctor, even if you aren’t due for your regular exam.

, During your regular check-up, your doctor will perform a breast examination, during which they will check for breast tissue irregularities. If you have noticed any lumps or bumps, let your doctor know.

, In general, doctors recommend regular mammograms for women 40 years of age and older. Early detection is possible through mammograms and can assist in the diagnosis of breast cancer sooner in order to start effective treatment.Women at high risk for developing breast cancer may need to start getting mammograms at a younger age.
Depending on your lifestyle and family history, your doctor may recommend a mammogram annually or at some other interval.
Since men rarely develop breast cancer, doctors do not typically recommend mammograms for men. However, if you are a man experiencing possible breast cancer symptoms, such as a lump in your breast, your doctor may wish to perform a mammogram as part of your diagnostic exam."
"
Look at your family history.,
Get tested for BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic mutations.,
Look at your personal health history.,
Look at your history of medical treatments and medications.",How to Defend Yourself Against Breast Cancer3," Some people have a genetic predisposition for breast cancer. If there is a history of breast cancer in your family, you may be at risk. Look at the history of both sides of your family (mother’s and father’s), since the genetic predisposition for breast cancer can come from either side.The same genes that are linked to breast cancer are also linked to other kinds of cancer. Make note of any history of ovarian, pancreatic, or high grade prostate cancer in your family.
Let your doctor know if there is a history of any of these types of cancer in your family.

, Mutations to these genes can make you extra susceptible to breast cancer and certain other types of cancer. It is especially important to test for these mutations if there is a history of breast and ovarian cancer in your family., Aside from genetic predisposition, there are other factors that could be related to your personal risk for breast cancer. Talk to your doctor if you have any of the following risk factors:Age: Women over 50 are more likely to develop breast cancer.
Dense breasts: Women with breasts that are “dense” or high in connective tissue (as opposed to fatty tissue) have an elevated risk of developing breast cancer.
Early menstruation: If you began menstruating at the age of 12 or younger, you may be at slightly higher risk for developing breast cancer.
No pregnancy, or pregnancy late in life: If you have never been pregnant, or became pregnant for the first time after the age of 30, you may have a slightly increased risk for breast cancer.
A previous history of breast cancer or non-cancerous breast diseases.

, Some medical procedures and medications can also increase your risk of developing breast cancer. Talk to your physician if you have used any of these medicines or undergone any of these medical procedures:Hormone therapy (e.g. hormone replacement therapy after menopause) or hormonal contraceptives (e.g. birth control pills).
Radiation therapy for other cancers of the chest and breasts.
The drug diethylstilbestrol (DES), a drug that was sometimes administered to pregnant women between 1940 and 1971.

Exercise your ear regularly.",How to Train Your Ear," Hearing loss is the third most common problem in the US and can result from overexposure to chronic loud noise, like the kind you might listen to with headphones.Damaged hearing can even limit your physical ability to hear a certain range of sound or cause a persistent ringing in your ears.


Defend your ears by listening to music at moderate to low volumes and wearing ear plugs around loud, chronic noises, like a construction site.
Sounds as loud or louder than normal traffic can be harmful to your hearing.;
, Music is represented by a set of rules, referred to as music theory, and by knowing these rules you can help your mind interpret the sounds you hear. Understanding that a basic chord has at least three notes in it, for example, will help your ear pick out the three different tones. You'll want to have a functional understanding of:


The musical staff and bass and treble clefs. The staff is comprised of five lines and four spaces that represent the notes in a scale, with each line/space corresponding to a white key on the keyboard. A treble clef, which is shaped similar to an ""and"" sign (&), or a bass clef, shaped similarly to a backwards C, start each staff.Ledger lines. Ledger lines are small lines drawn above above or below the five line, four space staff to represent notes that are higher or lower than the common notes of the regular staff.Common intervals. Music is arranged according to lines of a staff or, comparable, to the white and black keys of a keyboard. The distance between the two neighboring white keys is a whole step, also called a second. Black keys represent half steps between white key whole step intervals.A major third, like the interval between C and E, is made up of two whole steps (C, D, E) or four half steps (C, C#, D, D#, E).
Scale degrees, which are the special names for notes your scale. These names, starting from the root of a major scale like C major, are: tonic, supertonic, mediant, subdominant, dominant, submediant, with the seventh interval called a leading tone if the interval between it and the tonic is a whole step or subtonic if that interval is a half step., There are many goals you might want to accomplish over the course of your ear training. One of the most impressive is ""perfect pitch,"" which is where an individual can identify and recreate a musical tone without any point of reference.Even among master musicians, perfect pitch is rare, but more reasonably you might hope to gain:


The ability to identify intervals, musical keys, and/or recreate notes from memory.
The ability to tune pitches by telling if they are sharp or flat.
The ability to imagine the sound of music from notes without a point of reference.

, Different regions and cultures produce different kinds of music, and knowing these will further expand the powers of your musical ear. Some Asiatic music is based around a five note scale, called pentatonic, while Western music is characterized by an eight note scale.Listening to classical music can expose your ear to many difficult and intricate composition. There are also many difficult intervals that are infrequently occurring in contemporary music that are more common in a classic style, like opera.
Sing along to your favorite pop artists in the car. Though you should be careful when doing this, as it is easy to pump the volume of your favorite tunes and sing too loudly, which can lead to vocal strain., Throughout the process of mastering an instrument, you will be exposed to musical theory and practical exercises. Your practical exercises likely take the form of learning specific songs for practice. Through these songs you'll gain a better understanding and intuition of how notes work within a piece of music.


Studying piano will familiarize you with both treble and bass clefs, as well as different keys and styles. Due to its versatility, this instrument is considered by some to be ideal for studying and training music theory.

, A professional musician has years of experience tuning instruments, listening to music, and hitting pitches spot on in the hopes of creating the best possible music. Working with such a person will be an invaluable resource for developing your ear.

, The great thing about the ""Do, Re, Mi"" scale, called solfege, is that it can be done without an instrument. Moveable solfege is frequently used by vocalists, as it teaches you relative pitch with relation to the scale of notes for the key in which you are singing.If you already know the solfege scale and only need a refresher, check out how to sight sing.
The basic solfege scale is: Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Do. Like the notes of a normal musical scale, these tones repeat at every octave (eight note) interval.
Practice by starting your solfege scale on the root of your key. For example, you could start ""Do"" on C, and with each white note interval up the keyboard, you ascend the solfege scale.

, If you know how chords and scales naturally develop from a root note, like C, you will be able to recognize more complicated arrangements of notes.For example, if you are already well familiar with a diminished chord, once you hear the tonic (root note) of it, you will be able to predict, either with your voice, your instrument, or in your head, the sound of that chord.


Practicing scales and arpeggios encourage ear training by conditioning it to innately know and predict the flow of notes through a piece of music.Some might believe scales boring, but true musicians know the value of this kind of practice., Singing is something you are able to do most of the time when you're on your own. Choose a note and start practicing your own made-up melody. Try to include intervals or chord structure you have learned, like augmented chords.


Do this frequently to gain greater familiarity and mastery over your mental representation of the sounds you have learned.

, This can help you better internalize the role of that instrument in the music. You might sing along with the rhythm of the bass, or follow along with a reoccurring cymbal.Singing along with specific instruments also challenges your ear, as you will have to listen to the sound carefully to match it.

, Check that you are maintaining your pitch either with a tuned instrument, a digital pitch tuner, or a pitch pipe.

, There are a few ear training apps available now that are designed to test and analyze your musical ear. Some even include ear training exercises.You should investigate these through an online search before purchasing; some might be oriented toward sound engineers and not necessarily students of music.

, Training your ear to a certain level may take a very long time. Professional musicians train their entire careers to perfect their musical ear. Even so, perfect pitch is still something of a mystery to scientists and will likely take you much practice for you to attain., If you're a vocalist, this might entail putting on some soft music and singing along with it, or if you're an instrumentalist you might sit down at your instrument after breakfast every day. Hearing the movement of sound among intervals will reinforce these in your mind.

, These experts can help you fine tune your technique, but they can also point out areas where your musical ear might be weak.Once you've identified a specific problem, like difficulty hitting high C because it's close to the top of your vocal range, you can practice it until you improve.

, Once your ear for music improves, you should challenge it often, either at your instrument or with your voice. Use your imagination to recreate sounds that you have heard, try to capture the quality of sound exactly in your head.


You might start with a tonal element that's easier to hear, like the root of the chord. Then you can add new tones to it with an instrument, or move vocally from that root to discover the other tones that are a part of the chord progression.

Try the skull-thumping trick.,
Try waiting it out.",How to Stop Ringing in Ears1," If you're coming home from a concert or a club, and your ears won't stop ringing, it's because you've damaged some of the little hairs in your cochlea, which causes inflammation and stimulation of nerves. Your brain interprets this inflammation as constant ringing or buzzing, and this trick can help make that annoying sound go away.


Cover your ears with your palms. Your fingers should be pointed back and resting on the back of your skull. Point your middle fingers toward each other at the very back of your skull.
Rest your index fingers on top of your middle fingers.
Using a snapping motion, flip your index fingers down off your middle fingers and onto the back of the skull. This motion will sound like the beating of drums. Because the fingers will also hit your skull, the noise may be quite loud. This is normal.
Continue snapping your fingers onto the back of your skull 40 to 50 times. After 40 or 50 times, see if the ringing has subsided.;
, Ringing in the ears that is caused by exposure to loud noises usually goes away after a few hours. Take your mind off it by resting and staying away from anything that might exacerbate the symptoms. If the ringing doesn't go away after 24 hours, visit the doctor for further treatment.

Swimmer's ear (otitis externa), an inflammation, irritation, or infection of the outer ear canal caused by water that remains inside the ear after swimming.Ear infections (otitis media), a bacterial or viral infection of the middle ear caused by fluid buildup behind the eardrum after an upper respiratory illness.
A buildup of ear wax inside the ear.A sinus infection.Arthritis in the jaw.Pressure-induced ear damage (commonly due to extreme changes in altitude).A ruptured eardrum.Temporomandibular joint syndrome (TMJ), in which the joints on either side of the head are stressed or damaged.Ménière's disease, an affliction of the inner ear that causes problems hearing and maintaining balance. Ménière's disease is believed to be caused by high pressure in the inner ear. Ménière's disease flareups may happen on a daily basis or as infrequently as once per year.;
, Tinnitus, the medical term for ringing or buzzing in the ears in the absence of external sound, is quite common in short bursts for most people. However, prolonged or chronic ringing in the ears may be a sign of tinnitus. Objective tinnitus, a rare condition, is caused by either a disorder of the blood vessels, an inner ear bone condition, or by muscle contractions. Doctors can observe objective tinnitus during an examination (hence the name). Subjective tinnitus, the more common condition, is only audible to the patient, and may be caused by damage to the outer, middle, or inner ear, or by damaged auditory nerves.Consult a physician immediately if you experience ringing in the ears after sustaining a head injury or in conjunction with unexplained symptoms such as vertigo, nausea and vomiting. Common causes of subjective tinnitus include:


Ear infectionsBuildup of wax or the insertion of foreign objects into the earPermanent hearing damage caused by loud noisesMénière's disease, If an earache lasts longer than 10 to 14 days, it may be a sign of a more serious medical problem, and you should seek medical assistance. If left untreated, chronic ear infections could cause permanent hearing lossor irreversible damage to the ear canal and tissue or bones at the base of the skull.Call an ambulance or go to the emergency room if you experience:


Seizures
Decreased consciousness
Severe confusion
Facial weakness, loss of voice, or difficulty swallowing associated with an earache or inner-ear damage
Blood or discharge from the ear.

, Children are more likely to experience earaches and ear infections, especially after a cold or flu.Children with ear infections may experience pain (indicated by crying or pulling at the ears), trouble sleeping, fever, fluid discharge, or difficulty hearing or maintaining balance.There are several ways to prevent ear infections in children:


Avoid air travel with a child or infant who has a cold. The change in pressure may exacerbate the symptoms and could lead to an infection.Do not use cotton swabs to clean your child's ear. Cotton swabs can push wax deeper into the ear canal, and if pushed too far, may cause irreversible damage to the ear drums.Instead, clean the outer ear with a soft, wet towel to remove wax and dirt.
Get your child vaccinated with the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13), which protects against pneumococcal disease and meningitis. The PCV13 vaccine has been shown to reduce the occurrence of infections in the ear and blood, and reduce infant mortality in children.Avoid exposing children to cigarette smoke. Exposure to smoke has been linked to increased occurrence of ear infections in infants and young children.Limit your child's exposure to sick children. And keep clean hands, both on you and your child., If symptoms persist for more than one to two weeks or begin to affect your ability to work, drive, eat, or sleep, you may want to see an ENT specialist. ENT physicians, called otolaryngologists, can diagnose problems related to the ears, nose, and throat, and can perform corrective surgeries.Your EMT may recommend a myringotomy, a surgical procedure in which fluid trapped in the middle ear is drained out.An EMT can also prescribe ear drops and other medication to treat the causes of pain and discomfort in the ears.

, Swabs can push earwax deeper into the ear canal, and if pushed in too deep, may rupture or otherwise damage the eardrums, causing permanent hearing damage. Doctors recommend avoiding the insertion of any objects into the ear, as anything may cause these problems., Using a few drops of mineral oil, baby oil, or over-the-counter ear drops can help break up ear wax. Wait about 15 to 30 minutes for the oil to take effect. Once the wax is softened, use a bulb syringe filled with warm water to gently irrigate your ears, flushing out the wax from inside.Squeeze the air out of the bulb syringe.
While still squeezing the bulb, submerge it in lukewarm water. Then release the bulb to let it fill with water. Do not use cold water, as this may cause dizziness.Do not use hot water, as this may cause burns and damage the delicate inner ear.
Tilt your head so that the ear you intend to flush is angled downward.
Lift the bulb syringe to your ear and hold it to your ear, just barely touching the ear itself. Do not try to insert the bulb syringe into your ear canal.
Gently squeeze the bulb to release the lukewarm water into your ear canal.
Repeat as necessary., Set a hair dryer to the lowest setting and keep it at least one foot (30 centimeters) away from your head. Angle your head sideways while blow-drying to help facilitate the flow of excess water., If you have frequent or recurring ear problems, you may want to schedule a monthly ear cleaning with your doctor or ENT specialist. Depending on the particulars of your ear and wax situation, your ENT specialist may do any of the following during a professional ear-cleaning session:


Use ear drops and a bulb syringe to loosen wax and flush out your earsUse a small suction device to vacuum out ear wax.Ear wax vacuums should only be used by professionals. Do not attempt to vacuum your ears at home.
Use a small looped instrument called a curette to gently scoop wax out from inside the ear.Curettes should only be used by professionals. Do not attempt to use a curette at home.

, Inflammation, which is the body's immunological response to anything it perceives as a foreign object, has been linked to a number of health problems, and can be prevented or reduced by avoiding certain foods.Foods known to cause inflammation include:


Refined carbohydrates
Fried foods
Soda, and other foods and beverages with added sugar
Red meat and processed meat
Oily foods like margarine and lard, Patients with chronic ear problems, especially Ménière's disease, should reduce daily sodium consumption to around 1,500 to 2,000 milligrams to reduce inflammation and fluid pressure in the inner ear., Staying hydrated goes hand-in-hand with maintaining a low-sodium diet. Inner ear conditions like endolymphatic hydrops, a condition associated with changes in the quantity or pressure of inner-ear fluid, can be triggered by dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.Most experts recommend drinking eight 8-oz glasses of water everyday to stay adequately hydrated.But depending on factors such as environment and activity, you may need to drink a little bit more.Don't overdo it. Your body can ""overdose"" on water. Drinking too much water dilutes the level of salt that is in your blood, which leads to a deadly condition called hyponatremia.It's best to sip on water throughout the day, in small increments, to safely avoid dehydration. Many experts warn that by the time you feel profoundly thirsty, your body may already be experiencing some degree of dehydration., Sleep allows the body time to rest and heal, but recently researchers have linked hearing loss in some patients with nocturnal disturbance caused by sleep apnea.Additionally, tinnitus has been linked with inadequate sleep, which reinforces the need for adequate, restful sleep every night., Vitamins C and B have shown promise in reducing the symptoms of tinnitus,while vitamin E is known to help with cell repair and has been shown in some studies to actually restore hearing in patients who experienced sudden hearing loss.You can get vitamin C from natural food sources like citrus, tomatoes, and berries.
You can get vitamin E from spinach, broccoli, and vegetable oils.
Try taking daily vitamin supplements to help you meet the recommended daily allowance of each vitamin.

, Research has shown that magnesium, found in leafy green vegetables like spinach and in over-the-counter supplements, may help protect the auditory system and reduce the symptoms of tinnitus.The current recommended daily intake of magnesium is 400 milligrams for adult males, 310 milligrams for adult females, 350 milligrams for pregnant adult females, and 310 milligrams for lactating adult females.Your doctor may recommend a higher or lower dosage, depending on your age and other health-related factors. Consult with your physician before beginning any supplement regimen.

, Zinc is an essential mineral found in many natural sources like seafood, cheese, poultry, and red meat. Some studies have shown that taking a zinc supplement in patients with a severe zinc deficiency may help reduce the occurrence of middle-ear infections, though more research is needed in that area.The current recommended daily intake of zinc is 11 milligrams for adult males, 8 milligrams for adult females, 11 milligrams for pregnant adult females, and 12 milligrams for lactating adult females.Your doctor may recommend a higher or lower dosage, depending on your age and other health-related factors. Consult with your physician before beginning any supplement regimen.

, Try using a warm towel, a warm water bottle, or a bag of warm salt on the ear--just make sure the compress is not too hot.Repeat as necessary, holding it to the ear for a few minutes at a time. This should bring immediate relief., Tea tree oil is occasionally used by veterinarians to treat ear infections in dogs.Human patients wanting to try it on an earache should use caution, as tea tree oil may irritate the skin.Dilute tea tree oil before applying to ears. You can use water, if you like. One popular remedy calls for mixing three drops of tea tree oil with two tablespoons of olive oil and a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar. Use a dropper to apply the mixture to the affected ear.
Do not use tea tree oil in your ears if you have ear tubes, as it may cause inflammation and irritation.Do not use tea tree oil if you are pregnant, as it may cause complications during contractions., Otikon is a plant extract that has been used as a mild anesthetic to reduce the pain caused by ear infections. However, some plants containing Otikon may have adverse side effects. It's best to consult with a physician or pharmacist before trying this or any herbal remedy., Swallowing and yawning are known to open up the eustachian tube, removing pressure and reducing ear pain.The Valsalva Maneuver may be helpful to clear up ear pressure, although you should not do this when you are experiencing ear pain. Hold your nose and then blow as though you were blowing your nose. You should feel your ears ""pop."", Chewing gum has been shown to help relieve ear pressure, much like yawning and swallowing., Aspirin should only be administered if the sufferer is an adult. Aspirin is a safe and effective pain reliever and anti-inflammatory agent.Take one to two tablets every four to six hours as needed. Follow the instructions on the label for guidelines on how much aspirin is safe to consume in a 24 hour period.Aspirin should never be given to children or teenagers due to the link between aspirin and Reye's syndrome in children and adolescents. Reye's syndrome is rare, but it can be very serious, causing the liver and brain to swell.Consult your child's pediatrician for a safe alternative pain reliever to give to your child.

, If your pain persists despite your use of natural treatments, see a doctor. You should also see a doctor as soon as possible if you experience discharge from your ear, such as fluid, pus, or blood.If your child has an ear ache that does not go away within one day, see your pediatrician."

, Any kind of drainage from the ear can indicate an ear infection. However, look for drainage with color--yellow or green. Also, if the drainage smells bad, that could also indicate an ear infection., If you have pain in your ear, it could indicate an ear infection. If you press on your ear and the pain worsens, that's even more likely to be an indicator of an ear infection.In severe cases, pain may begin spreading across your face, which means you need to get to a doctor immediately, as the infection is spreading., Look at your ear closely in a mirror. If you can see some redness, that may also indicate an ear infection., Hearing loss is a more advanced symptom of ear infections, so if you begin to notice your hearing going in an ear along with other symptoms, that is definitely a reason to see a doctor.At its most advanced stage, your ear canal will be blocked completely., If your ear or lymph nodes swell, that is a far progression of an ear infection. Another advanced symptom is a fever., Even mild ear infections can progress quickly, so it's important to see your doctor if you have a combination of these symptoms., If you have fever along with other symptoms or you are in a lot of pain, you should see a doctor immediately if possible., Cleaning your ear allows the medicine to get where it needs to go. Your doctor may suction your ear out, or she may use an ear curette to gently scoop and scrape out your ear., Your doctor will most likely write you a prescription for antibiotic drops that include neomycin. You will then use the drops in your ear to reduce the infection.There is a very low risk of hearing loss from amino-glycosides, including neomycin. This medicine usually given in combination with polymyxin B and hydrocortisone a solution that is to be applied to the outer ear canal 4 drops 3-4 times a day as long as prescribed. Neomycin can also cause contact dermatitis.If your ear is too blocked, you may need a wick placed in your ear, which will help deliver the drops to your ear.To use the ear drops, warm up the bottle in your hand first. The easiest way to put them in is to tilt your head to the side or lie down.Lie on your side for 20 minutes or place a cotton ball over ear canal. Do not touch the dropper or tip to your ear or any other surface, as that can contaminate the liquid.If you have trouble getting them in the right place, ask someone to help you., Your doctor may also prescribe acetic acid drops, which are a form of vinegar.However, they are stronger than your average household vinegar.These drops help recreate your ear's normal antibacterial state.Apply these as you did the other ear drops.

, If your ear infection is more severe, especially if it's moved beyond the ear, you will need to take antibiotics by mouth.Finish the entire course of antibiotics. You should begin to feel better 36 to 48 hours after starting treatment, and completely better in 6 days.
Some infections are caused by fungus instead of bacteria. In that case, you'll need to take antifungal pills rather than antibiotics.If you are immunocompetent, Having a normal immune response topical treatment is favored over oral treatment.

, If your ear is inflamed, you may need to have a round of corticosteroids to help. They can also help if itching is bothering you., Once you are home, you can take pain medications such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. They should help with the pain., Though this treatment may not be as effective as prescription medications, you can create your own solution of saltwater or one part water to one part vinegar. Warm whichever one you chose up to body temperature before pouring it in using a bulb syringe. Let it drain out afterwards.

, A little heat, such as a heating pad on low or a damp washcloth heated in the microwave, can help ease pain. Hold it to your ear while you're sitting up.You don't want to fall asleep on a heating pad, as you can burn yourself., Use these ear drops when you first notice itching. Apply them both before and after you swim., You will need to keep your ear as dry as possible while you are recovering from your infection. Tilt your head away from the water even while showering., When you get out of the swimming pool, use a towel to dry your ears thoroughly. These infections thrive in moist environments, so drying out your ear can help prevent infection.Skip the cotton-tipped swabs, though, as these can increase your chances of contracting the infection., Before swimming, put ear plugs in your ears. Ear plugs will help keep your ears dry while swimming., Mix 1 part vinegar to 1 part rubbing alcohol. Drop about a teaspoon into your ear. Tilt your head so it pours back out.Check with your doctor before using this solution, as it is not recommended for people with punctured eardrums.You can also apply the mixture before swimming.The purpose is to keep you ear as dry as possible and as free of bacteria as possible., If the water at the swimming pool looks murky or dirty, don't get in it. Also, skip swimming in lakes or the ocean., If you spray on hair spray or use hair dye, put cotton in your ears first. These products can irritate your ears, so protecting your ears against them can reduce your chances of outer ear infections., While may be tempting to try to unblock your ear with an ear candle, they actually do not help all that much. Plus, they can severely damage your ear."

Feed your baby in an upright position.,
Reduce the exposure to tobacco smoke.,
Limit the exposure to others who are ill. Having a viral upper respiratory infection increases the risk of developing otitis media due to fluid from the viral infection blocking the eustachian tube.,
Make sure your child is up to date on his or her vaccinations, including a yearly flu shot.",How to Treat a Middle Ear Infection," The middle ear is an air filled, mucous-lined cavity between the outside of the body and the inner ear. Draining the middle ear is the Eustachian tube which also normalizes pressure between the outside and the inside of the body. Between the middle ear and the outer ear is the tympanic membrane.Middle ear infections, also called acute otitis media, occur when the Eustachian tube becomes blocked from swelling, inflammation, fluid from a viral upper respiratory infection, or irritation related to allergies, excess mucous and saliva during teething, infected or enlarged adenoids and tobacco smoke.;
, Specific risk factors include being between the age of 18 months and six years, attending daycare, and tobacco smoke in the home. Children who use a pacifier and who are fed directly from a bottle and not breastfed are also at higher risk, because the action can change the flow of fluid in the Eustachian tube.People are more susceptible in the fall and winter months, if you have underlying medical conditions such as allergies, and if your family has a history of infections. Many ear infections occur during or right after a viral upper respiratory infection.

, Infection in the middle ear will increase the pressure, which causes the pain. This can cause the child to be more irritable and to cry more. When lying down, chewing, or sucking, that pressure increases, which also increases the pain.Children may tug or pull at their ears in an attempt to relieve the pressure and pain. Tugging on his ears does not always mean that your child has an ear infection.


The infection can also cause difficulty hearing or trouble responding to sounds. When the middle ear fills with bacteria and fluid in an infection, it reduces the transmission of sound waves and affects hearing.

, There are numerous symptoms of these infections besides ear pain. You may have a fever over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, a headache, a loss of appetite, clumsiness, and trouble with balance. Infection in the middle ear will cause the body temperature to rise as the immune system fights the infection. Headache and loss of appetite may be commonly associated with fever.Ear infections can also cause vomiting or diarrhea.There may also be fluid drainage from the ear. If the pressure in the middle ear builds up high enough and the Eustachian tube is not open enough to allow drainage, the tympanic membrane may rupture. After it ruptures, thick fluid will drain from the ear and the person will no longer experience pain from the pressure.See your doctor if you think your child may have ruptured their tympanic membrane.

, The American Academy of Family Physicians recommend that physicians take a “wait and see” approach to the treatment of otitis media in many cases. Most infections will resolve spontaneously within two weeks with the pain significantly reduced within three to four days.Watch children aged 6 months to 23 months who have a temperature less than 102.2 °F (39 °C), have only mild ear pain in one ear, and who have symptoms less than 48 hours.
Watch children 24 months or older who have mild pain in one or both ears with a temperature of less than 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit and symptoms less than 48 hours.
Children with the following medical conditions are not candidates for a “wait and see” approach: children with cleft palate, children with Down’s Syndrome, children with underlying immune system disorders, children under six months old, and children with a history of recurrent middle ear infections.

, In some circumstances, the physician will recommend antibiotics at the first visit for treatment of an ear infection, especially for infants under six months, children with moderate to severe pain, children with a temp of 102.2 Fahrenheit or higher, or children from six months to 23 months with bilateral ear infections. Secondary effects from a middle ear infection in a child or an adult can result in an infection in another part of the head and even the brain, permanent hearing loss, or paralysis of a nerve in the face.Although the antibiotics will address the growth of bacteria in the middle ear, it takes a couple of days for reduction in pressure and the pain to get better.Watch for side effects from antibiotics.Some children can experience nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea from the use of antibiotics.

, Whether or not antibiotics are prescribed, the child or adult will continue to experience pain and pressure until the infection begins to clear. Relieve that pain using the following strategies:


Administer Tylenol or ibuprofen to help relieve the pain and reduce the fever. Consult with your physician about which over-the-counter medication is preferred and how much to give your child.Do not give aspirin to children as it has been linked to Reye’s Syndrome., You can use a warm cloth or warm water bottle over the affected ear to help the pain. Ensure that the heat will not burn the skin. If moist heat is used, the warm cloth should be in a water tight plastic bag.Applying warm, moist heat over the external ear can increase the risk of a swimmer’s ear infection.

, If there is extreme pain, ask your doctor for ear drops that can help. These can be used only if the eardrum or tympanic membrane has not ruptured. If it has, the medication or drops can get inside the middle ear and cause damage.Many of the drops that were used in the past have been taken off of the market and are no longer available. Ask your doctor if drops can or should be used for your child.

, Garlic has antimicrobial effects and can help fight the infection naturally. Slightly warmed olive oil can soothe the tympanic membrane and reduce pain and inflammation.


Nothing should be used in the external ear if the person has tubes placed in the eardrum or if you suspect the eardrum has ruptured. Oils, medications (unless prescribed specifically for a ruptured eardrum), or pain ear drops should not enter the middle ear.
Never use oil that is too warm because it can burn the ear. The oil should be tested against the inner wrist.

, Limit the activities of the affected person based on how she feels. A middle ear infection is not life-threatening and doesn’t require that you restrict all activities. If she feels up to going out, then it’s fine to go out. The same is true for adults.


If the child is not cranky and appears up to the activity planned, there is no reason not to continue with the plans.

, These are surgically placed tubes in the ears of children with chronic otitis media. They are used to relieve the pressure, allow drainage, and allow reduced fluid build up in the middle ear to reduce the number of ear infections.Although the placement of the tubes is minor surgery, the procedure carries surgical risks that are related to the use of anesthesia, including harm to the vocal cords, trauma to the teeth or tongue, temporary mental confusion, heart attack, lung infection, and rarely, death.The risks of anesthesia are low in healthy children and adults, but higher in people who have other underlying medical conditions.

, Never put your child to bed with a bottle. Lying down and drinking from a bottle increases the risk that fluid will reflux up the Eustachian tube and create an environment for bacterial growth and a middle ear infection.The lower the baby’s head during feeding, the greater risk there is for formula to reflux into the eustachian tubes and increase the risk of infection.

, Cigarettes and other smoking tobacco products increase the inflammatory response in the Eustachian tubes and therefore the risk of a middle ear infection. Limit your child's contact with people who smoke. If you have the infection, do not smoke and avoid enclosed spaces with those who do. , By limiting exposure to other sick children, you reduce the risk that you or your child will experience a middle ear infection.Don't send your child to school or daycare if he has a fever.

, Ear infections are common after infection with the flu. Some of the most common bacteria that cause ear infections can be reduced by vaccination, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenza."

Assess your risk.,
Watch for symptoms of a perforated eardrums besides draining.,
Look for draining.,
See a doctor.,
Review other treatments options if the perforated eardrum does not heal on its own.,
Take care at home.,
Get prompt treatment for any ear infections.,
Protect your ears when flying.,
Do not place foreign objects in the ear.,
Stay away from excessive noise.",How to Tell if Your Ear Is Starting to Drain," If you notice any subtle changes in hearing, assess whether this could be a warning sign of a perforated eardrum. Figure out whether or not you're at risk for a perforated eardrum.


If you've had any ear infections recently, particularly a middle ear infection, you are at an increased risk for a perforated eardrum. Pressure from the fluid buildup associated with ear infections in this region can press against an eardrum, causing a rupture.If you've recently been exposed to unusually loud sound, like a loud concert or a loud explosion, you're at increased risk. A particularly big sound wave can cause damage to the eardrum, resulting in a tear or hole.If you recently cottons swabs or hairpins to remove something from your ear, this can cause a rupture.Severe head injuries can also caused perforated eardrums, as can any increase in pressure, such as deep sea diving.;
, Oftentimes, you will not notice draining from the ear initially. It could still be occurring deep in the ear canal. There are other symptoms you should watch for that may point to a perforated eardrum and, in turn, a draining ear.


As your eardrum is ruptured, you may experience dizziness that is especially noticeable when moving. This may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting if the vertigo is severe.You may experience mild hearing loss or a ringing in your ear., The drainage that comes from your ear during a perforated eardrum may be clear. It also may contain pus or blood. You may not notice it as it might remain in the back of your ear. Therefore, watch your pillow for any discharge. Examine the outside of your ear, like the lobe, for any flakes. You should not stick anything, such as a q-tip, into your ear to check for damage. You're at an increased risk for infection and outside objects may carry bacteria., If you notice your ear is draining, see a doctor. A perforated eardrum usually heals on it own. However, your doctor will likely want to examine your ear to check for signs of infection. He or she may prescribe antibiotics to treat an existing infection or to decrease your risk of infection., Most of the time, a perforated eardrum will heal on its own. However, if symptoms do not improve with time talk to your doctor about other treatment options.


An ear, nose, and throat specialist may recommend you get an eardrum patch. This is a patch placed over your ear that releases certain chemicals to promote healing. An ENT will need to put the patch on in the office. You may need to undergo the procedure more than once until it's successful.An ENT may recommend surgery if a patch is unsuccessful. Usually, a tiny graft of your own skin will be used to close the eardrum. Usually, the surgery is simple enough that you can go home the same day it's conducted., When you get home, there are ways you should care for your ear. Follow certain procedures to promote healing.


Keep your ear dry. Put in a waterproof ear plug when showering or bathing.
Avoid cleaning your ears. You should not use q-tips or other items to clean your ears until healing is complete.
Do not blow your nose. The pressure of blowing your nose can cause damage to your eardrum., Earache, fever, loss of hearing, and nasal congestion are all causes of ear infections. If you experience any of these symptoms, seek medical care as soon as possible. Promptly dealing with ear infections can prevent the development of a perforated eardrum., The changes in air pressure that come with air travel can damage the eardrum. You need to protect your ears when flying to prevent a perforated eardrum.


You can buy pressure-equalizing ear plugs at a local drug store. You can use these during touch down and lift off to prevent eardrum damage when flying.You can also do things like chew gum and yawn in order to pop your ears when flying., You should never place foreign objects out of your ears. Only use q-tips or hair pins to remove wax on the side of the hole in your inner ear. Hardened wax stuck deep in the ear can be removed with ear irrigation kits you can purchase at a drugstore or can be removed by a medical professional., Excessive noise can harm your ears. It cannot just cause draining, but long-term hearing loss and damage. Wear ear plugs if you work in an environment where you're exposed to excess noise."
"
Tug gently on your ears.,
Consider tapers.,
Try taping for gradual adjustments.,
Avoid silicone and double flared jewelry.,
Don't stretch too fast.,
Stop if you feel pain.,
Stretch your ears at different speeds, if necessary.,
Massage with oil regularly.,
Use saline solution.,
Downsize immediately in the event of bleeding or significant pain.,
Resume wearing jewelry a few weeks after stretching.",How to Stretch Your Ears Pain Free," Before you make any decisions regarding the method you'll use to stretch your ears, consider how much you want to stretch them. If you're only moving up a size, the most pain-free option would be gently pulling your ears until they stretched out enough to accommodate new earrings. If you're looking to stretch your ears considerably, however, explore other options., Tapering is the most common method to stretch out your ears. If done correctly, this method is relatively painless.


Tapers are sets of rods that gradually increase in diameter. To stretch your ears, you would get a set of tapers, push the taper all the way through the hole, and replace it with a gauge the same size as the end of the taper. By the time you complete the set, your ears should be stretched as large as you want.Never wear tapers as jewelry. This will make your ears heal unevenly because of uneven weight distribution.
Some people use spiral gauges as tapers, they can be work for long periods of time and allow for longer stretching periods , If you want to stretch your ears slowly, consider taping. This allows you to gradually stretch your ears, which can reduce pain, but in smaller increments than you would use with tapers.


To tape, use non-adhesive tape. Wrap this tape around the parts of your earrings entering your ear. Increase by one or two layers at a time until you've stretched your ears to your desired diameter.Wash your earrings after taping to prevent infection., You should not wear silicone plugs until your ears are fully stretched and healed. If used when stretching, silicone can tear the lining of the ears and potentially cause infection. Double flared jewelry as flares are sometimes large enough to cause pain and possible permanent damage to your ear., Moving too fast through the stretching process is one of the biggest causes of pain. Regardless of your chosen method, wait until your ears have healed before stretching them further. Stretching too quickly can have serious consequences, such as a “blowout”, in which the inside of a stretched hole is forced out the back of the piercing as a result of too much pressure. This can result in permanent disfigurement and damage of the ear lobe.Another complication from advancing size too quickly or enlarging ear lobe beyond the remaining blood supply rim is that the skin edges will separate or tear. Surgery would be required to correct this.
Advancing size too quickly increases risk of infections.How long you should wait between tapers or sizes varies. People heal at different rates, for one, and it also depends on how much you're stretching; however, it's recommended to give your ears at least a month to get used to one size before moving up.Only increase size in 1-millimeter increments (for example, from 1 mm to 2 mm).Never skip a size when stretching. If you don't feel a lot of pain, you may feel overeager and want to skip up to a higher size to speed up the process; however, this increases the chance of causing permanent damage to your ears. Even if you feel confident, skipping sizes is a bad idea., Pain when sizing up is a sign something is wrong. If you have intense pain, resistance, or bleeding when inserting a new taper or adding another layer of tape, you should stop. Your ear is not fully healed and sizing up now could cause damage. Stay at your current size and wait a week before attempting to size up., While it may look and feel awkward, your ears may heal at different rates. If one ear is taking slightly longer, there's no medical reason why you can't stretch your ears at different rates. In fact, if one ear is more tender than the other it's better to slow down for the sake of avoiding damage., Once your ears are stretched to your desired diameter, some tingling and soreness is common. You can help lessen pain by massaging your ears regularly. Wait a few days after the initial stretching before massaging to avoid infection. Use a small amount of your chosen massage oil, which you can buy online or at a local beauty shop, and gently rub into your ears. Do this on a regular basis, a few times a day, until discomfort passes. This helps increase blood flow which can promote healing., Saline solution, which can be purchased at most drug stores, can also help soothe ears after stretching. Use such foams or sprays sparingly, and only once or twice daily. If you notice any side effects, like increased soreness, cease use.You can make your own saline solution by combining 1/8 teaspoon of salt to a cup of warm water.Rubbing alcohol and hydrogen peroxide should be avoided on a healing ear.

, If you have pain or bleeding after sizing up, downsize immediately. Pain or bleeding in your ears is a sign something is wrong. It will not, like soreness or tingling, pass over on its own. You should move down a size in tapers or taping. If the soreness and bleeding persists, contact a doctor for evaluation., After you've stretched your ears to the desired diameter, wait a few weeks. If you do not have any trouble like soreness or bleeding, you can resume wearing jewelry. For the first few weeks, stick to jewelry made from silicone or organic materials. If you don't have any trouble with such materials, you can move on to double flared jewelry."

Familiarize yourself with Noise Reduction Ratings (NRR).,
Consider how long you will be needing hearing protection.,
Consult your employer.,
Consult a hearing specialist.",How to Select Hearing Protection1," NRR is the standard rating system across all hearing protection devices. Under NRR, hearing devices are classified by their potential to limit decibels (dB) in professional and occupational environments. NRRs are determined by both the American National Standards (ANSI) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Understanding this rating system will allow you better understand the noise you are exposed to as well as the type of protection you will need.The NRR should be easily readable on the back of the box your hearing protection was purchased in.
In order to determine the decibel level you are exposed to, subtract the NRR from the decibels in your environment. For example, if you are at a rock concert with a noise exposure of 100 dB and you are wearing earplugs with an NRR rating of 27 dB, you will be exposed to 73 dB.A general rule is that the higher the NRR the better the protection will be.;
, Deciding on and selecting hearing protection will often come down to the user’s choice. Understanding the job you will be doing, what the source of the noise is, and how long you will need to protect your hearing will give you the information you need to choose a type of protection.For example, if you a using a loud drill or jackhammer for hours you might prefer earplugs. However, if you are going to be exposed to noise intermittently, you might prefer earmuffs as they are easier to remove and put back into place.

, Your employer should be able to provide you with the necessary information about the type of noise you will be exposed to and how long you will be exposed to it. If it is not your employer’s policy to provide you with hearing protection ask them for recommendations of where to purchase the appropriate protection.


Regulatory bodies such as OSHA often state that employers must provide employees with safe tools and equipment, and also warn employees of hazardous materials or environments.Ask your employer to provide you with information regarding safe noise level exposures, or consult online resources, like OSHA.You can also look up hearing protection devices online. Many manufacturers have extensive informational resources that can help you choose the right protection for your job., Hearing specialists, also known as audiologists, can provide you with useful information regarding what preventative measures can be taken to preserve your hearing. See a specialist especially if you already have hearing impairment conditions as exposure to high volumes of noise can still damage your ears.


Ask your doctor for recommendations on hearing specialists.

See your doctor about treating underlying conditions.,
Treat tinnitus with noise-suppression tactics.,
Take medications to ameliorate some of the tinnitus symptoms.,
Try ginkgo extract.",How to Stop Ringing in Ears2," Much of the time, tinnitus, or ringing in the ears, is caused by a treatable condition. Treating this underlying condition may help remove some or all of the ringing.


Have your doctor remove earwax from your ear. Alternately, do it safely yourself. Removing an excess buildup of earwax can help relieve symptoms of tinnitus.
Have your doctor take a look at your blood vessels. Blood vessel conditions such as impaired blood circulation may make tinnitus worse.
Have your doctor re-examine the interactions of your medications. If you take several medications, talk with your doctor about possible side-effects that could be causing the ringing in your ears.

, Several different noise-suppression tactics are used by doctors to mask the sound of ringing in your ears. These tactics include the following devices and techniques.


Make use of white noise machines. White noise machines that produce ""background"" sounds, such as rain falling or wind whooshing, may help drown out the ringing in your ears.

Fans, humidifiers, dehumidifiers and air conditioners also serve as effective white noise machines.


Make use of masking devices. Masking devices are fitted over ears and produce a continuous wave of white noise to mask the chronic ringing.
Wear hearing aids. This is especially effective if you have hearing problems in addition to tinnitus.

, Although medications probably won't completely rid you of the ringing, taking medications can make the ringing sound less noticeable if effective.


Talk to your doctor about tricyclic antidepressants. Tricyclic antidepressants can be effective for severe tinnitus, but have some undesirable side-effects, such as dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation and heart problems.Talk to your doctor about Alprazolam. Better known as Xanax, Alprazolam has been shown to be effective in reducing tinnitus buzzing, but is habit-forming and also has undesirable side-effects.

, Taking ginkgo extract three times a day (with meals) may help increase blood flow to the head and neck, reducing the ringing caused by blood pressure.Try taking ginkgo for two months before evaluating the effectiveness of the treatment.

Avoid situations in which damage to the cochlea could cause tinnitus.,
Find an outlet for your stress.,
Consume less alcohol, caffeine and nicotine.,
Stay off the salt.",How to Stop Ringing in Ears3," Because tinnitus is so hard to treat, the most effective option is to avoid causing it in the first place, or avoid making the symptoms worse.The following may exacerbate the symptoms of tinnitus:Loud noises. Concerts are the main culprit, but construction work, traffic, airplanes, gunshots, fireworks, and other loud noises can also be harmful.
Swimming. Water and chlorine can get stuck in your inner ear while swimming, causing or intensifying your tinnitus. Keep this from happening by wearing earplugs while swimming.

, If you have constant ringing in your ears, any stress might make the condition worse. Find ways such as exercise, meditation, and massage therapy to relieve your stress., These substances increase the stress put on blood vessels by dilating them. This happens especially in the inner ear. Limit your intake of alcoholic beverages, coffee and caffeinated teas, and tobacco products to reduce the symptoms.

, Salt weakens your body's blood circulation, causing high blood pressure and making tinnitus potentially worse.

Try disposable earplugs for one time use.,
Use pre-molded reusable earplugs for a better seal.,
Use canal caps or hearing bands for convenience.,
Try earmuffs for more uniform use.,
Try wearing both earplugs and earmuffs for added protection.",How to Select Hearing Protection2," Disposable earplugs are made from a foam like substance and are meant for one-size-fits-all single-use applications. Compress the earplug, insert it into your ear, and let it expand until it has formed to your inner ear.Use disposable earplugs when your exposure to sound will limited and you plan on discarding them after one use.

, Pre-molded earplugs are often made from plastic, rubber, or silicone and come in custom sizes or “one size fits most.” The advantages of pre-molded earplugs are that they are cheap, reusable, convenient to carry, and more comfortable to use on hot days or compact spaces.Pre-molded earplugs come in small, medium, and large sizes.
Be aware that your ears are not identical and that you might need a different size plug for each ear.

, Canal caps or hearing bands can either be pre-molded or formable earplugs connected by a flexible metal or plastic band. The main advantage of canal plugs is their convenience: they provide the seal of an earplug while also retaining the convenience of earmuffs. You can hang canal caps or hearing bands around your neck when not in use.Some find the pressure of the band to be uncomfortable. Keep a pair of earplugs on hand when using canal caps for the first time in case you experience discomfort.

, Earmuffs come in many models that are designed to fit most individuals. Earmuffs come in a variety of sizes, from small caps to larger shells, and fit around your ear. Earmuffs also come in three main designs: over the head, cap mounted, and behind the neck.


A general rule for earmuffs is the higher the NRR the larger the earmuff will be.
You may find earmuffs to be uncomfortable if you have a large beard, sideburns, or wear glasses. If you experience discomfort switch to earplugs., If you are in a particularly loud environment, try using both plugs and earmuffs for extra hearing protection. To determine the NRR of earplugs and earmuffs together, simply add 5 dB to the protective device with a higher NRR. For example, if you are wearing earmuffs rated to 35 dB and earplugs rated 30 dB your overall NRR would be 40 dB."
"
Use earplugs when at a concert.,
Try earmuffs or canal caps when operating machines or tools.,
Consider using earplugs when in loud public environments.",How to Select Hearing Protection3," Rock concerts at their peak can be in a painful dB range, whereas other concerts, such as jazz or classical music, rarely reach painful volumes. Although earmuffs will also provide adequate hearing protection earplugs will likely be your best option as they are small and concealable. Be sure to carry a pair of disposable earplugs when attending a concert in case volumes reach painful levels.


Rock concerts can reach dB levels of 150 at their peak, which is well beyond a painful register. In comparison, jet plane take-offs are around 120 dB. Look for earplugs with high NRR ratings to reduce your exposure level, ideally to around 80 dB.If you attend or perform in concerts regularly consider purchasing a custom set of pre-molded earplugs that provide protection from the noise levels you are exposed to.

, Machines and tools, whether industrial or home-owned, can risk exposing you to high levels of noise. If you plan on your exposure being consistent, like two hours of jackhammering concrete or using a lawnmower, try using earmuffs. If you plan on your exposure to be inconsistent, like when sawing wood down to parts or drilling intermittently, try using canal caps to easily remove and re-insert your hearing protection in between points of exposure.


Jack hammers produce noise that can be painful (130 dB), while other tools like drills and saws (100 dB) produce noise that is not painful but can still harm your hearing., Try to carry a pair of disposable earplugs if you find yourself in loud public environments, like sports games, trains, or large crowds in a city’s downtown area. Although you will not need protection consistently, having a pair of earplugs on you will keep you protected when your environment begins to reach noise levels that could harm your hearing.


Crowds and trains produce noise in a range of 80 dB to 90 dB."

Examine the ear with a microscope.",How to Remove Ear Wax Plugs," Some people may never have trouble with ear wax, while others are more prone to buildup. Being aware if you are at risk can help you figure out if you have a wax plug.


People who use hearing aids or ear plugs are more likely to have impacted wax.Those who use cotton swabs or put other items in their ears are more likely to experience wax plugs.Older people and those with developmental disabilities are more likely to have wax buildup.Some people have ear canals that are shaped in such a way that it is difficult for the body to naturally remove wax.;
, The best way to determine if you have a wax plug is to see a doctor, but you may want to try home treatments first. Before you begin any type of home treatment for a wax plug, it’s important to determine that you have a one. This can help ensure that you don’t use a treatment that could cause harm or that you don’t have another condition such as an ear infection.


You can purchase a special light (an otoscope) to look into the ear that is made for people who are not doctors for $10-$30 online or at some drug stores. A family member or friend can help you determine if you may have ear wax by using this tool.

, It can be relatively easy to determine if you have impact wax by recognizing the symptoms. From feelings of fullness to discharge, there are several signs that you may have a wax plug that requires removal.A feeling of fullness or sensation that the ear is plugged may accompany impacted cerumen.You may also feel like your ears are itchy.Noises in the ear, called tinnitus, may be present with a wax plug.You may experience partial hearing loss that gets worse with impacted wax.You may have an earache or mild pain with cerumen plugs.You may notice mild discharge that looks like wax from your ears with impacted cerumen.You might notice a mild odor emanating from your ear.If you have severe ear pain, a fever, or drainage that looks or smells like pus, you should see a doctor to make sure you don't have an ear infection.

, You can clean the outside of your ear canal with a cloth or paper tissue. This may help remove discharge or any wax that has worked its way outside of your inner ear.Use a soft cloth to wipe around the outside of your ear and on your outer ear canal.If you like, you can wet the cloth slightly with warm water.Wrap a paper tissue around your finger and gently wipe your outer ear and outer ear canal with the tissue., For those people with minimal to moderate amounts of ear wax, use an over the counter wax removal preparation. This can help clear any impacted wax.Most over the counter drops are oil and peroxide solutions.The hydrogen peroxide will not dissolve your wax, but help it move through the ear canal.Make sure to follow the package instructions for using the products to help ensure you don’t cause further problems.
If you have an eardrum perforation or suspect that you may, do not use an over the counter preparation.You can purchase over the counter ear wax removal drops at most pharmacies and some large retailers.

, In addition to over the counter wax treatments, you can also use simple household oils or glycerin drops to relieve wax plugs. These treatments soften ear wax, making it easier to clear out of your ear canal.You can use baby or mineral oils as a treatment.Place a few drops of baby or mineral oil in each ear and let it sit for a few minutes before allow it to drain out.You may also try olive oil.However, one study found that water was more effective at removing ear wax than olive oil.There are no studies about how often its helpful to use oil or glycerin drops, but no more than a few times a week should be fine., Irrigating, sometimes called “syringing,” is one of the most common methods of removing wax plugs from the ears.Try washing your ear by irrigation if you have large amounts or stubborn ear wax.You may want a friend or family member to help you with irrigation.


You’ll need a medical syringe to use this method, which you can buy at most pharmacies.Fill the syringe with body temperature water. Using cooler or warmer water may cause dizziness or vertigo.Hold your head upright and gently pull the outside of your ear upward to straighten your ear canal.Inject a small stream of water into your ear canal by where the wax plug is located.Tilt your head to drain the water.You may need to perform an irrigation several times in order to clear away the impaction.One study showed that injecting a small amount of water or oil into your ear before irrigation may help remove the wax more quickly.Never use a water jet device designed for teeth to irrigate your ears., You can purchase a suction device or vacuum to remove ear wax. Although studies show that this treatment is ineffective, you may find it works for you.You can get ear wax suction devices at many pharmacies or large retailers.

, Once you’ve removed your ear wax plug, it’s important to dry your ear thoroughly. This can help ensure that you don’t get an infection or experience other problems.You can use a few drops of rubbing alcohol to dry out your ear.A hair dryer set to low can also help dry out your ear., Understand that every person needs a certain amount of wax to help prevent ear infections. Avoid cleaning your ears too often or using instruments such as cotton swabs to help keep a healthy amount of wax in your ears.Only clean your ears as often as you feel they require it. If you notice you need to clean your ears daily or excess discharge, see your doctor.Using instruments such as cotton swabs or hair pins can force wax into your ear instead of removing it, and may cause infection or other problems.Using instruments can also perforate your ear drum and lead to infection or hearing loss., This treatment, which involves dripping candle wax into the ear, is generally considered ineffective and may be dangerous.If candling is done without the supervision of a professional, it can burn your ear canal, and cause hearing loss or infection., In the case that you're not able to remove the ear wax or it gets worse with home treatments, consult your doctor.

, If you can’t remove your wax at home or experience other problems such as severe hearing loss, pain or discharge, talk to your doctor about your different treatment options for wax plugs. This can help ensure that you get the most effective, least invasive, and most painless treatment for your impacted cerumen.


Your doctor may recommend professional treatments or options that you can use at home, including drops and irrigation., Your doctor may decide to treat your wax plugs by irrigating your ear canals. This can help to soften wax and clear away any blockages causing your discomfort.


Your doctor will inject water or another medical solution, such as saline, into your ear and let it soften the wax.Once the water is drained, your doctor may check to see if the plug is gone or if it needs to be removed with an instrument such as a curette.You may experience slight discomfort with irrigation., Unlike commercial suction methods, your doctor may use a more powerful suction method to clear your ear canal. This can help effectively and completely remove wax plugs.Your doctor will insert the suction device into your ear canal to remove the wax.She may check if the plug is gone once she’s suctioned and assess if you need a stronger or different method to remove your impaction.Suction may cause minor discomfort or some bleeding., If your ear wax plug is especially stubborn, your doctor may opt to remove it with different instruments including a cerumen spoon or curette.This treatment directly removes wax plugs and may help quickly and effectively relieve your impaction.


A curette is a small, thin device that your doctor will insert into your ear canal to remove the blockage.A cerumen spoon is a small device inserted into the ear canal that can scoop out blockages.Having wax removed with an instrument may cause discomfort and some bleeding., Your doctor may refer you to an ENT (Ears, Nose, and Throat) specialist if she is unable to get all the wax out. The ENT specialist may use a microscope to better see the wax plug in your ear canal. This can help him assess the extent of your impaction and if he’s cleared away the entire blockage.


To look at your ear with a microscope, the ENT specialist will place a metal speculum inside your ear canal and then shine the microscope light inside.The ENT specialist may continue to use the microscope to guide wax removal.

Get vaccinated for chickenpox.,
Keep your immune system strong.,
Avoid other children and adults with chickenpox.,
Disinfect your house and hands.,
Let the illness run its course.,
Talk to your doctor about antiviral drugs.",How to Prevent Chickenpox," The vast majority of medical authorities believe that getting the chickenpox vaccine is the best way to prevent chickenpox. Vaccination introduces weakened viral particles to your immune system so that it can mount a strong response when it comes in contact with stronger, more virulent particles. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, before the introduction of the varicella vaccine in 1995, about 4 million Americans were infected with chickenpox each year — currently, that's dropped to about 400,000 yearly.The varicella vaccine is usually given to toddlers between the ages of 12-15 months, and then again between 4-6 years.For previously non-immunized teenagers or adults, the vaccine is given as a series of 2 injections, separated by 1-2 months between shots.


If you are unsure whether or not you're already immune to chickenpox, your doctor can administer a simple blood test to check for immunity to varicella.
The varicella vaccine can be combined with the vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella, in what is known as the MMRV vaccine.
It's estimated that a single vaccination is between 70-90% preventative for chickenpox infection, whereas a double dose is about 98% protective. If you do get chickenpox after being vaccinated, the case is usually mild.
If you've had chickenpox, you don't need the varicella vaccine because you already have natural immunity (resistance) against it.
The varicella vaccine isn't approved for pregnant women, people with weakened immunity (because the vaccine can actually trigger a chickenpox infection), and people who are allergic to gelatin or the antibiotic neomycin.;
, Like any viral, bacterial or fungal infection, true prevention depends on the proper functioning of your immune system. Your immune system is made of specialized white blood cells that search and destroy potential pathogens, but when the system is weak or lacking in resources, disease-causing microorganisms grow and spread virtually unchecked. Thus, it's not surprising that those most at risk of most infections, including chickenpox, are babies and people with compromised immune systems.As such, focusing on ways to boost your immune system is a logical approach to naturally preventing chickenpox.


Getting more sleep (or better quality sleep), eating more fresh fruit and vegetables, cutting down on refined sugars, reducing your alcohol consumption, quitting cigarette smoking, practicing good hygiene and light exercise are all proven ways to keep your immune strong.Dietary supplements that boost immunity include: vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc, echinacea and olive leaf extract.
People can develop weakened immune systems due to illness (cancer, diabetes, HIV infection), medical treatments (surgeries, chemotherapy, radiation, use of steroids, over-medicating), chronic stress and poor nutrition.

, Chickenpox is highly contagious because it not only spreads directly from touching the blisters, but also through the air (via coughing and sneezing), and it can survive for short periods of time in mucus on various objects.Thus, avoiding people who are infected is a good strategy to help prevent contracting chickenpox. The tricky part is that chickenpox becomes contagious up to 2 days before the rash appears, so it's not always obvious who is infected. A mild fever is often the first sign of infection, so that might be a better indicator that your child has come down with something.


Sequestering your child in their room (while being properly fed and hydrated, of course) and keeping them home from school (for at least a week) is a practical way of preventing the infection from spreading to you and other children. Having them wear a surgical mask and keeping their nails trimmed short also help prevent the spread of the virus.
It typically takes from 10-21 days after exposure to chickenpox to develop an infection.Chickenpox can also be spread by contact with the rash in people with a condition called shingles (although not via airborne droplets from coughing or sneezing), because it too is caused by the varicella zoster virus.

, Because chickenpox is so contagious and can live outside the body for short periods of time, you should be vigilant about disinfecting your house as a form of prevention if your child or other household member is infected.Regularly disinfecting countertops, tables, the arms of chairs, toys and other surfaces which may have come in contact with the infected person is a good preventative approach. Consider giving over a bathroom solely for the infected person to use while they're ill, if that's possible. Furthermore, disinfect your hands multiple times daily by washing them with regular soap, but don't go overboard on the hand sanitizer or antibacterial soap, because it can promote the growth of ""super bugs.""


Natural disinfectants for household use include white vinegar, lemon juice, salt water, diluted bleach and hydrogen peroxide.
You should also make sure that the clothes, bed sheets and towels of the infected person are regularly and thoroughly washed — add baking soda to the laundry for more sanitizing ability.
Make an effort not to rub your eyes or put fingers in your mouth after you've touched someone with chickenpox.

, As chickenpox is not a serious illness in the vast majority of cases, letting it run its course is the best way of gaining natural immunity to the varicella zoster virus, which will prevent future infections. A typical chickenpox infection lasts between 5-10 days and entails the development of the telltale rash, mild fever, loss of appetite, mild headache and general fatigue or malaise.Once a chickenpox rash appears, it goes through 3 phases: raised pink or red bumps (papules), which break out over a few days; fluid-filled blisters (vesicles), which quickly form from the papules before breaking and leaking; and crusty scabs, which cover the broken vesicles and take several days to fully heal.
The itchy rash first appears on the face, chest and back before spreading to other areas of the body.
As many as 300-500 blisters can form during a chickenpox infection., In addition to preventative vaccination, drugs called antivirals are recommended for people who have a high risk of complications from chickenpox, or sometimes they are prescribed to shorten the duration and prevent the spread of the infection. As the name suggests, antivirals are able to kill viruses or prevent them from reproducing in your body. Commonly prescribed antivirals for the treatment of chickenpox include acyclovir (Zovirax), valacyclovir (Valtrex), famciclovir (Famvir) and immune globulin intravenous (IGIV).These medications are used more for lessening the severity of chickenpox symptoms, as opposed to preventing them, so they are usually given within 24 hours after the telltale rash appears.


Valacyclovir and famciclovir are only approved for use in adults, not children.
Natural antiviral compounds that you can take as supplements include vitamin C, olive leaf extract, garlic, oregano oil and colloidal silver. Ask a naturopath, chiropractor or nutritionist about how to protect yourself from chickenpox with natural antivirals.

Make sure you don't have an infection.,
Mix a wax-softening solution.,
Keep the solution lukewarm.,
Lie down on your side.,
Straighten your ear canal.,
Pour the solution into your ear canal.,
Remain lying down for 10 to 15 minutes.,
Drain your ear.,
Irrigate again (optional).,
Dry your ear.,
Seek a doctor's help.",How to Unclog a Clogged Ear1," If you suspect that you have an ear infection, do not attempt the following method to unclog your ear. If you have any of the following symptoms, call a doctor immediately:Persistent and severe pain in your ears lasting more than a few hours.
Fever
Vomiting or diarrhea.
Yellow or green drainage from the ear.;
, You can purchase a solution at the drugstore to soften Earwax, or you can make your own at home. The upside to mixing it yourself is that you probably already have the ingredients you need. Combine warm water with one of the following








A few drops of baby or mineral oil
A few drops of glycerin
Hydrogen peroxide: 3% no stronger or this can cause damage (in an amount equal to the amount of water)

, Putting water that's too hot or cold into your ear can cause dizziness or vertigo.









Dip your (clean) finger into the water. If you don't notice a huge temperature difference in either direction, the solution is perfect.
Allow a solution that's too warm to cool for a minute or two before pouring it into your ear.
If your solution has cooled too much, warm it up by adding a little bit of hot water, or by putting it in the microwave for 10 to 15 seconds.

, Enlist gravity's help by lying so that the ear you want to drain is facing the ceiling. Put a towel beneath your head to catch any excess solution that spills out of your ear.









This position is easier if you have someone to help you pour the solution into your ear.
If you can't lie down, tilt your head to the side as much as you can. You should get nearly the same effect.

, This will make it easier for the solution to get into your ear. Grab the outer edge of your ear, by the lobe, then pull it gently outward. Your ear lobe should be perpendicular to your neck.








, You can use a glass measuring cup, a plastic syringe or a rubber bulb syringe to put the solution into your ear, or just pour directly from the bowl.









If you do use a syringe, be careful that you don't put the end of it deep into your ear — holding it above your ear canal without inserting it should be fine.
Be prepared for a little spillage if you're pouring from a bowl, especially if you're trying to do it while lying down. Or, ask someone to pour it for you.

, This gives the solution time to break up the wax.









If you used peroxide, don't be alarmed if you hear it bubbling in your ear. When the bubbling stops, you're ready to drain.

, Place an empty bowl beneath your ear, and turn your head so that the canal drains into the bowl.









To drain completely, pull your ear lobe to straighten your ear canal (as in Step 4).

, If your ear still feels blocked, repeat the irrigation process. If you've done it three times and you still feel blocked, look at another method section in this article or contact a doctor.








, Gently drying your ear once the wax is out cleans up any excess solution or wax. You can do it a few different ways:









Use soft, light pats with a cloth or paper towel.
Put a handheld blow dryer on low heat and low power, and hold the barrel a few inches away from your ear.
Put a few drops of alcohol into your ear — it'll dry the skin as it evaporates.

, If your Earwax is so impacted that you can't drain it by yourself, call a doctor and evaluate your options.









Your general practitioner can prescribe ear drops that should break up the wax. Use them with care, though — overdo it, and you'll damage your eardrum.
An ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist can manually remove Earwax with specially designed tools.

Shave in a warm shower.,
Use shaving gel every time you shave.,
Use a razor with a single blade.,
Shave in the direction of hair growth.,
Shave each area only once.,
Rinse the razor blade after every stroke.,
Keep your skin naturally loose when you shave.,
Use an electric razor.",How to Prevent Ingrown Hairs on Your Neck1," Keep your skin nice and wet when you shave – shaving with dry hair is more likely to cause skin irritation and ingrown hairs.Shave in the shower to keep your skin moist the whole time. The warm water will also help soften your hair.
, Never dry-shave – your skin should be moist and lubricated when you shave. Lather up with a rich shave gel or cream to protect your skin.Use products that are fragrance-free and non-comedogenic (won’t clog pore) if you have sensitive skin.Apply the cream or gel five minutes before shaving to soften up the hair., Shaving cuts hairs short and makes them sharp – that’s why it’s easy for them to turn back in on themselves, pierce the skin, and become ingrown. Use a razor with a single blade instead of multiple blades so that the hairs aren’t quite as short or sharp.Replace your razor blades every 5-7 shaves so that they stay clean and sharp.Always rinse your razor when you’re done shaving to get soap and hairs off of it.

, Shave with, not against, the grain of your hair. This prevents hair from being cut too short and irritating your skin, and decreases the likelihood of ingrown hairs., Do not shave the same area of skin over and over again. This can irritate your skin and cut the hairs very short, possibly resulting in more ingrown hairs. Shave over an area one time only. Using a high-quality, lubricating shave gel can help make this more effective., It may seem tedious, but take the time to rinse off your blade after every stroke you make. This will keep your blade cleaner and produce a more even, less irritating shave., Don’t pull your skin taut while you shave over it. This can let the hair follicle slip back under the skin.It may take some practice, but work on shaving your neck without pulling on your skin. Lift and move your chin and jaw to different angles to get those hard-to-reach places., Electric razors do not give you as close of a shave as razor blades do. Because they don’t cut the hair as short, electric razors may be less likely to cause ingrown hairs. Consider trying one out to see if it helps.You can also use a clipper or beard trimmer. These often allow you to choose what closeness setting you want. Avoid using the shortest setting.

Identify the different types.,
Understand post-inflammatory hyperpig­mentation (PIH).,
Identify lentigines.,
Determine melasma hyperpigmentation.",How to Prevent Hyperpigmentation of the Skin1," Hyperpigmentation can take a variety of forms and have a number of different potential causes. If you want to try and prevent it, it's important to have a clear understanding of the different ways it might appear to see for which form you are most at risk. Depending on what form of hyperpigmentation you are concerned about, you may not be able to do much to prevent it. The three main types are:Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation
Lentigines
Melasma;
, This type of hyperpigmentation can be caused by any inflammatory skin condition which involves the junction between epidermis and dermis.The epidermis is the outermost layer of skin and the dermis is the layer beneath that.The kind of inflammation or injury that can cause PIH includes acne, burns, and psoriasis. A professional skin treatment can also result in PIH.If PIH is a reaction to a specific inflammation or trauma it can resolve itself without treatment, but this can sometimes take months.
It is possible that epidermal pigmentation can last for six months or a year.
Dermal pigmentation can last for even longer, persisting for years., There are a wide variety of different instances of lentigines recorded in medicine. Some of these develop when you are very young and some as you get older. Solar lentigines are those which are most often caused by excessive exposure to the sun.Sometimes these are known as liver spots, and have been associated with aging. Although they do multiply and become more prominent with age, evidence has shown them to be much more prominent in older people who have had high exposure to UV light.Solar lentigines most frequently occur on the face and the back of the hands.
There is no proven link between lentigines and melanoma (a serious form of skin cancer), but they are considered an independent risk factor for melanoma., One other common type of hyperpigmentation is known as melasma (sometimes referred to as chloasma). Unlike the PIH and lentigines, melasma is not caused by exposure to the sun or a trauma or inflammation experienced by the skin. Melasma is understood to result from hormonal fluctuations, most commonly during pregnancy.


Melasma takes the appearance of dark brown, roughly symmetrical patches on the face, which have clear distinct edges.
Melasma can be a side-effect of oral contraceptives for women. It is often aggravated by thyroid complaints.
It is more prevalent and tends to persist for longer in people with darker skin, and is sometimes experienced by dark-skinned men.
For women, melasma often fades slowly after pregnancy, when hormonal fluctuations desist; however, it may never completely disappear without treatment."
"
Avoid known allergens.,
Undergo allergy testing.,
Keep a hives diary.",How to Prevent Hives1," The first and easiest approach to prevent hives is to avoid the allergen. This means avoiding situations where you may be exposed to the allergen or learning how to adapt to unavoidable situations.For example, if you have a food allergy that causes hives, refrain from eating that food. When you go out to eat or eat at someone else’s home, inform them that you have a food allergy. Ask if which dishes are not made with that particular food.
If you have sun hives, you should take caution when outside in the sun. Wear hats and long-sleeved shirts. Wear sunscreen. Avoid long periods in the direct sunlight and find places to stand in the shade.
If you have pressure hives, avoid wearing tight clothing.
To prevent temperature hives, don’t swim in cold water, and if you do, make sure not to swim alone. Wear a scarf around your nose and head when walking in cold weather. Wear warm clothing and layers when in the cold.
You can learn how to treat hives for those times when you get in a situation where you can’t prevent hives.;
, Some allergens that cause hives can be determined by going through a process of allergy skin testing. There are two main forms of allergy testing. The allergen can be scratched into your skin, or a very small amount can be injected into the skin. These are not very painful but can be uncomfortable, especially if you react to the substance.Most positive reactions will occur within minutes, usually within 20 to 30 minutes. Delayed reactions may occur as well within 24 to 48 hours.
For young children and babies, a blood sample may be taken and tested.
In some people who may be at risk for anaphylaxis, who are taking certain medications, or who have severe skin conditions such as eczema or psoriasis, a blood sample may be taken to avoid severe skin reactions.
The skin tests may have to be repeated for a wide variety of allergens, but you should know that the specific allergen that you react to may not be a part of the panel of allergens tested, so it is possible that even after testing, you still will not know what it is you should avoid.

, If the testing doesn’t identify the allergen, try keeping a diary to see if you can narrow down the possibilities. Write down any minor thing that could cause them, even if you’re not sure it’s the cause. Especially pay attention to hives that occur in similar situations, or hives that only occur when exposed to specific circumstances.Keep track of what you eat, what medicines you take, and what environmental allergens may be around. Environmental allergens include pets, dust, and plants.
Also keep track of any drastic temperature changes or physical injury, such as scrapes or scratches that may cause any hives.
Vibrations can cause hives, so keep a log of things you touch that vibrate, like speakers with heavy bass, lawn mowers, or jack hammers.

Take preventative measures.,
Try to pop your ears.,
Treat your cold.,
Put a warm compress on your ear.,
See a doctor if the pain persists.",How to Unclog a Clogged Ear2," A blocked Eustachian tube (also called ear barotrauma) can be the painful consequence of a difference in pressure between your middle and outer ear. Most people experience it at some point. Here's what you can do to stave it off:








Fly smart. Don't sleep while the plane is descending. Instead, chew gum and try to yawn frequently. Allow small children to nurse or sip on a drink during the descent.
Dive slowly. If you're going scuba diving, descend and ascend at a slow rate. Give yourself plenty of time to readjust to the new pressure. Avoid diving if you have a cold or respiratory infection.

, Popping, or equalizing the pressure between your middle and outer ears, can relieve the pain. Try these remedies:









Chewing gum.
Yawning.
Sucking on candy.
Inhaling deeply, pursing your lips, holding your nose shut, then exhaling suddenly.

, The membranes in your Eustachian tubes, which connect your ear to the back of your throat, are the same as the membranes in your nose. As such, they can swell quickly and severely when you have a cold or seasonal allergies.








Take a decongestant or antihistamine. It should ease up the inflammation of the membranes. You can take it orally or in a nasal spray.
Rest up and recover. Doing everything you can to combat the cold will help your Eustachian tubes open up more quickly.

, Lie on your side, and put a washcloth soaked in hot water or a heating pad over your ear. It should help ease the pain.








Put a towel between the heating pad and your ear to avoid burning your face.
Don't sleep with an electric heating pad over your ear — it can be a fire hazard.

, Barotrauma can lead to long-term complications if it's severe and left untreated. If you're experiencing the following symptoms, seek medical help immediately:









Severe pain that lasts more than 3 hours.
Discharge or bleeding from the ear.
Fever.

Determine the cause.,
Determine if the acne you have is cystic acne or not.,
Start off with the least harsher cleansers in your skin regimen.,
Use a toner if you have particularly oily skin.,
Use an acne treatment, if your acne is more severe.,
See a dermatologist.",How to Prevent Cystic Acne," Figure out what is causing these annoying acne flare-ups or the acne that just seems to stay there forever. Some causes include:


Hormonal changes (ex. puberty, menstrual periods, pregnancy, birth control pills, or even stress)
Oily or greasy beauty products.
Particular drugs (ex. steroids, estrogen, and testosterone).
Sweating and high humidity levels.
Perimenopause or menopause.;
, There are four grades of acne, and they include:


Grade 1 is mild, characterized by only a few minor pimples, blackheads, and no inflammation.
Grade 2 is moderate, with more blackheads, more obvious breakouts, and there is inflammation.
Grade 3 is severe, with more inflammation than in Grade 2 and more pimples not only on the face, but on other parts of the body like the chest and the back.
Grade 4 is serious, this is the cystic acne and it is basically like Grade 3 only there are cysts and this type of acne is painful.

If you are in Grade 4, then you should go see a dermatologist. If you are in the earlier stages, the rest of this article will help you prevent getting the painful cystic acne.



,
Wash your face 1-2 times a day (depending on how oily your skin is). Be sure to select a good acne face wash, perhaps start with a typical salicylic acid wash that you could find at a drugstore (Neutrogena is a good start brand), or you could move on to a benzoyl peroxide wash. Just stick with one wash for about a month to see if it works for you or not, if you're not consistent though, you might not get results.

, Also the toner leaves your skin feeling very refreshed and clean. If you have dry skin this step is not recommended since it can dry your skin even more.

, Be careful though, as some treatments can dry your skin excessively. To avoid this, gradually use the treatment more regularly. Such as; one application every two days to two daily applications or whatever feels comfortable with your skin. Don't be afraid to experiment and also be patient, results won't happen in one day!

, If the past steps haven't worked, it might be a good idea to visit a dermatologist and ask them what to do about your acne. Don't be afraid to ask them, their job is all to do with the skin. But in order to be prepared for the possible treatments you might receive, here is a list of some options your dermatologist might suggest:


Photodynamic Therapy (PDT)
Oral Antibiotics
Hormone Therapy

Protect your skin from the sun.,
Care for your skin.,
Clarify the potential side-effects of medications.,
Find out if you have hyperpigmentation in your family history.",How to Prevent Hyperpigmentation of the Skin2," Ensuring that you properly protect your skin and limit your exposure to UV light is the most basic and reliable measure you can take to lessen the chances of experiencing any kind of hyperpigmentation. This means both applying sufficient sunscreen, and limiting your time spent in the sun. Generally, opaque sunblocks that contain zinc oxide or titanium dioxide are considered the most effective.As lentigines has been associated with exposure to the sun, protecting your skin with sunscreen will help prevent this from occurring or getting worse.
If you have PIH it's too late to prevent it, but avoiding further sun exposure can help you ensure you don't worsen your hyperpigmentation. Be sure to wear sunscreen.Re-applying a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 every two hours can help reduce PIH.Wearing a broad-rimmed hat and UV protective clothing can also help.

, As well as protecting your skin from UV light, there are other everyday steps you can take to look after your skin which in turn will help prevent hyperpigmentation. Use gentle skin care products and avoid scratching, popping blemishes, and picking at your skin. This is especially important if you have some areas of pigmentation already. Avoid the temptation to pick at them.


If you have PIH it is important to skin for your skin to allow it to heal as quickly as possible.
Using moisturizers to soothe your skin can help reduce the irritation. Gently massaging a cooling lotion onto the skin is much better than scratching.A gentle exfoliation once or twice a week can help clear out old skin cells which are discoloured., Some drugs can increase melanin production and bring about hyperpigmentation.In order to keep yourself as fully informed as possible always ask the doctor or pharmacist about any medications you are taking that might cause hyperpigmentation. Ask them for alternatives if they are available.


If you think your melasma hyperpigmentation is caused by oral contraception, hormone replacement therapy or another hormonal treatment, discontinue and contact your doctor., As with many medical conditions, there is thought to be a genetic element involved in melasma pigmentation. A family history of melasma has been cited as one of the potential causative factors.Determine if you have a history of it in your family. This is an inexact science, so be sure to talk to your doctor about any concerns you have.

These include topical creams including retinoids and corticosteriods.Drugs which block the production of melanin may be prescribed. Treatments which effect melanin formation are currently consider the most successful.Before deciding on any treatments, speak to your doctor or dermatologist to discuss the possibilities and what might be most suited to you.

, Due to the commonness of hyperpigmentation and the potential of the medical treatments to irritate your skin, people have been looking for natural alternative treatments. Some natural ingredients in topical treatments have been shown to have benefits in laboratory tests, such as soy.Natural and home remedies are never completely reliable, but citrus juice and aloe vera are cited as potentially good ingredients to use in topical treatments.Make a mask with aloe vera, seaweed and honey and let it rest on your face for ten minutes before rinsing off.
Alternatively try mixing lemon juice with honey and milk and use this as a face mask., If you are struggling to lighten dark patches on your face, you may want to consider further treatment options that go beyond topical creams and natural remedies. It's recommended that you speak to your doctor or dermatologist who will be able to advise you on specific treatments. One common treatment is a chemical peel. This is a harsher treatment than topical creams and involves you applying a liquid chemical solution, such as glycolic acid, to your skin.A chemical peel may be advised if other treatments prove ineffectual.
Dermabrasion or microdermabrasion treatments may also be recommended.
In some cases an light therapy or laser treatment might be used to target discoloured areas of skin."

Soak the hives.,
Use antihistamines.,
Try anti-inflammatory herbs and supplements.,
Use epinephrine for anaphylaxis due to severe hives.,
Talk to your doctor about chronic hives.",How to Prevent Hives2," For mild cases of hives, the most common and effective way to treat the hives is to soak the hives in lukewarm water or with a cool compress. For any case of hives, avoid any rubbing or itching because it makes hives worse.Soak a cloth in lukewarm water and press it to the affected area. If you have hives all over your body, soak in a tub of lukewarm water. Soak the area for ten to twenty minutes.
Soak a cloth in cold water or place a wet cloth in the refrigerator. Place the compress soaked in cool water against the affected and itchy area.

, For a case of hives that is moderate, antihistamines are often used. Antihistamines are designed to block histamine, which leads to the hives.These may be over-the-counter medications your purchased at the drugstore or prescription antihistamines you got from your doctor. Antihistamines you can use include:Sedating antihistamines like Brompheniramine (Dimetane), Chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton), and Diphenhydramine (Benadryl)
Non-sedating antihistamines like Cetirizine (Zyrtec, Zyrtec-D), Clemastine (Tavist), Fexofenadine (Allegra, Allegra D), and Loratadine (Claritin, Claritin D, Alavert)
OTC corticosteroids in nasal sprays, like Triamcinolone acetonide (Nasacort), and prescription corticosteroids including Prednisone, Prednisolone, Cortisol, and Methylprednisolone
Mast-cell stabilizers, such as Cromolyn sodium (Nasalcrom)
Leukotriene inhibitors like Montelukast (Singulair)
Topical immune-modulating substances like Tacrolimus (Protopic) and Pimecrolimus (Elidel)

, A number of herbs and supplements have natural anti-inflammatory activity. You may be able to prevent hives by taking these natural supplements daily. Follow manufacturer’s instructions on the dosage. Do not use these remedies for children under the age of five unless under the care of a physician.


Rutin is a natural bioflavonoid found in citrus fruits and buckwheat. It can function to reduce inflammation and swelling by limiting the leakage from blood vessels.Follow manufacturer’s instructions for dosages.
Quercetin, which is produced in the body from rutin, can also be effective in reducing inflammation and swelling. In addition, quercetin has been found to be more effective than the prescription drug cromolyn in blocking histamine release.Follow manufacturer’s instructions for dosages.
Bromelain is an enzyme found in pineapples. Bromelain can help reduce the swelling of hives.You can take bromelain as a supplement as instructed by the manufacturer’s directions.
Coleus forskohlii is used in Ayurvedic medicine and has been found to reduce histamine and leukotriene release from mast cells.Follow manufacturer’s instructions for dosages as a supplement.
Nettles have been traditionally used to treat hives.The scientific name of nettles is Urtica dioica, and the term urticaria is derived from that name. Make a cup of nettles tea using one teaspoon of the dried herb in a cup of water, and allow it to cool. Use as often as needed, usually about three to four cups a day.

, Anaphylaxis is a severe, sometimes life-threatening, allergic reaction that may sometimes occur with the appearance of hives. In rare cases, hives can cause swelling in the throat and can cause an emergency situation that requires epinephrine. Epinephrine can also be used as an EpiPen in those who are severely allergic to a particular substance and require epinephrine to avoid anaphylaxis.The symptoms of an anaphylactic reaction include:

Skin rashes which may include hives. There may be itching and flushed or pale skin.
A sense of warmth
The sensation or feeling of a lump in the throat
Wheezing or other difficulty in breathing
A swollen tongue or throat
A rapid pulse and heartbeat
Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea
Dizziness or fainting


If you or anyone you know experience any of these symptoms, get immediate medical care.
If your child or another loved one has a prescription for an EpiPen, make sure you know where it is and how to use it. Talk to your physician and pharmacist to get instructions on when and how to use these.

, If hives become a chronic or long-term problem, you should ask your physician for a referral to a specialist. An allergist can test you in order to determine, if possible, the cause of your allergic reaction.These allergy tests will cover foods, plants, chemicals, insects, and insect bites.

Identify hives.,
Recognize the trigger for your hives.,
Diagnose your hives.",How to Prevent Hives3," Hives are also known as urticaria. They are raised, reddish, itchy bumps on the skin that, when pressed, turn white. Most of the time, hives are round, though separate hives can appear to merge into what looks like a large, irregularly shaped welt.Hives can appear on any area of the body, though the most common area for hives is at or around the same area that was actually exposed to the allergen.
Hives can last minutes or days, and in very rare cases, even months and years.
Anyone can get hives. About 20% of the population have experienced them at one time or another. Hives occur on the young, the old, male and female.

, Hives occur after exposure to an allergen. The allergic response is when the immune response defends your body against anything it recognizes as not belonging in an excessive, uncontrolled way.Allergens are everywhere in the environment surrounding us. Allergens that trigger hives can be certain foods, prescription or OTC medication, insect bites and stings, a chemical, a polymer such as latex, an infection, pet hair or dander, pollen, plants, and even physical stimuli, such as pressure, a scratch, temperature, and sun exposure., The diagnosis of hives is generally straightforward because hives have a distinctive appearance usually only requiring a visual examination. Determining what caused the hives, and therefore preventing future cases of hives, can be more difficult.


Unless you know from experience, from seeing the insect or spider that bit you, or are aware of the food or medication that caused the hives, you may need allergy tests that test for skin reactions to a variety of substances.
You may also need to undergo blood tests and sometimes a skin biopsy to examine the skin under a microscope."

Bathe or shower regularly to keep your skin and hair clean.,
Use a mild antibacterial soap every day to eliminate bacteria on your skin.,
Gently exfoliate your skin using a loofah or washcloth.,
Dry your skin thoroughly after bathing.,
Try a bleach bath.,
Wear clean, loose-fitting clothes.",How to Prevent Boils1," Frequent bathing is especially important in hot weather when boils are more likely to form. Bathe or shower at least once a day, and after sweating. This will help prevent the Staphylococcus aureus (staph) bacteria that may be on your skin from getting into your pores or under your skin and starting a boil.Pay special attention to areas where boils are most likely to form, including the face, neck, armpits, shoulders, and buttocks.;
, Look for a soap, body wash, or facial cleanser that says ""antibacterial"" on the label. There are many varieties available at your local grocery store or pharmacy.If you find your antibacterial soap too drying, look for a gentle formulation like Cetaphil.
Most antibacterial soaps use the active ingredient triclosan. For a natural alternative, look for a soap containing tea tree oil, a natural antibacterial agent.In some cases, a prescription strength antibacterial soap may be needed. If you have ongoing problems with boils or other skin infections, ask your doctor about one of these.
You can also try an acne body cleanser with benzoyl peroxide.

, This will help prevent clogged pores that can lead to boils. Be careful not to scrub so hard that you damage your skin.

, Bacteria thrive in warm, damp environments so careful drying is important. You might also use baby powder, or a medicated powder like Gold Bond to help keep moisture-prone areas drier throughout the day.

, Doctors often recommend bleach baths for people with skin problems such as eczema, but they may also help kill the bacteria on your skin that causes boils.Use ½ cup household bleach in a bathtub full of warm water. Soak for 10-15 minutes.Do not take more than 3 bleach baths per week.Do not submerge your head or get the bathwater in your eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although bleach baths are usually safe for children, talk to your doctor or pediatrician before giving your child a bleach bath., Avoid re-wearing clothes that you have sweated in. Wear loose-fitting clothes that will not rub against your skin and irritate it. Tight clothing will not allow your skin to breathe, which can cause irritation and leave you prone to boils."
"
Avoid sharing razors.,
Use shaving gel on wet skin.,
Keep your razors clean and sharp.,
Shave “with the grain.” You may have been taught to shave in the opposite direction that your hair is growing, but that can cause ingrown hairs and lead to boils.,
Think twice before shaving your genitals.,
Do not shave an inflamed area.",How to Prevent Boils2," The staph bacteria that causes boils can be spread by sharing personal items such as razors. Each person in your household who needs one should have their own razor.

, Shaving is a big cause of ingrown hairs, which can end up becoming infected and leading to boil formation.Using shaving gel on wet skin will help lubricate the razor’s movement so that it doesn’t snag on your hairs and force them back into the skin., Rinse your razor frequently as you shave. Replace disposable razors frequently, and keep other razors sharpened.Sharp razors mean you have to apply less pressure to the skin to cut the hair, which reduces the likelihood of creating cuts and ingrown hairs.

, Shave in the same direction as your hair grows.This can be a little difficult to determine, especially if you have curly hair. In general, shave your legs in a downward motion. Run your hands along your skin to help you determine what direction your hair is growing.

, Studies have shown serious infections of MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) in women who shaved their pubic hair.“Cosmetic body shaving” for men can also cause MRSA infections.In general, it’s best to avoid shaving these sensitive areas.


Shaving your genitals leaves your skin with small micro-wounds, through which the staph bacteria can enter and cause infection and boils. Because the area is usually sweatier than other areas of your body, the likelihood of boils developing is also higher.

, If you notice signs of inflammation or you see a boil, do not shave that area. You could end up spreading the bacteria and infection to other parts of your body."
"
Take measures to avoid contagion.,
Avoid sharing bedding, towels, wash cloths, or clothing with someone who suffers from boils or staph infections.,
Wash and sanitize bedding and towels frequently and thoroughly to kill boil-causing bacteria.,
Keep the wound clean and covered and change the dressing frequently.",How to Prevent Boils3," The staphylococcus aureus' bacteria that causes most boils is highly contagious. Staph infections spread easily through direct contact with infected skin or pus. If you are prone to these infections or have close contact with someone who is, you should use extra caution not to transmit bacteria., Make sure all family members have their own towels and washcloths, wash them frequently, and keep them separate.


The pus that comes out of a boil is highly infectious, and the bacteria can live on most surfaces for some time.
Do not share bar soap if you have boils, or with someone who does have boils.
You should also avoid sharing razors or sporting equipment. Both “regular” staph and MRSA can be spread by sharing personal items or sporting equipment.

, Use the hottest water recommended for the fabric you are washing, and use bleach on whites.


Wear gloves when laundering the belongings of someone with boils as an extra precaution.
If you are prone to boils on your face, you may want to change your pillowcase every day to prevent spreading the infection.

, The pus that emerges from a boil is highly infectious and can cause more boils to form on yourself or others who may come in contact with it.


Do not lance boils. If lancing is required it should be done by a medical professional. You could cause injury or further infection by doing this yourself."
"
Clean all wounds thoroughly to prevent infection.,
Use soap and a soft, damp, clean cloth to wash away dirt and bacteria from around the wound.,
Apply an antiseptic solution or antibiotic ointment to your wound by following the directions provided by the manufacturer.,
Cover the wound with a clean bandage, and change the dressing frequently.,
Wash your hands thoroughly before and after treating a wound, and dispose of all bandages and dressings carefully.",How to Prevent Boils4," Flush dirt and bacteria from a wound by placing the affected area under cool running water, or use a saline ""wound wash"" product available at most pharmacies and online retailers.,


If dirt remains in the wound after flushing it, remove it using sterile tweezers that have been cleaned with rubbing alcohol.
If a wound is too large or deep to clean properly at home, or if you cannot remove all the debris, seek medical attention immediately.

,


There are natural alternatives to antiseptic solutions such as honey, as well as lavender, eucalyptus, and tea tree oil. These can be applied directly to the wound once or twice per day to kill bacteria.

, Wounds heal more quickly when they are covered. Bandaging also prevents dirt and foreign bacteria from entering the wound and making it worse., For optimal hand-washing, first wet your hands under running water, then apply soap. Lather well and rub hands together vigorously for at least 20 seconds, scrubbing all surfaces, including the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your finger nails. Rinse well, and then dry your hands thoroughly with a towel or aid dryer."
"
Eat a healthy diet.,
Stay hydrated, especially in hot weather.,
Try a daily dose of turmeric.,
Get 20-30 minutes of exercise a day.,
Try to minimize stress.,
Avoid exposure to noxious chemicals.",How to Prevent Boils5," Poor nutrition is one of the leading causes of immune deficiencies that lead to infection.Make sure that you are getting not just adequate food, but healthy food that is rich in vitamins and minerals.


Avoid foods that contain excess sugar, salt, and preservatives.
Consider a vitamin supplement, especially one that contains Vitamin C., Drinking plenty of water helps to keep pores clean and unclogged, which may help prevent boils. A good guideline for how much water you should drink every day is 1/2 to 1 ounce for every pound you weigh, so a person who weighs 150 pounds should aim to drink between 75 to 150 ounces (2.2 to 4.4 liters) per day.If the weather is hot, or if you are doing strenuous work or exercise, aim for the upper end of the range.

, The spice turmeric is a natural anti-inflammatory and antibacterial agent that may alleviate and prevent boils. A lotion or cream that contains turmeric may help your body heal wounds such as boils.Although studies have not shown that consuming turmeric has any effect on boils, it is an antioxidant and may help prevent conditions such as heart attack and stroke, so feel free to cook with as much as you’d like., A moderate amount of exercise has been shown to boost people's immune system considerably. Aim for at least 20 to 30 minutes of exercise a day to keep your skin healthy and prevent infection.If you are new to exercise, start small. A 20 minute walk, or even two 10-minute walks a day are enough to see some improvement in immune function.
Exercise doesn't have to be a chore, look for fun ways to be active, such as dancing or going to the park with your kids.

, People who are under a great deal of stress are far more likely to develop boils and other physical ailments. Take some time every day to relax, if possible, and look for ways to reduce stress in your life. Exercise is great for stress, and many people find activities such as yoga, meditation, and tai chi to be beneficial.Laughter is another great stress-fighter. Ask a friend to tell you a joke, or wind down by watching a funny comedy routine or TV show at the end of the day., In some cases, boils are caused by exposure to irritating chemicals at home or on the job. Chemicals that are especially likely to cause skin problems include coal tar and cutting oils.Use protective gear when working with these chemicals, and wash your skin thoroughly after exposure to remove them as soon as possible.

See a doctor.,
Consider a course of oral antibiotics.,
Ask your doctor about nasal antibiotics.,
Ask about prescription antibacterial soaps and topical treatments.,
Talk to your doctor about MRSA.",How to Prevent Boils6," If you are prone to frequent boils, or your boils do not go away with treatment, you should consult with a doctor to rule out any underlying conditions that may be causing your boils, such as undiagnosed diabetes, anemia or infection. Your doctor can also prescribe or recommend additional preventative measures. These could include oral antibiotics, topical treatments, and iron supplements.You should also see a doctor if your boils return, if they last longer than 2 weeks, you develop a boil on your face or spine, the boil is painful, or you have a fever along with the boil., Some people who suffer from frequent boils or cystic acne may require a course of oral antibiotics to eradicate any infections in the body that may be causing them.A six-month course of the antibiotics tetracycline, doxycycline, or erythromycin are most commonly prescribed to eliminate boils and problem acne.

, Some people are unfortunately carriers of staph infections, which commonly live in the nose. If your doctor suspects you may be a carrier, she can give you an antibiotic cream or nasal spray to use daily for several days. This will help eliminate the staph colony in your nose and prevent the spread of infection to your own skin and to other people through sneezing, exhaling, etc., If regular antibacterial soap is not helping or is bothering your skin, your doctor may be able to prescribe a more effective, or gentler alternative. Topical antibiotics can also be prescribed to apply to boil-prone areas, or open wounds.

, MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) is a strain of staph that has become antibiotic-resistant, making it much harder to treat. It is often picked up in hospitals and other healthcare settings, such as nursing homes. However, it can also be spread by skin-to-skin contact, such as during sports activities.Boils occur with MRSA infections. Other signs to look for include abscesses (collections of pus in your skin),carbuncles (lumps that often contain pus and fluid),and impetigo (thick, crusted boils that itch). If you think you may have a MRSA infection, see your doctor as soon as possible.

Apply a cold compress, such as a cold washcloth, to the bruise for 1 to 2 days after the injury.,
Avoid massaging the bruise or applying heat, which may cause it to worsen.

,
Elevate and rest the bruised area.

,
Take bromelain.",How to Prevent Bruising1," Never apply ice directly to your skin; it could cause frostbite.;
,,, Bromelain, a supplement derived from pineapple stems, may reduce bruising and swelling by breaking down blood proteins.

"
"
Hydrate the affected area.,
Avoid overexposure to water.,
Ignore the “urine” rumors.,
Soak existing calluses.,
Exfoliate the thickened skin.,
Use over-the-counter insoles or toe caps.",How to Prevent Calluses on Hands1," Make sure to moisturize your skin, focusing on the areas that most often get calluses like the hands and feet. Moisturize at least twice a day, perhaps once in the morning and once before bed. The lotion will soften existing calluses and help to prevent more cracking.Try a powerful lotion like Gold Bond with shea butter. You can find products like this at any pharmacy for as little as $5.
Udder cream like “Udderly Smooth” is another option. These creams were designed to prevent chapping on dairy cow udders, but are now sold as super moisturizing lotions. It’s perfectly safe for human use, greaseless, and will prevent chapped skin.Apply lotion regularly. Well-moisturized hands and feet will be more resistant to new calluses.;
, It seems counter-intuitive, but too much water can actually dry out your hands, leading to cracking and chapping and making them more prone to callusing. Limit the time you spend in the bath and shower, don’t over-wash your hands, and avoid hot water.Try to keep your time in the water to 15 minutes or less. Salt water will also dry the skin.
Bathe in warm rather than hot water. Also consider wearing rubber gloves when washing dishes to protect your hands from the hot, soapy water.
Always moisturize after washing your hands, and pat them dry rather than rubbing them on a towel.

, There is a persistent rumor in some sports like baseball that urine therapy, i.e. peeing on your hands, can help to harden the skin and prevent calluses. The idea is championed by former players like Moises Alou and Jorge Posada.Human urine may in fact offer some skin protection. It contains urea, an active ingredient in many hand lotions, and will soften instead of hardening the skin.
Before you experiment with this method, keep in mind that lotion is simply more efficient (and less gross). You’d have to soak your hands in urine for about 15 minutes to get a noticeable effect, for example.As for hygiene, recent studies debunk the idea that urine is sterile and show that it may actually contain bacteria.In short, while urine therapy may have some benefit, you’d be better to stick with more effective and more hygienic hand lotion.

, Soaking your calluses in the bathtub or foot bath in warm water for 20 minutes or so will soften the tissue even further and help you to exfoliate it. The object is to moisten the tissue and prepare the callus, so that you can slough off dead skin cells.


Fill up the tub or a smaller basin with warm water. It shouldn’t be uncomfortably hot, but it should not be tepid either.
Some home remedies suggest adding baking soda, Epsom salt, chamomile tea, or apple cider vinegar to the bath.The medical benefits of these ingredients are not clear, but they will not harm you.
Epsom salts are available at many health stores or pharmacies at low cost. You can buy them in small amounts or in bulk.

, Once you have softened the calluses, you can begin to reduce them by exfoliating the thickened skin. With a pumice stone, nail file, washcloth, or emery board, rub the affected area for several minutes. Be gentle. Do not overdo it.Do not use a pumice stone if you have diabetes. Doing so can increase your risk of infection.Follow up with another application of lotion to moisturize the skin.
Repeat this procedure as necessary. You can do so once or twice per week until the callus is gone., If you get calluses on your feet, consider buying some common foot care products. These are inexpensive and can be purchased at most any pharmacy, and they will keep your skin softer.Feet often get calluses and corns (very like a callus) because they bear a lot of weight and rub against the shoes. Insoles will give your feet added padding.Toe caps and toe sleeves fit over individual toes. The idea is to reduce friction on an individual toe and prevent the formation of calluses there.Both of these products are be bought for a reasonable price, usually between $10–$20.
You can also wear thicker socks, apply petroleum jelly to corns and calluses, or pad them with cotton, lamb’s wool, or mole skin."

Use a homemade solution of half rubbing alcohol and half white vinegar.,
Create a vacuum in your ear.,
Blow-dry the ear.,
Use over-the-counter eardrops for clearing water from your ears.,
Wipe the ear with a cloth.,
Tilt your head to the side.,
Lie down on your side with your ear facing down.,
Chew.,
Yawn.,
See a doctor when needed.,
Dry your ears after swimming.,
Avoid using cotton swabs to clean your ears.,
Avoid using earplugs or cotton balls in your ears when you have water stuck in them.",How to Remove Water from Ears," In addition to helping your ears get rid of that extra water, this solution will also keep them from getting infected. Simply make an ear drop solution that is made up of one part rubbing alcohol to one part white vinegar. Put about one teaspoon (or 5 milliliters) of the solution into your ear, either by pouring it in or using an ear dropper. Then, carefully drain it out. You can get the help of an adult to drop the solution into your ear for you.The acid in this mixture acts to break down the cerumen (earwax) that may be holding in some water in the ear canal, while the alcohol dries quickly and takes the water with it.
The alcohol will also help the water in your ear evaporate more quickly.
This method works well for people who are prone to getting swimmer's ear.
Do not do this if you have a punctured eardrum.;
, Face the affected ear down on your palm and then use your palm to gently push in and out until water begins to come out. Don’t do this with the ear facing upwards or you may drive it farther back into the canal. This will create a suction-like vacuum that will draw the water in your ear toward your hand.









Alternatively, tilt your ear down, place your finger in it, and make a vacuum with your finger by pushing and pulling rapidly. In a moment the water should come out of your ear very quickly. Note that this is not the preferred method, as scratching your ear canal can cause infection. If your palm isn't working and you want to use your finger, then make sure that your finger is clean and that your nails are short.
Additionally during the ""in"" phase of the vacuum method it may be beneficial to gently massage the ear in a clockwise (or counter) motion while the air is tight. This may help irrigate the moist wax and free the moisture a little. This may be especially helpful if your hearing has been impaired by the experience.

, Though you may be skeptical about using a blow dryer to remove water from your ears, it has proven to work for some people.Simply place your dryer on its lowest heat setting, or even on cool, and hold it at least 1 foot (0.30 m) (30 cm) away from your head, blowing it into your ear, until you feel that water draining. Just make sure it's not too warm or too close to your ear to avoid burning yourself.








Alternatively, blow the warm air across opening of the ear instead of into it. Whenever warm, dry air passes over water, it pulls away water vapor., Look for a 95% isopropyl alcohol solution, such as Swim-Ear or Auto-Dri. These are available in the pharmacy. Add the drops to your ear as recommended and tilt your ear down to drain the affected area.









As with the home solution, you can use the help of an adult to help drop the medicine into your ear.

, Wipe your outer ear slowly and gently with a soft towel or cloth to get rid of some of the water, tilting your ear down toward the cloth.Just make sure not to push the cloth inside your ear, or you may be pushing the water further back into your ear.








, Another trick you can try is to stand on one foot and tilt your head to the side so that the offending ear faces the ground. Try hopping on one foot to drain the water out. Tugging on the earlobe to open the canal wider or pulling the top of the ear to the side of the head can also help the water get drained.









You can also just skip the hopping part and simply tilt your head to one side.

, Gravity may cause the ear to drain naturally. Just lie down with the offending ear facing straight down for the most impact, unless you want to use a pillow for a bit of cushion. Stay in that position for at least a few minutes. You can watch television or find another way to entertain yourself if necessary.









If you're experiencing the water in your ear in the evening, then make sure that when you lie down to rest, that the offending ear is also facing down. This can increase the chances of the water draining on its own while you sleep.

, Pretend you are gnawing on some food to move the jawbones around your ears. Tilt your head to the side that doesn't have water in it, then quickly tilt your head to the other side. You can also try chewing some gum to see if that can dislodge the offending water. The water in your ear gets stuck in your Eustachian tubes, which are part of the inner ear, and the chewing motion can help free it up.









You can even try chewing while tilting your head with the offending side down for an added effect.

, Sometimes you may pop the ""bubble"" of water through simply yawning. Any motion that can affect the water in your ear may help ease the tension and drain the water. If you feel a ""pop"" or some shifting of the water, then this may have a positive effect. Like chewing gum, this will also help free up those Eustachian tubes.








, You should see a doctor when you begin to feel pain in addition to the water that is stuck in your ear. Also, know that an infection of the middle ear may feel like water getting stuck in your ear, and that will need to be treated as well. There's a good chance, though, that the pain that accompanies it may be a sign that the water has caused an irritation or infection that is known as Swimmer's Ear. If you have the following symptoms, then you should see a doctor immediately:








Yellow, yellow-green, pus-like, or foul smelling drainage from the ear
Ear pain that increases when you pull on the outer ear
A loss of hearing
An itching of the ear canal or ear

, After you get in the water, whether you're swimming in the ocean or a pool or just taking a bath or a shower, you should be attentive to keeping your ears dry. Wipe the water off the outside of your ears with a clean cloth, and pat the area closer to your ear canal dry, too. Make sure to tilt your head to one side or another to shake out any of the excess water in your ears.








It's true that some people are more prone to getting water stuck in their ears than others, since a lot of it depends on the shape of your ear. If you tend to get water stuck in your ears a lot, then you should be especially vigilant.

, While you may think that a cotton swab could help you excavate your ears, whether you want to remove water, wax, or a foreign object, using a q-tip actually has the opposite effect, and it can actually push the water or wax deeper into your ear. It can also scratch the inside of your ear, causing further pain.








Using a tissue to clean the inside of your ears can scratch them as well.
You can use a few drops of mineral or baby oil to loosen ear wax if you need to. If you want to clean the outside of your ears, wipe them down gently with a damp cloth., Using earplugs or cotton balls when you sleep at night can have a similar effect to cotton swabs if your ears have water or other substances stuck in them, pushing the matter deeper into your ear. If you're having ear pain or feel that there's water stuck in your ear, then avoid these nighttime aids for the time being.








You should also avoid headphones until the pain clears up, too.

Gently trim your ear hair.",How to Remove Ear Hair1," Before trimming your ear hair, make sure to clean wax or other debris out of your ears. Mix a salt water solution using a ratio of one teaspoon of salt per ½ cup (4 oz.) of water. Dip a clean Q-tip into the salt water and gently clean the immediate ear area (exterior to the ear canal) and the crevices at the top of the outer ear., To avoid cheap, ineffective trimmers as well as needlessly overpriced ones, opt for a mid-range model of ear hair trimmer (approximately $30-$50) . Look for a model with a rotary blade system and skin guard, which will prevent the blades from cutting your ears while you trim. If you are a frequent traveller, opt for a more lightweight trimmer that comes with a handy travel case.Most models of ear hair trimmers are battery-operated, so consider investing in rechargeable alkaline batteries and a charger.

, Choose a room with bright lighting (e.g. the bathroom) to trim your ear hair in. If possible, use a magnified mirror to see the ear hair that you want to trim as clearly as possible. While your fine ear hair might be invisible to you from some angles, it may be visible to people around you!, Make sure your ear hair trimmer fits comfortably into your ear canal and make sure that you don’t have to apply any force to insert it. Turn the trimmer on and gently move it over your ear hair to remove it. Stop and check your progress every minute or two to decide if you like the results."

First, try to dislodge the fluid with ordinary items or methods.,
Prepare a mixture of half vinegar and half isopropyl alcohol.,
Chew on gum, food, or make the chewing motion without gum or food.,
Rest your head on a pillow or go to sleep with your ear turned downward.,
Use a blow-drier to get air into your ear.,
Dry ears thoroughly with a towel if pool or hot tub water got in them.,
Understand the causes of middle ear fluid in the ears so you can try to prevent it from occurring in the future.,
Allow the infection to clear up on its own at which time the fluid should automatically begin to drain.,
Consult your physician for fluid that won't clear up using alcohol-based ear drops or over-the-counter medications.,
Opt for surgery if the fluid can't be removed any other way.",How to Remove Fluid in Ears," If you're out and about and you don't have any other ingredients and/or tools with you, try these techniques for removing fluid caught in your ear.


Put your finger in your ear and try to create a vacuum. Try putting your index finger in your ear and moving the index finger gently upwards. Ears are shaped differently, so this may take a bit of finessing. Move your finger around gently until you have created a vacuum. Try to suction the fluid out of your ear.
Try releasing the pressure with a gentle Valsalva maneuver. Take a breath, hold your mouth closed, plug you nose closed with two fingers, and force air up the Eustachian tubes by blowing. Tilt your head downward, with the problem ear facing toward the ground. You will feel a pop if the technique works.
Stand on one foot and tilt the side of your head that has the fluid caught in it. Hop on your one foot, keeping your head tilted toward the floor. Hop slowly, being careful not to tip over.;
, Mix the vinegar and alcohol together and soak up solution into an eye-dropper. Put a few drops into the ear with the water and wait. Isopropyl alcohol and water are highly soluble in one another; the alcohol helps speed along the evaporation of the water in your ear.









The vinegar and alcohol solution will also help break up any waxy residue that might be keeping the fluid from exiting.

, Chewing or pretending to chew often opens up the Eustachian tubes. Try chewing or yawning while your head is tilted to free up your Eustachian tubes and let gravity do its work.








, Lie down on your side, with the ear that has fluid caught in it resting on a pillow. Gravity can help force the fluid out of the ear.








, Get a blow-drier, turn it to its lowest setting and, keeping the blow-drier far enough away from your ear, send some air into your ear. The air can help dry up some of the fluid that is caught in the ear.









Never use a high (warm) setting, and always keep your blow-drier far enough away from your ear. Getting water out of your ear isn't worth the injury you might sustain doing this.

, Make sure your outer ears are clean and as dry as possible. Try resting with a heating pad (turned on low or medium) close to your ear.








, These causes include allergies, sinus infections and colds, overgrown or infected adenoids, tobacco smoke or other environmental irritants, and in young children, excess saliva and mucus produced while teething.









If you are prone to fluid developing in your middle ear, knowing the causes can help you take precautions to prevent colds, allergies and other triggers for sinus issues that lead to ear problems. Be more attentive when it comes to hand-washing, sanitizing phones or equipment you share with co-workers, and staying away from smoky places. Also if certain things trigger serious allergies, do what you can to stay away from them or be more persistent about taking your allergy medication.

, In the meantime, if you encounter pain in the ear, you can relieve it by placing a warm cloth or warm water bottle on the affected ear. Ear drops designed to relieve pain can also help as can over-the-counter pain and fever relief medications like acetaminophen and ibuprofen








, She will probably prescribe a protocol of stronger decongestants and antibiotics to clear up infection and allow the fluid to drain, usually happening in 10 days or less. Sometimes stronger medications are required for an additional week or so.








, This is especially true for children who have persistent fluid issues from recurring colds and ear infections, but adults can also experience fluid that won't clear up by using medication.









In children, the Eustachian tubes are often underdeveloped, causing some children to have problems with fluid not draining off as it normally should following a cold or upper respiratory infection. The doctor will make an incision in the eardrums to insert tubes into the inner ear to drain the fluid until the Eustachian tubes are more developed, usually six months, sometimes longer.
Tubes may also be used for adults, but usually only for four to six weeks, considerably less than in children. Once the fluid had drained, the tubes are removed, often during a regular office visit, at which time the eardrum heals quickly.

Do not attempt to shave the callus.,
Use a chemical treatment.,
Go to a dermatologist or podiatrist.",How to Prevent Calluses on Hands2," Some people try to cut around calluses with a razor-blade or other implement to remove them. Do not try this. You could get an infection from an unsterile tool or slice deeper than intended, causing bleeding or a serious injury.Self-removal of calluses is especially dangerous for people with diabetes, which affects feeling in the extremities. An infection is a serious matter for them and they can risk losing the whole limb.Instead, make sure to keep the affected area clean. If your calluses are sore or cracked, wash and dry them and apply antibiotic or antiseptic ointment to ward off infection.

, There are a number of over-the-counter treatments that reduce calluses. Many of these rely on chemicals like salicylic acid, which is also used for warts and softens the top layer of skin so that it can be easily removed. The acid is mild and does not cause pain.Salicylic acid products include callus plasters, pads, and liquid drops.
Chemical treatment will turn the top layer of skin on the callus white. You should then be able to remove or peel off the dead tissue.Always follow the instructions for proper usage. Consult with your doctor if you are not sure how or how often to use a chemical treatment.
Do not use salicylic acid products if you have diabetes or other conditions that affect blood circulation, or if you have cracked skin near the callus. You may be at a higher risk for nerve, tissue, or tendon damage., Consider visiting a skin specialist or foot specialist for treatment. Dermatologists and podiatrists have the means to safely remove your calluses without putting you at risk of an infection or injury. The doctor can do this with a sterilized scalpel during a normal office visit. She can also assess any underlying causes of your calluses.Your doctor may recommend some of the steps above, like moisturizing, softening calluses, and exfoliation. She may also prescribe acid treatments, shoe inserts, or antibiotics to ward off infection.In rare cases, the doctor may find your calluses are caused by a misaligned bone that causes friction. You may need surgery to correct the condition."
"
Try to limit the underlying cause.,
Protect your hands.,
Take breaks.,
Get well-fitting shoes.,
Get hammertoes and/or bunions treated.",How to Prevent Calluses on Hands3," Calluses are a way that the body protects itself. There is often an underlying cause that leads to calluses on the feet or hands, like, for example, ill-fitting shoes or heavy activity with the hands. Try to discover or limit the underlying issue.


Calluses on the feet usually come from a problem with shoes or your gait or foot’s physical shape. Preventing them will mean looking for sources of friction.
Do you work with your hands? Are you a gymnast, a gardener, a guitar player, or a construction worker? Chances are that you get calluses because of these activities.
In both cases, you should be able to take steps to minimize, though probably not eliminate, the thickening of skin.

, If your calluses are caused by an activity — a sport, manual labor, or a hobby — try to find ways to guard your hands and reduce the overall amount of friction involved. This may not eliminate the calluses, but it will limit them.


For example, baseball players can invest in a pair of batting gloves to limit friction on their hands. Golfers, bicyclists, and gardeners can also wear gloves.
Athletes like weightlifters and gymnasts need some amount of callusing because of the nature of their sports. However, they should be sure that calluses are kept level to the rest of the hand to avoid tearing them (through filing and exfoliation). In case of a tear, they may be able to wrap their hands in athletic tape.Also be sure to use plenty of chalk if you are weightlifter or a gymnast. Chalk will give you a firmer grip. Some Olympic gymnasts even use mixtures of sticky substances with honey, Karo syrup, or sugar.Wash these substances off and moisturize when done.

, Your hands and feet need to rest every now and then, both to prevent aches and to prevent calluses. If possible, take breaks or limit stressful activities. Give your body time to heal.


Rest your hands between bouts of potentially callus-forming activity. Pushing ahead will make the skin more likely to blister and thicken.
Take it easy on your feet from time to time. Also, avoiding walking too much on hard surfaces, as these put a good deal of stress on your soles., Poor-fitting shoes are one of the biggest causes of calluses on the feet. Shoes should not be too loose or too tight, and should not rub your feet or toes while walking. Your shoes should fit snugly with a small gap between the front and your longest toe.Shop for shoes in the afternoon. This is because your feet swell throughout the day. Shoes that fit you well in the afternoon should be comfortable at any time of day.Make sure that your shoes are well-padded on the inside. Wear thick socks to absorb impact with the ground, as well.Stay away from high-heels and pointed toes. Heels and sharply pointed toes put added pressure on the front of your feet and can lead to callus formation. Avoid them if possible.Keep your footwear in good repair. Worn soles can increase uneven forces on your heel bone and chafe your skin, for example., Hammertoes and bunions are slight deformations of the feet. Because they stick out, they are more prone to rub against your shoes and to develop calluses. Treat them right, however, and you will limit the amount of calluses you get.Both hammertoes and bunions can be padded. Obviously, the best way to do this is by selecting good fitting shoes.
Try using orthotic inserts, toe sleeves, or moleskin pads around the prominent parts of the deformities, as well.
In severe cases of bunion or hammertoe, a podiatrist may recommend that you get surgery. In both cases she will operate to realign the bones in your feet, fixing the deformity and, hopefully, the cause of your calluses.

Research clinics that offer laser hair removal.,
Set aside time for treatments.,
Protect your skin.",How to Remove Ear Hair2," Laser hair removal uses a laser beam to target and destroy dark hair follicles, leaving your skin nearly hairless. Look online for popular laser hair removal services in your area and look for reviews of the clinics offering them. Call to ask about possible treatments for removing your ear hair, and get pricing information so you can comparison-shop between clinics.Ask clinics what financing options they offer (e.g. monthly payments).
Make sure that the laser hair removal is done by an experienced doctor with a relevant specialty, like dermatology or cosmetic surgery., Because laser hair removal works in sequence with your hair growth cycle, a specific schedule of treatments will have to be established for effective hair removal. Make time for 4-6 sessions, held about a month apart, which is the standard procedure for most patients. Note that given the small area that ear hair covers, ear hair removal sessions should last only a short time., To protect your skin and ensure the results of your laser treatments, avoid the sun for approximately 6 weeks before your first appointment. Getting a lot of sun can greatly increase the risk of skin lightening during treatment. Keep your ears protected by wearing a wide brimmed hat outdoors before and during your hair removal sessions, or by applying sunscreen with a high SPF to your ears."
"
Opt against using scissors.,
Don’t use tweezers.,
Never use hair removal creams.",How to Remove Ear Hair3," Unless you are left with no other options, avoid using scissors to cut ear hair. Ear canals are very sensitive and the blades of a pair of scissors can easily damage them irreversibly. If you do use scissors, choose small, precise scissors and trim your ear hair slowly in a well-lit area., Avoid tweezing ear hair, which may cause damage to your sensitive ear canals. Tweezing can cause inflammation or lesions, which could lead to an infection. This method of hair removal is also very painful and time-consuming, so you should avoid it as a regular grooming ritual., While depilatory creams may seem like an easy way to remove hair from your ears, this method of hair removal should be avoided. The strong chemicals in hair removal creams can cause permanent damage to sensitive areas like the ears, eyes, and nose. Even milder depilatory creams (e.g. for underarms, upper lip, and bikini line) should not be used near the ears."

Ask a friend or family member to help with household chores.,
Ensure that you won’t be alone for at least 24 hours.",How to Prepare for a Biopsy," You may immediately begin to freak out when you hear the word “biopsy.” Stay calm and remember that many of these procedures are routine checks. Ask your doctor to clarify exactly why they want to perform the test. This conversation should make you feel better, as it will remind you that their biggest priority is keeping you healthy., There are several different types of biopsies. Your doctor will tell you what kind of procedure they’re performing, and they’ll take you through it step-by-step. They’ll also inform you of any risks. While biopsies are generally simple and safe tests, you may experience bruising, pain, swelling, scarring, or infection at the biopsy site., Depending on the type of biopsy you get, your recovery time will vary. For almost all procedures, you’ll almost certainly want to take it easy for at least a day. Make sure your doctor is very clear about your specific recovery timeline so you’re aware of when you can return to your normal day-to-day lifestyle.If you’re not having any anesthesia, you may be back to normal within a day. If your procedure is more complex or if you’re having general anesthesia, the recovery time may be longer.

, Your doctor may use this information to make adjustments to their plan for the procedure. They’ll also tell you if you need to stop taking any particular medications or supplements in the days leading up to the biopsy., It’s important for the doctor to be prepared for heavy bleeding during biopsies. Even though they’re generally using small needles, not having this information could lead to unnecessary complications. They may change their plans or tools depending on your history and unique needs.If you’re on blood thinners, it’s likely that your doctor will tell you to stop taking these drugs several days before your test.

, Pregnant women won’t be able to use certain medications, so this information will likely affect the doctor’s prescriptions leading up to, during, and after the procedure. The doctor will also be limited in the types of scans they can take., Your doctor may want you to stop taking your insulin the day of the procedure. They’ll give you insulin and monitor your blood sugar during the biopsy. Your doctor could also tell you to adjust your dosage on the day of the test instead of skipping your injection entirely., If you’ve been sick or had an infection, this may have weakened your immune system. Since sick bodies are already working hard to heal, it may not be the best time for your biopsy. Your doctor will be able to make this decision once you’ve given them all the facts., Most biopsies will be considered simple surgical procedures. This means that your doctor will require you to sign a consent form. Don’t get stressed out when you read this form! It should include all the information you’ve already discussed, including the details and risks of the test.If you’re under 18, you’ll need a parent or guardian to sign your consent form for you.
It’s super unlikely that you’ll suffer from any of the risks your doctor will discuss with you. Remember to breathe during these conversations. Your doctor just wants to make sure that you know everything you need to before the procedure.

, Most doctors will ask you not to take these medications, although you should double check with your individual doctor. Along with aspirin, avoid ibuprofen, Motrin, Advil, and Naprosyn. You can take Tylenol for pain.These are all non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that could lead to bleeding or complications during surgical procedures.

, If you’re on blood thinners, your doctor will give you specific advice about the days leading up to the procedure. They may not need you to change anything. Some doctors, however, will ask you to stop taking these meds a few days (usually three) before your biopsy., Your doctor will also make a plan for any other medications or supplements you’re taking. They’ll tell you exactly what they want you to do leading up to the procedure, and whether you can take your meds on the day of the biopsy.Depending on the type of biopsy, your doctor may just adjust your dosage. In some cases, you’ll need to stop taking insulin or other medications and supplements on the morning of the test.

, Especially if your procedure involves general anesthesia, your doctor will probably tell you not to eat or drink anything in the hours leading up to the test. For simpler biopsies, you can likely eat and drink as you normally would. Double check with your doctor for specific instructions.Sip water to take any necessary medications.
If you have a morning slot for your biopsy and your doctor doesn’t want you to eat or drink before the test, you’ll need to stop eating and drinking the night before.

, You’ll probably need to change from your normal clothes into a hospital gown. Your doctor will also likely ask you to take off all of your jewelry. The faster this process goes, the quicker you’ll be out of there., Most doctors or nurses give patients who receive breast biopsies a small ice pack after the procedure. You can put this ice pack inside your bra to keep it securely pressed against the biopsy site., You don’t want these materials to compromise the test. If your test comes back inconclusive, you may need to repeat the whole process over again., You’re probably feeling scared and unsettled as the date of your biopsy gets closer. Lean on your people. It’s important to talk through your fears and worries so you don’t get overwhelmed by them.

You might also want to set up an appointment with a therapist. They can help you work through your emotions and set up a concrete plan for dealing with them.
If you discuss the test with those who are close to you, they can support you through the whole process. They’ll be there for you as you get ready for the biopsy, on the day you take it, and while you wait for results. Don’t tough this one out on your own.

, While you may technically be able to drive yourself for simpler tests, if you’re able to have someone with you, bring them. They can be there for support and transportation, as you’ll almost certainly be tired even after quick and easy biopsies.This is absolutely critical if your procedure involves general anesthesia, as you cannot drive for at least 24 hours after taking this medication.

, If you’re able to take a day off work, do so. You’ll probably want to nap and rest after the biopsy. If you need to work or you have children, try to limit yourself to small and simple tasks. Don’t lift anything over a few pounds (or about 1 kg)., This is the perfect opportunity for you to call in a favor! See if someone else can handle cooking, cleaning, and general household tasks for at least a day. Tell them you’ve got their back when they need it in the future., Just in case there are unexpected complications, it’s a good idea for you to have a buddy around. They can call the doctor and get you to the emergency room if necessary. They can also help you monitor changes and strange symptoms if any occur after the biopsy.While you may experience some mild pain or discomfort for a few days, this should stop pretty quickly. If you’re experiencing sharp or extreme pain, especially at the biopsy site, plan to call your doctor. If your pain lasts for more than a few days, call your doctor.

Determine your skin type.,
Choose the best ingredients for your skin type.,
Make a cream for dry skin.,
Mix a cream for combination skin.,
Make a skin cream for oily skin.",How to Make Your Own Natural Skin Cream1," Different skin types require different care. A dermatologist can tell you your skin type and about any other skin conditions you might have. This can help you avoid foods, medications, supplements, and skincare products that could make your skin worse. In general, the types of skin are:


Normal skin, which has little or no sensitivity, extremely small pores and a bright complexion. It is not too dry or oily.
Combination skin, which can be dry or normal in some areas and oily in others. The oily areas usually include the nose, forehead, and chin. It can cause overly dilated pores, blackheads, and an oily sheen on certain parts of the skin.
Oily skin, which has enlarged pores and is prone to blackheads, pimples, and other blemishes. People with oily skin can have either a dull or shiny complexion.
Dry skin, which is characterized by less elasticity, red patches, more visible wrinkles and lines, nearly invisible pores, and a dull sheen. Certain factors such as hormonal changes, dry weather, extended hot showers, medications, ultraviolet radiation, and ingredients in skin products can make dry skin worse. This causes scaly, irritated, inflamed, or peeling skin.;
, If you plan on using your own homemade cream, it is important to know what kind of ingredients will work for your skin type and what could make it worse. In general, it is important to wash your skin at least twice a day to keep it clean. This will help avoid issues caused by bacteria, fungi, and free radicals.


People with dry skin should use cream with moisturizing agents such as aloe, cocoa butter, olive oil, or honey. These also help repair cracked skin and reduce scars. Hyaluronic acid is a naturally occurring substance in the body that heals damaged skin while locking in moisture, which can be found in some commercial skincare products. Some studies suggest that hyaluronic acid can also prevent the appearance of aging and reduce the appearance of scars and blemishes.
If you have oily skin, opt for low-comedogenic oils, which are oils that clog your pores less. Salicylic acid is a natural cleanser derived from willow bark that neutralizes bacteria and soaks up excess oil on the skin’s surface, which helps prevent acne breakouts. Essential oils with citric acid, such as lemon oil, help control oily skin while promoting skin repair. Tea tree oil is also helpful for oily skin.
Refreshing ingredients such as cucumber, aloe vera, or rose water alleviate inflammation and discomfort frequently experienced by people with sensitive or combination skin because of their cooling effect. Lactic acid, found in milk or yogurt, helps fight free radicals and harmful bacteria, remove dead skin cells, and gently moisturizes the skin., To make a skin cream for oily skin, put 1/4 cup almond oil, 2 tbsp coconut oil, 2 tbsp beeswax, 1/2 teaspoon vitamin E oil, and 1 tbsp shea butter in a glass jar. In a sauce pan, bring 3 to 4 inches of water to a simmer. Place the jar in the simmering water until the ingredients in the jar have melted completely. Then, combine the ingredients well in the jar. Move the cream into a smaller jar where you are going to keep the cream.


Leave the cream at room temperature until the cream cools and hardens. Once it cools enough, place the lid on the jar.
Keep the cream in a cool, dry place. The mixture can last for up to three months.
These ingredients are good for psoriasis, eczema, and scarring on the skin. They also have anti-aging qualities as well., Heat 2 tbsp of almond oil, 2 tbsp jojoba oil, and 1 tbsp beeswax in a double boiler until all the oils are melted and combined, which is about two to five minutes. Pour the mixture in a large mixing bowl and let it cool to room temperature, which is about an hour or two. While this cools, mix 1/3 cup aloe vera gel and five to seven drops of an essential oil of your choice.


Once the mixture cools, take a hand mixture and start mixing the oils. Gradually add the aloe vera and essential oil combination while mixing. Keep adding until you get a thick consistency, about 10 minutes. You may not need to use all the aloe vera. Stop once you get the thickness you like. Move the cream to a jar., Heat 5 tbsp jojoba oil, 2 tbsp hemp seed oil, and 1 1/2 tsp beeswax in a double boiler until melted and combined. Next, remove from heat and let it cool to room temperature, when it should start to solidify. Then, using a hand mixer, whip the oils and add 1 tsp aloe vera gel and a few drops of lemon essential oil or tea tree oil. Keep whipping until it gets thick enough. Then move it to small jar.


The jojoba oil and hemp seed oil have low comedogenic ratings, which means they are great for oily skin and won't clog your pores. The aloe vera help sooth the skin without adding oil and the lemon or tea tree oil will help remove excess oils from your skin."

",How to Hide Acne With Makeup," Cosmetics that do not clog pores are called noncomedogenic or non-acnegenic. The first ingredient in your makeup should be water. . Opt for mineral-based cosmetics, which will absorb excess oil and hide redness without irritating your skin.


Noncomedogenic makeup does not interfere with acne medication.;
, Use oil-free primer to keep your makeup in place. It can be especially difficult to keep concealer on an inflamed zit, but a dab of primer does the trick. Lightweight primers are less likely to irritate acne and are easier on oily skin.


Use a primer with SPF for protection from the sun, especially if you have scarring or hyperpigmentation. Sun exposure can slow the healing process.

, A mineral-powder foundation is less likely to clog your pores than a liquid foundation, though it will provide less coverage. Opt for mattifying products: they absorb excess oil, and a matte finish conceals bumpiness.


Avoid shimmery finish, which will draw attention to bumps.
Foundations that are designed to last all day are more likely to clog your pores, causing further acne.

, Concealer that is too light or dark will highlight your trouble spots, rather than hiding them. Mix two shades of concealer if you cannot find one that matches your skin. , Setting powder can benefit oily skin, but can exacerbate dryness in other skin. If you choose to use it, find a light setting powder that is less likely to trap oils under your skin.

, Before applying makeup, gently wash your face with warm water. Gently rub in a fragrance-free water-based moisturizer. Apply a sunscreen or a moisturizer-sunscreen combination for protection against the sun.


Sunscreen does not cause acne unless it contains harmful chemicals such as PABA and benzophenone., You can use brushes or sponges to apply your makeup if you would like to avoid touching your skin. Acne can be caused by bacteria on the hands, but sponges or brushes can also hold bacteria, so be sure wash them at least twice a week.

, Wait a few minutes to allow your skin to absorb the moisturizer, then use your fingers or a sponge to apply primer. If you prefer not to use a primer across your whole face, you can dab it onto problem spots to help fasten your concealer.

, Wait a few minutes for your primer to set, then apply concealer in an x to your acne. Gently pat it in place. Do not rub, or it may streak.


You may prefer to wait on the concealer after you have applied foundation, as foundation will cover many of the milder occurrences of acne.
You can use a green concealer to diffuse pigmentation. Never apply green concealer after applying foundation.

, Wait a few seconds for your concealer to set, then use a brush to apply foundation. Use as little as possible. If your first application seems inadequate, add light, even layers until you are satisfied with the result.


If you still have spots, wait a few minutes for your foundation to set, then add concealer.
If you are finishing with a setting powder, you can apply it now. With a brush, apply it on your skin in slow circles.
Once your foundation has set, you can apply the rest of your makeup.

Try a hydrating moisturizer.,
Use carrot.,
Try milk.,
Make an avocado mask.,
Use a sea-silt mask.",How to Make Your Own Natural Skin Cream2," In a small bowl, mix ½ an egg white with 1 teaspoon of honey and almond oil. Egg white helps with firming the skin and helps reduce fine lines and wrinkles. Almond oil gently moisturizes your skin, and honey helps seal in the moisture. Honey has also been known to reduce the appearance of blemishes and scars.


Apply a new mixture to your face in the morning and evening after cleansing every day. Wash with lukewarm water and pat dry., Carrots have high levels of Vitamin A, C, and B6. These are natural vitamins to help your skin stay healthy and retain its natural glow. To make your own carrot moisturizer, boil 1 chopped carrot in a saucepan for five to seven minutes, then strain. Mash the carrot in a small bowl and allow it to cool.


Add 1 ½ tablespoon of yogurt to the mashed carrot for a cooling effect and mix until it is a smoother consistency. Store the cream in a cool, dry place in an air-tight jar. Apply twice daily after cleansing.
To further improve your skin’s complexion, eat carrots and drink carrot juice regularly to provide your body with essential nutrients., Cleanse your face with plain, full-fat milk. The lactic acid in milk is a mild exfoliant to help remove dead cells. It also helps even out the tone of your skin and reduces scars and blemishes. You can also use almond milk, which is high in Vitamin E, a substance that moisturizes the skin and is recommended for people with dry skin.


To use this, dip a cotton ball in a tablespoon of milk and massage it into your skin in a circular motion for at least three to five minutes. This effectively removes dirt from pores.
If you have inflamed pimples or oily skin, mix the milk with a teaspoon of rice or gram (garbanzo) flour. Gently massage it into your skin with your fingers. Rinse off the substance with cold water and then dry., Avocado has many ingredients that help stimulate the production of collagen in your face. Vitamins A and C, which are found in avocados, have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. These help protect the skin from harmful free radicals. Vitamin E, also found in avocados, helps reduce scars and moisturizes the skin.


For a natural avocado mask, peel an avocado and mash the pulp in a bowl. Apply the creamy substance to your face for 10 to 15 minutes, rinse it with cool water, then pat it dry. Apply it every day if you have dry or sensitive skin. Apply it twice a week if you have oily skin.
To help with anti-aging, mix ½ an avocado, teaspoon of lemon juice, ½ teaspoon of plain yogurt, and 1 teaspoon of coconut oil in a small bowl. Blend until the mixture is a creamy consistency that looks smooth. This is best achieved with ripe avocados.
Apply a small amount of this cream to your face. Keep the remainder of the cream in a cool, dry place in an air-tight container. Make sure you make this cream fresh every week, since the ingredients can go bad. Use this if you have dry and sensitive skin., Sea silt is a type of mud that contains sea salt. This substance is found in coastal regions and includes sulfur, unsaturated fatty acids, and algae. These ingredients give the sea-silt soothing and anti-inflammatory properties. Sea-silt also helps smooth your skin's texture by removing dead skin cells as well as bacteria. It also improves the appearance of blemishes and scars.


Sea silt can be found in numerous store bought face masks, which are generally natural. The masks generally suggest application twice a week, but also check with your dermatologist for how much you should use it based on your skin type.
If you have dry, sensitive skin or combination skin, the sulfur and salt in the mask may cause irritation. It may also make inflamed scars worse."

Avoid stress.,
Have green tea.,
Eat a healthy diet.,
Protect your skin radiation.,
Touch your face as little as possible.,
Use skincare without paraben.",How to Make Your Own Natural Skin Cream3," When you want to improve your skin, try to avoid stress. The hormones produced when you're stressed can cause your skin to become more sensitive to outside irritants. It also increase the production of sebum, an oil made by your skin. This oil can cause acne as well as other skin issues. Stress can also slow down healing, trigger irritations such as hives and fever blisters, and interrupt your daily routine. Avoid stress by:


Getting regular exercise, because it can boost your mood and keep you physically active and fit. Take a moderate intensity walk for 10 minutes a day or a leisurely walk for 20 to 30 minutes at least five times a week to lift your mood.
Get a minimum of seven to eight hours of sleep each night, since a lack of sleep can make you age faster and leave tired looking skin.
Practice stress management techniques such as yoga, deep-breathing exercises, or meditation., Green tea is filled with polyphenols, which are antioxidants that repair skin cells and stimulate the production of collagen in your skin. This helps give your skin a healthier glow and protect your skin from harmful free radicals and ultraviolet radiation. These properties also help reduce wrinkles and also has the benefit of decreasing stress.


Brew green tea with warm water, which is 175 to 185°F or 80 to 85°C. Add two to three grams of loose leaf tea to the warm water for three to five minutes, then strain. You can drink this mixture two to three times each day.
You may be able to find topical treatments that contain green tea, which can benefit your complexion by improving blemishes and other issuesYou can also use premade green tea bags instead of loose leaf.

, Eating well can improve your skin from the inside out. Eat plenty of fresh vegetables and fruit and whole grains to improve your complexion. Eat foods especially high in vitamin A, C, and E as well as zinc to reduce the severity of acne and dermatitis. Some good sources of these vitamins include:


Sweet red peppers
Kale
Spinach
Amaranth Leaves
Turnip Greens
Sweet Potato (Yams)
Pumpkin
Butternut Squash
Mangoes
Grapefruit
Cantaloupe, Ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun can cause blemishes, sun spots, wrinkles, and other skin problems as well as increase your likelihood of skin cancer. Ways to avoid exposure to UV radiation include:


Seeking shade as much as possible and wearing protective clothing. This includes long-sleeved shirts, wide-brimmed hats, and sunglasses, which help avoid getting wrinkles around your eyes.
Using a broad-spectrum sunscreen. People with dark skin should wear at least SPF 15, while people with lighter skin should use at least SPF 30., If you have combination or oily skin, avoid touching your face as much as possible. Dirt and bacteria from your hands clog your pores, which cause blemishes. If you suffer from acne often, remove excess dirt with a gentle, oil-free facial wipe.


Never pop or squeeze pimples. This can cause scars and spread the bad bacteria further., Parabens are preservatives that disrupts your skin's hormonal balance and puts you at a higher risk of female centered cancers. If you have acne or eczema, these may cause skin irritation and inflammation because they are a potential allergen.


Butyl and propyl paraben are considered more toxic than methylparaben and ethylparaben. However, methylparaben and ethylparaben are more easily absorbed by the human body. They also cause the skin to be more sensitive to UV radiation, which lead to skin problems."

Do not use olive oil if you have another ear injury.,
Warm up the olive oil.,
Add essential oils if you wish.,
Collect some of the mix with an eyedropper.,
Squeeze two drops of the solution into your ear.,
Repeat the process two to three times a day.,
Consider irrigating your ear.,
See your doctor.",How to Clear up Ear Congestion With Olive Oil1," While olive oil is almost always perfectly safe for healthy people, certain injuries and conditions can make your ears too sensitive for it. If you have any of the following problems, speak to your doctor before taking any action.Perforated eardrums
Frequent ear infections
Hearing loss in either ear
Mastoid cavity
Any condition for which you've been told to keep your ears dry;
, Olive oil helps soften the wax in your ears, making it easier to drain on its own.Before putting any of the oil into your ears, however, you should warm it roughly to body temperature—98.6°F. This is the temperature of your inner ear, and the oil will be more comfortable at a comparable temperature. You should warm two to three tablespoons of pure olive oil.


Ensure you don’t overheat the oil since this can cause damage to your eardrum.
Note that while olive oil is a common option, it’s not the only option. You can also safely use hydrogen peroxide, glycerin, baby oil, or mineral oil., Blockages can also trap bacteria, which can lead to infection of the ear.Some people choose to add essential oils with antibacterial properties to help with excess bacteria that may be present due to the blockage. However, the olive oil alone has shown to be effective in simply helping to break up the blockage.Make sure to test a drop or two of the oil on your skin to check for irritation before adding it to your ears. Add about four drops to the warmed olive oil. Some essential oil options include:


Garlic oilEucalyptus oilLavender oil, which is safe for childrenOregano oilSt. John’s wort, Once you’ve mixed the olive oil and any essential oils you’ve chosen, pick up some of the solution with an eyedropper.This will help you deliver the correct amount of the solution, and it’s much easier than trying to pour olive oil into your ear.

, Rather than filling your ear with the oil, you can apply just a few drops, which will soak into the wax.Keep your head titled to stop the oil from escaping for five to ten minutes.


You can keep a tissue next to your ear to catch any remaining oil that drips out when you straighten your head—if any.

, Using the olive oil isn’t likely to work in a single application. You should try to repeat the process two to three times each day for approximately three to five days.This should be sufficient time to help dissolve and break up the blockage.

, Though the olive oil may have softened the blockage, some cases require more to actually dislodge it. You can irrigate the affected ear as an additional step if necessary. Use a rubber-bulb syringe (such as those used for babies), tilt your head, and gently squirt warmed water into the canal of the affected ear.Be very gentle since you can damage your eardrum if you squirt the water with too much pressure.
You can pull your ear both up and backward to help straighten the ear canal for best results.Your doctor can also irrigate your ear. He or she will have a safer method with tools using an exact pressure of water to avoid damaging your ear., If the process of softening the blockage and irrigating your ear doesn’t help, then consider seeing your doctor. He or she will have several methods available to safely remove the blockage.Your doctor will also be able to exam your ear and form a proper diagnosis. Your problem may not have been an earwax blockage in the first place. Other causes of a congested sensation in your ears include:Sinusitis - inflammation of the sinuses
Meniere’s Disease - an inner ear disorder with hearing and balance problems
Cholesteatoma - a cyst in the middle ear
Acoustic neuroma - a tumor of the acoustic (hearing) nerve
Fungal infections
Serous otitis media - a middle ear infection
Temporomandibular junction (TMJ) dysfunction

Make sure you don't have an ear infection to begin with.,
When in doubt, see a doctor.",How to Get Rid of Ear Wax1," If you have an ear infection, clearing away excess earwax could lead to a perforated eardrum.(Ironically, earwax actually protects against infections.) Do not proceed with any of the methods, especially ear irrigation, if you:


Have had problems with irrigation in the past
Have had a perforated eardrum within the past year
Have mucus-like discharge draining from your ear;
, Draining or removing earwax from your ear canal may not sound like a risky procedure, but it has the possibility of turning bad if you don't know what you're doing. If your ear hurts, don't risk it. Instead, see a doctor and consult with them about the following procedures.

"
"
Be sure you don't have an ear infection or a perforated eardrum.,
Make your own wax-softening solution.,
Prepare an applicator (optional).,
Tilt your head to the side.,
Slowly put the solution into your ear.,
Allow the solution to work for a few minutes.,
Drain the fluid.,
Flush your ears.,
Irrigate your ears again.,
Dry your ears.",How to Clean Your Ears1," Cleaning your ears under these circumstances can be extremely dangerous, so do not use this method if you even suspect a problem. Instead, schedule a medical appointment immediately. Symptoms of an ear infection include:Fever.
Vomiting or diarrhea.
Green or yellow drainage from the ears.
Persistent and severe ear pain.;
, You can purchase a carbamide peroxide cleaning solution at your local pharmacy, or you can make your own. Combine warm water with one of the following


A teaspoon or two of 3-4% hydrogen peroxide solution
A teaspoon or two of mineral oil
A teaspoon or two of glycerin

, You can simply pour the solution into your ear from the bowl if you don't have an applicator on-hand. However, if you do have one around, it can make the process a little tidier and easier.


Use a large plastic syringe with a plastic tip, a rubber bulb syringe, or even an eyedropper.
Fill the applicator with the solution. Draw up enough so that the applicator is more than halfway full.

, The cleaning process will work better if your ear canal is as close to vertical as possible. Allow the ear you're cleaning to face upward.


Lie down on your side, if you can. Just be sure to put some towels under your head to catch any excess solution.

, Pour the solution from the bowl into your ear, or position the end of the applicator a few inches above (not in) the ear canal and squeeze.


If you used hydrogen peroxide, you may hear a fizzing or popping sound. Don't worry, this is totally normal!
If you can, you might want to ask another person to do this step for you. It'll be easier for him or her to make sure the solution is actually getting into your ear.

, Keep your head tilted to the side and give the solution some time to break up the earwax. Five to 10 minutes should be sufficient.


If you used hydrogen peroxide, allow the solution to work until you no longer hear fizzing or popping.

, Hold an empty bowl under your ear, or put a cotton ball up to the outside of your ear. Tilt your head slowly, and allow the liquid to drain out.


Be careful that you don't push the cotton swab into your ear — simply hold it lightly against the outside of the ear, so it's positioned to catch the fluid.

, After the wax has softened, use a rubber bulb syringe to flush out loosened earwax. Gently squirt lukewarm water (at body temperature—98.6°F (37°C) into your ear canal. For very stubborn wax or for people with very small ear canals, an enema bottle filled with clean, warm water may work better than a bulb syringe.


Pull on the earlobe out and up to open up the ear canal.
Do this over the sink, tub, or other container: it's a messy operation, and you may flush chunks of earwax out.

, With excessive buildup, it may be necessary to repeat the process twice a day for no more than four to five days.


Don't drain your ears too often. Doing so could damage your eardrum and the sensitive skin in your ear canal.

, When you're done flushing, place a towel over your ear, and tilt your head to the other side to drain the water. Gently pat the outside of your ear with a towel, then repeat the process on the other ear.

Thus, it's important to keep track and careful record of any noted symptoms.
Be aware that OME often has no symptoms. Some people may experience a feeling of fullness in their ear or a ""popping"" sensation.If you notice any discharge of fluid, pus or bloody discharge, see a doctor immediately.;
, Ear infections are considered secondary infections that follow the ""common cold,"" or the primary infection. You should expect to see a few days of nasal discharge or congestion, cough, sore throat, and a low fever, all typical symptoms that accompany colds.


Most colds are due to viral infections and, given that there is no treatment for viral infections, there is usually no reason to seek medical attention. Only seek medical attention if the fever cannot be controlled through appropriate doses of Tylenol or Motrin (and reaches temperatures higher than 102°F or 38.9°C). Keep track of all symptoms of the cold, as your doctor will want to know about the primary infection. The cold should last for a week. If you don't see improvement after a week, visit your doctor.

, OM and OME can block sounds, which can lead to hearing issues. Signs that proper hearing may be impacted include:Failure to respond to soft sounds or other noises
The need to turn up the TV or radio to a louder volume
Talking in an unusually loud voice
General inattentiveness

, Most ear infections don't cause long-term complications and often go away on their own within 2-3 days. However, frequent infections or fluid build-up post-infection can result in some serious complications, including:Impaired hearing — Although slight difficulties in hearing are common with ear infections, more severe hearing loss can be a result of ear persistent infections or fluid, which can in some cases cause damage to the eardrum and middle ear.Speech or developmental delays — In young children, hearing loss could result in developmental delays in speech, particularly if they are not yet verbal.Spread of infection — Infections that remain untreated or that do not respond to treatment can spread to other tissues and should be addressed immediately. Mastoiditis is one possible infection that can result in the bony protrusion behind the ear. Not only can this bone become damaged but pus-filled cysts can also develop. In a few rare cases, severe middle ear infections can spread into the skull and affect the brain.Tearing of the eardrum — Infections can sometimes result in a tearing or rupturing of the eardrum.Most tears usually heal within three or so days, but in a few exceptional incidences, surgery may be required., If you suspect an ear infection or OME may be at work, see a doctor to confirm the diagnosis.The physician will examine the ear using an otoscope, a small instrument that looks like a flashlight. This helps the doctor see into the eardrum. Usually this is the only instrument they need to determine a diagnosis.Be prepared to answer questions about the onset and nature of the symptoms. If it is your child who is affected, you will need to answer on his behalf.
You may be referred to a specialist in ear, nose and throat (ENT) disorders (otolaryngologist) if the problem is persistent, frequent or unresponsive to treatment., These are available by prescription and can help open up the Eustachian tube.It works by reducing inflammation in the nose, which in turn helps the Eustachian tube to clear out. Note, however, that it takes a few days for the steroid to build up to its full effect; this means that you will not experience immediate relief., Using an over-the-counter decongestant or medication can unblock your ear help drain the fluid. You can get them in the form of nasal sprays or as oral medication and they can be purchased at most pharmacies. Be sure to follow any instructions on the label.Nasal decongestant sprays should not be used for more than three days at a time. Longer term use has been linked to ""rebound"" swelling of the nasal passages.
While the ""rebound"" swelling is less common with oral decongestants, some people experience palpitations or a rise in blood pressure.Children may experience other side effects, such as hyperactivity, restlessness, and insomnia.
Avoid nasal sprays containing zinc. These have been linked to permanent loss of the sense of smell (rare).Consult your doctor before using any nasal decongestant spray or oral decongestants.

, Some people find antihistamines useful, particularly in longer-lasting occurrences of sinus infections, because they can ease nasal congestion.However, antihistamines can have serious side effects for the sinuses, including the drying up of the mucous membranes of the nasal tissue and thickening the secretions.Antihistamines are not recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated sinusitis or ear infections.Other side effects include drowsiness, confusion, blurred vision or, in some children, moodiness and overstimulation.

, A home steam treatment can help to open the Eustachian tube and release the fluid. Basically all you need is a warm towel and a bowl of hot water.


Fill a large bowl with boiling water; you can also add anti-inflammatory herbs to the water, such as chamomile or tea tree oil. Cover your head with the towel and hold your ear over the steam bath. Try not to crane your neck, and only stay under the towel for 10-15 minutes.You can also try having a very hot shower and seeing if the steam from that can help loosen and drain the ear fluid. Do not try this with children, as they are not as tolerant of extreme temperature changes.

, Though this technique is highly debated, controversial, and scientifically unsupported, some people have had anecdotal success with it. In essence, you run your hair dryer on the lowest heat and blow setting available as you hold the mouth of the dryer a foot or so away from your ear. The idea is that the warm and dry air will turn the fluid in your ear to steam and help draw it out.Take caution not to burn your ear or the side of your face. If you feel any pain or overly hot, stop using the dryer.

, To help clear out your ear when you have an infection and improve the health of your sinuses, place a humidifier in your bedroom on a side table so it’s close to your affected ear. This will encourage the production of steam and help ease and alleviate the buildup of fluid in your ear. Humidifiers are good during the wintertime because the air in most homes is very dry due to central heating.Even placing a hot water bottle near the ear may have a similar effect and help to draw out ear fluid.
For children, a cool mist humidifier is recommended — it decreases the risk of getting burned or injured.

, Most studies suggest that these methods have little to no effect. Ultimately, in most cases the fluid that collects in the inner ear almost always fixes itself, unless it is the result of a chronic condition or persistent ear infections.Most of these treatments, after all, really only treat the symptoms (e.g., ear fluid, congestion, etc.) and not the main problem itself (e.g., OM, OME, a blockage or other problem in the Eustachian tube).

, When deciding on a course of treatment your doctor will consider a number of factors, including age, the type, severity, and duration of the infection, the frequency of ear infections in the medical history, and whether the infection has resulted in hearing impairment., Most of the time, the human immune system can fight off and heal ear infections with a bit of time (usually two to three days).The fact that most ear infections can actually clear up on their own has led a number of physician associations to support the ""wait-and-see"" approach, which essentially means administering pain relief but not treating the infection with antibiotics.The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians recommends the ""wait-and-see"" approach for children from six months old to two years old who experience ear pain in one ear and for children over two years who have pain in one or both ears for less than two days and have a temperature of less than 102.2°F (39°C).Many doctors support this approach because of the inherent limitations of antibiotics, including the fact that they are often overused and have lead to the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In addition, antibiotics can't treat an infection caused by a virus., If the infection does not go away on its own, your doctor will likely prescribe a 10-day course of antibiotics, which can treat the infection and potentially shorten some symptoms. Commonly prescribed antibiotics include Amoxicillin as well as Zithromax (the latter case if you are allergic to penicillin). Antibiotics are often prescribed for individuals who suffer from frequent infections or for those with severe and extremely painful infections.In most cases, the antibiotics clear any fluid in the ear.


For children ages six and up who have a mild to moderate infection as determined by the doctor's assessment, a shorter course of antibiotic treatment (five to seven days instead of 10) may be prescribed.Note that benzocaine has been linked to a rare but sometimes fatal condition that decreases oxygen in the blood, particularly in children under two years old. Do not administer benzocaine in children and if you are an adult, only use the recommended dose. Talk to your doctor about the potential risks., Even if symptoms improve partway through the course of antibiotic treatment, make sure to finish the full prescription. If you are prescribed enough for 10 days, then you need to take the antibiotics for 10 days. However, you should notice improvement within 48 hours. A persistent high fever (of over 100°F or 37.8°C) suggests resistance to that particular antibiotic and you may need to acquire a different prescription.


Note that even after antibiotic treatment, fluid may remain in the ear for several months. You should consult your doctor after the course of antibiotic treatment has ended to check on on the infection and determine whether fluid is still present. Your doctor will usually want to see you about a week after the end of the antibiotic treatment., Ear surgery may be an option in cases of prolonged ear fluid (when fluid exists for more than three months after an infection has cleared up or in the absence of any infection), recurrent OME (three episodes in six months or four episodes in a year with at least one occurring in the past six months), or frequent ear infections that don't clear up through antibiotics. The surgery, called a myringotomy, involves draining the fluid from the middle ear and inserting a ventilation tube. Usually, you will need to be referred to an ENT to determine whether this surgery is appropriate.In this outpatient surgery, an ENT specialist will surgically place the tympanostomy tube into the eardrum through a small incision. The process should help ventilate the ear, prevent the buildup of more fluid, and allow existing fluid to drain completely from the middle ear. Some tubes are intended to stay in place for six months to two years and then fall out on their own.Other tubes are designed to stay in longer and may need to be surgically removed.The eardrum usually closes up again after the tube falls out or is removed., In this surgery, the small glands in the throat at the back of the nose (the adenoids). This is sometimes an option in cases of recurrent or persistent problems with the ears. The Eustachian tube runs from the ear to the back of the throat and is met by the adenoids. When inflamed or swollen (due to a cold or sore throat) the adenoids can press on the entrance of the Eustachian tubes. Moreover, bacteria on the adenoids can sometimes spread up into the tubes, causing infection. In these cases, problems and blockages in the Eustachian tubes lead to ear infections and fluid buildup.In this surgery, more common in children whose adenoids are larger and thus more likely to cause problems, an ENT specialist removes the adenoids through the mouth while the patient is under anesthetic. In some hospitals, the adenoidectomy is done as a day surgery, meaning that you can go home the say day. In other cases, surgeons like to keep the patient in hospital overnight for supervision.

, Place a warm, moist washcloth over the affected ear to lessen the pain and throbbing ache. You can use any warm compress, such as a hot towel wrung out in warm-to-hot water, against the ear for immediate relief.Make sure that the water isn't too hot, especially when using this method on children.

, Your doctor may recommend the use of over-the-counter acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin IB, Advil) to relieve pain and ease any discomfort.Be sure to follow the dosage specified on the label.


Use caution when giving aspirin to children or teens. Aspirin is technically considered appropriate for ingestion by children over two years old. However, because aspirin has recently been linked with Reye's syndrome, a rare condition that can cause severe liver and brain damage in teenagers recovering from chickenpox or the flu, use caution when giving aspirin to adolescents.Consult your physician if you have concerns., Your doctor may prescribe ear drops, such as antipyrine-benzocaine-glycerin (Aurodex) to relieve pain as long as the eardrum remains in tact and not torn or ruptured.To administer drops to a child, warm the bottle by placing it in warm water. This will make the drops less of a shock to the ear since they won't be freezing cold. Have your child lie down on a flat surface with the infected ear facing you. Administer the drops as directed on the label. Follow the recommended dosage and do not use more. Follow the same procedure if you are administering drops to another adult or yourself."

Get a small bottle.,
Fill the bottle with your chosen oil.,
Warm the oil in your hands.,
Saturate a saturate a small piece of a cotton ball with the pre-warmed oil.,
Keep your head tilted for the three to five minutes.,
Repeat the procedure three to five times a day.",How to Make a Homemade Ear Cleaner1," You can either get an ear dropper bottle or a small (1 oz) brown bottle with an eye-dropper cap.;
, Use either mineral oil or olive oil.Oil-based cleaners have the advantage of lubricating the ear canal. Because earwax is a wax, a type of semisolid oil, the oil-based cleaners are better able to dissolve the earwax.Remember the old chemistry saying ""like dissolves like""? This holds for getting rid of earwax. The best way to dissolve oils and waxes is to use other oils.Add any additional oils to the solution. If you have an earache, add five drops of mullein oil and three drops of St John’s wort for every ounce of olive/mineral oil.St John’s wort oil has pain-relieving properties,while mullein oil protects the skin of the ear canal and has anti-bacterial, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory (pain relief) and anti-viral properties.Check with a knowledgeable healthcare professional before using St John’s wort because it can interact with a variety of prescription medications.Garlic oil can also be used in an oil-based solution as an anti-bacterial agent. If you want to add garlic oil to your olive/mineral oil, decrease the mullein oil to three drops and the St John’s oil to two drops. Then add three drops of garlic oil., You want the oil to be around body temperature to prevent dizziness.


You can also warm the oil by placing the bottle in very hot water for about five minutes.
Do a test on your wrist to be certain it is not too hot.
Do not use the microwave to heat the oil. It can be difficult to evenly heat oils to the proper temperature in microwaves., Place the cotton piece in your ear.


Alternatively, tilt your head and using an ear dropper, place one to two drops of the pre-warmed oil into your ear.
As the oil enters the ear canal, it may give you a bit of a chill. This is completely normal and will pass quickly. It may mean that you need the oil slightly warmer.

, This will ensure that the solution does not drain out too much. Do make sure that you have tissues nearby to catch any drainage, though, especially if you used drops. Then, remove the cotton ball if used.


You could try lying down on your side, with the non-affected ear and side of your face on a pillow. This will enable the solution to sink in to your affected ear without straining your neck by trying to hold it tilted while sitting or standing.

, This should remove any earwax over time.


You can also follow up this ""ear soak"" with a rinse, using an ear wash bulb. Fill the bulb with plain warm water. After the three to five minute soak (as described above), tilt your head again and gently place the end of the bulb near the opening of the ear. Do not place it in the ear canal. Gently squeeze out the water around the opening of your ear. Repeat this rinse two to three times. Most of the time, two to three treatments (oil soak plus the water rinse) are sufficient to remove most of the earwax.Avoid having your ears irrigated if you have diabetes, a perforated eardrum, a tube in the eardrum, or a weakened immune system. In these cases, irrigation should be done under the care of a medical professional."

Equalize the pressure in your ears.,
Stay hydrated.,
Sleep with your head elevated.,
Put a warm compress on your ear.,
Take a hot shower.,
Take an over-the-counter (OTC) product.,
See your doctor.",How to Clear up Ear Congestion With Olive Oil2," Most often, the sensation of ear pressure isn’t a blockage at all but a brief dysfunction of the Eustachian tube in your middle ear.You can force this tube open to equalize the pressure in your ear with various easy steps, including:Yawning
Chewing
Swallowing
Trying to exhale through your nose while pinching your nostrils closed
Common causes of Eustachian tube dysfunction include the common cold, flu, elevation changes, and exposure to air pollutants such as cigarette smoke.

, For sinus congestion that leads to ear pressure, you can also help reduce the pressure by simply staying hydrated. Fluids help to thin the mucus causing the pressure.Try to drink at least eight cups of water each day.

, By adding an additional pillow and keeping your head elevated, you make it easier for your sinuses to drain properly.This will help to reduce ear pressure., Try heating a towel and then placing the towel over your ear for several minutes. You can also place a cup over the portion of the towel covering your ear to help trap the heat., If the pressure is due to sinus congestion, you can also take a hot, steamy shower. This will help to thin and drain the mucus plugging your sinuses, which will help to relieve the pressure., A variety of different OTC products are available to help relieve ear pressure depending on the specific cause. Common options include:


Antihistamines - If your ear pressure is due to congestion from seasonal or environmental allergies, then you can take an antihistamine to help reduce symptoms.
Decongestants - If the pressure is from congestion due to a cold or the flu, then a cold and flu medicine with a decongestant will help to relieve the symptoms causing the pressure.
Cerumenolytics - These products essentially act the same way as olive oil to help soften the blockage if earwax is the cause of the pressure., If the pressure in your ear is causing pain and none of these options relieve the symptoms, then consider seeing your doctor. Your doctor will be able to diagnose the exact cause of the ear pressure and determine the appropriate treatment plan for your specific case.

He or she can tell you in a couple seconds if you have a blockage, and perform a quick procedure to flush your ears. You might be experiencing the following symptoms:


Persistent earaches.
Muffled hearing.
A feeling of fullness in your ear.

, To manage long-term earwax problems, your doctor may suggest using over-the-counter solutions containing carbamide peroxide every four to eight weeks.


Brands using carbamide peroxide include Murine, Debrox, Auro, Mack's, and GoodSense.
Your doctor may also suggest prescription ear drops containing trolamine polypeptide oleate, or Cerumenex., The doctor may flush your ears with a water pick or bulb-type syringe to clean out smaller blockages (lavage), or may remove larger blockages in part with an instrument called a curette or by using suction. It doesn't hurt at all, and in just a few minutes, your ears will be safely and thoroughly cleaned—and your hearing will be startlingly better.

, Talk to your doctor or an ear, nose and throat specialist (ENT) if you have frequent and troublesome buildups of earwax.

Warm ½ cup of water.,
Add 1 teaspoon of salt to the water.,
Soak a piece of a cotton ball in the saline solution.,
Keep your head tilted for the three to five minutes.,
Repeat the procedure three to five times a day.",How to Make a Homemade Ear Cleaner2," The water should be warm but not hot. You could boil water in a kettle and pour out the required amount and let it stand until its temperature lowers.Alternatively, you could also run your tap until the water is quite warm (i.e., not tepid).

, Sea salt is best but table salt will work fine as well.This combination of warm water and salt is what gives the saline solution its name. ""Saline"" means containing or impregnated with salt.

, Place the cotton in your ear for three to five minutes.


You can also use this solution without a cotton ball. Tilt your head and using an ear dropper, place one to two drops of the prewarmed saltwater into your ear.

, This will ensure that the solution does not drain out too much. Do make sure that you have tissues nearby to catch any drainage, though, especially if you used drops. Then, remove the cotton ball if used.

, This should remove any earwax over time.


A warm saline solution will work to dissolve the earwax like an oil-based one. However, you may have to repeat the process a few more times than you would using oil because the warm saline does not dissolve the earwax as well as oils do.
You can also follow up this ""ear soak"" with a rinse, using an ear wash bulb. Fill the bulb with saline solution. After the three to five minute soak (as described above), tilt your head again and gently place the end of the bulb near the opening of the ear. Do not place it in the ear canal. Gently squeeze out the saline around the opening of your ear. Repeat this rinse two to three times. Most of the time, two to three treatments (saline soak plus the water rinse) are sufficient to remove most of the earwax."

It is difficult to see inside your ear on your own.
You can easily damage your inner ears if you use improper tools or techniques to clean them. Cotton swabs, napkins, pins, etc. should not be inserted into your ears.;
, If your doctor’s examination detects a buildup of earwax or infected material, he can remove it using one or more methods. These can include:Applying special drops into the ear canal to soften the wax
Using a suction device to pull the wax out
Rinsing the ear with warm water or a saline solution applied using a bulb syringe
A device called a curette or cerumen loop or spoon can also be used to manually remove the earwax.These treatments can take place in your doctor’s office.

, After clearing your ears, your doctor will provide you with specific advice for post-treatment care, and discuss any further procedures that are necessary.If you have an infection of the ear canal, such as otitis external or otitis media, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics. These might be taken orally, or applied as drops into your ear canal
Additionally, your doctor may prescribe antihistamines or decongestants to reduce swelling and allow your ear to drain.
Use all medications exactly as instructed.
Drink plenty of fluids (at least eight glasses of water a day) to stay hydrated, especially if you have fever or infection.
Keep your ears dry while recovering.
Applying a warm, damp (not wet) towel to your outer ear as a compress may alleviate pain. Do this for 15 – 20 minutes several times a day.

, If you have waxy or infected buildup in your ears, do not insert things such as cotton swabs, napkins, pins, or even your finger into your ears to clear it out. Doing so can cause a number of problems:


Inserting things into your ears can push buildup deeper into your ears, rather than drawing it out.This can make the problem worse, as well as cause decreased hearing ability.You can puncture the eardrum, which is thin and delicate.This can cause a ruptured ear drum.Foreign objects inserted in your ear can irritate or damage the skin.Ear candling is dangerous and appears to be ineffective. You can burn yourself with hot wax or flame from the candle, and may even perforate your inner ear., Ordinarily, earwax will fall out of your ears on its own in time.If you feel that there is an unusual buildup or risk of infection, however, you can use some at-home remedies for relief. If you cannot have a doctor treat your ears, you can:


Apply over-the-counter drops that soften earwax. Look for ones that contain carbamide peroxide.
Apply drops of mineral oil, baby oil, glycerine, or hydrogen peroxide into your ears.
Use an over-the-counter earwax removal kit. These contain a rubber syringe to use warm water to flush the earwax out.The things you need for these treatments should be available at pharmacies. You may even be able to find earwax removal kits at pharmacies that will include a rubber ball syringe and instructions for use.

, If you are applying ear drops or other liquids to soften and or remove material in your ear, carefully follow any specific directions provided with the drops (or by your doctor). It may take a few days for these treatments to work.If you are using a liquid such as mineral oil, baby oil, glycerin, or hydrogen peroxide, apply a few drops of into your ear using an eyedropper.
After a day or two, the wax should be softened. You can use a rubber bulb syringe to gently squirt some warm water into your ear. Lean your head back, and gently pull on your outer ear. This will open up your ear canal. Once the water is in your ear, tilt your ear to the other side to let the water drain out.
Afterwards, dry your outer ear with a dowel or hair dryer.
You may have to repeat this process a few times for it to work. If it doesn’t seem to help after a few attempts, contact your doctor.

, Wet wax can become infected because it has lots of dead skin cells which can swell and provide an ideal environment for bacterial growth.To reduce the chance of ear infections, try to keep your ears dry when possible.When swimming, you can wear a swim cap.
Use a towel to dry your outer ears when they become wet.
If water gets in your inner ears, try tilting your head and holding it in that position until the water can run out. Pulling lightly on your earlobe can also open up your ear canal and make it easier for the water to drain out.
You can also use a blow dryer on a low setting to dry your ears; hold it several inches away from your ears.

, When your ears become dirty, gently wipe the outer portions with a warm cloth.Do not use cotton swabs or other implements to clean your inner ears; ordinarily, ear wax will gradually fall out of your ear on its own.

, If you have a recurrent problem with ear buildup, apply ear drops once every month or so to help prevent it. Do not use ear drops more often than that, however, because they can irritate your skin. You should also let your doctor know if you have chronic ear problems.If you wear a hearing aid, you are at a greater risk of ear problems. Have your ears checked three to four times a year by a doctor to catch and treat any issues.Let your doctor know if you notice any unusual symptoms related to your ears (such as a non-wax discharge, severe pain, or significant hearing difficulties), or if you are unsure of their condition."

Don't use Q-Tips for deep cleaning.,
Don't use ear candles.,
Don't spray any liquids into the ear with force.",How to Get Rid of Ear Wax6," Q-Tips can be used in the outer ear to remove superficial earwax, but don't dig into the ear canal with a Q-Tip. The tissue in your ear canal is extremely delicate; it's easy to introduce infections by smashing into any of the tissue near the tympanic membrane, or eardrum.


Another reason that doctors advise against using Q-Tips to remove substantial buildup in the ear is that you're likely to push more earwax into the canal than you are likely to bring it out. If that's the case, what's the point in using a Q-Tip?

, Ear candling is when you place a cone-shaped device into the ear, light a candle on the far end of the spout, and let the pressure of the candle vacuum out the earwax. That's the theory, at least. Ear candling doesn't work, and is dangerous, for the following reasons:


Earwax is sticky. The pressure that it would take to ""vacuum"" earwax from the ear canal would be so great that it would unfortunately rupture your eardrum. This is because earwax is sticky and doesn't move readily.
Ear candling can deposit candle-wax into your ear. Instead of taking earwax from your ear, candling can easily deposit candle-wax into your ear. That's because you're lighting a candle perilously close to your ear, on a device that funnels into your ear.
Ear candling can be dangerous. There are a host of medical problems waiting to happen as soon as you decide to use an ear candle:The air inside the ear can become so hot that it can burn the inner ear.
The candle can accidentally result in a fire if care is not taken.
The procedure may result in a perforated eardrum.



, Doctors may do this but you should not. Liquids that are thrust into the ear canal may get past the tympanic membrane and cause an ear infection. Liquids that are thrust against the tympanic membrane may cause damage to the inner ear.

Ask your doctor if scar massage is right for you.",How to Heal from a Skin Biopsy," Your doctor may use several different methods to remove skin for a biopsy. Determining which kind of biopsy you had can help you more effectively heal the site.


A shave biopsy removes the top layers of skin, or epidermis and part of the dermis, with a tool that looks like a razor.Shave biopsies don’t usually require stitches.A punch biopsy removes a smaller and deeper section of skin than a shave biopsy.Larger punch biopsies may need stitches.An excisional biopsy removes a large section of abnormal skin with a scalpel.It’s common to need stitches to close an excisional biopsy site.;
, Depending on the size of your biopsy site and if it continues to bleed after the procedure, your doctor may instruct you to keep the area covered with a bandage for a day or more. This will help protect the biopsy site and absorb any bleeding.If the area bleeds, simply apply a new bandage and some light pressure. If the bleeding is heavy or continues for a protracted period, contact your doctor., For the day after your biopsy, leave on the original bandage your doctor used. Make sure to keep the bandages and area dry. This will help the site begin to heal and may keep bacteria from entering the wound.Make sure to keep the area dry for the first day after your biopsy. You can begin to shower and clean the site the day after the procedure., You should change the bandages protecting your biopsy site on a daily basis. This will help keep the area clean and dry and may prevent infection or serious scarring.Make sure you use a bandage that will allow the biopsy site to breathe. This will allow air to flow and help heal the wound. Make sure only the nonstick prat of the bandage touches the wound.You can get breathable bandages at most drug stores and at many grocery stores. Your doctor may also provide you with dressings for the wound.
The average time for bandage use is 5-6 days but may be as long as two weeks.Continue to change bandages every day until you see no open wounds or your doctor instructs you to discontinue use.Depending on the type of biopsy you had, your doctor may instruct you not to use a bandage after the first day or another amount of time.This may be the case if you had stitches.

, Any time you touch the biopsy site or change bandages, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. This will help ensure that you don’t spread any bacteria that may infect the incision site.You don’t need to purchase any special soap. Using any soap will work to disinfect your hands.Make sure to scrub your hands for at least twenty seconds in warm water., It’s important to keep the biopsy site clean while it is healing to help prevent infection. Washing the area daily should help keep bacteria from growing at the site.You don’t need any special soap to clean the biopsy site. Simple soap and water will effectively disinfect the area.If the biopsy site is on your head, use shampoo to clean the site.Make sure to rinse the biopsy site well with warm water. This will remove excess soap and not irritate the sensitive area.If the wound is otherwise fine and not infected, simply changing the bandages and washing the site daily is sufficient to keep it clean.Your doctor may recommend that you rinse it with something like hydrogen peroxide; follow your doctor's recommendations, but don't use anything on the wound without checking first.

, Once you have cleaned the biopsy site, apply an antibiotic ointment or petroleum jelly if you've been instructed to do so by your doctor. Ointments help keep the wound moist and reduce scab formation, helping the wound to heal. Then, apply the bandage.Use a clean cotton swab or clean fingers to apply the ointment.

, In the first few days following your skin biopsy, refrain from strenuous activity such as heavy lifting or anything that may make you sweat profusely. These could not only cause bleeding and enlarge the scar that will develop, but may also irritate the sensitive skin. You should not do any strenuous activity for the entire time that you have stitches.If you can avoid it, don’t bump the biopsy site or do activities that may stretch your skin. This can lead to bleeding and stretching of your skin, which may result in a larger scar., It’s normal to have mild pain and soreness or tenderness at the biopsy site for a few days following the procedure. Use an over the counter pain reliever to help alleviate pain and possible swelling.


Take over the counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Ibuprofen may also help alleviate some of the swelling associated with the procedure.

, If your biopsy required stitches, make an appointment to have them removed by your doctor. It’s important to leave stitches in for the entire time your doctor suggests so that your wound heals properly and doesn’t leave a large scar.


It’s not uncommon for stitches to itch. If this is the case, you can use a light layer of antibiotic ointment or petroleum jelly to relieve itching and help prevent infection.If the itching is bad, you an also apply a cool, wet washcloth to the area to help reduce itching.

, If you notice excessive bleeding, pus, or other symptoms of infection, such as redness, warmth, swelling, or fever, around the biopsy site, see your doctor immediately. This will ensure that you don’t have an infection and can ward off more serious complications.It’s normal for the biopsy site to bleed a little bit or drain pink fluid for a couple of days after the procedure. Excessive bleeding would include soaking a band-aid or bandage with blood.It usually takes several weeks to heal a biopsy site, but the healing should be complete within two months., Every biopsy will cause your skin to scar. Depending on the size of the biopsy site, it may be a large scar or one that only you notice. Taking care of the biopsy site and surrounding skin can help ensure that your scar heals properly and as minimally as possible.Scars fade gradually over time and the permanent color will only be visible one to two years after the biopsy., Your skin biopsy site may form a scab or may simply heal over into a scar. In either case, it’s important to not pick at a scab or skin to help it heal properly and not form a large scar.Picking at the skin or the wound can introduce bacteria into the wound and cause an infection., As the wound and scar heal, keep the area moist with an ointment such as petroleum jelly or antibiotic ointment. This will help ensure that the skin heals properly and that the scar doesn’t enlarge.


The best way to keep the skin moist is to apply a light layer of ointment such as petroleum jelly or Aquaphor to the wound site 4-5 times per day.
You can apply the ointment for 10 days or longer, if necessary.
If you are still using a bandage on your biopsy site, apply the ointment first.
You can get petroleum jelly or other ointments at most drug and grocery stores.

, Recent studies suggest that applying a thin film of silicone gel may help heal scars.If you’re prone to forming keloids or hypertrophic scars, you may want to consider having your doctor prescribe silicone gel to help treat any scars or potential scarring.


Keloids are raised and reddish nodules that may appear at the site of a biopsy or other injury.They occur in approximately 10% of the population.Hypertrophic scars resemble keloids and are more common. They may fade with time.Your doctor may be able to treat keloids or hypertrophic scars with a steroid injection.
Silicone gels will hydrate your skin and allow skin to breathe. They will prohibit bacterial and collagen growth, with can affect the size of your scar.Children and persons with sensitive skin can usually use silicone gel films without a problem.Most patients can begin use of silicone gels within days after a wound closes. Once you get a prescription for silicone gel, you apply a thin film of it twice a day., The skin that forms as a scar is very delicate. Avoid sun exposure or apply sunscreen to help keep the scar from burning and minimize discoloration.Cover up the wound and scar to keep them protected from the sun.
Use a high SPF sunscreen to help protect an exposed scar or biopsy site from burning and prevent it from discoloration., In many cases, scar massage can be started about 4 weeks after the biopsy. It can help the scar heal more quickly and reduce its appearance. Ask your doctor to show you how to massage your scar.


Scar massage can also help prevent scar tissue from adhesion, or sticking to the muscles, tendons, and other things beneath your skin.In general, use a slow, circular motion to massage the skin around your scar. Use firm pressure, but don't pull or tear at the skin. Massage 2-3 times a day for 5-10 minutes.Your doctor may also recommend using elastic therapeutic tape, such as Kinesio Tape, over your scar area once it has begun to heal. The movement of the tape can help keep the scar from adhering to the tissues below."

Call your doctor.,
Consult a dermatologist.,
Talk to your pharmacist.",How to Heal Inflamed Skin1," Dermatitis is the most common type of skin inflammation, and is also known as a rash. Rashes are a swelling or irritation of the skin, and can be itchy, blistered, or bumpy. A lot of times, you can treat rashes at home, but if your rash appears frequently or lasts more than two days, it is time to consult your physician. If your rash is so uncomfortable that you are constantly distracted, contact your doctor right away.Dermatitis is not contagious.
When you call your doctor's office be sure to describe your symptoms in detail, especially any vomiting or fever. Be sure to mention if you have been exposed to a new environment, new foods or new products, such as soaps or lotions.
If your doctor cannot see you within a day or so, you can try going to a walk-in clinic. Many pharmacies offer in store clinics. A doctor or nurse practitioner can examine your skin and help you figure out a treatment plan.;
, If you have a chronic (recurring or persistent) case of skin inflammation, it is probably time to visit a dermatologist. A dermatologist is a doctor specializing in treatment of the skin. They can help you figure out the underlying cause of your skin issue and prescribe any necessary medication.Ask your primary care physician to recommend a dermatologist that they trust.
Make sure your insurance plan covers the dermatologist that you choose.

, There are many over-the-counter medications that can help heal your skin inflammation; however, it can be overwhelming to try to select the product that will be most beneficial to your individual problem.

Select an appropriate cleanser for your skin type.,
Use acne wash if you have blackheads.,
Wash with shampoo for added convenience.,
Use gentle products for children’s ears.",How to Clean Behind Your Ears1," Most people can simply use regular soap – whatever you wash your body with in the shower – to clean behind their ears.If you have sensitive skin, use a gentle foaming cleanser like a product you would use on your face.

Use a cleanser that you’re familiar with – if it’s comfortable on your body or face, it probably won’t irritate the skin behind your ears.;
, Some people are prone to getting acne outside and behind their ears. This can be due to oils from the hairline clogging pores. Wash with a mild acne wash if you’re prone to getting blackheads behind your ears.After you clean behind your ears, dab some rubbing alcohol on the affected area with a cotton swab. This can help to kill bacteria that live there and cause acne.

, Use shampoo to wash behind your ears while you're in the shower. This is a good option if you often forget to clean behind your ears – it’s easy to remember to do while you’re shampooing your hair. Work up a good lather and use the sudsy foam to clean back there.

Be sure to rinse it off thoroughly – shampoo can easily get stuck behind your ear., Parents should clean behind their children’s ears regularly. Be sure to use a cleansing product that is safe and effective for kids.Use your child’s tear-free shampoo or a baby-safe soap or cleanser.

Babies have especially sensitive skin, so avoid using harsh soap on them.

Make sure that you don't have an infection.,
Leave your ear canal alone.,
Put down the cotton swabs.,
Clean the outside of your ear.,
Recognize signs of impaction.,
See your doctor for impaction removal.",How to Deep Clean Your Ears1," Cleaning your ears while you have an infection can be very painful and is not a good idea. Consider an infection if you are having symptoms such as earaches, smelly discharge, or ringing in your ears.If you suspect that you have an infection, visit with your doctor before trying any method to clean your ear yourself.
, For the majority of people, this is really all you need to do. Don’t pour or stick anything into your ear, and don’t try to scrape anything out. The human ear is designed to be self-cleaning, and earwax flows outward to facilitate this process. So, in almost all cases, there is no reason to go digging around in there.Earwax lubricates, hydrates, and offers some protection to the delicate components of the ear canal. It also possesses antibacterial properties, and naturally carries nasty stuff out of your ear canal.The ear canal's skin and hair help direct wax out of the ear. Additionally, chewing and other jaw motions help push wax outward.

, Cotton swabs (e.g., Q-Tips) are great for cleaning a million different little things — except for your ears. Using a cotton swab (or a rolled up napkin corner, etc.) to clean your ears will probably just push earwax down further toward your eardrum.Even worse, because of the thin skin and sensitive components inside your ear, you can easily cause punctures or other damage.
Most cases of impacted earwax are caused by ill-advised cleaning methods that push wax down against the eardrum.

, If you want to get rid of ear wax, wait until it emerges from your ear canal. Then, wipe it and the rest of your ear with a soft, moist cloth or cotton ball. You can even use those cotton swabs — that you’ve stopped sticking into your ear — to get to all the nooks and crannies on the outer part of your ear.Basically, only worry about cleaning the parts of your ear you can see in the mirror.

, Cerumen (earwax) impaction almost always happens due to human habits, like regularly sticking foreign objects — including cotton swabs, hearing aids, earbuds, earplugs, or a stethoscope — into your ears. If you develop an earwax impaction, you’ll probably use terms like “clogged,” “full” or “plugged up” to describe the feeling in your ear.Wax buildup on the eardrum can also cause muffled hearing or even progressive hearing loss. Other common symptoms of impaction include earaches; ringing in the ears (tinnitus); ear canal itchiness; discharge that may smell foul; and coughing spells.

, In most cases, your doctor will use some combination of irrigation and manual extraction to remove impacted earwax. Any pain should be minimal, and you will probably feel the difference (and possibly notice improved hearing) almost immediately.Many of the symptoms of cerumen impaction can also indicate ear infections or other serious conditions that your doctor can diagnose and treat.

While male or female pattern baldness is permanent, there are certainly measures you can take to slow it down and treat it.Sometimes hormonal fluctuations lead to impermanent hair loss. Women who are pregnant, have discontinued birth control, or are going through menopause may experience temporary hair thinning.
Handling the hair gently, using all-natural hair products and changing your hairstyle can help slow the progression of hormone-related thinning.;
, Certain medical conditions can cause hair loss. Treating these conditions can help slow or halt hair loss. If you are concerned you may have one of the following conditions, talk to your doctor about starting a treatment program so your hair will start growing back in. Conditions that cause hair thinning include:Thyroid issues -- when your thyroid isn't working properly, you might notice more hair falling out than usual.
Scalp infections and skin disorders -- hair loss might result from a skin condition like ringworm. Treating the issue can help the hair grow back.
Alopecia areata -- this is a disorder in which the body's immune system actually attacks hair follicles.

, Certain medications lead to hair loss. If you're on a medication that lists hair loss as a side effect, you can discuss other options with your doctor. It may not be possible to switch to another medication, but it's worth looking into. Drugs used to treat the following conditions commonly lead to hair thinning:


Cancer
Depression
Heart problems
Arthritis
High blood pressure

, Hair loss can result from physical or mental shock as well as ongoing stress. Any type of shock to the system is going to have a physical effect, and hair loss is a common occurrence when these conditions are at play.


If you're chronically stressed, dealing the causes of your stress is an important way to keep yourself in good physical condition.

, When you notice your hair is thinning, making the switch to all-natural, gentle hair products is a good idea. Many shampoos, conditioners, hair sprays and other products contain chemicals that are hard on the scalp and hair and can speed up hair loss and damage the hair that's left.


Use shampoo that doesn't contain sulfates or any type of alcohol. These ingredients are very drying and damaging to hair.
Look for conditioner that doesn't contain silicones. These weigh down the hair and require sulfate shampoos to rinse out.
Look in health food stores for hair styling products made with natural ingredients.

, Brushing your hair tends to pull more of it out, especially when you brush your hair while it's wet. The gentlest way to get the tangles out is by using a wide-tooth comb. Start near the tips of your hair, combing out the tangles at the bottom first, and work your way up to the roots.

, To keep from pulling out too much hair after your shower, pat it gently with a soft towel - don't wring it out or towel it roughly. Let it air dry instead of using a hair dryer, since the heat from a hair dryer can cause hair to dry out and break. Letting your hair air dry as often as possible will help promote new hair growth.

, Along the same lines, avoid using curling irons, straightening irons, or any other type of hot styling tool to style your hair. Try embracing your natural hair texture and leaving it alone whenever possible. When you do use heat styling tools, use the lowest, coolest setting you can.


There are plenty of ways to style your hair without heat - experiment with different ways to curl or straighten your hair and find out what method works for you.

, Tight braids, weaves, and other pulled-back hairstyles can cause hair to pull out more easily. Try wearing your hair down or pulled back loosely. Avoid hair elastics and barrettes that might tug on your hair.

, Massaging your scalp can stimulate hair growth by increasing circulation around your hair follicles. Place the pads of your fingers on your scalp and rub your scalp in a circular motion. Start near your forehead and make your way along the sides and back of your head, concentrating on areas that are thinning.


You can try egg oil, almond oil, mustard oil, coconut oil, or jojoba oil.

, The most popular hair growth treatment is minoxidil, which comes in the form of a cream or foam that is applied to the scalp twice a day. Many people experience some regrowth with minoxidil, but it can take up to 12 weeks to start working. You should be aware of the health risks associated with minoxidil, which are outlined by USFDA. Other options include the following:


Hair transplants. Hairs are transplanted from an area of your scalp with thick growth to the areas that are thinning.
Scalp surgery. Bald spots are surgically removed, and the incision is closed up with hair-covered scalp on either side.

, Since being stressed out can cause hair loss, taking measures to decrease your stress level might help to slow it down. If you lead a high-stress life, try the following measures to calm down on a daily basis:


Get more sleep. Lack of sleep causes your body to produce the stress hormone cortisol.
Exercise frequently.
Try meditating or yoga.

, It's one of the building blocks of your hair, and if you aren't getting enough, hair loss can occur. Thinning hair is common among vegetarians and vegans who aren't taking in enough protein. Try eating more of the following foods:


Fish, chicken, beef, and pork
Black beans, chickpeas, and other legumes
Tofu
Dairy products

, The body needs omega-3 fatty acids to create new hair. Getting plenty of omega-3s is essential for hair growth, so try stepping up your intake of the following foods:


Salmon
Sardines
Walnuts
Avocados

, Biotin is a B vitamin found in animal products that leads to healthy hair, skin and nails.Biotin supplements are often marketed as hair-growth supplements for this reason. Take biotin supplements as recommended or increase your intake of foods containing biotin, like liver and other meat products as well as walnuts and leafy greens.

With the help of your doctor, and possibly healthcare professionals that practice in specialty areas, treating the underlying medical condition may resolve your hair loss problem.Your doctor will need as much information as possible about your hair loss problem, so be prepared to discuss this issue in depth. Be prepared to describe when it began, any significant life events that occurred just prior to the problem, steps you have taken to resolve it, and how much distress the hair loss is causing you.If an underlying medical condition is discovered, specialists that may be part of your treatment may include endocrinologists, dermatologists, nutritionists, and psychiatrists.

, Many of the medical conditions listed interfere with one of the three phases of hair growth.The anagen phase is the period when your hair is actively growing. About 85% of your hair is in the anagen, or growing phase, at any given time.The catagen phase is a short period of time, about two weeks in durations, that allows the follicle to regenerate. Hair growth is halted during the catagen phase.The telogen phase is considered the resting phase of hair growth, and lasts for two to four months. At the end of this phase the hair falls out. Most people normally lose about 100 hairs each day due to the hair that is in the telogen phase.Many medical conditions encourage hair to enter the telogen phase. This may cause as many as 300 hairs to be lost each day. The medical term for excessive hair loss during this phase is telogen effluvium., Many medical conditions that cause hair to move into the telogen phase can be treated.


Since your hair remains in the telogen phase for several months, your hair loss may not occur immediately after the event that triggered it. This would include physical trauma and severe emotional stressors., Many medications can cause temporary hair loss.Do not alter your medications for any reason. Talk with your doctor about your concerns. If you feel a medication is causing your hair loss, your doctor may be able to help by either adjusting the dose or prescribing a similar medication to take its place.
Some medications that are known to contribute to hair loss include lithium, warfarin, heparin, and levodopa.Drugs that are classed as beta-blockers can also cause hair loss. Examples of medications in this class include propranolol, atenolol, and metoprolol.Amphetamine derivatives can cause hair loss. Examples of amphetamine medications include amphetamine salts, most commonly recognized by the brand name Adderall®, dextroamphetamine, and lisdexamfetamine.Chemotherapy medications, such as doxorubicin, commonly cause sudden and complete hair loss, as does radiation therapy associated with cancer treatment., Having family members that developed hair loss are an indicator that you may also be susceptible.The most common pattern of genetically-induced hair loss involves losing hair at any earlier than normal age, losing hair more quickly than normal, and an overall thinning of hair in women.There is an incidence of about 21% of hair loss in women that is passed on genetically., Some situations that cause fluctuations in hormones result in temporary hair loss, and others a gradual but permanent change in hair growth.A good example of temporary hair loss is from pregnancy and childbirth.The onset of menopause is often accompanied by a noticeable loss of hair. Menopause is part of the normal aging process, and the associated changes in hormone levels lead to a gradual thinning of hair.Some women with hair loss at an earlier than normal age, or excessive loss, have been tested for alterations in levels of male hormones including androgens like testosterone. The results of these studies are inconclusive as to the role those hormones may play in causing hair loss in women.Your doctor can help to determine the role of hormones in your situation by performing blood work. Severe hormonal imbalances may be treatable in some cases., Sudden changes in your diet, and sudden weight loss, can contribute to hair loss.In most cases, hair loss related to nutrition or diet falls in the category of telogen effluvium, meaning it is often temporary.Talk to your doctor or work with a nutritionist. Your doctor can perform physical exams and lab work that can provide evidence of vitamin or nutrient deficiencies.Working with a nutritionist can help to incorporate foods into your regular diet that will correct any vitamin or nutrient deficiencies identified, and help to resolve the problem of hair loss., The normal aging process causes follicles to gradually reduce their size.Reduced follicle size means that the area of your scalp that supports hair roots becomes smaller, but the number of follicles are basically the same.The overall reduction in the size of hair follicles still allows for hair to grow and develop as always, only the hairs are much finer, leading to thinning of the hair as opposed to areas of baldness.Studies done in women that experience FPHL indicate that the normal aging process includes thinning of hair. This usually begins somewhere around age 40, with the greatest impact in women 70 years of age or older., Various brand names are manufactured that contained minoxidil. The most familiar branded product is called Rogaine.®Monixodil is available without a prescription in 2% and 5% strengths. The products are made in a topical solution or topical foam. The 2 % product is recommended for use in womenProduct directions recommend applying the solution or foam no more often that twice daily.Results show that using minoxidil helps hair to grow in about 20% to 25% of women, but stops further hair loss in most women that try the product.Once you begin using the product, it is necessary to maintain long term use in order to continue to see the positive results. Once the product is no longer used, its effects wear off.The most common side effects of minoxidil include scalp irritation and unwanted hair growth on areas of the face or hands. Sometimes systemic absorption can cause tachycardia, or a rapid heart rate., Finasteride is the only other approved medication for the treatment of hair loss, however it is only approved for use in men.The use of finasteride has been shown to improve hair growth and slow the process of hair loss in men, however research studies are ongoing for the use of finasteride in women.Studies using finasteride in women are currently ongoing and are showing promising results. Your doctor may consider using finasteride, or a similar agent, depending on your individual presentation, other medications you are using, your age, and other medical conditions you may have.
The use of finasteride in women is not FDA approved, so your doctor would be prescribing this to you in a manner called off-label prescribing.
Women of child-bearing age should not even touch tablets that contain finasteride due to the documented risk of birth defects.The most common side effects of finasteride use in men include decreased sex drive and sexual function. Other common side effects include dizziness or faintness when getting up from a seated or resting position, chills, and sweats., Some drugs have secondary effects that lead to hair growth. In some cases, these medications may be appropriate for use in women to treat hair loss.These drugs are not approved for use in treating hair loss by the FDA. Some drugs that may be helpful include spironolactone, cimetidine, other drugs that fall in the same class as finasteride, birth control pills, and ketoconazole.While these, or similar agents, may prove helpful in treating your hair loss, they have other effects for which they are FDA approved to treat. Talk with your doctor about using these medications. Your doctor will consider your other medications and any existing medical conditions in treating your hair loss., The process of transplanting hair involves removing healthy hair follicles from areas on your scalp where your hair is thick, and transplanting those into areas where the hair is thinning, or where hair loss is most evident.This type of procedure involves removing hundreds of hair follicles and grafting them into areas where they are needed.While hair transplant surgery is expensive, the results are very good and are permanent., The process of low-level light therapy, or LLLT, was discovered in the 1960s and found to be helpful in promoting wound healing.Several products are available, and approved by the FDA, that use LLLT technology. While the documented results of this form of treatment do not meet scientific measures of efficacy, many individual patients did see positive results.The underlying mechanism of action for LLLT is not completely understood, but studies have indicated that a change occurs at the cellular level, improving hair growth in many people. More work is needed to develop products that work more efficiently., Work with a nutritionist to establish a diet that is rich in any vitamins or nutrients you may not routinely consume, or that your doctor may have identified as deficient. Take vitamins or supplements that may provide additional doses beyond what you consume in diet.


Take products that contain omega 3 and omega 6. The use of omega 3 and omega 6 products are not approved for use in the treatment of hair loss. However, one study done in women with FPHL showed good results when they took products contain omega 3 and omega 6 for six months.Another study done in women resulted in positive results when products containing the B vitamins and L-cysteine were taken for a four month duration., One research study done in a small group of women showed positive results in treating hair loss when melatonin was used.The women that participated in this study showed an increase in the anagen phase of hair growth, and resulted in improvement in hair thinning.The women in the study used a 0.1% topical solution of melatonin applied to the scalp area for six months.This was the first clinical trial using melatonin in this manner. More research is needed to determine any risks that may be involved in using melatonin in this manner., One small study showed positive results using lavender.There is very little evidence to support the use of herbal remedies in treating hair loss, however one preliminary study showed good results when using lavender combined with other herbal oils, in treating some forms of hair loss.Lavender should not be taken orally. Scalp or skin irritation may occur when lavender is applied topically."

Use food.,
Try essential oils.,
Buy the right products.",How to Heal Inflamed Skin2," If your inflammation is caused by sunburn, an allergic reaction, or is simply dry and itchy, there are many ways to treat yourself at home. Your kitchen is a great place to find ingredients that can help soothe and heal your irritated skin.For example, you can apply cucumber slices to red, irritated areas for almost instant relief.Honey is another great home remedy because it is a natural anti-inflammatory. Rinse your skin with warm water, then apply a thin layer of honey. Rinse after 30 minutes. Your redness and irritation should be reduced.
If sunburn is the cause of your inflammation, you can make a paste using the gel from an aloe vera plant. Mix a small amount of the gel with equal parts cider vinegar and white vinegar and smooth onto irritated skin.
Avocado is another option. If your skin is inflamed due to extreme dryness, apply mashed avocado to your skin. Rinse with warm water after about 10 minutes. Your skin will feel refreshed.

, Essential oils are an inexpensive and effective way to heal your skin at home. Most oils can be purchased at your local health food store. Some pharmacies and grocery stores also stock them.Essential oils should often be placed in a carrier oil (like almond oil or coconut oil) and not directly applied to the skin as this can cause further irritation. Instead follow recommended guidelines for essential oils, staff at health food stores can be a good resource for mixing essential oils for topical use.


Frankincense is one of the most popular essential oils for skin treatments. It is a natural anti-inflammatory, so it is great for reducing redness and irritation. Apply small amounts to each of your trouble spots.
Geranium oil promotes blood circulation, which speeds healing. Apply this oil for help soothing eczema, dermatitis, and ringworm.
Myrrh oil is another natural anti-inflammatory. It is great for soothing rashes and dry skin.

, You can help heal your skin by making sure that every product you use is good for your skin type. This applies to any moisturizer, cleanser, or cosmetic. Pay attention to medicated creams, but also look at the ingredients for all of your skin-care products.Dermatologists report that one of the most common causes of skin irritation is that people are using too many products on their skin. Doctors suggest a simple regimen of a mild cleanser, chemical free sunscreen, and fragrance free moisturizer.
Look for products that are labeled ""gentle"" and for ""sensitive skin."" These typically contain less potentially irritating ingredients.
Ask your dermatologist to recommend products that are right for your particular skin type.

Know the common types of inflammation.,
Learn about environmental factors.,
Consider genetics.,
Try preventative measures.",How to Heal Inflamed Skin3," Before you attempt to treat your skin inflammation, you should familiarize yourself with common types of problems. This way, you can more effectively identify your ailment. This will help you figure out the safest, most healing treatment.Eczema is a medical term used to describe several types of skin conditions that are characterized by redness and irritation.
Psoriasis is another common skin problem. A common symptom of psoriasis is a thick, red, scaly area that covers parts of the skin.
Rosacea typically affects facial skin and is a common disorder that causes redness and irritation. Make sure to consult your doctor if you suspect you have any of these conditions.

, Your skin inflammation might also be caused by external factors. Sunburn is one of the most common, but other causes include allergens such as food and plants. If you touch or eat something you are allergic to, you might see inflammation in your skin.Many people suffer from dermatitis if they wear jewelry that contains even a small amount of nickel. If you know that your skin is sensitive, make sure to find out what your accessories are made of.
Plants are also a common irritant. Some of the most common plants that cause dermatitis are poison ivy and poison oak. Your skin can be effected not only if you touch the plant itself, but if you touch another person or animal who has been in contact with it.
Food allergens can also cause skin inflammation, and often times, hives. If you regularly suffer from hives, you should see an allergist to help you determine the cause.

, Some skin conditions are inherited. These are passed from generation to generation through your DNA, and there is no way to prevent this from happening. One common genetic disorder is ichthyosis vulgaris, which includes symptoms such as severely dry and scaly skin.


Another genetic condition is xeroderma pigmentosa, which causes extreme sensitivity to light. This results in frequent blistering from sunburn.
If you have a chronic skin condition, make sure to consult your doctor. Ask if you might have a genetic condition that can be treated.

, In addition to healing your skin inflammation, you can also take steps to prevent it from occurring in the first place. One way is to avoid foods that are known to cause redness and inflammation. Spicy foods are one of the common culprits. Instead of flavoring your food with black or cayenne pepper, try more gentle flavor additions such as ginger or turmeric.Limit your alcohol intake. Drinking large amounts of alcohol over a long period of time can result in chronically red skin.
Dress appropriately for the weather. Bundle up in the winter, taking care to cover your face. That is where your skin is the most sensitive. Also, make sure to cover your skin whenever you are exposed to the sun.

Give the area a wipe with tea tree oil.",How to Clean Behind Your Ears2," Stand in the shower under a stream of warm water. Lather up some of your cleanser in your hands so you get a good foam. Make sure the water is warm, but not hot enough to burn your skin.

Instead of showering, you can also wash your ears while leaning over your bathroom sink., Lather up a clean washcloth with your soap suds. Gently scrub the skin behind your ears.It may help to use one hand to pull your ear forward (gently!) so you have more space to clean back there.

If you have sensitive skin, try just lathering up the area with your fingertips. A cloth may be too rough for you.

, Stand under the warm water or splash warm water onto the area to clean it. Make sure you rinse all the soap off – leaving soap suds behind your ear may irritate your skin or cause crusting., Use a clean, soft towel to thoroughly dry the skin behind your ear.Pat the area dry - don’t scrub it. Dry inside any folds of skin back there, and don’t be afraid to gently pull your ear forward to access that small space.

If you blowdry your hair, you can also dry behind your ear with the hair dryer on a cool setting.

, Put a drop of tea tree oil on a cotton ball. Gently wipe the area behind your ear that you just cleaned. This can help to remove any leftover soap residue.You can get tea tree oil at most drug stores, pharmacies, or some health food stores.
If using tea tree oil causes redness, itching, or pain, stop using it right away. Tea tree oil may be too harsh for sensitive skin."

Prepare the cotton swab with your cleanser.,
Wipe dirt away gently.,
Only use cotton swabs on the outside of the ear.",How to Clean Behind Your Ears3," Cotton swabs can be very useful to clean small spaces like the area behind your ear. You can also clean behind your child’s ear with cotton swabs – this can be done more regularly and easily than bathing.Select the appropriate cleanser and wet both sides of a clean, fresh cotton swab – use one end for each ear., Whether you’re cleaning your own ears or a child’s ears, be gentle – pulling hard on the ear can cause discomfort. Use small vertical wiping motions to remove any dirt or crust that’s behind the ear. Wipe in a single direction, up or down, to sweep the dirt away. Wipe away any visible debris with a washcloth, another cotton swab, or a cotton ball.

Be sure to wipe inside any small nooks and crevices on the outside of your ear.If the cotton swab dries out, rewet it with your cleanser.

, Do NOT put cotton swabs or any other objects inside your ear. Despite being a popular practice, this does not help to remove earwax and can even damage your ears.Reserve cleaning with cotton swabs for outside the ear only, and clean inside your ears with peroxide, oil, or other liquid products."

Skip the earwax candles.,
Choose a liquid that’s safe to put in your ear.,
Warm any liquid to be used in the ear to body temperature first.,
Dribble a small amount of loosening liquid in your ear to soften the wax.,
Wait, roll over, and repeat in the other ear if needed.",How to Deep Clean Your Ears2," Earwax candles are little more than hollow paper tubes lined with wax. Supposedly, when one end is lit and the other is placed in your ear, the candle will draw out earwax via a vacuum effect. If this all sounds a bit far-fetched to you, rest assured that science agrees with you.Plainly stated, there is no reliable evidence that these candles work in the least, and ample evidence that they can cause burns, fires, and punctured eardrums.

, If you want to try to loosen and drain out excess earwax yourself by introducing a liquid, pick a safe option like salt water, baby oil, or (especially) mineral oil. Commercial earwax cleaning solutions are also available for purchase.Other DIY methods you can find online may carry unnecessary risks. Pouring hydrogen peroxide in your ear, for instance, can cause serious irritation, or even greater damage if you have a perforated eardrum.
Ask your doctor about using a diluted hydrogen peroxide solution. This can be a great option for loosening and draining excess earwax if your doctor advises that it's safe for you to try., Whether you are using mineral oil or another option, warm the liquid to body temperature before introducing it into your ear. Liquids that are too cool can disrupt the workings of your inner ear, potentially leading to loss of balance, dizziness, and nausea. Liquids that are too hot can cause irritation or even burns., Add just a few drops of body-temperature mineral oil (or other safe liquid) into your ear canal, using either a medicine dropper or a moistened cotton ball.Lie on your side, with the gunked-up ear facing up.
Instead of trying to force or flush out excess earwax on or near your eardrum, you might be able to soften it up and encourage it to flow out. The process should be painless and can even be relaxing.

, Remain in position for ten to twenty minutes, or even a bit longer if desired. Then, roll over onto a clean towel and allow the liquid and the loosened wax to drain out."

It is important to know if you have any allergies that may be aggravated as a result of coming into contact with a supplement.;
, Raw onion or onion juice, when applied directly to the scalp, has been shown to increase hair growth in those suffering from baldness. Simply dice or puree an onion and rub it on your scalp.Be sure to apply the juice to your scalp before you take a shower, otherwise you might smell strongly of onion all day.

, Certain studies have found that green tea may promote hair growth.Try drinking a cup or two a day. However, there is no conclusive evidence identifying green tea as a cure for baldness.Brew green tea in boiling water for best results.

, Capsaicin, the active ingredient in chili peppers, has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that can increase blood flow, which is essential to maintaining a healthy scalp. Try cooking recipes with lots of chili pepper or, if you are feeling bold, try rubbing chili oil on your scalp but, be warned, it may burn.In order to avoid any complications, talk to your doctor before applying chili oil to your skin.

Receding hair lines may be a sign you're ""going bald."" Patchy hair loss may be associated with other causes. It is important to fully evaluate these other possible causes, as hair loss can be indicators of other health problems.;
, Most people lose anywhere from 50 to 100 hairs a day. If you're concerned because you've recently been noticing your hair falling out, this information can be comforting. Know that there are many reasons for hair loss.


Evaluate your situation. Hair loss can have one or more contributing factors. The most common factors are age and genetics. If you have hit puberty, and your hair is gradually but steadily thinning, this is perfectly normal.
The most common reason for hair loss is genetics. Patterns of baldness in your family may be a good indicator as to whether or not you are going bald yourself.95% of hair loss in men is male-pattern baldness.40% of men have noticeable hair loss by age 35.Most baldness in women occurs after menopause.Half of men over the age of fifty experience some sort of hair loss., Stress can cause hair loss both directly and indirectly, via a variety of biological mechanisms. Taking control of your stress levels will help you to reduce related hair loss. Unchecked, this level of stress is a threat to your health. This doesn't pertain to little stressors in life; it refers to things that make you lose sleep, or cause big changes in appetite.Try activities such as meditation, jogging, team sports, or yoga to help you manage stress.


One common cause of baldness is the level of testosterone in the body, which can be dictated by your genetics and stress.Try stress-relieving activities, or spend more quality time with your family. Stress releasing activities have shown a decrease in speed of the balding process.
Shock is another factor that can lead to hair loss. Your body is not a series of separate parts stuck together. If you've suffered a traumatic event in the recent past, such as sudden change in lifestyle, a death in the family, or loss of an important job, suffering hair loss a few months later is normal.Oxidative stress, caused by your body's exposure to free radicals, has been shown to contribute to hair loss.Antioxidants such as those found in a variety of foods, such as blueberries, acai, and green tea can help to minimize this kind of stress on your body.

, Don't abuse your hair. Some causes of hair loss are self-inflicted. A variety of styles and treatments for hair can cause serious damage to your hair and scalp. Take extra care not to induce baldness in the pursuit of fashion.


Hair that's put up too tightly can slowly be pulled from the roots. If you like pigtails or tightly-braided hair, try relaxing the binding a little. This will help to reduce tension on the roots. Hair loss of this kind is called traction alopecia.Over-use of hair treatments, dyes, and permanents can leave your hair brittle, fragile, and eventually they can lead to hair loss.

, Hair loss may not be related to hereditary baldness patterns. It can also be caused by hormonal factors. A doctor can help you to evaluate your levels of hormones.


Typical male-pattern baldness or female-pattern baldness is caused by sex hormones that trigger a permanent pattern of hair loss.
Other hormonal factors that can cause temporary hair loss are those brought on by pregnancy, childbirth, menopause, or discontinuing birth control pills., There are also medical factors that can trigger hair loss—some temporary, some permanent, depending on the type of problem and its severity.


Thyroid problems can result in hormone imbalances that lead to hair loss.

Alopecia areata is an immune system disorder that causes your body to attack hair follicles. If you find your hair loss in the form of smooth, round patches, this may be the cause.Malnutrition
Scalp infections such as ringworm can cause your hair to fall out, though ridding your head of infection will usually result in renewed growth.
If you suspect any of these problems are causing your hair loss, seek a physician.

, If you're treating chronic conditions such as high blood pressure, heart problems, depression, arthritis, or cancer, prescription drugs meant to treat these conditions can cause hair loss. If you're concerned that this is the case, discuss an alternate prescription—many drugs have alternatives that have a different set of side effects.

, A diet poor in iron and protein can result in a scalp that's poor in hair coverage. Lack of proper nutrition inhibits the body's ability to function. Poor nutrient intake can directly cause hair loss. It is possible your hair loss is related to your diet and may be mediated with dietary means.Eating disorders such as anorexia or bulimia can lead to hair loss.Crash dieting is another factor in hair loss, combining poor nutrition with a form of bodily shock. Your body sees it simply as starvation.

, Once you determine that you are indeed going bald, and that's it's something you have no control over, such as genetics, you can either accept your body as is or you can try to ""fix"" it. The efficacy of such treatments will depend on your genetics, your disposition, and your financial wherewithal. It is important to note that, while medical treatments have been shown to have some effectiveness, none of them will be able to completely reverse male pattern balding.


Minoxidil (the active ingredient in Rogaine) is an over-the-counter solution for some types of baldness. It's had some success in slowing or even rejuvenating hair growth. However, minoxidil is only effective on hair loss on the back of the head, not on the front. Side effects include irritation and unwanted hair growth on the face.Finasteride (Propecia) is a prescription medication pill taken daily for treating male-pattern baldness. Results include slowing of hair loss and some in some, new hair growth. Side effects may include depression, diminished sex drive and sexual function, and a low-but-present risk of a fast-growing prostate cancer, and is not recommended for women of child-bearing age.Hair transplants, or hair plugs, work by transplanting tiny clumps of skin, each containing a few hairs, from the back or sides of your scalp. These clumps are then plugged into the bald sections of your scalp. This won't stop balding, and may require occasional additional treatments as your hair loss progresses.Scalp reduction surgically removes some of the bald skin on your head. The bald skin is removed, and the hairy scalp is moved into place., You may not want the pain of plugs or the possibility you'll maybe regrow some of your hair. You may be suffering from non-permanent hair loss if, for example, you're subject to chemotherapy treatments. There is the tried and true alternative that men and women have used for centuries: the humble wig.


Wigs come in all shape, styles, colors, and materials. You can pick up a few cheap wigs to find out what styles and colors work for you, or you can find a custom wig maker in your area who can recreate your normal styling so that your rug looks perfectly natural.
Human hair wigs are available, and can be exceptionally good—for an exceptional price.
Some charitable organizations, notably Locks of Love, offer wigs to children with long-term or permanent hair loss. These are made of human hair, and are available to a limited number of recipients for free or for affordable prices, depending on needs. To fund the charity, they also sell wigs retail. This could be a good source if you want a human hair wig, and wish to support a charitable cause at the same time.

, Embrace baldness with bald-friendly hairstyles such as a buzzed/shaved head. Think about all the handsome and impressive people who have rocked the bald look over the years — Bruce Willis, Michael Jordan, Vin Diesel, Samuel L. Jackson, Patrick Stewart, Larry David, Jason Statham, Andre Agassi... there's a long, long list of people who have embraced their baldness and have not allowed it to hold them back. It didn't stop Sean Connery from being named People Magazine's ""Sexiest Man Alive"" in 1989.


According to a study in Social Psychological and Personality Science journal, men who are completely bald were found to be more masculine, dominant, taller, and stronger than men with hair."

Look into genetic factors.,
Examine recent events and stress levels.,
Consider chemical interactions that affect the growth phase of your hair.,
Consider autoimmune and/or inflammatory conditions.,
Try to diagnose any infections.,
Read medication labels closely for hair loss as a side effect.,
Consider other conditions and diseases that can result in hair loss.,
Note if your hair style can contribute to hair loss.",How to Stop Hair Loss With Natural Remedies1," Hair loss (known as alopecia) can be based on genetic factors (male-pattern baldness and female-pattern baldness). These are both known as androgenic alopecia because both are dependent on levels of the hormone androgen, which is responsible for hair on the scalp, face, chest, underarms, and genital regions.In men, the hair loss occurs at the front of hairline and on the top of the head (the “bald spot”).
In women, hair is thinned all over the scalp, but more at the top of the head. Women usually don’t get bald spots.Androgenic alopecia is the most common form of hair loss.
Though far less common, congenital hypotrichosis is a group of genetic conditions with little or no hair growth. These may be due to single or multiple gene defects.;
, Environmental causes can lead to what’s known as telogen effluvium (TE), which is the second leading cause of hair loss. The telogen phase is the resting phase of hair growth. If, for any reason, the number of hair follicles in the active, growth phase drops, TE can result, and a person would notice more shedding, usually by noting more hair than usual in a comb or brush. You might also notice more hair loss during bathing or on a bath towel. TE can develop in three ways:


An environmental “insult” stuns or shocks the hair follicles, and they stop growing. This type of TE is usually temporary as long as the triggering event is temporary, and normal hair growth returns within 6-12 months.
If the environmental “insult” is more persistent, more and more hair follicles enter the resting state, and there will be a slow, but constant loss of hair.
A third type of TE may or may not be due to an environmental stressor. In this type, the hair follicles go through shorter hair-growth cycles. The result is thin scalp hair and shedding short hairs, which are very thin.
The environmental stressors can be many. Some short-term stressors include postpartum alopecia (after giving birth), physical trauma (an accident, a fall, or a broken leg, for instance), vaccinations, crash dieting, or medications, especially antidepressants. More persistent environmental stressors that may lead to more persistent TE include nutritional deficiencies (iron, zinc, B-vitamins, lysine) and chronic stress.

, Anagen effluvium is a rapid form of hair loss due to an interruption in the anagen (or growth phase) of your hair. The most common causes are cancer chemotherapy and poisonings (such as heavy metal poisoning). Once chemotherapy ends, or when the poisoning has been treated, hair growth returns, though not always as before. Some people experience a change in hair color or type—changing to curly from straight or vice versa.

, Alopecia areata (AA) is believed to be an autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks the hair follicles. Hair loss can be sudden and most often happens on the scalp in patches. If the entire scalp is affected, it is called alopecia totalis. If the entire body is affected, it is called alopecia universalis. If it is limited to the beard area in men, it is termed alopecia barbae. Different forms of AA are seen in men, women, and children. AA may go into a spontaneous remission, or it can be persistent.


Conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (Lupus or SLE), discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) and sarcoidosis are other autoimmune conditions that can lead to hair loss.Folliculitis and seborrheic dermatitis are two examples of inflammatory skin conditions that can cause hair loss. If you notice any overly dry skin or red, acne-like rashes around the site of the hair loss, then contact your doctor for a diagnosis.
Many of these conditions can lead to scarring alopecia, which occurs when scar tissue results in irreversible destruction of hair follicles. This can be the result of a chronic disease (SLE) or various forms of folliculitis.

, Certain viral, bacterial, and fungal infections (such as HIV, late-stage syphilis, and ringworm, respectively) can also lead to hair loss.When ringworm (a group of common fungal infections with no actual worms involved) occurs on the scalp, it results in patchy hair loss called tinea capitis.


There are a number of fungal organisms that can cause tinea capitis, including Microsporum audouini, Trichophyton tonsurans (especially in Latin American countries), Trichophyton schoenleinii, Trichophyton megnini (Southern Europe and Africa), and Trichophyton violaceum (Middle East).

, Drugs such as antidepressants, acne medications, anticoagulants (blood thinners), anticonvulsants, cholesterol-lowering drugs, beta-blockers used in glaucoma or heart disease, anti-fungals, anti-gout medications, anti-inflammatory drugs, and medications used to treat Parkinson’s disease, ulcers, and thyroid disease may all have hair loss as a side effect., If you suffer from muscular disorders (muscular dystrophy) or glandular conditions such as hyperthyroid (overactive thyroid), hypothyroid (underactive thyroid), either low or high adrenal function, or diseases of the pituitary gland, then you may also experience hair loss as a result., Certain hairstyles (tight pigtails and corn rows, for instance) and chemical or physical treatments (curling irons, perms, hot oil treatments, hair color products) can encourage hair loss.Keratin-treated hair (also known as Brazilian Blowout or Brazilian Keratin Treatment) has been reported to cause hair loss because of the presence of formaldehyde-like chemicals in the products.In August 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sent a warning letter to the producers of many such products citing both safety and labeling violations."

Cut down on foods high in sugar, fat, and preservatives.,
Avoid eggs and dairy.,
Reduce your stress levels.,
Wear breathable clothing.",How to Heal Eczema Fast2," Eczema has been linked to junk food and a poor diet. Avoid foods that are inflammatory, such as fried foods, foods with artificial sugars, and foods high in preservatives. Instead, go for foods that are fresh and high in nutrients, such as vegetables, fruits, and healthy sources of protein like chicken, tofu, and beans.Talk to your doctor before you make any major changes to your diet. Do not change your diet drastically and suddenly without speaking to your doctor first.
Apples, oranges, kiwi, and tomatoes are common culprits of eczema.

, Eggs and dairy have been shown to cause skin issues for some people, especially if you have an allergy or sensitivity to these foods. Try cutting eggs and dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt out of your diet.If you notice your eczema improves once you remove eggs and dairy from your diet, you may have an allergy to these foods. You can get your doctor to do an allergy test to confirm your allergy so you can cut these foods out of your diet completely.
Peanuts, soy, wheat, and fish can also exacerbate symptoms.

, Eczema is also tied to stress and anxiety. Try to reduce your stress levels so your eczema does not flare up. Do a calming activity like reading, writing, or watching television. Go to a yoga class or take a long walk outside. Hang out with friends to help blow off some steam and keep your stress levels down.You can also try doing a five minute meditation to center your mind and stay calm. Do deep breathing to help you stay relaxed.

, Go for tops and bottoms made of cotton or other breathable materials like linen or hemp. Avoid clothing in synthetic materials or non-breathable materials like wool. Wearing breathable clothing will ensure your skin does not become more irritated by your clothing.You should also wear appropriate workout clothing when you exercise or sweat, as this can prevent your eczema from flaring up. Remember that exercise can make your eczema worse.

Increase your intake of omega-3 fatty acids.,
Avoid shampooing too often.,
Avoid damaging hairstyling techniques.,
Massage essential oils into your scalp.,
Add other herbs to your essential oil mix.,

Take a mental vacation.",How to Stop Hair Loss With Natural Remedies2," While you may seek a natural remedy to stop losing your hair, diagnosing the exact cause of your hair loss should be the first step. If nothing else, you should get a checkup to ensure that the hair loss isn’t a symptom of a more harmful disease or condition.

, Hair is primarily protein, and strong, healthy hair comes from “the inside.” Make sure you are getting enough vitamins, minerals, and high-quality protein. You should try for a variety of sources of complete protein, which contain all the essential amino acids (protein building blocks). Here is a list of some foods that are complete proteins:Eggs
Dairy products
Quinoa (this high-fiber food also has high levels of iron, magnesium, and manganese
Buckwheat
Hemp seed (also contains high levels of magnesium, zinc, iron, and calcium)
Chia seeds (also contain high levels of omega-3 fatty acids)
Soy products (including tofu, tempeh, and natto)
A combination of rice and beans (rich in methionine and lysine, respectively, so together, they form a complete protein)

, You should also ensure that you eat a diet high in B-complex vitamins. Your body needs B vitamins to promote healthy hair follicles and healthy hair growth. These foods include:Leafy green vegetables, such as spinach, parsley, mustard greens, romaine lettuce, turnip greens, and beet greens
Other vegetables, including broccoli, beets, turnips, and bell peppers
Legumes, such as lentils
Calf and beef liver and fortified grains, which are rich in vitamin B12

, The only mineral that has been proven to be connected to hair loss is iron.Increasing iron in your diet may reduce hair loss. However, consult your doctor before adding iron supplements to your daily regimen to ensure you don’t take in too much of the mineral. Foods high in iron include:


Eggs
Red meat (go for grass-fed beef or buffalo, which are higher in omega-3 fats as well)
Dark, leafy green vegetables
Beans and lentils
Liver

, While low zinc has been implicated in hair loss, it is still not known if zinc deficiencies play a primary or secondary role in hair loss.Foods high in zinc include:


Seafood and shellfish
Spinach
Pumpkin, squash, sunflower seeds
Various nuts

, Omega-3 fatty acids used on the scalp have been shown to increase the numbers of hair strands.Increasing the amounts of omega-3 fatty acids in your diet may be useful for hair loss. Omega-3 fatty acids are found in:


Varieties of fish, including salmon, mackerel, herring, sardines, and bass
Eggs
Flaxseed oil
Soybeans
Chia seeds
Walnuts

, Frequent shampooing can strip hair of natural oils. Frequent shampooing doesn’t really cause hair loss, but if you are stripping the oils from your hair, it can make the hair more fragile and likely to break. Many professionals advise their clients not to shampoo daily, but instead recommend 2-3 times a week.Avoid shampoos that are loaded with chemicals, such as sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), parabens, and ammonium chloride, especially if you have thin, fragile, or treated hair.
Also, remember not to “over condition” your hair. Conditioners can weigh down the roots of the hair and damage the hair follicles. Use a conditioner 1-2 times a week and avoid using conditioner on the scalp., When brushing or combing your hair, be gentle and don’t get “over-vigorous.” Use a wide-toothed comb to untangle your hair, especially when wet, to avoid pulling out your roots and breaking the hair strands.


This also includes avoiding heat styling tools. Let your hair air dry.
Avoid dyeing, chemically straightening, perming, or bleaching your hair.
Avoid extensions, weaves, and tight hairstyles that can lead to hair loss.

, You can massage oils into your scalp to help improve hair growth. These can nourish the hair follicles, increase blood flow to your scalp and promote relaxation.Oils you can use include coconut oil, argan oil, emu oil, castor oil, and almond oil.Pour a quarter-sized amount of oil into the center of your palm, and use your fingertips to apply it around your scalp. Then massage the oil into your entire scalp. You can do this for 5-10 minutes once a week or more often if you prefer.
To further reduce stress add 1-2 drops of essential lavender oil to two ounces of oil. Lavender has also been shown to increase hair growth.To promote healing and hair growth, try 1-2 drops of calendula oil in two ounces of oil., There are a variety of other herbs that have shown positive results. You can try adding some of the following to your essential oil mix:


Serenoa repens (saw palmetto), Cimicifuga racemosa (black cohosh), Urtica dioica (nettles), and Pygeum africanum (African prune) contain 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors similar to those found in finasteride, which is a hair loss treatment. There have been some positive results in small clinical trials using these herbs topically on the scalp.Green tea increased hair regrowth in one study in rats and has been used traditionally as a rinse to increase hair growth.Green tea also has 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor activity similar to that found in finasteride.Anti-inflammatory herbs, including onion and garlic, licorice root, panax ginseng, and ginkgo biloba have been used traditionally to reduce inflammation and promote hair growth.Licorice root also inhibits androgen activity and may be useful for both male and female pattern baldness.Onion juice has been tested and stimulated hair growth in both men and women as well.Rinse well after using the onion juice, and use the onion juice only once a week., Since chronic stress is a major cause of telogen effluvium (see above), try techniques to help manage the stress in your life. The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends the following “emergency” stress relievers:Count to ten before speaking
Take 3-5 deep breaths
Handle stressful situations later when possible
Go for a walk
Admit when you’ve made a mistake, and don’t be afraid to say you’re sorry
Avoid the stress of running late by setting your watch 5-10 minutes ahead
Break big problems down into smaller, manageable parts
Drive in the slow lane or avoid busy roads to help you stay calm while driving
Try smelling a rose, hugging a loved one, or smiling at your neighbor
Consider meditation or prayer to break the negative cycle

, The American Psychological Association (APA) suggests progressive muscle relaxation to help reduce stress. Start with your feet and lower legs and first tighten them as much as possible for roughly thirty seconds before slowly releasing the tension. Move on to your upper legs and repeat, Move onto your hands and lower arms, upper arms and shoulders, and finally your stomach and abdominal muscles. Repeat daily., Another technique suggested by the APA is taking a mental vacation. Take a few deep breaths, relax, and close your eyes. Imagine the most beautiful place you have ever been. Try to experience that place as fully as you can, smelling the smells, feeling a breeze, hearing the sounds, etc. Repeat daily."

Try 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors.,
Try minoxidil.,
Try hormone replacement therapy for hair loss in women.,
Use non-surgical hair replacement.,
Look into surgical hair replacement.",How to Stop Hair Loss With Natural Remedies3," The main drug treatment for men’s hair loss are the 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors Proscar and Propecia, which are trade names for finasteride. 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors are anti-androgens and block their activity on hair follicles to prevent male and female pattern baldness.


5-alpha-reductase inhibitors used to treat men are less often used for women because of adverse effects of lowering androgen levels in women. The drugs are never prescribed to women hoping to become pregnant due to adverse effects to the fetus.

, Another drug used to increase hair growth is minoxidil (Loniten, Vitadil-2A), which was originally prescribed to lower blood pressure. Minoxidil is generally less effective than finasteride, but it can be applied directly to the areas of hair loss.


2% minoxidil is more commonly prescribed to women because it can be applied to the areas of hair loss and has fewer side effects. In fact, it appears that minoxidil works better for more women than men. Many dermatologists also use 5% topical Minoxidil off-label for hair loss in women as it works better with fuller hair than 2% topical Minoxidil.

, In women, hormone replacement therapy with estrogen and progestin can be helpful (progestin is the synthetic form of progesterone). In Europe, a synthetic estrogen, ethinyloestradiol is combined with cyproterone acetate to treat women’s alopecia. This is not available in the U.S. But the safest form of bioidentical hormone replacement is bioidentical estrogen and progesterone through a naturopath., For non-surgical hair replacement (wigs, extensions, weaves, hairpieces, and toupees), most professionals recommend carefully looking at what is available. One recent survey indicated that over 70% of people were unhappy with the service provided by hair replacement salons.


Hair replacements are based on a support of polymers, meshes, or a combination of the two. There are differences in cost, comfort, look, feel and how they are attached. The hair can be natural human hair, animal hair, or synthetic fibers.
They can be semi-permanently attached with an adhesive or by weaving it into natural hair, but this is not often recommended because you cannot properly clean the scalp underneath unless it it professionally removed and then reattached. Since this should be done at least every 5-7 days, it can be costly and time-consuming.
Using the semi-permanently attached hair replacement means you will need to get two replacements—one to wear while the other is being maintained.
Other recommended methods of attachment include double-sided tape or metal clips. In this case, home care and maintenance is all that is required.

, At this time, the only type of surgical hair replacement recommended by the American Hair Loss Association (AHLA) is harvesting your own androgen-resistant hair. This hair is then transplanted into the areas of hair loss. Getting hair transplants from donors would necessitate lifelong anti-rejection medications, which is too risky.

Talk to your hair stylist about treatments and styling.Some chemical processes might cause hair to break off or fall off temporarily.,
Take family history into consideration.,
Keep track of excessive shedding.,
Be cautious about pulling out your hair.,
See your family doctor or dermatologist about medical conditions.,
Check for small, round bald patches.,
Speak with your doctor about medications.",How to Stop Teen Hair Loss1," These include bleaching and coloring, straightening, and perms. Heat from straightening irons or blow-drying can also cause hair loss.


Hairstyles that pull your hair tightly can cause ""traction alopecia,"" in which follicles are damaged over time. If you feel scalp pain, avoid pulling your hair back into tight ponytails or other styles that pull the hair.;
, Ask your parents whether there's a history of hair loss in your family. The most common cause of hair loss in adults — male or female pattern baldness — is genetic. However, a combination of genetics and hormones can start this sort of hair loss in your mid-teen years.Recent studies show that genetic hair loss can be inherited from either parent in both boys and girls., Some amount of shedding — about 50 to 100 hairs per day — is completely normal. However, stress or traumatic events (accidents, surgery, illness) can cause excessive shedding.Normally, excessive shedding goes back to normal within six to nine months, but constant stress can cause it to progress to permanent hair loss., Teenagers often play with their hair absent-mindedly, twirling or tugging on it. In some cases, this may be a symptom of a disorder called ""trichotillomania,"" in which people pull out their hair when nervous or distracted.Though the behavior is usually unconscious, it leaves sufferers with bald patches.The disorder is often caused by stress. See a therapist or a hair and scalp specialist called a ""trichologist"" for proper diagnosis and treatment.

, There are many illnesses and conditions that could cause hair loss. Hormonal conditions like uncontrolled diabetes, thyroid disease, or polycystic ovary syndrome can interfere with hair production. Those with lupus can also experience hair loss.


Eating disorders like anorexia or bulimia can starve the body of essential proteins, vitamins, and minerals needed for hair growth. Some vegetarian teens also lose hair if they don’t get enough protein from non-meat sources.
Athletes are at a higher risk for hair loss because they’re more likely to develop iron-deficiency anemia. Anemia can then result in hair loss.
One cause of patchy hair loss, often with scaling and broken hairs, is ringworm of the scalp, called tinea capitis. It is not very common in teens, but it can occur. This is caused by a fungal infection and is treated with oral medications and special shampoos.

, One or more of these patches on your scalp may point to a skin disease called ""alopecia areata"" that causes hair loss. It's an autoimmune disorder in which your own immune system damages hair follicles.Luckily, it can be treated, and hair usually regrows within a year. Still, some sufferers lose their hair repeatedly or even permanently.If unchecked, alopecia areata can sometimes progress to full baldness or even complete loss of all body hair, though this is rare.See a dermatologist for a proper diagnosis, which may involve simple examination of hair under a microscope or may call for a skin biopsy.The condition is not contagious., Chemotherapy for cancer is a medical treatment particularly well-known for causing hair loss. However, many prescription drugs — including some used to treat acne, bipolar disorder, and ADHD — list hair loss as a side effect.Diet pills that contain amphetamines can also cause hair loss. Show your doctor a detailed list of all current medications, both prescription and over-the-counter, to see if they might be causing your problem.

This chemical can enlarge hair follicles and help to increase hair growth. It may take up to 4 months to see results, however, and you would have to use it twice a day indefinitely.


Minoxidil can irritate the scalp and cause itching, flaking and redness. If you have a sensitive scalp you may want to consider some other treatment for hair loss.
Once you stop using Minoxidil, your hair will probably begin to thin again.
Minoxidil has been shown to be effective in up to seven out of 10 men for re-growing hair and slowing hair loss.If you are a woman who is breastfeeding, you should not take minoxidil, as it may contaminate breastmilk.;
, Medication for male pattern baldness usually includes finasteride, which blocks an enzyme responsible for converting testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT contributes to thinning hair and pattern baldness by shrinking the hair follicles that grow hair. Finasteride is extremely effective for most men and some women at slowing hair loss, while also allowing you to regrow some of the hair you have lost.


Know that if you stop taking finasteride, your hair loss will likely continue.

, If you want greater results stopping hair loss, then combine treatments. You can use minoxidil externally and finasteride pills together. However, be aware that you have to continue the treatment indefinitely, which can get expensive and difficult to maintain over time.

, This is an ancient Ayurvedic hair loss herb. It is used in Ayurvedic medicine to slow hair loss and balding, regrow hair and help with premature graying. Topical application has been shown to reduce the time to regrow hair and to increase the number of hair follicles in the growth phase.You can purchase eclipta alba oils at a local market or online. You can also make your own by heating 50 grams of crushed or ground bhringraj plant in 200ml in oil, such as coconut oil, for 10 minutes. After the oil has cooled overnight, strain the oil.
Massage eclipta alba oil into your head and scalp at least once every day.

, This is an Indian herb that is highly nutritious and a good source of vitamin C, carotene and iron. It has been used since ancient times to help stop hair loss. You can use an alma rinse made from alma pieces soaked in water overnight. Regularly rinse with the alma water after you shampoo.You can also use dried amla pieces heated with coconut oil until the oil turns dark. After letting the oil cool, remove the amla pieces and massage the oil into your scalp daily.

, Aloe vera helps stimulate hair follicles and remove dead skin cells that can clog hair follicles. You can purchase aloe vera gel or juice from the store or use the gel from off of a plant. Make sure the store bought aloe does not contain extra chemicals.


To make an aloe vera hair mask, use half a cup of aloe vera gel with 2 TBS of castor oil and mix together. You can apply this to your scalp, cover your hair and leave it on for 8 hours. Repeat this as often as possible.To use an aloe vera leaf for gel, cut off a thick leaf at the base of the plant. Cut the leaf open and scrape off the gel inside. If you don’t use all of it, you can store the rest of the leaf in the refrigerator for use another day.

, This plant is traditionally used in Native American remedies. Some people also use yucca for baldness.The saponins in the root reduce inflammation and itching. Yucca can usually be purchased in health food stores.


Peel the yucca root and smash it before mixing it in with shampoo or directly onto the scalp. Rinse and repeat regularly. You can also use yucca extract or 1 TBS of root powder mixed with 2 cups of water as a shampoo., Massages increase blood flow to the scalp and bring nutrients to the hair follicles. This can help strengthen your hair and reduce hair loss. It can also help with stress relief. Get scalp massages 2-3 times a week to help treat hair loss.

, Stress can be a huge factor in hair loss. It can change the way that hair grows on your head and cause you to shed a large amount at one time. Try to relax and don’t let day-to-day events cause you to worry excessively.


Know that you can’t conquer hair loss overnight. It takes time to deal with the issues behind hair loss and start to regrow your hair. Don’t stress out over your hair loss.

, Meditation can help eliminate stress and keep you calm. It will promote emotional and physical well-being, including the health of your hair. Take a five minute break every day to close your eyes and focus on your breathing.


Inhale slowly through your nose, concentrating on the way your breath feels as it passes through your nostrils into your chest. Fill your belly with air so that it expands. Exhale through your nose and notice as your abdomen deflates. Repeat this until you feel calm and relaxed.

, Exercising helps keep your body healthy and increase blood circulation. It can also keep stress at bay. You can try walking, yoga, playing sports or swimming—anything that gets your heart pumping that you find enjoyable. Exercise also releases endorphins that make you feel good and decrease the stress that can cause hair loss.

, Hair dyes, sprays, heat, perms and relaxers, all contribute to hair breakage and loss. They can cause damage to your scalp and make your hair brittle and dry. Chemicals are never good to use when you are losing your hair and can even be the culprit, so stay away from them. ]


Condition your hair regularly. Warm oil treatments or olive oil left on overnight twice a week can improve the condition of your hair.

, Regular hair maintenance is important for keeping your hair healthy. Tangles can create breakage, so you will want to shampoo your hair regularly and brush it out every day. The scalp secretes oils when hair is brushed that keeps hair healthy. Though brushing can seem to cause some hair loss, it is usually the hair we are shedding naturally that comes out.


Brushing wet hair or aggressively towel drying your hair can damage it. Be gentle with your hair.
Some hairstyles like cornrows, tight braids or pony tails can cause hair loss. Don’t do your hair this way anymore if you notice that you are starting to lose more hair than normal.
Bad brushes can also contribute to breakage, so use a good quality brush with soft bristles or a wide-toothed comb.

, Some vitamin and nutrient deficiencies can cause hair loss. You will want to make sure you are eating lots of green, leafy vegetables, fruit, whole grains, omega 3 fatty acids and protein. You may want to take a whole foods-derived multivitamin to keep your skin and hair healthy.


Omega 3 fatty acids nourish hair follicles, keep hair more elastic to prevent breakage and promote hair growth. Eat flaxseeds, walnuts, salmon, sardines and soybeans. You can also take an omega 3 fatty acid supplement.
If you’re deficient in zinc, you can lose your hair. Zinc is essential for hair growth and repair, so be sure to include foods like oysters, crabs, lean meats, wheat germ, spinach, squash, sunflower seeds and nuts into your diet.
Include vitamins A and C in your diet. These vitamins help produce the oil secreted by hair follicles that keep hair strong. Eat carrots, sweet potatoes, spinach, collard greens, swiss chard, winter squash and lettuce for vitamin A. Vitamin C can be found in papaya, peppers, strawberries, pineapples, Brussel sprouts, oranges, kiwi, broccoli and kale.

, Sometimes you just have to wait for your hair to resume its normal cycle. This can take some time, though, usually months to years. Spend this time focusing on getting your body and mind healthy so that your hair will stay healthy too.


If you lose your hair after menopause or childbirth, it can take 6 months to 2 years to regain normal hair growth.
If you lost your hair due to an illness or high fever, then hair growth will usually go back to normal once the illness is under control or the fever has ended.
Hair loss can be caused by medication or radiation therapy and will likely grow back once you are finished with the medicine or therapy. You might also consider changing meds.

, A wig, hat or other type of hair replacement can be inexpensive, safe and help you maintain the appearance of a full head of hair. Changing your hair style can also disguise thinning hair. In some cases, your hair may grow back while you are wearing a wig, weave or hair piece and you won’t need it anymore.

, Hair transplants can be an expensive but effective means to solving a thinning hair problem. Right now the most common types of hair transplants are follicular unit strip surgery (FUSS) and follicular unit extraction (FUE). Technology is rapidly advancing, though, so new techniques may be available in the future.


The FUSS procedure involves a strip of hair from a donor region that is implanted and often sutured into the desired area. Several grafts can be transplanted for more moderate to severe hair loss.
With a FUE procedure, hair strands from the back and sides of the head are transplanted into the desired area in groups. FUE can provide very natural-looking growth and does not usually involve any major cutting so it has less recovery time than FUSS.
Keep in mind that you may require additional sessions if you are not happy with the results or lose more hair.

, For this procedure, the surgeon will remove a bald area of your scalp. The skin on your scalp is elastic and can be stretched to move areas of hair over the area that was removed.Headaches can occur after this procedure but can be treated with pain relievers.

, This procedure can stop hair loss and encourage more hair growth. A laser is passed over the scalp to stimulate it, encouraging blood and nutrients to reach the hair follicles. Some people have found laser hair restoration effective for hair loss.

Use hair products formulated for your hair type.,
Maintain a regular washing routine.,
Protect your hair from heat.,
Avoid pulling on your hair.Traction alopecia is caused by consistent pulling on hair strands over a period of time.,
Style your hair when it’s dry.,
Reduce your chemical exposure.",How to Stop Teen Hair Loss2," It can be overwhelming to confront the crowded shelves in the hair-care aisle at the store. But taking the time to read the labels and find shampoos and conditioners designed for your specific needs can pay off. For example, if you color your hair, use products designed for color-treated hair. If your hair is chemically treated or suffering from damage, consider a “2-in-1” shampoo.Some hair care professionals recommend using baby shampoo that's milder on hair.Regardless of cost, many shampoo and conditioner brands provide the same benefits. Don’t feel like you have to splurge to get a good product made for your hair type.


Be wary of products advertising hair loss prevention or hair regrowth, as there's not scientific evidence backing them up.Ask your hair stylist or dermatologist for advice on which hair products may be best for you.

, Wash your hair with a gentle shampoo and conditioner once a day or every other day, especially if you have oily hair. You may think that washing your hair every day might actually speed up hair loss, but that's not the case. Hair follicles can't function properly when they're blocked with dirt or oil.Regular washing will improve follicle health and halt excessive shedding that might lead to hair loss.


Focus on cleaning the scalp with shampoo rather than the strands of hair. Washing only your hair might make it dry it out, making it prone to breakage and shedding.Apply conditioner after every shampoo to rehydrate hair and improve hair strength. Unlike shampoo, you should avoid the scalp and concentrate on the tips of the hair.Conditioning the scalp can lead to blocked, unhealthy follicles.Avoid rubbing your hair too hard with a towel after a shower — it can break and damage hair.

, The heat from blow-dryers, curling irons, and straightening irons can damage hair, making it break and shed.Avoid all processes that might cause heat damage: let your hair air dry, and try out hairstyles that suit your natural hair texture.


You may have to style your hair with heat for special occasions. If you must heat-style, protect your hair with heat-protecting hair products., Avoid tight braids, pony tails, or other styles that put undue stress on your hair. When combing, curling, or straightening your hair, take care to prevent tugging. Use a thin comb to lightly pull apart any tangles.Also avoid teasing or backcombing your hair.

, Wet hair is more prone to stretching and breaking when it's pulled on. If you're going to braid it or twist your hair in any way, wait until it’s dry., Be careful if you regularly dye or otherwise treat your hair with chemicals. Chemical processes like straightening or perming can damage and weaken hair follicles, leading to breakage and hair loss.Prolonged exposure to the chemicals in pools can have a similar effect.Whenever possible, avoid chemical treatments for your hair.
Wear a swim cap when in the pool to protect your hair. Use hair products formulated for swimmers to replace lost moisture on your scalp and hair if you're a regular swimmer.

Maintain a balanced, healthy diet.,
Round out your diet with vitamin supplements.,
Address any stress triggers in your life.",How to Stop Teen Hair Loss3," The right diet will provide you with the vitamins and minerals needed for healthy hair. Unbalanced diets (sometimes seen in vegetarians or people with eating disorders) often result in hair loss.To prevent this, work the following into your diet:Iron and zinc: These minerals, found in lean red meat, soybeans, and lentils, help your hair follicles to grow.Protein: Meat, fish, beans, nuts, and yogurt promote cell growth and healing in your hair.Omega-3 fatty acids: Fatty fish like salmon improve hair’s strength and shine. Additional benefits include depression relief and improved heart health.
Biotin: This B vitamin, found in eggs, is important for healthy growth of all cells, including hair., Some vitamins, like vitamin D, help with hair growth but are tricky to get through eating. Vitamin D supplements (about 1,000 IU a day) can help improve your hair.Take B vitamins such as biotin, vitamin E, zinc, and magnesium supplements once a day to ensure you are consuming these vital vitamins and minerals.


Though there is no direct correlation between vitamin supplements and the prevention of hair loss, supplements will help maintain your current hair and body health.

, Hair loss can be connected to prolonged stress or highly traumatic events like accidents or surgeries. In such cases of ""telogen effluvium,"" you may lose 1/2 to 3/4 of your hair and see it come out in handfuls when you wash, comb, or run your hands through your hair.It's usually temporary and should return to normal in six to 9 months, but it can become chronic if you don't address your stress. Once stress has been managed, hair growth usually returns.Take up a stress-releasing activity like yoga, meditation, or running. Make room for things you enjoy in your daily routine, and focus on bringing calm and peace into your life.
If the stress feels unmanageable, talk to a therapist or counselor to help you release tension and recover from stress.

Take over-the-counter hair loss medication.,
Speak to a dermatologist if you display extreme symptoms.Rapid hair loss at a young age should be addressed immediately by a medical professional.,
Provide the dermatologist with accurate information.,
Ask for prescription medication to treat pattern baldness.A dermatologist will be able to prescribe finasteride (brand name Propecia).,
Speak to your doctor about changing medication if necessary.If your hair loss is a side effect of a medication you're taking for another condition — like acne or ADHD — your doctor may be able to change your treatment options.,
Look into corticosteroid to treat alopecia areata.",How to Stop Teen Hair Loss4," Over-the-counter medications like Rogaine work well with consistent use, but aim to stop hair loss, not regrow hair.However, regrowth can occur in some cases. You may see new hair growth that's shorter and thinner than your normal hair, but it will slow down if you stop taking the medication.Do not take Rogaine if you are or plan on becoming pregnant.

, Hair loss in an unusual pattern, like many patches or loss in just one area, can also be a sign of a serious problem. Pain, itching, redness, scaliness, or noticeable abnormality should all be reported, as should hair loss when accompanied by weight gain, muscle weakness, or getting cold or tired easily.


The dermatologist will review your medical history and do an exam of your hair and scalp to diagnose the cause of your hair loss.
She may also run other tests like a blood test to rule out disease; microscopic examination of a plucked hair; or a skin biopsy.

, During the examination, your dermatologist will ask a series of questions. Be prepared to provide the following information:Are you losing hair only from your scalp or from other parts of your body as well?
Do you notice a pattern to the hair loss, like a receding hairline or thinning on the crown, or is the hair loss throughout your head?
Do you dye your hair?
Do you blow dry your hair? If so, how often?
What kind of shampoo do you use on your hair? What other hair products, like gels or sprays, do you put on your hair?
Have you had a recent illness or high fever?
Have you been under unusual stress lately?
Do you have any nervous habits like hair pulling or scalp rubbing?
Do you take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs?

, It comes in pill form and should be taken daily. However, the purpose of this drug is to stop hair loss, not regrow hair.


Propecia is usually prescribed to men, as it can pose risks of birth defects if used in women who become pregnant.

,


Never simply stop taking your medication, as this could cause your underlying condition to worsen.
If you suffer from a condition like diabetes or thyroid disease, taking proper care of your disorder should reduce or prevent your hair loss.

, If your dermatologist diagnoses you with this autoimmune condition, talk to her about corticosteroids. These powerful anti-inflammatory drugs suppress your immune system and treat alopecia areata. Your dermatologist may administer corticosteroids in three ways:Local injections: injections of the steroids directly into the hairless patches. Side effects may include temporary pain and temporary depressions in your skin that usually refill on their own.
In pill form: Side effects of oral corticosteroids include hypertension, weight gain, and osteoporosis. Because of this, pills are rarely prescribed for alopecia, and only for short periods of time.
Topical ointment: Ointments or creams containing steroids can be rubbed directly on the hairless area. These are less traumatic than injections and are often prescribed for children and teens. However, steroid ointments and creams are less effective than injections. Your dermatologist may also prescribe other topical medications to apply to the affected area of your scalp.

Let the vinegar sit for around 20 minutes.Wrap a warm towel around your head to lessen the smell and keep the vinegar in place.,
Rinse your hair thoroughly.,
Repeat this vinegar treatment a few times a week.",How to Remove Dandruff Using Vinegar2," While you don't necessarily want to wash your hair before this vinegar treatment, you do need to be somewhere that can have a bit of vinegar dripping on it. You may also want to remove your clothes, so that they don't get covered in vinegar.

, While you can use undiluted apple cider vinegar, it can be hard on a sensitive scalp and can dry out your hair.Instead opt for a slightly diluted mixture, which will give you all the benefits of the vinegar but will be a little less harsh.

, Remember to keep your eyes closed, so the vinegar doesn't get in them!

, You don't want the vinegar to just get on your hair and not your scalp. Take the time to make sure it thoroughly coats your scalp.

, The warmth of the towel will also open your pores, letting the vinegar really get into the pores.

, Because of the strength of the vinegar, you will probably need to shampoo and condition to get the smell out. Be sure to use products that are easy, or even helpful, to your scalp, such as shampoo and conditioner that contains tea tree oil.

, Because the concentrated vinegar can be hard on your hair and your scalp, you don't want to do it every day. However, doing this treatment regularly will help to keep the bacteria that causes dandruff away.

Include more high-protein foods in your diet.,
Take care of the hair that you have.,
Reduce stress.,
Avoid wigs or hairpieces.",How to Stop Hair Loss Naturally2," Eating lean meats, fish, soy, or other proteins may help to curb hair loss. Besides containing protein, many foods rich in protein also contain Vitamin B-12.

, Never brush wet hair, and avoid rubbing your hair dry with a towel. Instead, let it air dry or else blow dry it to the point of dampness, and let it dry from there.

, Sometimes, the root cause for hair loss is stress.


Practice meditation. Meditation can help to both reduce stress and restore your hormonal balance. Practicing meditation can also help you in other aspects of your life.
Get some exercise. Walk, swim, or bike for 30 to 60 minutes per day. Or, try playing a sport like tennis, so you can take out your aggression by hitting a ball. The exercise will help to lower your stress levels.
Talk or write it out. Talk to your spouse, a friend, or family member, or to a therapist about what you are experiencing. Take the time to record your feelings in a journal.

, While these may seem like good cosmetic solutions, they may also speed up hair loss by damaging your hair follicles.

Treat with saw palmetto.,
Take vitamins.",How to Stop Hair Loss Naturally3," Native Americans use saw palmetto to promote healthy hair and skin. Saw palmetto also blocks the production of DHT (a metabolite of testosterone), a contributing factor to enlarging of the prostate. Because DHT production also causes hair loss. However, no authentic clinical reports support use of saw palmetto to be effective for preventing hair loss.

, Your mother told you they were good for you, but you may not know that they are good for your hair, too. Add some extra milligrams of these vitamins to your daily regimen:



Vitamin A: Vitamin A is an anti-oxidant, which promotes healthy production of sebum in the scalp. Sweet Potatoes are loaded with beta carotene - rich in Vit A not only promotes a healthy scalp but promotes hair growth.

Omega-3: Take Omega-3 fatty acids. Foods rich in Omega-3 are fatty fish, egg yolks, fish eggs (caviar) and milk.

Vitamin E: This vitamin stimulates circulation, and good blood circulation in the scalp is important in keeping your hair follicles productive.

B vitamins: The B vitamins help your body produce melanin, which gives hair its healthy color. Melanin also stimulates blood circulation."

Go to your doctor for a physical exam.,
Have the ankle-brachial index test done.,
Agree to imaging tests.,
Discuss the diagnosis.,
Take medicine.,
Make lifestyle changes.,
Consider getting a medical procedure.",How to Diagnose Peripheral Artery Disease," Many people will assume that pain in the legs is a normal part of aging. However, it is not normal and can be a sign that you have peripheral artery disease. Pay particular attention to pain and muscle cramping in the legs and hips while walking, exercising, or climbing stairs.Muscles in action need more blood flow than muscles at rest. This is why a person with PAD is more likely to have pain when moving, because the muscle can't get the added blood flow it needs.;
, Because blood flow to the limbs is limited, it will take injuries to the feet longer to heal if you have PAD. Pay attention to cuts or lacerations that won't heal or take a very long time to heal.In severe cases of PAD, the tissue on the feet can get gangrene or die due to lack of blood flow.

, In addition to the symptoms of PAD, you should also be aware of the potential risk factors that might increase the chance you have the disease. The risk factors for PAD include:Smoking
Age
Diabetes
High blood cholesterol
High blood pressure
Heart disease
Stroke

, If you are having pain or numbness in your legs or arms, you should get checked out by a doctor. Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and how long they have been going on for.Be sure to answer all of your doctor's questions honestly, even if they ask you about risk factors, such as smoking.

, This is a simple and non-invasive test that compares the blood pressure in your foot to the blood pressure in your arms. It is done with a simple device, should take only a few minutes, and may even be done as a part of your regular medical exam., If your doctor suspects you have peripheral artery disease due to the results of the ankle-brachial index test, they may want to do further testing. Your doctor may suggest an ultrasound, a CT scan, or a MRA scan, all of which are imaging tests. All of these tests are non-invasive and quick to perform.The doctor may also want to do an angiography. This is a more invasive test, in which a dye is injected into the artery and an X-ray is taken to show blood flow.

, Once your doctor does enough tests, they will come to you with a diagnosis. If the diagnosis for your symptoms is peripheral artery disease, then the doctor will want to discuss treatment.


If you have peripheral artery disease, your doctor should be able to give you a definitive diagnosis with proper testing and analysis of those tests.

, If you are diagnosed with peripheral artery disease it is likely that your doctor will prescribe medications to help control the condition. This is very important for your limb health, as well as limiting the risk of other diseases that can be associated with peripheral artery disease, such as stroke or heart attack.Medications that are commonly prescribed for people with peripheral artery disease include those that lower cholesterol and high blood pressure, and medications that will prevent blood clots., There are a variety of things that you can do to treat your peripheral artery disease and to improve your health. These include, most importantly, making dietary changes and exercising more often.If you can improve your diet by decreasing your fat and cholesterol intake, it will likely decrease your blood cholesterol and blood pressure. This, in turn, will decrease the likelihood of more plaque building up in your arteries.
Exercising can increase your circulation and decrease your blood pressure and cholesterol.

, In some serious cases of PAD a person may need to get a procedure or surgery to treat the condition. If medication and lifestyle changes don't work, your doctor may recommend that the arteries get cleaned out or stents get placed in your arteries, which will allow blood to flow freely through them.This procedure is done through a small incision and is considered a minimally-invasive procedure.


If the problem is very serious, your doctor may recommend surgery. The surgery used for peripheral artery disease will take a vein from elsewhere in the body and use it to bypass an artery that is severely blocked.

Consult a doctor.,
Discuss oral treatment solutions.,
Discuss topical treatment solutions.,
Discuss surgical treatments.,
Discuss laser combs.",How to Regrow Hair1," Reasons for hair loss in the first place can vary. The classic issue of male pattern baldness is due to a testosterone derivative called dihydrotestosterone and the effect it has on hair follicles.Baldness due to a condition called alopecia areata comes from the body’s own immune system attacking hair follicles.In order to treat any specific case and potentially regrow hair, a doctor will first need to determine the cause of the hair loss.


Your doctor will likely run a panel to test for any severe vitamin deficiencies that could be responsible as well. For instance, a severe zinc deficiencyor vitamin D deficiencycan lead to hair loss; however, you should still consult a doctor to determine the true cause of your hair loss before self-diagnosing and beginning an over-the-counter vitamin regimen.;
, Once your doctor has run a few tests to discover the source of your hair loss, the treatment option may be as simple as an over-the-counter or prescription pill that can stop the hair loss and in many cases regrow hair.


If you doctor suspects that the hair loss was due to a vitamin deficiency such as zinc, then a zinc supplement can often reverse the process and lead to regrowth of normal hair quantities.If your doctor determines that dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is to blame for the hair loss, then he or she may prescribe finasteride, which is known more commonly as Propecia or one of its generics.Finasteride is one of the most commonly prescribed medicines in cases of hair loss because it lowers DHT levels in a way that stops hair loss and often achieves a level of regrowth. Side effects of Propecia include depression, sexual dysfunction & prostate cancer.If your doctor determines that your hair loss is due to the autoimmune disease alopecia areata—which is only about 1% of the population—then recent findings have shown a class of drugs called JAK inhibitors are effective in regrowing hair.These drugs stop hair loss and promote hair regrowth by suppressing the body’s immune response to the afflicted hair follicles. The arthritis drug Ruxolitinib has shown some of the most-positive results., In addition to oral medications, your doctor may discuss topical medications. The most common topical suggestion is minoxidil (Rogaine and its generics).Minoxidil is another option for DHT-related hair loss, and it most commonly requires application to the scalp twice a day.When applied in early stages of hair loss, minoxidil can not only stop hair loss but often stimulate regrowth.One of the drawbacks to minoxidil is that it requires strict adherence to the application regimen. When a man stops taking minoxidil, he will lose the regrown hair as a consequence., Hair transplant technology has come a long way, and your doctor may discuss this option with you as a permanent solution that doesn’t require daily medication. Your doctor can test to find areas of the scalp that are not affected by DHT, and small sections of these hair follicles can be grafted to the affected area of the scalp.Despite offering a permanent solution, transplant surgery is the most expensive option, often requiring several procedures to build a full look over time.Hair transplants are also the most common method suggested for regrowing hair in those with bald patches due to burns or other injuries that damaged original hair follicles.

, Only the third nonsurgical hair loss method to receive FDA approval, laser combs are hand-held devices that stimulate hair follicles with low-level lasers.Laser combs are still in their infancy and many dermatologists are wary of their ability to permanently regrow hair since they don’t affect DHT levels; however, early trials did increase hair growth in many participants."

Avoid direct head-to-head contact.,
Don't share items that touch the head.,
Keep long hair tied up in a ponytail, braid, or bun.,
Use tea tree oil or lavender oil on your scalp.,
Regularly check for signs of head lice every week.",How to Prevent Head Lice1," The common theory as to why children are more susceptible to head lice than adults is that children are less likely to respect personal space. They may also be exposed to situations where head-to-head contact is unavoidable like class nap times or sitting close together side-by-side at their desks. It's as simple as two kids touching heads while leaning over a colouring book. Try to leave space between you and others in order to prevent the spreading of head lice.


Contrary to popular belief, head lice do not jump. They actually crawl very fast from one head to another on a strand of hair. While lice eggs are laid on the shaft of a hair with cement-like glue.
Ask children to try their best to avoid head-to-head contact. That might mean avoiding games or activities that need them to have head contact with each other.;
, Lice can also travel onto any items or surfaces that may have come into contact with the head. Hats, glasses, scarves, combs and hairbrushes, earbuds and headsets, and even chairs can be sites where can lice can jump from and to your own head.


Even within families, it's good practice for each family member to have their own hairbrush or comb.
In some situations such as school closets, clothes, hats, and scarves are often stored together out in the open. Avoid exposing these items by either keeping your belongings with you or storing them away in a bag or backpack.

, Long hair can sometimes reach beyond personal space since some hair can grow well past someone's shoulders or even fall off and get onto other people's space. Keeping hair tied prevents your hair from touching others.


Use hairspray to keep stray hairs in place.
Never share hair ties, barrettes or clips with others.

, This is a great way natural remedy to prevent head lice. These oils will act as repellents and keep head lice away. Use only a few drops on your scalp per day or dilute a few drops in a spray bottle and spritz it in your hair.


Tea tree oil can be quite drying so only use as directed on the label.
Tea tree oil can also be used to treat and remove head lice.

, Prevention also means being on the look out for possible head lice infestations. Caught early enough, you can disrupt the life cycle of lice, making treatment faster and easier. There are several ways to check for head lice which look like brownish-grey caramel sesame seeds and eggs which often look like brown coloured dots:


Lather your hair in conditioner and comb through your hair with a head lice removal comb. Every few passes, wipe the comb out on a paper towel and inspect for brownish-coloured dots or eggs or even actual bugs.Inspect your scalp, especially where hair shafts meet the scalp under direct sunlight or a bright lamp.
Get someone to check around your ear, nape of the neck and the crown of your head for any signs of lice.
Inspect your clothing for signs of lice.

Put on latex or nitrile gloves.,
Examine the entire cuff for stains or bodily fluids.,
Remove the tubing from the cuff.,
Soak cuffs.",How to Disinfect a Blood Pressure Cuff1," Gloves will protect you from blood and other bodily fluids that might have contaminated the equipment. If you do not have gloves, wash your hands for 20 seconds with warm water and soap. Hand washing is still the most effective way of preventing cross-contamination of harmful bacteria.;
, Ensure you thoroughly check the tubing as well. As you inspect the cuff, be careful not to touch any stain that you do see, especially if you are not wearing gloves. Although the cuff may not have visible stains, harmful bacteria can still linger on the cuff. , You can remove the tubing and inflation bag by undoing the velcro strap or unbuttoning the side pocket. If it does not appear as though the tubing can be removed, check the manufacturer’s guidelines and clean according to their specifications.


No water should enter the tubing or the inflated pump during cleaning. Be extremely careful as you handle it around water. The cuff itself can be completely soaked and washed, so long as you ensure that is completely dry before you reinsert the tubing.

, If you cannot disinfect the cuff immediately, place the cuff in a bucket with warm, soapy water. This will prevent any potential stains from settling on the cuff, and it will prevent contaminants from spreading in the meantime. Do not soak the tubing. Set it aside in a sterile bag until you are able to disinfect it.


This is generally appropriate for the end of the day of a personal cuff. In a clinic or hospital setting, when the cuff must be reused quickly, using with a disposable disinfecting wipe is appropriate. This takes only a few minutes (and is described later in this article).

Consult a doctor.,
Discuss oral treatment solutions.,
Discuss topical treatments.,
Discuss hair transplant options.,
Do not worry about refraining from typical hair care regimens.",How to Regrow Hair2," As with hair loss in men, the most important first step is to consult a doctor. The earlier a woman seeks care, the sooner a doctor can administer the proper treatment, which is more likely to yield positive results and regrowth.Your doctor will run a panel of tests to check everything from deficiencies to levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT).

, Deficiencies such as zinc, iron, or vitamin Dcan result in hair loss. After your doctor runs a panel of tests, he or she may recommend a stronger daily dose of deficient vitamins or minerals.


In cases where hormonal abnormalities are present—specifically the presence of excess male hormones known as androgens—medications such as spironolactone (which limits aldosterone production) or oral contraceptives may be the solution.In cases where the diagnosis is alopecia areata, early data shows that JAK inhibitors such as ruxolitinib can suppress the immune response causing the hair loss., A doctor may decide to prescribe minoxidil (Rogaine and its generics) for a woman with DHT-related hair loss. Whereas the minoxidil formulation for men is typically 5%, women are more commonly prescribed a 2% formula.For a women who really want to maximize the potential for hair regrowth, a doctor may still prescribe the stronger 5% solution; however, while very effective, this can lead to increased facial hair growth as a side effect.As with men, one of the major drawbacks of minoxidil for women is that the product requires strict adherence to its application. Regrown hair will quickly recede with discontinued use.

, Hair transplant surgeries relocate healthy hair follicles to affected areas of the scalp and are very effective methods of regrowing hair. Transplant options are best for women with traction alopecia (caused by long wear of tight braids or other things that pull the hair) or hair loss due to trauma such as scarring or burns.Unfortunately, most women with DHT-related hair loss see a general thinning across the entire scalp as opposed to male pattern baldness which typically affects very specific areas.This means that finding a donor site of unaffected follicles is more difficult; however, it isn’t impossible.As with men, transplant options for women are effective but quite expensive.

, If a doctor has diagnosed the problem as DHT-related hair loss, then you do not need to worry about altering daily hair care of styling options as nothing is structurally wrong with the hair—the issue is stemming from the hair follicles. You can continue to dye and style hair as normal."

Ensure belongings stay separate from each other.,
Store belongings in plastic bags.,
Clean your belongings when you get home.,
Educate others about head lice prevention.",How to Prevent Head Lice2," Whether you're a teacher at a school or working in an office with many others, it's important to keep your belongings separate from others. This decreases the likelihood head lice or any other pest or illness is spread through touching jackets, hats, or bags.


If you are a teacher or building a classroom, ensure that your classroom's cloakroom or closet allows for plenty of space between each student's belongings. This might mean spacing out clothes hooks or assigning individual cubbies or boxes for students to stow away their things.
Avoid hanging your jacket or storing your bag in a communal closet. Some places like restaurants, bars, and hotels offer you a coat check. Rather than checking your things, you could bring your things with you, or ask that your jacket be stored away from others.

, Things like hairbrushes, hats, scarves, and jackets could be placed in plastic bags when you go out in public, especially if you're sending your kids to school. This keeps the lice out and plastic bags are easy to throw away before going home.


To be extra cautious, you can throw in your belongings in the freezer after coming home. Head lice cannot survive in low temperatures., Use disinfectant or soap to kill germs and prevent lice from crawling into the home. Wipe down your bag or backpack and throw the clothes you wore outside into the washing machine.

, It's not only important to do your part in preventing head lice from invading your home and your family, but it's also important to educate others on how to prevent and treat head lice.


Urge your school or community to make head lice prevention and education available. It's as easy as making an announcement about what head lice is and how to prevent it or making flyers and directing others to resources or treatments that they can access.

Change and wash your bedding and clothes every week.,
Regularly wash or change combs, brushes, and hair ties.,
Vacuum around your house regularly.",How to Prevent Head Lice3," Wash your bed linens and clothes in hot water that is at least 140°F (60°C) and dry them with heat as well. Heat is effective in killing lice and any eggs dropped from your head.Take non-machine washables to the dry cleaner. If you suspect you have lice or have been exposed to lice, let your dry cleaner know so they can take the right precautionary measures when cleaning your garments.

, These items come into contact with your head on a daily basis. It's best to clean them once in a while or swap them for something new, especially hair ties.


Soak hairbrushes in diluted bleach or in close to boiling hot water for one hour. Be careful as some brushes may be made of plastic or materials that don't react well to bleach and heat.
Remove hair from hairbrushes regularly as well. This is also a good way to inspect to see if you can see any signs of lice or lice eggs.

, Headboards, couches, and chairs are hotspots for lice to spread. Be sure to use a vacuum that has a disposable vacuum bag that you can throw away, especially if you've been exposed to head lice.


Lice won't stay too long or survive apart from the host as they need blood supply to feed and live. There's no need to invest in a powerful vacuum cleaner or spend too much time cleaning in order to prevent lice."

Check to see if others in your area have lice.,
Wash all clothing worn in hot water.,
Apply lice medication.,
Allow the lice medication 8 to 12 hours to work.If you can still see lice moving around in your hair, do not retreat.,
Comb your hair.,
Check and comb your hair regularly.",How to Prevent Head Lice4," If you find out your child or student has lice, it's important to check to see if your family or other students have been infested. Let your family or classroom know about a possible lice infestation and urge them to get them checked.


If you find lice in your home, it's important to treat everything in your home to ensure the lice does not infest others in your family. Even the sheets and rooms of non-infested people must be cleaned.
If you're treating a child or student with lice, it's most likely you will have come in contact with lice as well. Get yourself checked for lice before, during, and after their treatments.

, Remove all clothing worn by you or whoever is infested with head lice and wash all garments in the hottest water setting possible.


If a garment can't be washed, isolate it in a garbage for several days to weeks to ensure all lice is dead. Since there is nothing the lice can feed on, the lice will eventually die.

, You can purchase over-the-counter or prescription lice medication at your local pharmacy which may sometimes be called pediculicide. Be careful to read and follow the instructions of the medication.


If you or whoever is infested with lice has long hair, you may need more than one bottle of medication.
Do not use shampoo or conditioner or wash your hair for 1 to 2 days after using lice medication.

, It can take a while for the medication to kill all the lice.


If you still see lice moving around after 12 hours, call your health care professional. They may recommend you do a second round of treatment or prescribe you a different lice medication.

, Most lice medications will come with a comb or you can purchase a comb specifically made for checking for lice. Since all the lice are dead and you aren't able to wash your hair for the next few days, it's important to comb out the dead lice and eggs from your hair.


Flea combs for pets are a great alternative to lice combs.

, Even if treatment was successful, it's important you comb your hair with a lice comb every 2 to 3 days after treatment to protect yourself from reinfestation.

Put several drops of liquid dish detergent onto a brush or sponge.,
Scrub both sides of the cuff, tubing and bulb completely.,
Rinse the cuff and tubing with running warm water.,
Spray both sides of the cuff with rubbing alcohol.You should spray the tubing and bulb as well.,
Allow the cuff and tubing to air-dry before use.",How to Disinfect a Blood Pressure Cuff2," An unused toothbrush works well for this. Run the soapy brush or sponge under warm water. If you are using a sponge, squeeze out the excess water. If you are in a pinch, you can use a clean rag or folded paper towel.

, Using the brush or sponge, wipe down the cuff and tubing, making sure that no water enters the tubing. If there are stains, use a scrub brush or a toothbrush to dislodge dirt. Make sure to vigorously scour the velcro in particular, as dirt and germs can linger within it. Cuffs are resilient; you do not have to be gentle as you clean. Aggressive scrubbing will guarantee a cleaner cuff.

, Be extremely careful that no water enters the tubing. You can plug the tube with a paper towel to ensure this. You can, however, rinse the cuff entirely. After rinsing, pat both the tubing and the cuff dry with a clean towel.

, The cuff should appear wet after spraying. Leave the alcohol or disinfectant to sit for ten minutes before patting dry to ensure that all bacteria are killed.


Alternately, you can mix 1 tsp. (5 ml) of bleach with 2 cups (473 ml) of water and pour it into the bottle. Shake the bottle and spray the mixture onto the cuff and tubing.

, The cuffs should hang on a clothesline or similar apparatus that suspends the cuff without it touching other materials. The outer and inner cuff as well as the velcro should be completely dry before re-use. Once dry, you can reinsert the tubing.

"
"
Determine if your cuff can be machine washed.,
Place the cuff in the washing machine and add a mild detergent.,
Set the machine to a gentle cycle with warm or cold water.,
Hang cuffs to dry.,
Disinfect with rubbing alcohol or a bleach solution.",How to Disinfect a Blood Pressure Cuff3," Consult the box or cuff to see if the manufacturer’s guidelines. Some hospitals have special machine washers for cuffs. At home, you may be able to wash yours in a laundry machine. Do not machine wash if the manufacturer advises against it.


Do not put the tubing the washing machine. The tubing and inflated pump must be hand washed. You can clean the tubing by rinsing in warm soapy water and spraying down with rubbing alcohol. It is important that no water enters the tubing, as it will render it unusable.

, Choose a gentle laundry soap that will remove stains and fluids during the cycle. You can wash multiple cuffs in the same load.

, Warm water is better for cloth cuffs while cold water should be used for vinyl. Select a high or medium water level for the load. The water will rinse away bacteria and stains more effectively without damaging the cuffs. Do not use hot water. Hot water may form a protective layer for bacteria and could damage the material.

, Air-dry the cuffs by hanging them on a clothesline. Make sure both the outer and inner cuff are completely dry before use. Do not place cuffs in the dryer. Make sure the cuff is completely dry before reinserting the tubing. You may need to dry it overnight.

, Before you use the cuffs again, wipe down the cuffs with rubbing alcohol or a bleach solution. Let them sit for between ten and twenty minutes before patting dry. This will kill any remaining bacteria that may have survived the washing process.

"
"
Use disinfecting wipes to clean the cuff.,
Consider disposable cuffs.,
Use a disposable sleeve to prevent contact with the patient's skin.",How to Disinfect a Blood Pressure Cuff4," Look into purchasing disposable wipes that are already treated with germicidal chemicals. This is a quick way to disinfect the cuff and its components without having to disassemble the entire apparatus. Look for EPA-approved products that have a contact time of one to three minutes, which means you only need to wait up to three minutes after disinfecting the cuff before safely using it again.This may be the most practical method of disinfecting a blood pressure cuff if you are in a hospital, clinic, or somewhere with a high volume of patients.

, Some hospitals have opted to try disposable cuffs, which are either thrown out after a single use or remain with each patient and are disposed of at the end of the patient's stay. Disposable cuffs can eliminate the need to disinfect equipment between patients. Not all hospitals will have the budget for these items., Using a disposable sleeve that slides on the patient's arm may help prevent the spread of bacteria, as this prevents the cuff from coming into contact with the patient's skin. Simply slide the single-use barrier onto the patient's limb, then fit the cuff around the sleeve and take the patient's vitals.

This is a less expensive option than disposable blood pressure cuffs and may be effective in preventing cross contamination.

Watch for shortness of breath.One of the main symptoms that mitral stenosis may present with is shortness of breath — in particular, waking in the night with breathing difficulties.The shortness of breath may get worse with exertion, and/or when lying down.,
Watch for any unusual fatigue.In addition to shortness of breath, mitral stenosis often presents with fatigue beyond your normal level.,
Look out for a cough and possible blood in your sputum.Mitral stenosis makes it more challenging for blood to pass from your left atrium into your left ventricle.,
Take note if you are feeling episodes of dizziness or fainting.Due to the reduced effectiveness of circulating blood and oxygen distribution to key areas of your body (such as your brain), you may begin to feel dizzy, lightheaded, or faint if you have mitral stenosis.,
Observe for swelling in your lower extremities.You may begin to notice swollen feet, ankles, and/or legs if you have mitral stenosis.,
Tell your doctor if you are experiencing heart ""palpitations"" (unusual heartbeats).Heart palpitations may feel like unusually forceful heartbeats, or you may have the sensation of your heart ""fluttering"" in your chest.,
Consider your risk factors.To diagnose mitral stenosis, your doctor will ask you about predisposing risk factors.,
Have your doctor listen for a heart murmur with a stethoscope.Mitral stenosis often presents with a heart murmur that can be heard when your doctor listens with his or her stethoscope.,
Get a chest x-ray.A chest x-ray is normally one of the first tests your doctor will order, if he or she suspects a lung and/or a heart problem, such as mitral stenosis.,
Consider an ECG (electrocardiogram).In the evaluation of heart or lung problems such as mitral stenosis, an ECG (sometimes accompanied by an exercise stress test) can be helpful.,
Receive an echocardiogram to definitively diagnose mitral stenosis.In order to confirm the diagnosis of mitral stenosis (or of any other form of valvular heart disease), an echocardiogram is needed.,
Be aware that treatment for mitral stenosis may not be needed immediately.In many cases of mitral stenosis, surgery is needed eventually but not immediately.,
Opt for medical treatment to reduce your symptoms.Although medications cannot treat or cure mitral stenosis directly, they can help to ease symptoms and to improve your overall heart and lung function.,
Consider valve repair or valve replacement surgery.The only definitive treatment for mitral stenosis is to have the valve surgically repaired or replaced.",How to Diagnose Mitral Stenosis," The shortness of breath is caused by decreased effectiveness of blood flow with each heartbeat, due to partial blockage of the mitral valve (called ""stenosis"").


Your shortness of breath may progressively get worse with time.
Your exercise tolerance may also decrease with time, as your condition worsens.;
, Again, this is due to less effective blood circulation, and thus reduced oxygen delivery to your tissues. Over time, the increased work that your heart must do to pump blood throughout your body can lead to progressively worsening fatigue.

, Therefore, the pressure in your left atrium builds up, and can cause a backup of blood in the lungs (because blood flows directly from the lungs into the left atrium).


As a result, mitral stenosis may cause fluid build-up in your lungs.
It can also cause a cough that may or may not be accompanied by coughing up small amounts of blood.

, If you feel this way, it is important to sit or lie down until you feel better, to avoid passing out while standing and injuring yourself. It is also important to tell your doctor as it may be a sign of mitral stenosis or another medical condition, and it merits proper medical investigation.

, This is a symptom of right heart failure, which may occur as a result of mitral stenosis. It occurs due to the backup of blood that cannot be effectively pumped through the heart.

, Either way, it feels like your heart is behaving abnormally. It is important to tell your doctor about this as it may be a sign of mitral stenosis, or of another heart condition that warrants medical attention and investigation.

, One of the major risk factors for mitral stenosis in developing countries is a history of rheumatic fever (which can damage and scar the mitral valve). This is less common in developed countries due to more effective modes of treatment that can prevent the development of rheumatic fever.


Other risk factors include calcium deposits around your mitral valve, chest radiation, certain medications, a family history of mitral stenosis, or having congenital birth defects involving the heart.

, Although this is not enough to diagnose mitral stenosis, it is suspicious of a heart problem and would be an indication for your doctor to order further investigative tests.

, A chest x-ray allows your doctor to examine your lungs for fluid build-up (called ""pulmonary edema"") which may go hand-in-hand with mitral stenosis. Your doctor can also evaluate for enlargement of any of the chambers of your heart, such as the right atrium, which may also be a sign of mitral stenosis.


A chest x-ray is also useful in ruling in or ruling out other heart or lung conditions that may present similarly to mitral stenosis.
It is for this reason that it is normally one of the first investigative tests that is ordered.

, An ECG is able to detect the amount of ""stress"" on the heart in various situations.

, The first type performed will normally be a TTE (transthoracic echocardiogram). In a TTE, the ultrasound probe is placed on the outside of your chest. It then projects a real-time, colored, moving image of the heart on a screen, where the doctor can look at the structure of your heart as well as the flow of blood with each heartbeat.


The color in the TTE can help indicate the flow of blood.
A TTE may be sufficient to observe and confirm the diagnosis of mitral stenosis.
If it is not, a TEE (transesophageal echocardiogram) may be ordered.
In a TEE, rather than the ultrasound probe being placed on the outside of your chest, it is inserted into your esophagus.
Your esophagus is much closer to your heart anatomically, so a TEE can provide a much more detailed view than a TTE, which can aid in the diagnosis of mitral stenosis.

, Most cases can be controlled in the interim with medications; however, most cases will eventually require surgery once the condition gets to be severe enough. Doctors call this approach ""watchful waiting.""


You are advised to receive regular echocardiograms to monitor your mitral stenosis, and to see if and when your condition progresses to the point of potentially needing surgery.
The frequency of your echocardiogram examinations will depend upon the severity of your mitral stenosis.

, Some medications that you and your doctor may wish to discuss include:


Blood thinning medications such as Warfarin (coumadin), plus or minus aspirin, to prevent blood clot formation and thus reduce your risk of a stroke.
Medications such as Beta-blockers (e.g. Metoprolol) to decrease your heart rate and thus allow the chambers of your heart to fill with blood more effectively.
A water pill (called a ""diuretic""), such as hydrochlorothiazide or furosemide, to decrease the swelling in your lower extremities.

, Your doctor can go over the pros and cons of each surgical option with you if and when it comes time for you to receive surgery — there are minimally invasive surgical options to consider for some patients."

Get a stopwatch or clock.,
Find your pulse.,
Begin counting the beats.",How to Determine Cardiac Output1," The heart rate is simply the number of heartloads of blood that are ejected from the heart per unit of time.Typically we measure heart rate by beats per minute. Measuring your heart rate is simple, but before attempting it, make sure you have an accurate device to count the seconds.

You can attempt to keep track of the the beats and seconds in your head, but this could be inaccurate because the beats you count tend to overpower one’s inner clock..
It is better to set a timer, so you can focus on counting the beats. Try using the timer on your cell phone.;
, Although there are many places on your body where you can find a pulse, the inner wrist is usually an easy place to find it. An alternative is on the side of your throat, on the jugular vein area. Once you have identified your pulse and have a clear beat, take the forefinger and middle finger of one hand and place them over the area where you can feel the pulse.Usually the pulse is strongest on the inside of the wrist, in a line drawn down from the index finger, within two inches past the first crease of the wrist.
You may need to move your fingers around a bit to find your heartbeat.
You may also need to apply a little pressure to feel it. However, if you have to press too hard, then this is probably not a good spot. Try a different spot instead.

, Once you find your heartbeat, start your stopwatch or look at your clock with the second hand, wait until the second hand reaches the 12, and begin counting the beats. Count the beats for one minute (until the second hand returns to the 12). The total number of beats per minute is your heart rate.

If you find it difficult to count your heartbeats for an entire minute, you can count for 30 seconds (until the second hand reaches the 6) and then multiply that number by two.
Or you can count for 15 seconds and multiply it by four.

Have an echocardiogram.,
Calculate the area of the left ventricle’s outflow tract (aka LVOT).,
Determine the velocity time integral.,
Assess stroke volume.,
Determining your cardiac output.",How to Determine Cardiac Output2," Whereas the heart rate is simply the number of times your heart beats in a minute, the stroke volume is the volume of blood pumped out by your heart's left ventricle with each beat. It is measured in millilitres and is much more complicated to determine that your heart rate. A special test called an echocardiogram (aka echo) is used to determine your heart’s stroke volume.

An echocardiogram uses radio waves to create a picture of your heart so the volume of blood passing through it can be measured.An echocardiogram makes it possible to make the measurements of the heart that are required to calculate stroke volume.
Using the echocardiogram, you will be able to determine the numbers needed for the following calculations.

, The left ventricle outflow tract is the portion of your heart through which blood passes to enter your arteries. In order to calculate the stroke volume you will need to determine the area the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT), and the velocity time integral of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT VTI).

These calculations need to be done by a professional reading an echocardiogram.An expert may use the following equation to determine the area of the left ventricle’s outflow tract:
Area = 3.14 (LVOT diameter/2)^2This way of calculating the area is now beginning to be superseded by more advanced imaging technology., The velocity time integral (VTI) is the integral of the velocities during the period of flow in a vessel or through a valve. In this instance it is used to determine the amount of the blood flowing through a ventricle.To determine the left ventricle’s VTI, your technician will measure the flow by doppler endocardiography. To do this the technician will use the tracing function on an endocardiography machine, which will then calculate the VTI.The VTI is derived by calculating the area beneath the curve on a Pulsed Wave Doppler trace of your aortic output. Your health care professional may take many measurements of your VTI over the course of your treatment to judge your heart's efficacy.

, To determine stroke volume, the amount of the blood in a ventricle (heart chamber) at the end of a beat (end-systolic volume, ESV) is subtracted from the amount of the blood in a ventricle just before a beat (end-diastolic volume, EDV). Stroke Volume = ESV – EDV. While stroke volume usually refers to the left ventricle, it can also refer to the right ventricle. The stroke volume of both ventricles is usually equal.

To determine your stroke volume index, take the velocity time integral, which is the amount of blood being pumped with each heartbeat and divide it by the body surface area of the left ventricle (in square meters).
This formula allows direct analysis of the stroke volume for a patient of any size., Finally, to determine your cardiac output, multiply your heart rate by your stroke volume. This is a relatively simple calculation which identifies the amount of blood your heart pumps in one minute. The formula is Heart Rate x Stroke Volume = Cardiac Output.For example, if your heart rate is 60 bpm and your stroke value is 70 ml, the equation looks like this:

60 bpm x 70 ml = 4200 ml/min or 4.2 liters (1.1 US gal) a minute."
"
Understand how heart rate functions.,
Learn about contractility.,
Investigate the importance of preload.,
Analyse afterload.",How to Determine Cardiac Output3," You can get a fuller understanding of cardiac output by learning about what influences it. The most straight forward of these is heart rate, the number of beats the heart makes in a minute. The more it beats the more blood is pumped all over the body. A normal heart should beat at 60-100 in a minute. When the heart rate is too slow, it is also called bradycardia, a condition in which the heart ejects too little blood in circulation.If your heart beats really fast it may cause tachycardia (a heart rate that exceeds the normal range) or, in severe cases, arrhythmia (problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat).
Although you may think that the faster the heart beats the more blood is circulated, in fact the heart ejects less blood with each stroke.

, If you are interested in the influences of physical fitness on cardiac output learn about contractility. Contractility is the ability of the muscle to contract. The heart is made up of muscles that contract in a certain pattern to eject blood. As the heart contracts, for example during exercise, this equates to increased cardiac output.The stronger the heart contracts, the more blood it draws into itself with each contraction, hence the more blood it circulates.This is what is affected when a piece of the heart muscle dies, and the heart is able to eject less blood during circulation.

, Preload refers to the stretch of the heart before shortening and impacts on cardiac output. According to Starling’s law, the force of contraction depends on the length to which the heart muscle is stretched. Therefore, the greater the preload the greater the force of contraction, which results in a greater amount of blood being pumped by the heart., The final key factor that influences cardiac output and is connected to the condition of the heart is known as afterload. Afterload is simply the amount of force that the heart needs to overcome to pump blood, which is highly dependent on the tone of the blood vessels and arterial blood pressure. A decrease in afterload can increase cardiac output especially in cases when the heart’s contractility is impaired, as often seen in heart problems.If heart muscle has been damaged, increasing the health of arteries and lowering blood pressure gives a net increase in cardiac output.

Recognize signs and symptoms that may accompany a POTS diagnosis.In addition to an elevated heart rate upon standing, people with POTS may experience a variety of others symptoms.,
Notice if you have had any recent triggers that may cause POTS.Oftentimes an infection (such as mononucleosis) can be a trigger for POTS.,
Be aware of who is at greater risk.People who are at an increased risk of developing POTS include women, people between the ages 12 and 50, and those who have been exposed to triggers (such as an infection, pregnancy, and/or stress).",How to Diagnose POTS1," These include:


Unusual fatigue
Headaches
Lightheadedness and/or fainting
Exercise intolerance, with or without chest pain and shortness of breath
Heart palpitations (meaning episodes of unusual heart rhythms)
Nausea and/or vomiting
Diminished concentration
Shaking and/or tremors
Problems with the nerves (the nervous system) that affect other areas of the body;
, Other common triggers include pregnancy and stress. With that said, POTS may also occur without an observable trigger. A number of studies have associated POTS with cardiovascular deconditioning., People taking multiple medications may also be at increased risk of noticing symptoms. This is because certain blood pressure medications and heart-related medications may exacerbate the signs and symptoms of POTS.

"
"
Bring a list of your current medications to your doctor.,
Have your doctor measure your heart rate sitting and standing.POTS is a form of ""autonomic dysregulation"" (a nervous system disorder) in which your heart rate spikes upon standing (among other symptoms).,
Have your blood pressure measured as well.After your doctor measures your heart rate and its variance when you are sitting versus standing, she will also want to measure your blood pressure.,
Know that the heart rate criteria are different for children and adolescents.Children and adolescents have naturally faster heart rates than adults; therefore, their heart rate must increase by at least 40 BPM (beats per minute) when they make the transition from sitting to standing, in order to be diagnosed with POTS.

,
Receive a ""tilt table test.,
Talk to your doctor about other tests.,
Be aware of the implications that POTS can have on your quality of life.",How to Diagnose POTS2," As you prepare for your visit with your physician, it is important to have a list of all your current medications on hand, including the names of the medications, the doses, and the reason you are taking each one. It is also important to have a list of your past medical history, including any surgeries or hospitalizations from your past, as well as any ongoing health concerns that you have suffered from. This information will help your doctor to understand your whole health history better, so that he can evaluate your risk of POTS and move forward with diagnostic testing.

, In order to diagnose POTS, your doctor will need to measure your heart rate when you are sitting at rest. You will then stand and, after one or two minutes, your doctor will measure your heart rate again. If your heart rate increases by 30 BPM (beats per minute) or more when you stand, this means that you have POTS.

, The reason for this is to rule out a condition called ""orthostatic hypotension"" (this is when your blood pressure drops significantly when you stand, leading to a compensatory elevated heart rate). Because your doctor does not want to diagnose you with POTS if you actually have orthostatic hypotension (that is, if your blood pressure is actually more of a problem than your heart rate), she will need to measure your blood pressure while sitting, then again after you stand up.


If you have POTS and not orthostatic hypotension, then your blood pressure should not drop significantly when you stand up versus when you are sitting.
Alternatively, if your resting heart rate is above 120 BPM when you stand, this is also in itself diagnostic of POTS.,,""Your doctor can diagnose you with POTS by simply measuring your heart rate sitting and standing; alternatively, he or she may perform what is called the ""tilt table test."" This is a much lengthier and more detailed exam. In total, it takes between 30-40 minutes to do the simple version, and up to 90 minutes to do the complex version.


The tilt table test is where you lie on a table that changes positions at set time intervals.As this occurs, you are attached to machines such as an ECG and blood pressure cuff to continuously monitor your vital signs, including heart rate and rhythm, and blood pressure.Your doctor can evaluate the series of results and use this to diagnose POTS or other heart-related conditions., There are many other tests that can be used to aid in the diagnosis of POTS.Your doctor may suggest a catecholamine test, a cold pressor test, EMG (electromyographic) testing, and sweat tests, among other things. POTS is a heterogeneous disorder, meaning that it can manifest in a variety of ways and have different underlying causes. As a result, the best set of diagnostic tests to confirm the details of your POTS diagnosis will depend upon your doctor's assessment of your particular case.

, Approximately 25% of people diagnosed with POTS have impaired quality of life similar to someone who is officially categorized as disabled. This includes not being able to work, as well as possible difficulty with day-to-day tasks such as bathing, eating, walking, or standing; however, while some people with POTS suffer from a reduced quality of life, others are able to live normally and you might not know they have a medical condition unless they told you.The prognosis for POTS is highly variable from case to case.
For POTS where the onset follows a viral infection (termed a ""post-viral episode""), approximately 50% of patients recover in two to five years time.If you have been diagnosed with POTS, your doctor can provide you with information that is specific to you in terms of prognosis, as well as working with you to develop a personalized treatment plan.Your prognosis will depend upon the subtype of POTS that you have, your overall health history, the underlying cause of your disorder, and the constellation of symptoms (as well as the symptom severity) that you are experiencing.
Non-pharmacological measures for the treatment of POTS include eliminating aggravating factors, addressing dehydration, and and increasing activity.
As far as medication goes, there have been no-long term studies on the efficacy of medications to treat POTS and all medication is used off label.

Get immediate, serious medical attention, if in doubt about possibly having symptoms of either mild or severe sepsis due to a possible infection (symptoms given below).,
Get expert evaluation and treatment of infection, with or without pain or throbbing pain.,
Observe symptoms of sepsis while the patient is at rest (resting rates) according doctors at the Mayo Clinic:Fever, high body temperature, greater than 101.3°F (38.5°C), possibly chills;

Or Low body temperature, less than 95°F (35°C), in a warm place, perhaps shivering;
Below normal blood pressure;
Pulse rate is rapid, higher than 90 per minute;
Respiratory rate higher than 20 breaths a minute (shallow/short breath);
Has a probable or confirmed infection.

,
Seek ""intensive care"", if you think you see a possible symptom of ""severe sepsis"": If a person already may have symptoms of mild sepsis and then shows any one of the following symptoms of severe sepsis, get expert medical treatment.,
Seek immediate treatment/hospitalization if several of those symptoms are observed: Severe cases often require antibiotics given in an intensive care unit for several days or weeks:Early treatment of worsening sepsis, usually with antibiotics and large amounts of intravenous fluids, in an intensive care unit at a hospital, greatly improves the chance for survival, before it causes blood clots, gangrene or one even develops septic shock.,
Diagnosing sepsis can be difficult because its observable signs and symptoms can be caused by other illnesses/disorders.,
Show caution; watch any inflammation or infection possibly becoming worse: the beginning symptoms of sepsis all depend on where an infection started, as seemingly minor as:


Scrapes on a knee, deep paper cut, puncture by a construction nail,
A tampon left in place longer than intended;
Stress causes/increases inflammation:

Poor diet, lack of sleep, over-work,
Smoking, anxiety, worry, belly fat,
Allergies, pollution and various chemicals;


Serious infections or illness including:

Pneumonia, lung infection causing sepsis,
Abdominal infections (sepsis, possibly with deadly peritonitus),
Kidney infection (sepsis and possible kidney failure),
Bloodstream infection, bacteremia (bacteria in your blood -- normally such a sterile environment -- always a very bad sign)...



,
Avoid or prevent infections:


Be immunized for illnesses, such as: Influenza and pneumonia.,
Keep unwashed hands (Avoid germs!),
Avoid sleeplessness, overexertion and fatigue, especially when ill or recovering from illness.,
Take care with the following risk factors.","How to Deal with Blood Poisoning, Sepsis (SIRS)"," If treated medically, very urgently people can more fully recover from the ""milder, beginning levels of sepsis"". Recovery becomes more and more difficult as minutes and hours pass... as any organs and limbs can be damaged beyond help by tiny blood clots and death of tissues., Infection may be unseen/internal, which can be/lead to a very serious danger, if it goes untreated. One may be mild sepsis but then can lead to severe complications including amputations, organ failure or septic shock and 50/50 and rapidly worse chance of death--not all likely, but something might develop! For example, drug resistant streptococcal bacterial infection can be a cause of great concern. Strep is very common and can cause SIRS, or it can seem to clear up after ""settling"" in certain organs, causing gradual damage and inflammatory conditions, and organ weaknesses can pop up later.


Early stage, ""mild sepsis"" treated with antibiotics, quickly, is more curable, compared to the mortality (death rate) for a related condition during more severe sepsis complications, called septic shock syndrome, in which death is near 50 percent (about 1/2).,, These are possible indications of severe sepsis, requiring immediate intensive medical care: if the patient exhibits ""at least one of the following signs and symptoms, it may indicate an organ(s) failing"":Abrupt, unexplained change in mental status: such as unusually confused, disoriented or dizzy (sudden difficulty speaking or behavior changes), and possible seizures;

Significantly decreased urine output (low kidney function), but this could be from extreme dehydration, such as from continual diarrhea and/or vomiting, very serious, also;

Abnormal heart pumping function/significant rhythm change;

Abdominal pain (possibly pancreas, kidneys or liver, etc. impaired or failing);

Difficult or labored breathing, unusual fatigue, light-headedness;

Lab: shows decreased platelet count. (Normally platelets are sent to sites of injury or infection, to signal and to control leukocytes and such in your inflammatory processes, but with severe sepsis they begin failing miserably!).,, Doctors often order a battery of tests to try to clearly show the underlying infection:Blood tests for evidence of: infection, clotting, abnormal liver or kidney function, impaired oxygen availability, electrolyte imbalances
Test other bodily fluids: Urine may be checked for signs of bacteria. Wound secretions can help show what type of antibiotic might work best. Respiratory secretions from coughing up mucus (sputum) may determine what type of germ is causing the infection.
Imaging scans are used as tests to help visualize internal problems including in soft tissue infections, such as in lungs, liver, pancreas, bowels, spine, etc.

,, An immune system weakened by such common illness are more open to sepsis, and they're avoidable.
Properly clean, possibly medicate and bandage up cuts, surgical wounds, or other wounds. Even, chickenpox blisters can become infected by bacteria.
Wash your hands regularly: And if you or your family member or friend is in the hospital, ask about all health providers washing their hands, and putting on new rubber gloves between patients.
Do not take antibiotics for common ailments of three day viruses or colds: Such improper antibiotic use may create drug-resistant bacteria that make sepsis more dangerous.


Drug-resistant bacteria. Many types of bacteria now can resist the effects of antibiotics that once killed them. These antibiotic-resistant bacteria are often the root cause of the infections that trigger sepsis.

, away from:


Cuts, sores, scratched places (avoid staph infections);
Face, mouth and eyes and other body orifices (avoid E. coli infections):

Wash hands, going in and coming out of the bathroom (water-closet), toilet, handling public door handles, etc.



, Get your seven or more hours of sleep. Extensive sleep loss/deprivation is detrimental to your immune system.

, Realize that Sepsis is more common and more dangerous with any of these risks:Are very young or very old -- which may have immune system weakness
Have a compromised immune system -- such as due to certain illness, drugs/medications
Are already very sick, often in a hospital's intensive care unit -- system is overtaxed
Have wounds or injuries, such as burns
Have invasive devices, such as intravenous catheters (drip or pump) or breathing tubes -- that may introduce infection and aggravate an inflammatory response.

You may experience it when you participate in a physical activity, or you may feel breathless when you are sitting around. You may also experience shortness of breath when you are sleeping, which may wake you up.This shortness of breath can impact your daily activities and exercise routines. You may even wake up feeling tired or restless because you are not getting a good night’s sleep.;
, Coughing can be a symptom of heart failure. You may find yourself coughing more than usual, or wheezing when you breathe. You may find that you are coughing up mucus that is white or pink tinged, but not green or yellow.This coughing is caused by fluid building up in the lungs. The lungs can't pump the blood fast enough, so as it slows returning to the heart, it runs into slow-moving blood, which causes it to back up into the lungs.

, Swelling is a sign of heart disease because swelling indicates a buildup of fluid in the body. You may see swelling in your lower body, like your feet, ankles, legs, and even abdomen. Because of this, your shoes, socks, or pants may fit more tightly.When you experience heart failure, the blood pumps slower, which causes a bit of a ""traffic jam"" effect as blood returns to the heart. When the blood returning to the heart can't get to the heart, it finds somewhere else to go, like your tissues. This causes swelling.
You may experience weight gain that is due to the swelling in your abdomen region.

, Fatigue or a feeling of being overly tired is another symptom of heart disease. You may feel tired no matter how many hours of sleep you get, and common everyday tasks wear you out. Your limbs or body may feel overly weak when you try to do things.This occurs because the heart has trouble pumping blood to the brain, so the rest of your body gets less blood pumped to it.

, You may notice that your appetite has changed. You may feel less hungry than usual or you may feel full all the time. You also may experience bouts of nausea or feeling sick to your stomach that affects your appetite.The appetite changes are caused by a lack of blood flow to your stomach and other digestive organs.

, If you are experiencing heart failure, you may experience irregular heartbeats or a rapid heartbeat. They may feel like heart palpitations, or like your heart is racing in your chest. This may cause chest pain, and be accompanied by fainting or a shortness of breath.Your heart beats faster as it tries to get blood to the rest of your body.

, If you are experiencing two or more of these symptoms, you may be experiencing heart failure. You should make an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible to get checked out. You should never rely on your own diagnosis, but go get checked out by a doctor immediately.The symptoms of heart failure are not very specific and may be symptoms of other conditions. Heart failure causes your heart to get worse if left untreated. This is why it’s important to be seen by a doctor as soon as possible.
If you experience any chest pain, fainting, weakness that impairs your functioning, severe shortness of breath, or pink, foamy mucus when you cough, you should contact emergency services.

, The first step in diagnosing heart failure is for your doctor to give you a physical exam. During this exam, the doctor will take your blood pressure and weigh you. They will check over your body, looking for signs of swelling in your legs and feet and around the abdomen.Your doctor will also use a stethoscope to listen to your heart, checking for anything that sounds abnormal. They will also check the sound of the lungs for any fluid.

, When you go to your appointment, your doctor will need certain information from you. You need to give them a list of your symptoms, including those that you may not believe are related to your heart failure. Be as detailed as possible.You will need to tell your doctor about any personal or family medical history that is pertinent. You should share any personal or family history of heart disease, heart failure, high blood pressure, stroke, or even diabetes. You may need to tell your doctor about recent life changes or major stresses.
Tell your doctor about all your medications, including vitamins and supplements you take.
Your doctor may want to know about your dietary or exercise habits.
Your doctor will ask you if you smoke, if you used to smoke, and about your alcohol consumption., If you think you are experiencing heart failure, you should ask your doctor questions about your symptoms, condition, and possible tests. You should ask your doctor if there are other conditions that may be causing your symptoms instead of heart failure or what else could be causing your symptoms.If your doctor believes you have heart failure, talk with them about the tests they will need to perform, when you will be able to get these tests, and if you will have to do anything special (like fast) before the tests.
Ask your doctor if you should avoid certain foods or make any dietary changes. You can also ask about what types of physical activities should be done or avoided.

, Blood tests are one of the tests used to determine if a person has heart failure. Blood tests will check various levels in your blood that can help your doctor figure out if you are having heart trouble, and if you are, how severe it is.Your doctor will check your sodium and potassium levels, along with kidney and thyroid function through the blood test. They will also check cholesterol levels. The blood test will also reveal if you have anemia.A B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) blood test may also be performed. Increased levels of BNP indicates heart failure, and the more BNP, the more severe the condition., There are multiple different kinds of tests your doctor may perform to check for heart function. These tests include chest x-rays, echocardiograms, and electrocardiograms (EKG/ECG).Your doctor may take x-rays to check the size of your heart and if there is any congestion or problem with the lungs.
In an EKG, you will have electrodes attached to your chest that sends information to the EKG machine. The electrodes will monitor your heart’s function by showing the rhythm and number of beats. This can let a doctor know if you’ve had a heart attack or if there are abnormalities with your heart.
Echocardiography uses sound waves to detect the structure and motion of the heart. For this procedure, you would receive a transthoracic echocardiogram, not a transesophageal echocardiogram. A device is moved over your chest while you remain motionless. The images it gathers can show the thickness of the heart and the way it pumps, as well as assess the function of the valves that may be contributing to the heart failure. An echo can also help your doctor figure out if the heart has poor blood flow or any damage to the muscle.A cardiac computerized tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be ordered. These tests gather images of your heart and chest., The doctor will put a catheter in a blood vessel in your arm or your leg so they can guide the catheter to your heart. The catheter can help your doctor see inside your heart and collect information about it. You doctor can collect blood samples from the heart and check blood flow.In one type of test, the catheter will put dye in your heart to take x-ray movies of the function of the different parts of the heart., Your doctor may decide to have you do a stress test. This test helps the doctor see how your heart does when you exert yourself. Generally, you will be asked to walk on a treadmill or ride a stationary bike. While you do this activity, you will be hooked up to an ECG machine. Sometimes, patients have to wear a mask to measure the way oxygen brought into the body and carbon dioxide released.This helps doctors figure out if you have heart failure and the way your body reacts to this heart failure. This can help your doctor decide on a treatment plan.

, In this test, you will receive a shot or an IV that sends radionuclides into your bloodstream (there is no negative impact from this). Then a computer will use the radionuclides' location to make a picture of your heart that will measure if the heart has been damaged, if the chambers of the heart are working correctly, and if the heart has enough blood pumping through it. It's the most accurate assessment for an ejection fraction, which is a way to measure heart failure."

Watch for symptoms that may be indicative of aortic regurgitation.Aortic regurgitation occurs when the heart valve leading from the left ventricle of your heart to the aorta becomes weakened.,
See your doctor if you believe you may be experiencing aortic regurgitation.If you are experiencing the signs and symptoms above, it is best to book an appointment with your family doctor sooner rather than later — or, in certain cases, seek emergency care.,
Have your doctor check your pulse.If you suspect that you may have aortic regurgitation, your doctor will look for what is called a ""bounding pulse."",
Measure your blood pressure.If you have aortic regurgitation, your systolic blood pressure will likely be normal but your diastolic blood pressure (the pressure when your heart relaxes) will likely be lower than normal.,
Have your doctor listen to your heart with a stethoscope.If you have aortic regurgitation, your doctor will likely be able to pick up a heart murmur when she listens to your heart with a stethoscope.,
Obtain an electrocardiogram.,
Receive an echocardiogram to evaluate your aortic valve.An echocardiogram is a type of ultrasound that specifically looks at your heart.,
Opt for an exercise stress test.An exercise stress test normally consists of going on a treadmill and gradually increasing the intensity (beginning at a slow walk and proceeding to a jog or a run) until you are too fatigued to continue, or until your heart begins to show signs of stress as per the measuring devices you will be hooked up to.,
Ask your doctor for a cardiac MRI.A cardiac MRI is another way for doctors to visualize your heart and to see abnormalities.,
Have a chest x-ray to evaluate for fluid in the lungs and/or an enlarged heart.Another test that can help in the diagnosis of aortic regurgitation is a chest x-ray.,
Obtain a referral for cardiac catheterization.If the above tests are inconclusive as to the degree of aortic regurgitation you are experiencing, your doctor may order a more invasive test called cardiac catheterization.,
Opt for ""watchful waiting"" and regular echocardiograms.If your aortic regurgitation is not too severe, your doctor or cardiologist may recommend that you do not opt for any procedures (such as surgery), but rather, that you continue to monitor your aortic valve over time and treat it surgically only if that becomes necessary.,
Take medications to prevent worsening of your symptoms.If your blood pressure is high, your doctor will recommend that you take blood pressure medications to lower it back into the normal range.,
Receive surgery to ""cure"" aortic regurgitation.The one and only definitive ""cure"" for aortic regurgitation is to have it treated surgically.",How to Diagnose Aortic Regurgitation," As a result, some of the blood that is pumped out of the heart flows back in after each heartbeat, due to incomplete closure of the aortic valve. Initially, you likely will not notice any signs or symptoms of aortic regurgitation. It is only once the condition progresses and gets more severe that symptoms become apparent. Some symptoms to be on the lookout for that may indicate aortic regurgitation include:


Fatigue, particularly unusual fatigue with exertion
Fainting or lightheadedness
Palpitations (feeling your heart beating)
In more severe cases: shortness of breath, chest pain, swelling of the feet and ankles. If you experience these symptoms, this is a medical emergency and you should seek immediate medical attention.;
, Your doctor will likely refer you to a cardiologist (a heart specialist) who can proceed with further diagnostic and investigative tests.


Note that sometimes aortic regurgitation presents with no signs or symptoms until you begin to experience the complication of congestive heart failure.
Signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure include: swelling of your ankles and feet, shortness of breath, fatigue, and occasionally chest pain.
Depending upon the severity of your congestive heart failure symptoms, either proceed straight to the Emergency Room (if you are experiencing severe shortness of breath or chest pain), or book an appointment in the next day or so with your family doctor to receive appropriate medical evaluation and treatment.

, A bounding pulse occurs when your systolic blood pressure (the force of blood against the artery walls when your heart contracts) is significantly higher than your diastolic blood pressure (the force of blood against the artery walls when your heart relaxes).


A bounding pulse is most easily detected at the carotid artery on the left side.

, Your doctor will measure your blood pressure in the office, and will check to see whether your diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number) is low.


If it is low, this may be a sign that you have aortic insufficiency, and your doctor will proceed with further tests and investigations.

, The heart murmur is due to the backflow of blood from your aorta (the blood vessel) back into your left ventricle (a chamber of your heart) due to weakness of the aortic valve.


It will be a ""diastolic murmur"" that your doctor is looking for, meaning that the hum of the murmur will be audible as your heart relaxes (and when the blood flows back into your heart due to aortic valve weakness).

, Your doctor will also order an electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) to check the rhythm of your heart, look for signs of decreased or lack of blood or oxygen in the heart, and exclude other causes of the symptoms.Electrical information will be transmitted through electrodes stuck to your skin. You may be required to stay still and/or to walk on a treadmill or pedal a stationary bike., It will be able to evaluate the size and function of your heart, as well as illustrating to your doctor the direction of blood flow in the heart and the function of each of the valves.


If your aortic valve is malfunctioning, the echocardiogram will show blood flowing backwards into the heart after each contraction.
An echocardiogram may be used to officially diagnose aortic regurgitation and provide an indication of the severity of the problem (mild, moderate, severe).
It may also be used as a tool to monitor aortic regurgitation (or other heart disorders), so that your doctor knows when further intervention or treatment is needed.

, The purpose of an exercise stress test is to watch how your heart responds under the stress of physical exertion, and to draw conclusions based upon that about your overall heart function.


If you have aortic regurgitation, your heart will be less capable than normal at responding to the stress of exertion.
You will likely fatigue sooner, and your heart will begin to show signs of stress due to the inability to pump enough blood fast enough (as a result of the backflow of blood into the heart due to a leaky valve).
By these measures, an exercise stress test can aid in the diagnosis of aortic regurgitation.

, Abnormalities that may be present in cases of aortic regurgitation include an enlarged left ventricle (the biggest chamber of the heart becomes enlarged due to the backflow of blood causing stress on the heart), as well as changes to the aortic valve and to the aorta (the big blood vessel leaving the heart).

, In more severe cases of aortic regurgitation, you may begin to develop an enlarged heart and/or fluid in the lungs due to the pressure of having too much blood in the heart at one time. These are complications of aortic regurgitation that can be picked up with a chest x-ray.

, In this test, a tube is inserted through an artery in your arm or leg and passed through that artery until it reaches the heart. Once it is at the heart, dye is injected. An x-ray machine is then used to visualize the motion of the dye and, in cases of aortic regurgitation, this can inform your doctor as to the degree and seriousness of your regurgitation, allowing your doctor to make the best treatment decisions for you moving forward.

, You will be advised to receive regular echocardiograms to check the status and function of your aortic valve, and it is important that you follow through with these appointments as a decline in function of your aortic valve may not be noticeable to you otherwise.


Your doctor may also advise caution with exertion, and avoiding strenuous activities so as not to put undue stress on your heart and your aortic valve.
You will likely be advised to continue with moderate physical activity due to the numerous health benefits that this offers.

, This is because elevated blood pressure is one of the major risk factors for worsening aortic regurgitation.


If you are experiencing symptoms of congestive heart failure as a result of your aortic regurgitation, you may receive ""ACE inhibitors"" and or ""diuretics"" (two classes of medications) to help with symptom relief and to get rid of excess fluid in your body.

, This can be done either with an aortic valve repair, or an aortic valve replacement (depending upon the extent of damage to the valve). Most often, for aortic regurgitation, a full aortic valve replacement will be required.For the surgery, you will be put under general anesthetic, which means that you will not be conscious for the operation.
You will receive open heart surgery and your aortic valve will be replaced with a new valve.
Recovery time following surgery usually involves one week in the hospital, followed by four to six weeks of rest at home prior to returning to work. You may need anticoagulation after the surgery to maintain valve function.

If you are unsure about whether the chest pain you are experiencing could be a heart attack, call emergency responders immediately. Symptoms of angina include:Pain in your chest
A squeezing feeling in your chest
Pain in your arms, neck, jaw, shoulder, or back
Nausea
Fatigue
Shortness of breath
Sweating
Dizziness or lightheadedness;
, Women’s symptoms during heart attacks often differ from those of men. They may not have chest pain; however, it is still a medical emergency. Women are more likely to have:Nausea
Difficulty breathing
Abdominal discomfort
Exhaustion
Pain in the neck, jaw, or back with or without chest pain
A stabbing pain instead of a squeezing feeling

, Unstable angina is often a sign of a heart attack. You may need immediate treatment to avert a heart attack. Signs of unstable angina include:Pain that is not alleviated by angina medication. If medication does not alleviate the angina within five minutes, call an ambulance.Pain that is more severe or different from your previous episodes
Pain that gets worse as it continues
Pain that occurs when you are at rest

, This is the most frequent type of angina. Your doctor may diagnose you with a stable angina if your angina:Is triggered by exercise, emotional stress, cold, smoking, or eating a heavy meal
Feels like gas or indigestion
Lasts five minutes or less
Is similar to other angina attacks you have had
Includes pain that radiates to your arms or back
Is alleviated by medication

, Determining whether you have these anginas may help your doctor to determine what the underlying cause of your angina is. Tell your doctor beforehand if you are pregnant, nursing, or think you could be pregnant, as this might affect your doctor's choices of which tests to give you.Variant angina or Prinzmetal’s angina occurs when your coronary artery spasms and constricts. This reduces blood flow to your heart causing the angina. It usually causes severe pain and may happen even when you are inactive. It can usually be helped by medications.
Microvascular angina is often an indication of coronary microvascular disease. It occurs when the small coronary arteries spasm and restrict blood flow to the heart. The pain is generally severe and does not go away quickly. You may also feel tired, have difficulty breathing, and have problems sleeping. It may be triggered by stress.

, Depending on your particular symptoms and medical history, your doctor may request one or more of the following tests:Electrocardiogram (ECG). In this test your doctor will attach metal electrodes to your arms, legs, and chest. The electrodes will be attached to a machine that will measure the electrical pulses of your heartbeat. This test is noninvasive and does not hurt.
A stress test. During this test, you will exercise on a treadmill or bike while connected to an ECG machine. This tells the doctor how much exercise your heart can handle before you have an angina episode. If your health condition makes you unable to exercise, you may be given a medication that will make your heart beat faster instead.
A nuclear stress test. This is similar to a stress test except that the doctor will also introduce a labeled substance into your bloodstream. This enables the doctor to then use a scanner to take pictures of your heart as you exercise. It can be used to determine what areas of your heart are not getting enough blood.
An echocardiogram. This test uses ultrasound waves to create an image of your heart. It can detect damaged areas. Your doctor may also do this during a stress test.
An x-ray. An x-ray produces an image of your heart and lungs. It allows the doctor to study the size and shape of your organs. It does not hurt. You may be asked to wear a lead apron to protect your reproductive organs.
Blood tests. Your doctor may want to take blood and test it to see if it contains enzymes that enter your bloodstream after your heart has been injured due to a heart attack.
Cardiac CT scan. This test involves using X-rays to take images of your heart. It enables the doctor to see if parts of your heart are enlarged or if you have narrowed arteries that might be reducing the blood flow to your heart. During this test, you would be on a table inside the scanner.
Coronary angiography. This test would involve the doctor using a cardiac catheter. This is a small tube that would be inserted into your body through a vein or artery in your groin, hand, or arm. The catheter would then be moved through the vein or artery to your heart. A dye would be put into the catheter which would enable the doctor to use x-rays to see where you might have blocked arteries.

, One commonly prescribed medication is nitroglycerin (glyceryl trinitrate). It causes your blood vessels to relax and widen. This increases the blood flow to your heart immediately and should relieve your pain within three minutes.This medication is taken to stop an angina episode or prevent it if you are about to do something that may trigger it, like exercise.
It may cause headaches, flushing, and dizziness. You should not drink alcohol with it. If it makes you dizzy you should not drive or operate machinery.
You can take it as a pill or a spray.

, There are many different possibilities for medications that your doctor may prescribe, depending on your symptoms and medical history. These medications are designed to prevent attacks over the long-term, rather than deal with an occurring or oncoming attack. Because some of these medications may interact with other prescription medicines, over-the-counter medications, herbal remedies, or supplements, it is important to tell your doctor about everything that you take. Possible medicines include:Beta-blockers. These medications make your heart beat slower, reducing the amount of blood and oxygen it requires. Side effects include fatigue, cold hands and feet, and diarrhea. These medications may interact with other medications, including over-the-counter medications.
Calcium channel blockers. These medications relax your arteries and increase the blood flow to your heart. Side effects include flushing, headaches, dizziness, exhaustion, and rashes, but they usually stop after a few days. Grapefruit juice can cause your blood pressure to drop, so you should never drink grapefruit juice while on these medications.
Long-acting nitrates. These medications relax your blood vessels and increase the blood flow to your heart. Side effects include headaches and flushing. These medications cannot be taken with sildenafil (Viagra) because they may lower your blood pressure too much.
Ivabradine. This medication slows your heartbeat. It is often given to people who cannot take beta-blockers. A side effect is that it may disturb your vision by causing you to see bright flashes. This can make driving at night dangerous.
Nicorandil. This medication widens your coronary arteries and increases blood flow to your heart. They are often prescribed for people who can’t take calcium channel blockers. Side effects include dizziness, headaches, and feeling unwell.
Ranolazine. This medication relaxes the heart without affecting the rhythm of your heart beat. It is often given to people with heart failure or arrhythmias. Side effects include constipation, dizziness, and weakness.

, People with angina are often at a high risk for a heart attack or stroke. If this is the case for you, your doctor may suggest the following medications:Statins. These medications prevent your body from making cholesterol. This can reduce your blood cholesterol, prevent additional blockages in your arteries, and reduce your risk of heart attacks and strokes. Side effects include constipation, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort.
Aspirin. Aspirin can prevent the platelets in your blood from sticking together and forming clots. This reduces your risk of heart attacks and strokes. Aspirin may not be suitable for people with stomach ulcers. Side effects include irritation to your digestive tract, indigestion, and feeling unwell.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. These medications lower your blood pressure. This means that your heart doesn’t have to work as hard. It can reduce the blood flow to your kidneys, so this medication may not be suitable for people with kidney problems. Side effects include dizziness, exhaustion, weakness, and coughing.

, If medication does not alleviate your symptoms, your doctor may recommend intervention or surgery in addition to medication. One of two procedures is generally used to treat angina:Coronary artery bypass graft. This procedure takes a piece of another blood vessel elsewhere in the body and uses it to route the blood around a blocked artery. This option is often the most likely to be recommended if you have diabetes, have the main artery blocked, or have blockages in at least three arteries. It is used for both stable and unstable anginas. Recovery usually takes two to three months.
Angioplasty and stenting. The doctor puts a balloon tipped catheter into the artery that is too narrow. The balloon is expanded at the narrow point to stretch the artery open. A stent, or wire mesh, is put in to hold the artery open. It is less invasive than bypass surgery because the catheter may be inserted through your groin, hand, or arm, making recovery easier. Recovery is usually two weeks or less; however, it has a higher likelihood of the artery becoming blocked again, relative to coronary artery bypass surgery.

, Saturated and trans fats are particularly bad for your heart. Keep your fat intake down to 3 servings per day. A serving is actually a very small amount, like a tablespoon of butter. You can reduce your fat intake by:Checking the labels on food to see what types of fat they contain. Limit yourself to 14 grams of saturated fat and 2 grams of trans fat each day. This will help prevent your arteries from clogging. Some packages may not say they have trans fats. If it says “partially hydrogenated,” those fats are likely to be trans fats.Healthier fat sources include: Olive, canola, vegetable, and nut oils, avocados, nuts, seeds, trans fat free margarine, cholesterol lowering margarines like Benecol, Promise Activ, and Smart Balance. Fat sources to avoid include: Butter, lard, bacon fat, gravy, cream sauces, nondairy creamers, hydrogenated margarine, hydrogenated shortening, cocoa butter, chocolate, coconut, palm, cottonseed, and palm kernel oils., Eating too much salt contributes to hypertension, or high blood pressure. You lower your salt intake by:Not adding table salt to your food. At first, you may miss the salt, but after a while, your body will readjust and you won’t crave the salt.
Avoid pre-packaged or canned foods that have salt added. This includes many snacks like chips, pretzels, and salted nuts. You can replace these snacks with an apple or carrot.

, Fruits and vegetables are low in fat and high in fiber and vitamins. A heart healthy diet should include 2 to 3 cups of fruit and 2 to 3 cups of vegetables each day.Fresh or frozen vegetables are generally healthier than canned items. In particular avoid canned vegetables that have salt added or fruits that have sugary syrups. Don’t eat vegetables that are fried, breaded, or have fatty cream sauces.
Many fruits and vegetables make simple, quick snacks. Try eating an apple, banana, cucumber, carrot or pepper when you get hungry between meals.

, Red meats like steaks and pork chops are often very fatty. Healthier alternatives are poultry and fish. You should eat no more than 6 ounces of meat per day.Trim off any fat you see and remove the skin.
Change your cooking techniques. Try baking or grilling instead of frying.

, Drinking too much can increase your risk for obesity and burden your heart. If you drink a lot, you may find that quitting causes you to lose weight. When you do drink, try to stick to these guidelines.Only one drink per day for women, and men over 65.
One to two drinks per day for men under 65.

, Smoking and chewing tobacco can damage your arteries making you more prone to angina, high blood pressure, heart attacks, and strokes. You can get help quitting by:Talking to your doctor or seeing a counselor
Joining support groups or calling hotlines
Using medications or nicotine replacement therapy

, However, if your doctor gives you the go ahead, it can help you to lower your blood pressure, reduce your cholesterol, and help keep your arteries clear.If exercise is an angina trigger for you, talk to your doctor before starting. Your doctor may recommend you take medications before exercising and keep the exercise mild enough that you don’t trigger an attack. Overtime you may find that you can increase the intensity of your workouts without having an episode.
You may want to start with mild, low-impact exercise like walking, swimming, or biking. Then as you start to get in shape, talk to your doctor about increasing your exercise program. Because angina can indicate a vulnerability to heart attacks, however, you should carefully discuss your plans with your doctor so that you don’t over stress your heart.

, The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in Britain recommends against using the following alternative therapies. These treatments have not been shown to be safe or effective for people with angina:Acupuncture
Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS). This technique uses small electrical pulses to stimulate the nerves and reduce pain.
Enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP). During this treatment you put inflatable cuffs around parts of your body like your legs. These cuffs are inflated in the rhythm of your heart beat with the goal of improving the blood flow.

Call an ambulance if you could be having a heart attack.,
Go to the doctor if you have symptoms of mitral valve prolapse.,
Let your doctor listen to your heart.,
Get additional tests if you doctor says it’s necessary.,
Ask your doctor if treatment is necessary.,
Avoid activities that may burden your mitral valve.,
Control your symptoms with medications.,
Have the mitral valve repaired.,
Replace a valve that is beyond repair.",How to Cope With Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP)," Heart attacks can produce similar symptoms to a mitral valve prolapse. Because untreated heart attacks can be fatal, you should call an ambulance at the first suspicion of a heart attack. Heart attack symptoms may include some or all of the following:Chest pain or pressure
Pain that radiates to your neck, jaw, or back
Nausea
Abdominal discomfort
Heartburn or indigestion
Feeling out of breath, rapid or shallow breathing
Sweating
Exhaustion
Lightheadedness or dizziness;
, If you have symptoms, they may be slight at first and increase slowly. If the prolapse causes blood to leak back into the atrium (a condition called mitral valve regurgitation), you are more likely to have symptoms. This can increase in the amount of blood in the left atrium, create more pressure in the pulmonary veins, and cause the heart to become enlarged. If your condition is severe, you may have:Chest pain
An arrhythmic heartbeat
A racing heartbeat
Difficulty breathing during exercise and when lying flat
Exhaustion

, The doctor will use a stethoscope to listen to how the blood flows through your heart. When diagnosing a mitral valve prolapse, your doctor will consider:Whether there is a clicking sound as the valve shuts. If so, this suggests that the valve is bulging or prolapsing.
Whether you have a heart murmur. If the valve is leaking, your doctor may hear a whooshing sound as the blood goes backwards into the atrium.
Your medical history. If you or someone in your family has another condition that is associated with a mitral valve prolapse, you may be prone to it as well. These conditions include: Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Ebstein’s anomaly, muscular dystrophy, Graves’ disease, and scoliosis.

, Your doctor may need additional information to diagnose you. There are several tests that he or she may do to measure and take images of your heart. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, nursing, or think you could be pregnant because that may influence which tests the doctor does.Echocardiogram. This exam uses sound waves to create a picture of your heart. The doctor can see if your heart is enlarged and examine the mitral valve. This test is likely to be done by putting a transducer through your mouth and into your esophagus. The esophagus is right near your heart so your doctor will be able to get high quality images. The doctor may also measure the blood flow and determine if you have leakage with a Doppler ultrasound at the same time.
An electrocardiogram (ECG). This test measures the intensity and pacing of the electrical signals that control your heartbeat. The doctor will put electrodes on your skin. It is noninvasive and will not hurt.
Stress test. If you do a stress test you will exercise on a treadmill or bike during an ECG. This lets your doctor examine how your heart performs under stress. If you cannot exercise, your doctor may give you a medication to make your heart beat faster, simulating exercise. If you have leakage through the mitral valve that makes it hard for you to be physically active, this test will show that.
A chest X-ray. X-rays can show the doctor the size and shape of your heart. It is particularly useful in identifying areas that might be enlarged. You will not feel the X-rays, but you may need to wear a heavy lead apron to protect your reproductive organs during this procedure.
Coronary angiogram and cardiac catheterization. The doctor puts a small catheter into a vein or artery, usually in your groin, and then moves the catheter through your body to your heart. The doctor then introduces dye into the blood vessels of your heart so they will show up on an X-ray. This test can be used to determine how much blood is leaking through the mitral valve.

, Your doctor may not recommend treatment if you have no leakage through the mitral valve and no symptoms.If you have some leakage but no symptoms, your doctor may suggest monitoring your condition rather than using medications or surgery to treat it. If you chose this course of action, be sure to attend follow up appointments as advised by your doctor.

, Most of the time dietary or exercise changes aren’t necessary. However, if the leakage through your mitral valve is significant, your doctor may recommend that you avoid activities that increase the blood pressure on the mitral valve. If the valve is weak, you may be at an increased risk of a rupture.Your doctor may suggest that you avoid weight lifting with heavy weights.
Your doctor will probably have no objection to other activities such as running, biking and swimming.

, Which medications your doctor recommends will depend on what symptoms you have, the severity, and your medical history. Medications will not prevent the prolapsed from happening, but they may reduce chest pain or stabilize a heart arrhythmia. Possible medications include:Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. These are common high blood pressure medications for mild mitral valve regurgitation.Anticoagulants such as aspirin, warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven), dabigatran (Pradaxa). Blood clots can cause strokes and heart attacks. The doctor is particularly likely to prescribe them if you have previously had either of these conditions.
Diuretics. These medications can reduce the burden on the mitral valve by lowering your blood pressure.They will also help to remove fluid that may be building up in your lungs.Beta blockers. Beta blockers reduce the rate at which your heartbeats and lower the amount of force with which it beats. This reduces your blood pressure, decreases the strain on your mitral valve, and can help inhibit irregular heartbeats.
Medications to control your heartbeat. If you have an irregular heartbeat, your doctor may recommend flecainide (Tambocor), procainamide (Procanbid), sotalol (Betapace), or amiodarone (Cordarone, Pacerone).

, This procedure enables you to keep your valve instead of replacing it. Be sure to go to someone who is experienced and specializes in mitral valve repair. Depending upon the cause of your prolapse and / or leakage the doctor may do several things:Annuloplasty. If you have structural problems with the tissue around the valve, it can be reinforced by implanting a ring around the valve or tightening the tissue.
Valvuloplasty. This involves doing surgery on the tissues of the valve. It might involve making the flaps, or leaflets, that close smaller so they close snugly. It could also involve modifying the attachments of the flaps.

, This would be done if it isn’t possible to repair the valve you have. There are two options for replacing your valve and each have pros and cons:A bioprosthesis. This is a tissue valve, usually made of a valve from a cow or pig. The major advantage is that it does not require you to take anticoagulants for the rest of your life. However, the disadvantage is that it may wear out and have to be replaced.
A mechanical valve. Mechanical valves have the advantage that they last longer. The disadvantage is that blood clots may form on the valve and then get dislodged. This means that people with mechanical valves have to take anticoagulants for the rest of their lives to reduce their risk of strokes.

See a doctor immediately if you take a blood thinner.,
Consider any underlying conditions such as osteoarthritis.,
Identify a possible autoimmune disease like rheumatoid arthritis.,
Determine if joint redness is due to infection.",How to Determine the Cause of Joint Redness1," If you have experienced a joint injury, you may experience swelling and redness in the area. Treat a local injury with rest, ice, elevation, and compression. If you observe redness at a recently injured joint, you can likely easily manage the issue at home. Treat redness, swelling, and pain associated with minor injuries using the RICE method: rest the joint, ice the area, apply compression by wrapping it, and keep the affected area elevated above heart level.See a doctor if you experience severe pain, can’t move the joint at all, or can’t bear any weight on an ankle or knee joint.
A fracture may also cause swelling and redness around local joints.;
, Joint redness after a more serious local injury, such as a fracture or torn ligament, can indicate hemarthrosis, or bleeding in the joint spaces. Other symptoms include swelling, warmth, stiffness, and bruising. You should see a doctor if you experience redness accompanied by severe swelling, especially if you take a blood thinner.Blood thinners, like warfarin, make it more difficult for your body to stop bleeding after an injury.

, Redness affecting one or more joints can be associated with a number of underlying conditions, such as osteoarthritis, diabetes, or a systemic inflammatory disease.If you can rule out an acute injury, consult a medical professional and discuss your preexisting conditions.

Osteoarthritis incidence increases with age and can present in those individuals who are active but have experienced injury in the past. It also can develop from normal wear and tear as person ages. In osteoarthritis, pain is worse with activity and improves with rest. Osteoarthritis can be managed long-term but occasional joint flare-ups are common.
They can also offer a variety of tests to accurately diagnose the cause of joint redness and refer you to a specialist., Autoimmune diseases can also cause joint redness. For example, one in five psoriasis patients experience psoriatic arthritis, which results when the immune system attacks joint tissue. Pain usually accompanies redness and swelling, and one or multiple joints can be affected.Other autoimmune disorders include lupus and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which can cause symptoms in one or multiple joints.Gout is also common among those with RA, and can cause further swelling in the joints., Viral and bacterial infections can cause septic arthritis, which requires prompt medical treatment. Sudden, severe pain and fever typically accompany redness and swelling. Usually, only one joint is affected."

Understand that some people will not experience symptoms.,
Monitor any chest pain you experience.,
Recognize shortness of breath as it occurs.,
Look out for a feeling like your heart is skipping a beat.,
Take note of any fainting spells you have had.,
Look for signs of embolization.,
Look for general symptoms associated with cancer.,
Talk to your doctor about heart cancer if you have a stroke.",How to Detect a Cancer in Your Heart1," A person suffering from heart carcinoma (heart cancer), may not actually have any symptoms.If you think you may have heart cancer, talk to your doctor. However, some common symptoms that have occurred because of heart cancer are listed in the following steps.


Keep in mind that the following symptoms could also be symptoms of different medical conditions, so if you experience several of these symptoms, contact your doctor and set up some tests (these tests will be covered in the next section).;
, If you have heart cancer, you may experience strong pain in your chest. When a cancerous tumor grows, it can cause water to accumulate in the area, especially if the tumor is located in the pericardia (which in the membrane that is situated around the heart). This accumulated water can affect how efficiently the heart pumps blood, which in turn can cause pain.


This pain should appear in the center of your chest, but can also be experienced in other parts of your body. You may find that the pain is relieved when you sit up.If you are experiencing strong chest pain, go to the emergency room right away, as the pain may be caused by a different medical condition, like a heart attack.

, You may begin to feel short of breath if you have heart cancer because the cancer cells can affect the way that circulation occurs in your body.This can limit the amount of oxygen you can bring into your body.


This shortness of breath may feel like you can’t catch your breath, even when exerting only a minimal effort or simply lying down. It may also lead to intense fatigue when doing physical activities.

, If you suddenly feel like your heart has gone out of sync, or that it has skipped a beat, and you’ve never felt this way before, this could be a sign of cancer. If you notice this symptom occurring frequently, contact your doctor.


Some people describe this sensation as their heart seeming to jump out of their chests.

, If you have suddenly started fainting and have never been prone to fainting before, you should take note. If these fainting spells are caused by cancer, they may be caused by part of the cancerous tumor blocking your circulation. When you stand up, your body may realize it does not have enough oxygen, causing you to faint.

, Embolization is when a part of the tumor breaks off from the rest of the tumor and travels to your brain, limbs, liver, or kidney, which causes different symptoms. Some of the symptoms of embolization include:


Limb weakness or spasticity.
An inability to feel sensations such as vibrations.
Limb pain.
Challenges or inability to walk.
Pain in the liver or kidney.

, These symptoms are not specific to heart cancer, but may occur as they would in someone who has a different kind of cancer. If you do have these symptoms, they will most likely go away when the cancerous tumor is removed. These signs include:


Unexplainable weight loss.
Fever.
Cold and painful fingers and toes.
Anemia.
Sweating heavily at night.

, A stroke is caused by the blockage of an artery that sends blood to your brain. A cancerous tumor could block an artery leading to your brain, in turn leading to a stroke.


If you have a stroke, make sure to talk to your doctor about checking for heart cancer.

Determine how many joints are affected.,
Consider your age and how you use the affected joint or joints.,
Determine how suddenly the symptoms appeared.,
See a doctor promptly if you have a fever or chills.",How to Determine the Cause of Joint Redness2," Identifying where you observe redness can help you determine the most likely cause. Some forms of arthritis more commonly affect multiple joints, while others often start in one joint.

For example, while it can affect any joint, gout usually develops first in the big toe. Redness, swelling, and sudden, severe pain are symptoms of this form of arthritis, which is caused by the buildup of uric acid crystals.Symmetrical redness, with or without pain, swelling, or stiffness, is most often seen in RA. Symmetrical means that symptoms affect both sides of the body, like experiencing redness and pain in both wrists., Osteoarthritis (OA) is usually due to wear or tear over time, injury, or both. It most commonly affects the lower back, hips, knees, and feet, and usually involves joint stiffness.If you experience redness and stiffness in a joint you’ve recently injured or have used a lot over time, you might be experiencing OA. Symptoms are usually intermittent, or on and off, and occur gradually or after using the joint.
Other forms of arthritis are not directly related to joint use or injury and can occur spontaneously at any age., Symptoms of different joint conditions develop at various rates. Sudden redness and pain that’s so severe the joint cannot be moved are more often associated with gout or infection-related septic arthritis.Redness, warmth, or stiffness in the morning that lasts at least 30 minutes but goes away with activity may indicate RA.Redness and stiffness that occur after using the joint or in the morning for less than 30 minutes and gets worse with activity are usually associated with OA., Redness and pain in one joint accompanied by fever are symptoms of infection-related septic arthritis. Though less common, chills can often accompany fever. You should visit a doctor promptly if you develop these symptoms, as delay could result in permanent joint damage or allow the infection to spread to other parts of your body.Treatment will depend on the results of blood and joint fluid cultures. Septic arthritis is typically due to bacterial infections, such as staphylococcus, which are treated with antibiotics.

Keep track of your symptoms.,
See your primary care doctor.,
Get a referral to a specialist.,
Get an x-ray, ultrasound, or MRI.,
Get a joint aspiration and culture.,
Discuss how to manage RA or OA.,
Treat or manage other causes of joint inflammation.,
Contact your insurer to avoid surprise medical costs.",How to Determine the Cause of Joint Redness3," Understanding your medical history and how and when your symptoms occur will help your doctor or rheumatologist make an accurate diagnosis. Note when you first observed joint redness, any other accompanying symptoms, and whether symptoms are constant or intermittent.Note what makes your symptoms better and what makes them worse.
You should also report any medications, such as anti-inflammatories, that you take to manage your symptoms. Let your doctor know how effectively any medications relieve your symptoms.

, It's best to make an appointment with your doctor if you experience persistent redness with or without pain, stiffness, or other symptoms. While there are ways to distinguish various joint conditions, only medical tests can make an accurate diagnosis.You’ll need to see a doctor promptly if you suspect septic arthritis or if you take a blood thinner.

, Most primary care doctors don’t have the specialized knowledge and experience required to diagnose arthritic conditions with certainty. Since various joint issues have overlapping symptoms, it’s best to have your primary doctor offer an initial examination and, if appropriate, a culture. They should then refer you to a rheumatologist, especially if the issue isn’t related to an infection or local injury., You’ll first report your symptoms to your doctor or specialist, then they’ll perform a physical examination and test the joint’s range of motion. Depending on their findings, they’ll likely order imaging techniques, such as an x-ray, ultrasound, or MRI.Imaging techniques will help distinguish between forms of joint inflammation. For example, an ultrasound can detect gout-related urate crystals in a joint., Joint aspiration involves drawing fluid from a joint for examination and culture. It’s useful for distinguishing between cases of gout and septic arthritis, so your doctor or specialist might order the procedure if they suspect either of these conditions.Blood and joint fluid cultures can identify a bacterial or fungal infection that’s caused septic arthritis.
Examining joint fluid for urate crystals can diagnose gout.

, Your diagnosis will determine the best treatment or management options. The best ways to manage many cases of OA and RA are rest, eating a calcium-rich diet, applying heat or cold in 20 minute intervals, and taking over the counter anti-inflammatories.At first, you should try applying both heat and ice packs at different times. See which works better for you, then stick to whichever provides relief.
Wrapping the area might also reduce redness and inflammation.
Your doctor or specialist might suggest corticosteroids and topical pain relievers. In cases of severe joint damage or deterioration, they might recommend joint replacement., Anti-inflammatories and pain relievers are used to manage gout. Additionally, medications that improve uric acid removal can help prevent gout flare-ups.Antibiotics are used to treat infection-related septic arthritis.In addition to corticosteroids and anti-inflammatories, specialized medications are used to manage psoriatic arthritis., Call your insurer before undergoing lab tests or imaging techniques to make sure all procedures are covered. Ask them if your rheumatologist is in-network, or ask them to refer one in your network, in order to ensure specialist care is covered.

Ask your insurer, “My doctor has recommended a joint aspiration and x-ray. Does my plan cover these procedures? Do I need prior approval from my insurer in order for these procedures to be covered?”

Get blood work done.,
Get a chest x-ray.,
Have your heart rate tested with an electrocardiogram.,
Schedule an echo-cardiogram.,
Talk to your doctor about getting an MRI or a CAT scan.,
Set up an appointment with a cardiac surgeon if you are diagnosed with a myxoma.",How to Detect a Cancer in Your Heart2," If you have some, or more than half of the symptoms listed in the previous section, you should get blood work done. Assessing your blood in a lab can help your doctor determine what is causing your symptoms, and may confirm or rule out a diagnosis of cancer., Chest x-rays help to examine your heart and will give your doctor a clear picture of any abnormalities you may have, particularly cancerous growths. Talk to your doctor about setting up an x-ray and what preparation you may have to do.


You will have to remove all jewelry, including piercings, before you have your x-ray done.

, An electrocardiogram is a device that is attached to your body and draws up a visual representation of your heart rate. Small electrodes are attached to your chest, which pick up your heart’s electric pulses, and then print them out on a piece of paper.


When this paper is printed up, your doctor uses this visual aid to determine if you have an irregular heartbeat.

, An echo-cardiogram is a device that allows you to see your heart on a monitor, and determine how it is functioning. The device uses ultrasound waves to create a picture of your heart.Your doctor will look at your heart’s movement, and can tell you if there is anything strange occurring.


This device can also allow you to hear your heartbeat while watching your heart pump blood.

, Both CAT scans and MRIs can help your doctor to look at your heart and locate any growths that have formed, if any have done so.


These scans are intensive and are generally reserved for cases in which the other tests have failed to locate any abnormalities, but the symptoms persist.

, Surgical treatment is the only way to remove a cancerous tumor from your heart. Luckily, once the tumor is removed, it is very rare that it forms again.

Your body treats it the way you treat your body.,
Maintain a healthy weight.,
Maintain a regular exercise routine.,
Do not over exercise.,
Avoid repetitive movements as often as possible.,
Eat a healthy diet and drink plenty of water.",How to Decrease Chances of Arthritis," Thinking ahead to the years when your body starts aging and care of itself with that in mind sometimes you can help prevent arthritis pain later in life - or at least help you prevent arthritis for a long time.;
, Excess weight causes the premature wear of the weight-bearing joints, including the feet, ankles, hips, knees and spine.

, The old saying, ""If you do not use it, you lose it,"" is true. By not exercising regularly, muscles weaken and put more pressure on the joints. By exercising on a regular basis, the muscles are allowed to do their job and work with the joints, rather than working together for the muscles.

, While a regular exercise regimen is essential to your overall health, overusing your joints will have a negative effect on your body. The key is regular exercise - instead of trying to accomplish a week's worth of exercise once a week. Exercise daily - or keep a consistent schedule.

, Repetitive movements of the wrists or knees can cause problems later in life. Try to control activities regularly enough to prevent repetitive strain on the joints.

, A healthy diet and keep your bodies properly hydrated are important to prevent the onset of the attack of arthritis.

Stretch your back muscles first.,
Stretch your back by elongating your spine.,
Extend your spine while standing.,
Extend your spine with help from your hands.,
Add some spinal rotation while standing.,
Rotate your spine while sitting on the floor.,
Sit in a chair to get more leverage.,
Do a twisting stretch while lying on your back.,
Use a foam roller.,
Stretch your back over the edge of your bed.,
Get a ""bear hug."",
Get ""picked up"" from behind.,
Don't let someone crack your back on the floor.",How to Crack Your Back," Muscle tension in your back is often relieved with simple stretches without the spinal joints making cracking or popping sounds. Too much joint cracking may damage the joint tissues and accelerate a type of arthritis known as osteoarthritis (the wear and tear type).As such, aim for a good muscle stretch to start with and don't focus too hard on trying to achieve any cracking sounds.


Lay on your back (supine) on an even surface that has some padding (such as carpet or a yoga mat) so your spine doesn't get bruised.
Bring both knees up to your chest with your arms until you feel some mild-to-moderate stretching within your back muscles and hold for about 30 seconds. Do this simple stretch three to five times daily depending on the degree of tension in your back.
Don't hold your breath. Instead, you should breathe deeply and exhale as you relax into the stretch.
You may have to slowly rock forward and backward in this position to get a better muscle stretch, but always do so in a controlled, gentle fashion. Never aggressively bounce or force motion into your spine or other joints as this could cause injury.;
, Another type of stretch can be done while on your knees and facing the floor (prone), which is similar to a yoga position known as the child's pose.Again, the goal of this position is to stretch the back muscles and the spine, but it may not lead to any cracking sounds if you avoid twisting or extending your back









Kneel on a padded surface with your buttocks resting on the soles of your feet. Then bend forward at the waist, walking your fingers forward as far as you can go while trying to touch your nose to the floor.
Hold this stretch for about 30 seconds while continuing to breathe. Depending on the amount of tension in your back, try this stretch three to five times daily.
You may not be very flexible, or your belly may get in the way, but try to extend your arms as far forward as you can until you can feel your back muscles and spine stretch at least a little bit.

, Extension of the spine is a movement that often creates a cracking sound, but your spinal column has fairly limited motion in this direction, so don't be too aggressive while doing it.Extending your back doesn't really stretch your back muscles, but you may feel some pulling in your chest or abdominal muscles.









Place both hands behind your head and slowly push your head backwards while arching or extending your spine so that your stomach sticks out.
Hold the position for 10–20 seconds and consider doing it three to five times daily depending on the amount of tension in your back.
The area of your back most likely to crack with this position is the thoracic region, which is the part of your spine between your shoulder blades.
Make sure your feet are firmly planted and shoulder width apart so that you maintain balance and reduce the risk of falling over. Keep your eyes looking forward to prevent overextending your neck and head backwards.

, While slowly extending your spine in a controlled manner, you can reach around your back and put pressure on the area that has the most tension, which will induce a little more focused extension there. This movement requires a little more flexibility, especially from your upper body and arms.









While standing and slowly extending your back, slide your hand behind and slowly push down on your spine while extending your stomach forward. Hold for 10–20 seconds and try it three to five times daily depending on your condition.
Use your dominant arm / hand so as to have more control and strength.
The spinal area under the most pressure is likely to crack, especially if you have the flexibility to reach up towards the thoracic spine.

, The spine tends to have more range of motion from side-to-side than it does in extension, so rotation tends to be a safer or more forgiving motion.Rotation of the spine can crack most areas of your back, especially the lumbar region or low back.









While standing with your feet shoulder-width apart (for stability and balance), place your arms in front of you, bent at the elbows.
In a controlled fashion, rotate your upper body as far as you can in one direction, then switch and do the other way a few seconds later.
You can use some momentum by swinging your arms, but be careful not to go too far and risk pulling a muscle.
Repeat as many times as necessary, but once you crack your back, it won't crack again at the same spinal segment for between 20–30 minutes or so. It takes that long for the joint to reset again.

, Another way to rotate the lower half of your spine is to do it while sitting, which might feel more stable and easier to control. You can also use your arms and hands to induce a little more rotation without having to swing your body, which is likely a little safer.









Sit on the floor with one leg bent at the knee and the other leg extended — it does not matter which side you start with because you'll switch and do both sides a few times.
With the foot of the bent leg on the ground, push with it and rotate your torso in the opposite direction, using your hands to stabilize you and induce more rotation.
Try to look back over your shoulder on the same side as your bent knee.
Wear runners so your feet get more grip to push with.

, Rotating your spine while sitting in a chair is helpful because you can grab parts of the chair to gain additional leverage and rotation. Spinal joints need to go slightly beyond their normal range of motion in order to crack, so using a chair to achieve that may be your best bet.








Sit facing forward on a stable chair. While trying to keep your buttocks and legs in the same position, rotate as far as you can in one direction (holding for a few seconds), then go in the other direction. Breathe normally while doing this.
Grab on to the sides or the top of the chair to gain more leverage — a wooden chair works well in this regard.
In this position, your lower lumbar spine is the most likely to crack or release.

, Another way to crack your mid-to-lower back is to lay on your back (supine) and use your leg / knee as a lever in order to achieve rotation. Make sure the floor is cushioned or padded for the most comfort.









Lie flat on your back on a cushioned floor, raise a leg to your chest while bending it at the knee. Then pull on the outside of your knee towards the floor with your opposite hand, which will create rotation in your lower back and hips.
Your may feel the low back and/or hip joints release and crack with this move.
This is a similar position that a chiropractor or osteopath will put you in for adjusting your low back and hips (sacroiliac joints).

, Rolling on a piece of firm foam is a good way to massage your back and it also increases the likelihood of cracking or popping some spinal joints, especially those in the mid back region (thoracic). Foam rollers are commonly used in physiotherapy, yoga and pilates.








Pick up a foam roller at a sporting goods or big-box store — they're very inexpensive and nearly indestructible.
Place the foam roller on the ground, perpendicular to where you're going to lay your body. Lie down on your back so that the foam roller is beneath your shoulders.
Put your feet flat on the floor, bend your knees, and lift up your lower back so it rolls over the foam in a back and forth manner.
Never lie with your low back flat on a foam roller because it will hyperextend the low back. Always lean to one side while rolling the low back on a foam roller.
Use your feet to move your body over the foam, so that your entire spine is massaged (at least 10 minutes). Repeat as many times as necessary, although your muscles might be a little sore after the first time your use a foam roller.

, Another way to achieve more extension is to use the edge of your bed as a fulcrum point, so that your head can dip below the level of your spine. This position is effective for cracking the mid back primarily.









Lie down on your back on a bed, with everything above your shoulder blades extended over the edge.
Relax your back and let your head and arms slowly extend towards the floor, breathing out entirely as you do it.
After each downward extending motion, hold for about 5 seconds and then do a full sit-up to get back to the original position and take a full breath in. Repeat as necessary.
This movement is also great for strengthening your abdominal muscles, but it carries a little greater risk of injuring your spine, so maybe ask a companion to be a spotter to make sure you can do it safely.

, A very common way to crack the mid back is to have someone give you a tight hug from the front. Some extension is needed to release the joints and it certainly helps if the person performing the hug is stronger and taller than you so they can get good leverage. Be careful though, because broken ribs and lung injuries are possible.








Stand face-to-face with a person of equal or greater size.
Allow the person to hug you and have them clasp their hands near the area that you want to crack while you relax your arms at your sides.
After breathing in and fully out, give a signal for the person to squeeze harder with their hands in a quick thrusting manner (this takes some practice and coordination), which will extend the spine somewhat and likely release a few joints.
For women with large or sensitive breasts, this maneuver might not be appropriate.

, A possibly more effective method of adjusting the mid back is getting a hug from behind because extending the thoracic spine is a little easier from this direction, assuming the person doing it is strong enough to lift you off the ground by a few inches or so. Instead of using their hands to crack your back, the person lifting you can use gravity and their own chest as they arch back (which takes less coordination).









Cross your arms across the front of your body and allow a stronger, taller person to hug you from behind and grab your elbows for support.
After fully exhaling, give a signal and allow the person to lift you off the ground while simultaneously squeezing you and extending your mid back.
This maneuver is a little risky for both participants because of the greater forces on the spines and shoulder joints.

, There is a technique that should only be attempted by someone with adequate training, such as an osteopath or chiropractor. There are laws that prevent some health professionals from doing this maneuver without adequate training. If you are interested in having your back cracked in this way, talk to a licensed professional.

You may also require medical devices like a brace or an orthosis to assist you in your daily functions, which will also require a doctor's visit (specifically to an orthotist). Your doctor will want to monitor your condition and may require follow-up visits to determine how effective your treatment options are.;
, Antispasmodic drugs, also known as anticholinergic drugs, are a class of medications that treat a variety of muscle spasms.Some common antispasmodics prescribed for spasticity include:


Baclofen (Lioresal) - targets the spinal cord to alter signals sent to the brain. Side effects include hallucinations, confusion, sedation, and weakness/loss of muscle coordination.
Dantrolene sodium (Dantrium) - weakens spastic muscles without targeting the nervous system. Side effects include drowsiness, dizziness, weakness, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, depression, blood abnormalities, and liver damage.
Tizanidine hydrochloride (Zanaflex) - targets the central nervous system to reduce muscular reflexes. Side effects include dizziness, drowsiness, low blood pressure, dry mouth, and possible liver damage.

, Benzodiazepines are a group of skeletal muscle relaxants that are often prescribed to treat spasticity.Benzodiazepines may even be effective when used in low doses to treat spasticity in children.However, due to the potential for tolerance and addiction, it's generally advised that benzodiazepine use be kept to a minimum and remain closely monitored by a medical professional.Some common benzodiazepines include:


Alprazolam (Xanax)
Clonazepam (Klonopin)
Diazepam (Valium)

, Intramuscular injections provide relief for extended periods of time with few reported side effects. They can help treat spasticity in as few as one muscle or muscle group with great accuracy, but they may not be as effective at treating broader, more diffused spasticity problems.Some common intramuscular injections used to treat spasticity include:


Botulinum Toxin A (Botox)
Botulinum Toxin B (Myobloc)
Phenol

, A baclofen pump is a surgically implanted device that is inserted around the spinal cord. It delivers medication to your spinal cord at regular intervals that your doctor will determine and set.Because the pump is surgically implanted, you will need to have the medicine reservoir refilled every four to six weeks.
This treatment option seems to work best with leg spasticity.
Since medicine is delivered directly to the spinal cord, it does not pass the blood-brain barrier and therefore does not cause any cognitive side effects.

, For some individuals with severe spasticity, surgery may be a viable option when other treatments have failed. However, because surgery is such an invasive and serious procedure, you should think carefully about your options and discuss the possible benefits and downsides with your doctor.An orthopedic surgeon may be able to simply cut an affected muscle or tendon to elongate it, thereby reducing contractions.
A neurosurgeon can perform a rhizotomy in which the roots of affected nerves are cut from the spinal cord. This permanently paralyzes some or all of the attached muscles, preventing further spasticity.
Be aware that both surgical options are permanent. In the case of a rhizotomy, it will result in permanent loss of muscle function.

, A physical therapist can help you improve your flexibility and range of motion. Physical therapy can also teach you ways to stretch and exercise your muscles at home between sessions.Ask your doctor for recommendations if you need a physical therapist.

, Some individuals find that stretching triggers spasticity because of the physical limitations on muscle use that may come with spasticity.However, it's generally agreed that daily stretching exercises can help prevent spasticity in the long run.Making stretching a regular part of your treatment plan will help limber your muscles and get your body used to extending and flexing your muscles.


Extend each spastic muscle's joint so the affected muscles are stretched as far as they can comfortably reach.Try to hold the position for about one minute. You should begin to feel the muscle relax and loosen up.
Release the position and allow your muscles to gradually relax. Gradually work through each affected muscle group.
As you continue your stretches over the weeks and months ahead, try to increase the number of stretches and the types of movement you perform.
If you're unsure of how to stretch your muscles or if you need assistance, a physical therapist can help you get started.

, Exercising in a pool makes your body feel more supported. This can give you a broader range of motions and flexibility than you would otherwise get doing the same exercises on dry ground.Cold temperatures can trigger spasticity.However, too high of a temperature may lead to quicker fatigue.A temperature slightly below 85 degrees Fahrenheit (29 degrees Celsius) is generally considered ideal.
Be aware of your own limitations. If you're not a strong swimmer or if your symptoms may cause a drowning hazard, avoid pool exercises or have someone closely supervise you at all times.

, Orthoses are medical devices that are custom-built for patients by an orthotist. These devices can help reduce spasticity by altering the position your muscles rest in.Some common orthoses for individuals with spasticity include:


finger and toe spreaders
braces (worn on the foot, ankle, hand, or wrist)

, Some people with spasticity issues have uncontrollable movements or contractions at night. This can disrupt sleep and make it difficult to remain comfortable in bed. Using special splints and/or padded braces can help keep your body in a position that reduces the chance of nocturnal spasticity.Ask your doctor or orthotist if medical splints and braces designed for nighttime use may help your condition.

, Some individuals with spasticity find that relaxation techniques reduce the incidence of muscle spasms. Relaxation techniques can also help you mentally and emotionally cope with your condition.Progressive muscle relaxation can be very helpful at reducing spasticity.

Deep breathing, yoga, and meditation may also help relieve some symptoms of spasticity.

, Different individuals may experience different triggers of muscle spasms. However, some conditions are generally acknowledged as being common triggers for many people.Some triggers for individuals with spasticity include, but are not limited to:


extreme temperatures (both heat and cold)
fatigue
high levels of humidity
infections
tight clothing
sudden movements without proper stretching and preparedness

, Severe spasticity may leave some individuals confined to a bed or chair for long periods of time. If this happens, it's important to take health and sanitation precautions so you can prevent infections and irritations from developing.Change positions regularly to avoid developing bedsores.
Wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing to reduce muscle constriction.
Keep your skin clean. If you cannot bathe on your own, keep pre-moistened wet wipes handy and use them to clean your body.

, Some individuals with spasticity find that constipation or painful hemorrhoids can affect their condition. These complications can be avoided with careful monitoring and regulation of your diet.Eat a diet high in fiber to prevent constipation.
Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day.
Aim for two to three liters of total beverages consumed each day. Be sure to further increase your water intake if you live in a hot, arid environment or if you are physically active."

Apply warmth to stiff joints.,
Try cold packs too.,
Do dishes in hot water.",How to Deal with Morning Stiffness from Arthritis1," Heat provides a quick, easy way to reduce the discomfort of morning stiffness. To relax your muscles and increase circulation to stiff joints, use hot packs, heating pads, or a hot shower to target affected areas.When using a hot pack or heating pad, wrap the device in a thin, dry towel. Do not exceed 20 minutes of application.
Take as hot of a shower as is comfortable for you. Hot tub or whirlpool use can be especially therapeutic to relieve stiffness first thing in the morning.
Allow your skin to return to room temp before applying any topical medication.;
, Believe it or not, you can also relieve morning stiffness by applying cool temperatures to your joints. This helps reduce swelling and can numb locations of particularly bothersome pain. Ice packs, cold packs, or even a bag of frozen veggies will do the trick.Try warm and cold packs on separate days to see what works better for you. Stick with whichever seems to work better.
If either warm or cold packs are too uncomfortable, discontinue use. Your comfort is an important factor in keeping your pain low.
Wrap anything frozen in a dry towel to protect your skin, and do not apply cold to one location for more than 20 minutes. Allow your skin to warm back up to normal before applying topical medication.

, If your hands are the primary site of your morning stiffness, try soaking your hands in warm or hot water. To take your mind off of the discomfort as well, try doing a few dishes in a sink filled with hot water.Always test a sink’s water temp by quickly dipping a finger in momentarily before submerging your hands.

Learn what scoliosis is.,
Realize that scoliosis doesn't always require surgery.,
Recognize when surgery is needed.,
Understand the type of bone graft your surgeon recommends.,
Understand the procedure.,
Schedule the surgery at a convenient time.,
Don't rush your hospital stay.,
Wean yourself off pain medications.,
Be patient while recovering.,
Get counseling if need be.",How to Deal With Scoliosis Surgery," From a side (lateral) view, the spine is normally curved much like the letter ""S"" in order to best support the body, allow for flexibility and to protect the spinal cord. However, when viewed from behind (posterior), the spine should appear fairly straight and not deviate too much to either side. Many people have a few degrees (less than 10) of lateral deviation that's typically ignored and not diagnosed as scoliosis because it doesn't cause any problems. There are many potential causes of scoliosis, including congenital spine deformities (present at birth), spina bifida, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, spinal infection, trauma from accidents and certain spinal tumors, although in more than 80% of cases the cause is unknown, or idiopathic.Although boys and girls develop scoliosis at about equal rates, girls have a much higher risk of severe scoliosis, which often requires surgery.Scoliosis can run in families (genetic link), but most people diagnosed with scoliosis don't have a family history of the condition.;
, Scoliosis is relatively straightforward to measure on spinal x-rays, but curves are not considered significant until they are greater than 25 – 30 degrees.As such, mild and moderate curvatures are not even considered for surgery, regardless if they cause discomfort or not. Mild-to-moderate scoliosis may cause some noticeable deformity, but it's usually too difficult to tell with clothes on. In many cases, the diagnosis of scoliosis sounds much worse than how the condition actually presents or any symptoms that it may cause. People with mild-to-moderate scoliosis live normal lives and can even become top-class athletes, so don't get overly upset or concerned with an initial diagnosis of scoliosis.


Common deformities related to scoliosis include: a prominent shoulder blade that creates a hump, one hip higher than the other (uneven waist), ribs that protrude more on one side, listing to one side while standing or walking, a head that's not centered over the torso.
Most mild scoliotic curves develop without the child or parent realizing because they appear gradually and often don't cause back pain., Although a scoliotic curve is considered significant at around 30 degrees, that's still not enough to warrant surgery. It's not until a curve reaches 40 degrees in an adolescent that a doctor starts to even consider surgery, and then only if there are signs of fairly rapid progression and/or serious symptoms.However, as curves approach 45 – 50 degrees in a younger teenager, then most doctors recommend surgery not only to combat the growing deformity for cosmetic reasons, but also to reduce the risk of disabling symptoms. Severe scoliosis (a curve greater than 80 – 90 degrees) can be disabling because it pushes the rib cage against the lungs and heart, making it difficult to breathe and forcing the heart to work harder.Scoliotic curves located in the mid back (thoracic region) grow and worsen more often than curves in the upper (cervical) or lower (lumbar) regions of the spine.
Signs and symptoms of scoliosis typically begin during the growth spurt just prior to puberty — between the ages of nine and 15 years old.Once a teenager's bones stop growing, the risk of scoliosis progression becomes very low.

, The basic idea of scoliosis surgery is to realign and fuse together the curved vertebrae so that they heal into a single, solid bone. All spinal fusions use a bone graft, which are small pieces of bone that are placed into the spaces between the vertebrae to be fused. The bones then grow together, similar to when a broken bone heals. However, there's typically a choice of bone graft used: it's either taken from somewhere on your body (such as the pelvis bone) or allograft bone is used (taken from a deceased donor).Allograft bone is sterilized and often mixed with your own marrow to improve its bone fusion capability. The main downside to using your own bone for grafting purposes is that the donor area can hurt for a long time (weeks or months).


Spinal fusion surgery is very successful in stopping curves from progressing and improving the patient's appearance.
With surgery, most severe curves (50 degrees and more) are reduced to less than 25 degrees, which are hardly noticeable.Metal rods (made of either titanium, cobalt chromium or stainless steel) are typically used to hold the spine in place until fusion happens. The metal rods are attached to the vertebrae by screws, hooks, and/or wires and then usually removed at a later time.

, Most scoliosis operations involve cutting into the back where the curve is most pronounced, but sometimes with more complicated cases, the surgeon will go through the chest and address the front (anterior) side of the twisted vertebrae. Going through the front is more traumatic for the body and involves slightly more risk, but most scoliosis surgeries go in through the back side to address thoracic curves (between the shoulder blades and below in most cases). Scars are inevitable, but fade pretty well with time. especially if you keep the incision wound clean and apply aloe vera and vitamin E regularly once the wound is fully healed and your surgeon has said that this is OK.Incisions to repair a single scoliotic curve are generally about 10 inches long. Don't be too self-conscious about the scar as it's not very noticeable after about six to eight months.
Although it typically takes at least three months for vertebrae to fuse together well, it will take an additional year or two for them to fuse completely., The decision to get spinal surgery is bound to cause anxiousness and probably a little fear, so help mitigate that by getting it done at a convenient time that allows for proper healing and recovery. Most surgeons agree that scoliosis rarely requires urgent emergency surgery (even in adolescents), so plan the surgery around a summer break if you're still in school.If you're a working adult, consider saving up your vacation days and getting it done during cooler months, which will make your recovery indoors more comfortable and it will be less tempting to be active before you're truly ready.


Although the first couple of days involve significant pain, this pain will be managed by your surgeon and his team. It gradually fades away such that most teenagers can return to school within three to four weeks after surgery.
For adults, return to work is difficult to estimate because of all the factors involved — age, overall health condition, type of surgery performed and profession.

, Each patient's hospital stay varies depending on their age, overall health condition and surgical procedure. In general, most hospital stays are four days, but it may last up to seven days.Depending on your surgeon, an epidural catheter may be used, an epidural catheter may be inserted into your back to control pain for the first three days then removed. A catheter is also placed in your bladder for two to three days so that you don't have to walk to the bathroom and risk falling. You'll have a physical therapist helping you get out of bed and instructing you to move and walk over the course of your stay. By the fourth day, you should be able to climb stairs. If you need more time to reach physical milestones, don't worry because everybody heals at different rates.


Before being discharged, spinal x-rays will be taken to ensure there are no problems with the implants and/or spinal alignment.
The bandaging covering your incision shouldn't be disturbed until a follow-up visit with your doctor (about one to two weeks), so you'll have to take precaution while bathing yourself.
Remember that the more immobile the spine is kept, the better it will fuse together, so any bending, lifting, and/or twisting is discouraged for about three months post-surgery., As you're preparing to leave the hospital your doctor will likely give you some strong prescription medication for the pain — probably morphine-like opiates. Although these are very effective at controlling pain, they can become addictive if taken for much more than a few weeks.As such, you'll be encouraged to switch to over-the-counter acetaminophen (Tylenol) as soon as possible once you get settled in at home. By three to six weeks after scoliosis surgery, pain medicine of any kind should no longer be necessary. If you're having trouble weaning yourself off pain medications, consult with your doctor about effective approaches.


Be careful not to take any medications on an empty stomach, as they can irritate the lining of your stomach and increase the risk of stomach ulcers.
Never take analgesics, such as acetaminophen, at the same time as NSAIDs. Mixing different drug classes can create worse side effects.

, As a general guideline, once you're at home, you shouldn't be very active (aside from some walking) for about two weeks.This is the most important time to heal, both physically and mentally. During this time, the dressing over the incision should not be disturbed, so be prepared for numerous sponge baths. For the first 6 months, activities should be mainly related to daily living — no heavy lifting, running or jumping is allowed. After eight to 10 months, if everything is healing normally, then light activities may be allowed (ask your surgeon what he recommends). At 10 – 12 months, running, jumping and non-contact sports are usually allowed.


Any physical contact or jarring type activities common in sports such as football and hockey are restricted for up to a year or more post surgery, so be prepared to miss at least a full season of sports if not more.
After spinal fusion surgery most people have enough spinal motion to perform all activities of daily living and most sports. However, most surgeons will not allow patients to return to contact sports following spine fusion surgery.

, The physical trauma and pain of scoliosis surgery, as well as the emotional stress caused by fear is a lot to take, especially for adolescents who might feel their lives are ruined. If all the stress is too much to bear, then don't hesitate to contact a school counselor or have your doctor refer you to a mental health professional. In addition to helping with stress, anxiety and depression, cognitive-behavioral therapy can also help with musculoskeletal pain.Dispelling the myths of scoliosis is also very helpful at alleviating stress because the truth is that the vast majority who need surgery lead completely normal lives.

Females who have scoliosis fusion (even in their lower spines) can still become pregnant and deliver babies normally.Fusion surgery rarely stunts growth and has minimal effects on height. In fact, straightening curves sometimes adds a 1/2 inch to a person's height.
In extremely thin patients the metal rods / implants can sometimes be felt, but rarely seen, so there's no need to be self-conscious.

Take acetaminophen.,
Talk to your doctor about NSAIDs.,
Take a pill first thing in the morning.,
Apply capsaicin cream.,
Talk to your doctor about any continued medication use.",How to Deal with Morning Stiffness from Arthritis2," This drug is an aspirin-free pain reliever, which are the recommended choice in treating arthritis symptoms such as morning stiffness. Though acetaminophen does not fight inflammation, it will help reduce your pain and is safe to take more frequently than some other pain relievers.Tylenol is an example of an over-the-counter medication that contains acetaminophen.
Follow the packaging’s label regarding dosage. Take as little as if effective. Do not take more than 3,000 mg per day.Seek advice from your doctor before taking acetaminophen if you have a liver disease or abuse alcohol.

, Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are another type of medication that can help with morning stiffness. As their name implies, these do fight inflammation, and will reduce the swelling in your joints that cause discomfort; however, extensive NSAID use can have negative side effects.Specific NSAIDs include aspirin, ibuprofen (such as Advil/Motrin), and naproxen sodium (Aleve). Make sure NSAIDs are safe to use with any other medications you may be taking.
Talk to your doctor if you find yourself taking NSAIDS more than a few times a week, or consistently for a period over two weeks long. Side effects associated with prolonged NSAID use include heart complications, gastrointestinal discomfort, and kidney damage.Alternatively, try topical medications that contain diclofenac sodium, such as Voltaren gel.

, It may be worth setting your alarm clock half an hour before you want to get up. Place the pill and some water (in a resealable container) near your bed. When your alarm goes off, take the medication and doze off until you need to get up.Even if you are unable to fall back asleep, giving yourself 15 minutes or so before getting out of bed may help. Alternatively, get up to do a basic task, such as make coffee, take a pain reliever, and get back in bed to allow your joints to loosen up before starting the day.

, Capsaicin is found in chili peppers and can reduce the amount of a pain neurotransmitter (substance P) that sends pain signals to the brain. Apply thin layer of capsaicin cream over painful and stiff joints. Apply between two and four times every day for the cream to be effective and therapeutic. Wash hands after applying.Capsaicin must be used continuously to keep substance P levels low.
The cream may cause burning or stinging for the first few weeks of use.

, Let your doctor know about any over-the-counter medications you are taking. They may talk to you about prescribing stronger NSAIDs or other drugs designed to help fight arthritis. New drugs, such as modified-release prednisone, were developed to target morning stiffness in particular. Though they have yet to hit the open market, drugs such as this can be taken at night and may help prevent morning stiffness."

Do range of motion stretches.,
Exercise frequently.,
Balance physical activity with rest.",How to Deal with Morning Stiffness from Arthritis3," Another good way to loosen up stiff joints is by doing some gentle exercises. You can even perform some exercises while you’re still in bed. For instance, roll your shoulders and ankles in small, slow circles, or reach as far as you can above your head.Once out of bed, stand with your feet together, your arms out in front of you, and your back straight. Slowly twist from side to side. This exercise alone will engage most of the joints in your body, improving blood flow.

, Physical activity is extremely important, as keeping your muscles strong will help support your joints. Further, exercise will help you sleep better, maintain or achieve a healthy weight, and improve your mood and sense of contentment.Aim to do at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise five times a week.


Try yoga, tai-chi and other low-impact exercise such as swimming or elliptical cycling.
Swimming is one of the best exercise options for people who suffer from arthritis. Try an early morning swim whenever you are able, as this can help loosen up any lingering morning stiffness.
Eliminate or reduce aggravating activity, such as stair climbing, prolonged sitting and intense jogging.

, Stiff, swollen joints also need to be treated carefully. While you need to exercise to keep muscles engaged and loosen your joints, you also need to allow inflamed joints to cool down.If unaccustomed to exercising regularly, start slowly with short a short walk or casual swim.


If a type of exercise makes your joints warm or swollen, remove it from your exercise regimen. Further, don’t continue any exercise that cause site-specific pain in your joints.
Alternate exercise activities to decrease the amount of repetition and overuse of the joints.
See a physiotherapist for help establishing an exercise regimen that works for you.

Minimize symptoms with diet.,
Get high-quality sleep.,
Head off your morning the night before.",How to Deal with Morning Stiffness from Arthritis4," A healthy, balanced diet is important for countless reasons, including the fact that what you eat can help prevent the frequency and severity of your symptoms.Make sure you’re getting plenty of Omega-3 fatty acids, whole grains, and are eating meals and snacks consisting mostly of colorful fruits and veggies.

, In addition to diet, healthy sleeping habits are extremely important to reducing your symptoms, especially morning stiffness. Keep your bedroom dark, quiet, and cool. Avoid screens of any type for an hour before bedtime, and do something that will help you wind down, like reading or gentle yoga.Try to find a comfortable sleeping position that reduces stress on your joints. For instance, sleeping sideways with a pillow between your knees can reduce some types of morning stiffness. Since the perfect sleeping position varies from person to person, take note of the position you were sleeping in whenever you wake up without morning stiffness.
If falling asleep is an issue for you, remove caffeine from your diet, particularly later in the day. Further, don’t hesitate to see a sleep specialist if you continue to have trouble sleeping.

, Another great way to help wind down for bed — and ease any tension in your joints — is a warm bath or shower before bed. This will also help you start your day if you need to get ready quickly. Further, set out clothes and pack your lunch if you know you may need to work off a bit of stiffness in the morning. Waking up ready to overcome your morning stiffness and enjoy the day will be easier if you give yourself a head start."

Know that none of the methods described below are necessarily medically recommended.",How to Crack Someone Else's Back1," A chiropractic manipulates the neuromusculoskeletal system to bring any joints or sections of the spine back into alignment. Although chiropractic adjustment is seen by some to be a pseudoscience, it is almost certainly safer than administering a chiropractic adjustment at home, without the supervision of a licensed professional.;
, Many people crack their back in order to help relieve pain. If you experience chronic back pain and are cracking your back in order to relieve pain, you're treating the symptoms, not the underlying problem.Chiropractors, physical therapists, or orthopedists use techniques that have been studied and replicated with good results. If you or another person whose back you're cracking is in chronic pain, visit a licensed professional who can not only treat the pain, but who can also diagnose the underlying problem and work to fix it.

, Although most patients who undergo spinal manipulation report no adverse health effects, there are risks associated with back cracking. Doctors are particularly worried about tearing in the lining of the vertebral artery in the neck that can happen when a person gets their neck cracked. This can lead to stroke., The below methods, although extremely effective, are not medically recommended. Visit a licensed professional if you have any doubts about cracking someone's back.

It's a good idea to have had a neck rub, massage or even a few good neck stretches before you begin to help stretch and loosen the neck.

, Get a good grip and hold in the hair behind your left ear.

, Gently but firmly rotate your head counter-clockwise between your hands, pushing your chin around to the left with your palm while pulling your head around in the opposite direction with your right hand. Do this until the neck muscles are at full stretch but not over stretched.


You will often hear and feel a series of cracking sounds as the neck muscles pull tight, but just as cracking a knuckle often requires you to stretch your thumb or finger joints fully before pushing just a little further to achieve joint cavitation (cracking), you may have to stretch out one side of your neck fully. Add just a little extra pressure to trigger the full sequence of cracks.

Understand that cracking your joints does not necessarily signal a spinal adjustment.,
If you have any doubt about the efficacy of home treatment or underlying symptoms that may be presenting pain or stiffness, see a doctor.",How to Crack Your Neck5," When you crack your knuckle or back or neck, your joint capsule stretches, forcing a release of oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide.This forms a bubble of air, which then collapses on itself. This is what causes the audible pop we associate with cracking a joint.

, Although there are several other health risks associated with cracking your joints, and your neck specifically, arthritis is not one of them. Donald L. Unger cracked the joints of one hand for 30 years without ever cracking the joints of his other hand, casting doubts on the claim that joint cracking leads to arthritis., If you repeatedly need to crack your neck to deliver relief to your neck, shoulders, and spinal area, there's probably a deeper issue that deserves medical attention. Separating the joints in the manner described above does provide temporary relief, but it's just that — temporary.


People often find that to deliver the same amount of relief to the neck area, they have to crack the area more and more often. Cracking tends to stretch out the ligaments in the surrounding area, making them less stable. Ligaments that are less stable are less likely to support the weight of your head adequately, leading to more pain.

, A lot of people will mistake the cracking sound for an actual adjustment. This is not necessarily the case (often, it's not the case). To get an adjustment, visit a licensed physical therapist or chiropractor.

Put your legs close together, with your knees bent, and hold onto the sides of your knees with your hands. Arch your head up slightly to activate your core muscles.









Foam rollers are great back-cracking (and back-stretching) tools, but if you don't have one, you can probably improvise. Some people choose to use a PVC pipe with a yoga mat glued onto it. This is a much harder surface than a normal roam roller, which means it's less forgiving (and usually not great for beginners).

, You can roll by extending, and then bending, your legs while keeping them anchored to the ground. This creates a see-saw like effect. It allows you to glide over the foam roller with your lower back.









If you want to get a good upper back stretch, roll the foam roller from the small of your lower back to the top of your shoulder. You should hear several cracks in your upper back especially as you do this.

, You should experience several cracks if you haven't cracked your back recently. As you do your foam rolls, remember to:









Keep your core activated and upper body slightly elevated. Remember not to slouch.
Keep your feet anchored to the ground. Try not to move your feet too much as you glide over the foam roller.
Stay comfortable and relaxed. The more relaxed your muscles are, the better your chances of cracking your back.

, Get on the foam roller with your back. Bring one thigh up so that it's 90° to your torso. Your leg, however, should be parallel to your torso. Grasp the area behind the kneecap with the hand opposite it. (If you're elevating your left thigh, grasp behind the kneecap with your right hand.) Anchor your free foot and your free hand on the ground and begin rolling your lower back over the roller.









After you feel the crack in your lower back, relax and switch sides. Perform the same stretch until your lower back cracks.

, Get on the foam roller with your back. Lift your thigh and leg so that both are positioned 90° to your torso. Your thigh and leg should be extended high into the air. Anchor your free foot and your free hand on the ground and begin rolling your lower back over the roller.

Sit down in a comfortable chair without armrests.,
Lower one bent elbow down to the outside of the opposite knee.,
Turn your torso in the direction of whichever knee you are using as an anchor.,
After you feel the crack, switch arms and rotate your torso in the opposite direction.








,
As an alternative, try the same basic trunk rotation seated on the ground.",How to Crack Your Lower Back4," A chair without armrests is best so that you have a freer range of motion with your arms.








, If you're working with your right elbow, bend it and rest it on the outside of the left knee.








, If you're resting your right elbow against your left knee, turn your torso to the left. If you're resting your left elbow against your right knee, turn your torso to the right.









Be careful as you turn your torso. No jerky motions or sudden movements. A relaxed and steady pressure is best when trying to crack your back.

,, Bend your right knee and bring your right leg over your outstretched left leg, which should be flat on the ground. Take your left elbow and position it on the outside of the bent right leg. Move your torso to the right, using your left elbow against your right knee as a fulcrum.









This is the same basic stretch as the seated chair crack — both use elbows against opposite knees as anchors. Once you feel the crack in your lower back, repeat the process using the opposite leg and elbow.

Know that it's generally considered safe to crack one's back.,
Know, however, that cracking one's back isn't the same thing as giving it a realignment.,
Try stretching exercises in addition to or instead of cracking your back.,
Be careful about working out right after cracking your back.",How to Crack Your Lower Back5," Usually thought to be the purview of chiropractors and massage therapists alone, cracking the back can be safely performed at home, provided the act of cracking isn't accompanied by any pain or discomfort.If you begin to feel any pain during the act of cracking your back, stop immediately.









What happens when you crack your back? When you crack your back, nitrogen and carbon dioxide bubbles travel rapidly from the surrounding tissue to the joint.This rapid expansion causes a momentary vacuum, which in turn causes the cracking sound we are all so familiar with.

, While cracking our backs generally feels good — and is often accompanied with relief — it may not be addressing the underlying problem if you have persistent back pain. You may be putting a temporary band-aid on a bigger problem, and in some cases, can even make the problem worse.









Ever notice how cracking your back leads to a cycle of pain and then relief? You crack your back and get relief, but your back feels crummy the next day, necessitating another go at cracking. This cycle of boom and bust can usually be fixed by getting a chiropractic realignment.
What happens in a chiropractic realignment? The doctor of chiropractic works any fixated or jammed vertebrae back into realignment so that the vertebrae aren't pressed together or pinching one another. Unfortunately, you cannot give yourself an alignment. You must have it done by someone else — even chiropractors cannot give themselves alignments.

, There are tons of great stretches that you can perform instead of cracking your lower back. These are often just as effective at providing relief and potentially less dangerous. Here are some that you might consider:









Yoga poses such as cat pose, downward dog pose, pigeon pose, and chair pose

Basic lower back stretches

, If you work out too soon after cracking your back, you could end up with an injury such as a herniated disc.To avoid this, stretch instead of cracking, or decide to crack your back after you've done the requisite workout.

Check for symptoms of forearm tendinitis.,
Consider whether you may have golfer’s elbow.,
Determine if you have tennis elbow.",How to Assess Forearm Tendinitis1," You can feel pain from tendinitis in the forearm around the tendons that connect to the bone near your elbow. Some of the common names for forearm tendinitis are tennis elbow and golfer's elbow. You may have forearm tendinitis if you experience any of the following symptoms:Mild swelling in the area
Tenderness with use and when pressing on the tendon
Pain that is often described as a dull ache
Pain that occurs more often when moving the affected limb;
, The medical term for golfer’s elbow is medial epicondylitis. The pain associated with golfer’s elbow is on the inside of the elbow due to inflammation in the flexor muscles, the muscles that allow your elbow to bend.Placing too much stress on these tendons through repetitive motions will increase your risk of developing this condition. Symptoms of golfer's elbow include:


Pain starting at the elbow and radiating out to the lower part of the arm
Stiffness in your arm
Increased pain when you bend and flex your wrist Pain that is aggravated by certain motions, such as opening jars and shaking hands, Tennis elbow, or lateral epicondylitis, is located on the outer portion of the elbow. The pain starts from repetitive movement which involves the extensor muscles, or those which work to straighten the elbow.The symptoms of tennis elbow often start with mild discomfort and then graduate to more significant pain over months. There is often no injury or specific incident to which you can attribute the start of the pain. Common symptoms of tennis elbow include:


Pain or burning on the outer part of your elbow and down your forearm
A weakened grip
Worsening of symptoms when you overuse the associated muscles, such as by playing racquet sports, turning a wrench, or shaking hands

"
"
Think about whether you are having symptoms in one or both arms.,
Identify repetitive movements that may have contributed to your tennis elbow.,
Consider activities that may have contributed to your golfer’s elbow.",How to Assess Forearm Tendinitis2," With any kind of forearm tendinitis, it is more common for your dominant hand to be affected, but both arms may be affected. Tendinitis will occur in the tendons against which you consistently exert the most force.Tendinitis may also occur in the tendons that control either extension or flexion (straightening or bending), but it rarely occurs in both at the same time. The repetitive motion that exerts the most stress — either force against flexion or against extension — will cause tendinitis.

, Tennis elbow may develop if you exert force against an object with your elbow extended.Although tennis elbow is often caused by playing tennis, using a lighter racquet and a two-handed backhand swing may reduce your chances of developing this condition. Some other types of movement that may also cause tennis elbow include:


Repetitive heavy lifting or using heavy tools
Jobs that involve the use of squeezing and twisting movements or precision motions
New or uncommon movements, such as gardening for the first time in the spring, lifting a new baby, or packing and moving your home

, Although named after the sport of golf, golfer’s elbow can also be caused by other sports that involve gripping and/or throwing motions, such as baseball, football, archery, or javelin throwing.Some other types of movement that may cause golfer’s elbow include:


Doing jobs that involve repetitive motion of the elbow, including computer use, gardening, chopping or painting
Using vibrating tools
Using a racquet that is too small or heavy for your ability or putting excessive topspin on the ballParticipating in other repetitive activities for an hour or more on consecutive days, such as weight lifting, cooking, hammering, raking, or chopping wood"

Get treated right away.,
Schedule an appointment with your doctor.,
Discuss treatment options with your doctor.,
Ask your doctor about plasma therapy.,
Find out about physical therapy.,
Watch for severe symptoms.,
Support your recovery with home remedies.",How to Assess Forearm Tendinitis3," Although it is not life threatening, forearm tendinitis can restrict your movement and activities for weeks or months because of pain and discomfort. Without treatment, tendinitis will also increase your risk of suffering from a tendon rupture. This is a more serious condition that requires surgical repair to restore function to the tendon.If tendinitis persists for several months, you can experience tendinosis, which has a negative effect on the tendon and causes abnormal new blood vessel growth.Long-term complications of tennis elbow can result in recurrence of the injury, rupture of the tendon and failure to heal with either non-surgical or surgical repair due to a nerve entrapment in the forearm.Long-term complications for chronic golfer’s elbow can lead to chronic pain, limited range of motion and a lasting or fixed contracture (bend) in the elbow., If you suspect that you have tendinitis, make an appointment with your doctor for evaluation and treatment. Early diagnosis and treatment will lead to more successful outcomes for your forearm tendinitis.To diagnose your forearm tendinitis, your physician will take a thorough health history and perform a full physical assessment.
Your physician may order x-rays if you were injured before the pain started.

, Following diagnosis, your doctor will recommend treatment to reduce your pain and improve your arm movement. Make sure that you follow your physician’s instructions for treating your forearm and ask any questions that you have about the treatment.


Your physician may prescribe an anti-inflammatory medication to help reduce the inflammation in your forearm, reduce pain, and improve arm function.
You may need to wear a brace to support the area and reduce any stress on the muscles and tendons.This brace may immobilize the area or just provide support, depending upon the severity of your condition.
Your doctor may inject corticosteroids around the tendon to reduce inflammation and pain; however, if the condition lasts more than 3 months, repeated injections may weaken the tendon and increase the risk of tendon rupture., Platelet rich plasma therapy treatments involve taking your blood, spinning it to separate the platelets and re-injecting those platelets into the tendon area.Although this treatment is still being researched, it has been beneficial in the treatment of some chronic tendon conditions. Talk to your doctor to find out if this treatment is a good option for you.

, Your physician may recommend physical therapy in conjunction with other treatments for your tendinitis. In physical therapy, you will learn how to do forearm stretches designed to reduce any tightness in your muscles. Knowing how to reduce this tightness is important because it contributes to the micro-tearing associated with tendonitis.Occupations and recreational activities that require a lot of gripping, force placed against extensor or flexor muscles or repetitive hand or wrist motions can develop tight muscles that contribute to tendinitis.
Your physical therapist may recommend deep friction massage to trigger the release of natural stimulants that may help to heal the tendon.This technique is safe, gentle, and easy to learn from your therapist.

, In some cases, tendinitis may require emergency medical treatment. Learn what the severe symptoms are so that you will know when to get help right away. Seek immediate medical attention if:Your elbow is hot and inflamed and you have a fever
You can’t bend your elbow
Your elbow appears to be deformed
You suspect you may have cracked or broken a bone from a specific injury to the area

, Although you should see your doctor for a diagnosis and treatment of your tendinitis, there are some home remedies that may help to alleviate minor pain from tendinitis. Ask your doctor if these remedies are appropriate for your situation. You may be able to relieve some of your tendinitis pain by:


Resting the inflamed joint and stopping the activity that triggered it
Icing the joint with a towel-wrapped ice pack three to four times per day for 10 minutes at a time
Using over the counter anti-inflammatory medications, such as naproxen (Aleve) or ibuprofen (Motrin)

Find the right fit for you.,
Take chair measurements.,
Establish your seating angles.,
Don’t forget your feet.,
Prefer an adjustable chair with simple controls.,
Take breaks from sitting.,
Consider desk chair alternatives.,
Don’t forget about your furniture.,
Get comfortable in your car.",How to Choose Ergonomic Seating," While it’s hard to beat the convenience of ordering an office chair from a website or catalog, “try before you buy” is definitely the better way to go when it comes to ergonomic seating. Gather all the evidence and advice you can, but in the end make the choice based on your needs and your comfort.For instance, the ergonomic seating diagram available at https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/ergonomics/office/chair.html is a good starting point, but don’t assume that your ideal chair will exactly match its measurements and details.;
, Due to the prevalence of sitting-related injuries, as well as their negative impacts on worker productivity and healthcare costs, there is ample research available regarding ergonomic seating. These studies have established certain chair measurements that tend to make them more ergonomic. Remember, however, that your body needs to be the final judge.


The seat of the chair should be about 17 inches high if fixed in place, or 15”–24” if adjustable. The “seat pan” should be 16.5” (fixed) or 14”–18.5” (adjustable) in depth, and 20”–22” in width (or wide enough to allow at least one inch per side beyond your seated hips).The backrest should be 12”–19” wide, and high enough to support your entire back, at least to the shoulders if not beyond.If the chair has armrests, they should be adjustable and 7”–11” above the compressed seat height (that is, the top of the seat pan when you’re sitting on it).While not as precise of a measurement, when seated, you should be able to fit your fist between the back of your knee and the front of the seat pan (with your back against the backrest).To convert inches to centimeters, multiply by 0.39.

, While you might assume that sitting perfectly upright would be the ideal position, it turns out that a slight recline can substantially reduce the amount of pressure placed upon the discs in your back. A seat back that leans back about 15–20 degrees (105–110 degrees from parallel with the ground), and perhaps even up to 30 degrees, is likely to be more comfortable.Although a slight recline places less pressure on the discs, it’s important not to lean back too much. Leaning back too much may be better for the disc, but it also leads to a change in the position of the neck, putting the neck in slight extension. This can often lead to shortened muscles and eventually muscle pain and tension headaches.
While on the topic of angles, your knees should be bent at right angles (90 degrees) when seated. The angle at your hip should be just slightly beyond a right angle, to accommodate the slight recline in you back positioning.

, Use all the measurements and angles as a guide, but prioritize some simple observations when determining your ideal seat. For instance, when seated, your feet should be able to be (and actually be) planted firmly and flat on the floor. Your knees should be level with the seat pan, and your lower back against the seat back (or lumbar support).If you can’t find a comfortable and supportive chair that lets your feet rest flat on the floor, utilize a flat footrest attachment.

, Adjustable chairs are usually the better choice, as they permit personalization to meet your unique body type and comfort needs. That said, some ergonomic chairs have so many complicated adjustment controls (manual or electronic) that they are often not used properly.Take a little time to figure out how the levers, pedals, buttons, etc. on the chair work before you begin using it regularly. Know how to adjust it to your comfort specifications, instead of having to fiddle around with it while you’re juggling a half-dozen other tasks.

, Experts say you should give an ergonomic chair a “test sit” of one to two hours before deciding if it is right for you. Ideally, that should also be the maximum amount of time that you ever sit in the chair thereafter without getting up to take an on-your-feet break.No matter how well-designed a chair may be, sitting increases pressure on the discs in your back and can hinder blood flow to your legs. Simply standing up reduces these problems and burns substantially more calories; actually moving around a bit is even better.
Give yourself an excuse and/or a reminder to get up every hour or so and move around a bit. Your comfy chair will be there waiting for you when you get back. Consider setting a timer on your computer to remind you to get up from your desk for a few minutes every hour.

, You may have seen or heard of standing desks or treadmill desks, which get you off your backside and on your feet while doing desk work. If sitting is preferable or medically advisable for you, however, there are several desk chair alternatives that may offer ergonomic benefits.


Kneeling seats literally put you on your knees, which padded rests for your knees and arms. Seating balls are akin the giant rubber balls you know from childhood or yoga class, and allow you to sit while remaining slightly in motion. Saddle seats are designed for you to straddle (like riding a horse) with your feet planted on the ground.There is less clear evidence regarding the comfort and health benefits of these chair alternatives, however. It may simply come down to personal preference., There’s a decent chance that you spend as much time on your living room couch as in your office chair (maybe even more time), yet few people give much thought to ergonomics when selecting home furnishings. Home furnishings designers and shoppers tend to prioritize style above all else, so most pieces — like soft, plush couches that you sink into — are ergonomically-unfriendly.You might be able to find furniture designed with ergonomics in mind if you search widely (and are willing to pay more), but you can also keep some general principles in mind while shopping. Look for pieces that have firm cushioning, allow you to put your feet flat on the ground while your back is against the backrest, and put your body in an upright position (ears over shoulders over hips).
Think of furniture shopping like shoe shopping — go for style and comfort. Try out a piece for 20 minutes or more before deciding.

, Some car manufacturers now advertise their ergonomically-designed seats, but often your comfort and back health while sitting in a car boil down to some simple adjustments. Your individual physical characteristics also play a role — a jockey and an NBA center are never going to be perfectly comfortable driving the same car.When driving, adjust your seat so that: your hips and knees are level; you can push in the pedals fully without your back coming off the seat back; the center of the steering wheel is about 10–12 inches from your breastbone; your back is reclined about 10-20 degrees past upright; the headrest touches the middle of the back of your head; your tailbone is as far back in the seat as possible; the seat cushion does not hit the back of your knees.
As with any other type of seating, get up regularly (after stopping the car, of course!) to move around and refresh your mind and body.

Exercise properly.",How to Deal with Back Pain As You Age," Find a comfortable position and rest as much as possible for a few days. Rest in small doses. For example, lay down for two hour stretches at a time. Avoid resting for too long or the muscles will begin to weaken. Aim for two to three days of rest followed by light movement.Start a light activity program during the first week, consisting of 20 minute walks three times a day interspersed with several hours of bedrest to avoid losing muscle tone.
Use pillows to support your back and legs while you're resting. Putting pillows underneath back of your knee joints can be especially helpful if you suffer from lower back pain. This can ease some of your back discomfort as it takes some of the pressure off your back.;
, Since back pain can differ wildly in people, some people find pain relief with ice packs while others get pain relief from heat packs. Many physicians recommend alternating cold packs with heat packs. To do this, apply a heat pack for about 20 minutes followed by an ice pack for 10 minutes.Heat therapy works well for muscle sprains or pulled muscles in the lower back. Ice packs are also recommended for strained muscles, but you should use them within 48 hours of feeling pain to get the most relief., Most OTC pain relievers like ibuprofen and acetaminophen reduce the inflammation that causes back pain. While you can take both of these at the same time, talk with your doctor about what medications you can take to deal with your back pain.It should be noted that acetaminophen provides equivalent pain relief compared to ibuprofen but with much less gastrointestinal upset.
Topical OTC pain relievers are also available. These work best to relieve isolated pain and should be used according to the manufacturer's instructions.

, Applying heat to your aching back can stimulate blood flow, reduce swelling, and relieve aches and pains associated with aging. To get the most health benefits, soak for 20 minutes in a hot tub, bath, or Jacuzzi. Use warm water since water that's too hot (over 104°F or 40°C) can put stress on your cardiovascular system.Add magnesium sulfate crystals, also known as Epsom salt. Magnesium is an important mineral that helps in bone and heart health. It also eases muscular tension.
Be sure to drink water before and after soaking so you stay hydrated.
If the bath is large enough or you're soaking in a warm pool, try to stretch while in the water.

, The chairs and bed on which you rest should support your spine. The pillows on your back should be high and full enough that they support your neck. Your ear, neck, and hip should form a straight line while you're laying on the pillows. Make sure your mattress is firm enough to support your back comfortably. If it doesn't, purchase a new mattress that provides good support or slide a thin sheet of plywood between the mattress and box springs.If you spend a lot of time in an office chair or at a desk, choose an ergonomic chair or tuck rolled up towels behind your lower back to support your spine.

, If you're still feeling back pain after two or three days of trying to reduce pain, call your doctor for advice. Your doctor may prescribe more powerful pain relievers or refer you to a physical therapist for treatments. You should also see a doctor if you have:Numbness or tingling
Severe pain even after resting
Pain plus: trouble urinating, weakness, numbness in the legs, fever, or weight loss (when not dieting)

, While more specific research is needed, studies suggest that regular massage therapy can reduce chronic lower back pain that you might experience as you age. Back massages combined with exercise and education were even more effective at reducing chronic lower-back pain.Check with your insurance company to see if massage therapy is covered. Massage therapy has been shown to improve your mood, reduce muscle tension, and help your muscles heal., Acupuncture is part of Traditional Chinese medicine. It involves inserting thin needles into the surface of the skin. A trained acupuncturist will insert the needles into key energy points in your body (especially your back) to relieve pain. Research suggests that acupuncture is effective at reducing pain for elderly back-pain sufferers.Studies on patients that have low-back pain disabilities found that acupuncture was effective at reducing pain and increasing mobility., Physical therapists use massage, manual manipulation, electromagnetic therapy as well as strengthening exercises and education on proper body mechanics to help relieve and prevent back pain. Your doctor can give you a recommendation for a physical therapist who can help you., If you've seen your doctor and tried prescription-strength pain relief with no luck, your doctor may recommend getting injections. Epidural steroid injections insert anti-inflammatory medication into a space around your spinal cord. This is an out-patient procedure and you'll need to rest for the remainder of the day.You may feel worse for two or three days after getting the injection. You'll begin feeling the pain relief around three days after getting the injection.
Injections will give pain relief for several weeks or months before wearing off.
Two injections are typically given, spaced three to four weeks apart, with a third given if relief is only partial from the two initial injections.

, Chiropractors are health care professionals who specialize in caring for the back and spine. During a back adjustment, the chiropractor will manipulate the vertebrae that make up your spine. Getting regular chiropractic care can increase your range of motion and reduce inflammation that causes your back pain.You may experience some soreness or aching immediately after your adjustment. This should go away within a day and is completely normal.

, If medications, therapies, or injections don't work, you may want to get back surgery. This is a last resort measure, because the outcome is uncertain and your back pain can become worse. You'll need to work with your doctor, chiropractor, and surgeon to determine the cause of your back pain before talking about what types of surgeries are available to treat you.People with back pain caused by aging often find that back pain worsens very slowly over several years. You should see a surgeon if you're having trouble functioning because your back is causing you pain or you can no longer walk easily.

, Drink six to eight 8-ounce glasses of water every day to prevent damage to the discs of your back. The discs between your vertebrae are largely made up of water, so being well-hydrated can reduce tearing and prevent pain. Drinking water will also help keep your joints lubricated and prevent stiffness.You can also drink juices, herbal teas, and milk. Remember that fruits and vegetables also contain water which can contribute to your overall hydration.

, Eat a healthy diet full of fresh fruits, vegetables and whole grains so that you can maintain a healthy weight. Foods that can fight pain include red grapes, ginger, soy, cherries, and salmon.If you're overweight or obese, try to lose weight since the heavier you are, the more strain there is on your back. Over time, this excess weight can cause back pain.Avoid smoking, tobacco products and alcohol. These are associated with back injuries and can prevent your back from healing itself quickly., You can reduce the pressure on your back by practicing correct posture. This will also distribute your body weight equally which can prevent back pain over time. Stand or sit so that the vertebrae of your spine are always aligned. Avoid slouching forward or slumping over which can cause strain to your back.You should also protect your back by practicing proper lifting techniques. To lift correctly, bend over and hug the item you want to lift. Use your legs and stand up, rather than lifting from your back.

, You can manage back pain by keeping the muscles of your back strong. If you're feeling severe pain, lay on your back and bring your knees to your chest or twist your knee over your leg while keeping your back straight. You can also do yoga poses that stretch and relax the back. Try:Child's pose
Cobra pose
King pigeon pose

, Be careful when twisting or stretching while exercising. Spend some of your exercise time slowly bending from front to back and from side to side. Exercise can reduce back pain because it increases blood flow to the area. Try to do any exercise that you can comfortably do, even if it is vigorous. Talk with your doctor or physical therapist about creating an exercise program tailored to your back needs.Good low-impact exercises for back pain include walking, swimming, hamstring stretches and stationary bicycling."

Check the padding of the seat.,
Consider if you can tilt the seat of the chair.,
Try out chairs in person.,
Consider the details of the chair.,
Think about different chair styles.",How to Choose an Ergonomic Office Chair," The height of your ergonomic chair should be fully adjustable. The chair's seat should be easy to move either upwards or downwards. This adjustment will allow for people of different heights to comfortably sit in the chair. Make sure you can adjust how high or low the the seat is before purchasing your chair.A seat height of 15” to 22” will comfortably seat a person between 5'0"" to 6'4"" tall.
Most chairs will offer only a small range of adjustment.
Your feet should be able to sit flat on the floor while your knees are bent at ninety degree angles.;
, Before you select an ergonomic chair, you'll want to think of who will be using the chair. The chair will need to comfortably fit anyone who will sit in it or be able to be adjusted to fit them. Make sure your chair is a good fit for anyone in your office before making a purchase.The chair you are interested in should comfortably fit the person it is intended for.
Many ergonomic chairs will be adjustable enough to accommodate most anyone.

, A good ergonomic chair will allow you to adjust each part of the chair by itself. You should be able to move the armrests, seat and back supports independently of each other. This level of customization will allow you to make the chair a good fit for anyone that might end up using it.You may want to avoid chairs that don't allow for adjustments.
Generally, you will want to select chairs that have a large number of adjustable features.

, Proper ergonomic chairs will offer full upper and middle back support. If you are going to be sitting for a long period of time, supporting your back and its natural shape will be important in preventing injury or strain. Make sure your ergonomic chair has excellent upper and middle back support before making a purchase.The backrest should be between 12” and 19” wide.
Your chair's backrest should support the natural curve and shape of your back.
Most backrests will be adjustable to support the contours of your back.

, Chairs without proper lumbar support will have a damaging and flattening effect on your lower back. The lower back has a natural inward curve and poorly designed chairs will cause this curve to straighten out. Make sure your chair helps you maintain your lower back's normal curvature to help your back stay strong and healthy.Lumbar support can be adjusted by raising or lowering the chair's back support pad.
Chairs that have an unadjustable back won't be a good fit for everyone.

, Being able to recline or adjust the back of your chair will affect the amount of weight placed on your lower back. If you are planning on being seated for a majority of the day, reclining can help relieve pressure on your spinal discs and lower back muscles.Avoid buying an ergonomic chair that can't recline.
Most chairs can be locked into the most comfortable reclined position you find.
Back pressure is lowest between 110° and 130° of reclining.
People with lower back injuries can benefit the most from reclining chairs.

, Seats that are too big or too small can affect your comfort and health when using them for long periods of time. When you are searching for a good ergonomic chair, you'll want to make sure that the seat is right size for you or anyone using it. Keep some of these criteria in mind when judging the seat size of an ergonomic chair:The seat should be about an inch wider than your hips.
The seat pan should be positioned just behind your knees.

, You will likely be spending a large amount of time seated in your ergonomic chair. Because of this, you'll want to make sure that your chair is properly and adequately padded to help ensure comfort and ergonomic support. Make sure the chair's seat is made of high quality foam before making a purchase.Low quality foam can break down quickly, causing your chair to become uncomfortable.
You should be able sit comfortably in the chair for at least an hour.
Improperly padded chair seats can cause misalignments in the hips and back issues.

, Although the ability to tilt the chair's seat is often optional, you may still want to have this feature included in your chair. Tilting the chair seat can help you maintain proper posture when sitting in the chair. If you think the ability to tilt your chair's seat would help you sit more comfortably, check to see if your ergonomic chair has this capability., Although you can learn a lot about a chair from reading its specifications, it's still a good idea to try a chair out in person. By sitting in a chair, you will be able to directly feel how comfortable it is and learn if it can be properly adjusted to your needs. Whenever possible, try to examine an ergonomic chair in person to make sure it's the one for you.

, There are many features to consider when looking for the perfect ergonomic chair. Because there is so much to consider, some aspects of the chair may get overlooked. Think about some of the following parts of the chair you are looking at to help you finalize your choice:Chair bases should have five spokes.
The chair's casters should move easily and freely.
If the chair comes with a headrest, make sure it's a good fit for your body type.
You may need a foot rest if the chair's height is too high and cannot be adjusted.
You'll want to think about which chair covering is best. Vinyl coverings can be easy to clean but don't breathe well. Cloth seat covers can allow for airflow but may be tougher to keep clean.

, There are many different types and styles of ergonomic chairs available. These chairs will differ from the traditional style of chair and each will have its own unique benefit and purpose. Take a look at some of these unique styles of ergonomic chairs to learn if one of them might be a good fit for your needs.Kneeling chairs have no back and can help you to improve your posture and back health.
Saddle chairs are good choices for computer or desk work. They are shaped like a horse saddle and can help make your back stronger and healthier.
Exercise balls can help keep you moving and actively require you to stay balanced.
For people with back issues, reclining chairs with footrests can be the most comfortable choice.

Get an elliptical trainer.,
Try a treadmill.,
Consider a recumbent bike.,
Look into rowing machines.",How to Choose Exercise Machines for Chronic Hip Pain2," Elliptical trainers provide a low impact workout that is gentle on the joints, so this might be a good choice if you suffer from chronic hip pain.Just make sure that when you use the machine, you set it to a low resistance.


If the machine has an incline option, then set the incline to a low level as well.
You can also try using the machine with your hands on the moving handles and on the stationary handles to see which works better for you.

, Treadmills allow you to walk at a comfortable pace and on a level surface, which is better for hip pain. You can even find treadmills that have joint-friendly surfaces. Some other things to consider when looking at treadmills include:Safety features, such as side rails and an emergency stop button.

Consider your current activity level.,
Be wary of ads.,
Find out if you can try the machine before you buy.,
Calculate the price.",How to Choose Exercise Machines for Chronic Hip Pain3," If you already exercise, such as by going to a gym or taking walks, then you will probably be more likely to use an exercise machine at home; however, if you rarely exercise, then having an exercise machine at home may not change that.Take an honest look at your current activity level to determine if you will actually use the machine. If you are currently sedentary, then you might want to develop an exercise program for yourself first.
For example, you could start taking a 30 minute walk after dinner every night or do low-impact aerobics at home using a video.
Try to work your way up to the recommended 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise each week. An easy way to break this up is to do 30 minutes of exercise five days a week.

, Advertisements for exercise machines may make some convincing claims about the product; however, it is important to remind yourself that these claims are meant to sell you the product and should not be considered guarantees. Some this to be wary of include:Claims that the product is easy to use. Exercise is challenging no matter what. There is no easy, sweat-free way to get into shape.

Claims that the product will target one area. It is not possible to burn fat and lose weight in just one part of your body. Losing weight requires burning more calories and this will result in overall body weight reduction.

Before and after photos and testimonials. Avoid relying on these as your only proof that the product is effective. Read reviews to find out what people who have bought this machine have to say about it. Try to seek out reviews on sites that are not affiliated with the product, such as 3rd party online retail sites.

, Trying the machine before you buy it may be a good idea, especially if the machine is expensive. You might be able to try out the machine in a store, at a local gym, or at a community center.You might also ask about refund options for the machine. For example, can you return the machine if you are not satisfied with it? If so, how long do you have to return it? Will you get a full or partial refund?

, Even if a machine has a low cost payment plan, exercise machines can cost thousands of dollars by the time it is paid for. You may also have an increased electricity bill from using the machine. Take some time to calculate the total cost of the machine you are thinking about buying.You might compare the cost of buying a machine with the cost of joining a gym. For example, if you will be paying $150 per month for the next two years to pay off a top of the line treadmill, and a gym membership costs only $40 per month, then you would save a lot of money by joining the gym.

Check your policy to see if it covers rehab.,
Talk to your insurance provider.,
Learn about dual diagnosis options.,
Contact the rehab center.",How to Afford Rehab1," Because of the Affordable Care Act, many more insurance programs, including those provided by Medicaid, are required to provide at least partial coverage for substance abuse;however, the amount of coverage will vary from provider to provider, and from state to state, because of state regulations. , You can check your provider’s website if you have a personal login for them (plans differ from person to person, and from group to group, so it’s important that you see you individualized plan information). Otherwise you can call your insurance provider to find out your deductible and copays.Some companies, such as Blue Cross Blue Shield, may require that you go through pre-certification before you can go through in-patient rehab.Others such as Health Partners requires a medical recommendation for in-patient rehab, a diagnosis based on the DSM-5 (you can can visit a psychologist or psychiatrist to obtain a diagnosis), and as well as a number of other requirements. Check with your insurance provider for more information., If you are struggling with addiction and a mental health issue, you may be able to get coverage for both, which would save you money.

, Just as with doctors and clinics, not all rehab facilities accept all types of insurance. There are some that won’t accept Medicaid, and some that only accept one or two types of private insurance, but they might offer payment plans in addition to or in lieu of accepting insurance. You may be able to pay as you go. Ask the rehab facility if this is a possibility for outpatient rehab.You can call them and ask, ""What insurance do you accept?"", ""Do you accept Medicaid?"" and ""Do you offer any payment plans or pay-as-you-go options?""

Apply for a loan.,
Ask friends and family to contribute.,
Apply for any government grant or scholarship in your area.Some government grants, like the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant, have specific requirements, like having a dependent child or being pregnant, so research them before you apply.,
Sell your assets.",How to Afford Rehab2," Applying for a loan before you approach a treatment facility can help you get a better deal for rehab. Some treatment centers demand proof of ability to pay before they will admit you, so having the funds ready will help the process along.Some facilities work with certain lenders to help provide financing, so talking to them is important. As with any loan, you will need to provide credit and income information.Alternatively, if you are a homeowner, you can apply for a home equity loan, which means borrowing against the value of your house., This can be hard emotionally, especially for someone struggling with addiction. Before asking, make sure you’ve done your research so you can state a good approximation of what you need. If you are really broke and will be unlikely to pay it back any time in the near future, be honest about this and tell them about your need. If your friends and family are invested in your recovery, they will likely want to help in any way they can.If you don’t feel comfortable asking for money outright, it might be in your best interest to ask for a loan from family or friends. They may be willing to loan you money if they know you want to recover from addiction, and they may be more comfortable lending than giving money.If asking for a loan, make sure you explain how and when you’ll pay them back, and make sure you know how much you need before you ask.When asking for money or a loan for rehab, ask your friends and family, ""Would it be possible to get a loan for rehab?"" Be prepared to answer their questions., Grants and scholarships are more helpful than loans because you do not need to pay them back.Some nonprofit organizations, such as the Sobriety Optimization League, even provide scholarships for people seeking recovery.Some grants are only for the organizations and rehab facilities. Don't apply to these as an individual., Identify any items of value you own. You can make a list of any antiques you own, high-quality jewelry, and other valuable items. Of course, you may want to consult your family before selling a family heirloom — they may be willing to buy it or loan you the money in lieu of you selling it. If you are unsure of an item’s worth, you should consult an expert.You should make sure the items you want to sell are clean and in good repair. Cleaning what you can for free is the best way to get the best price for your items. This is true for most items; however, some items such as antiques or collectibles lose value when they are cleaned.A car should be tuned up and clean, inside and out, before you sell it. This means making sure it is up to date on oil changes, etc., and perhaps even going to a detailing service.To determine an item's worth, you can appraise it with someone qualified to do so or check online at websites such as eBay or Amazon Marketplace. If you think a piece of jewelry may be worth thousands of dollars, it may be worthwhile to get it appraised."

You can usually find this information on the center’s website, but you may need to call if the website is not very informative., Questions to ask: Is the facility clean? How many people sleep to a room? What treatment plans does the facility typically offer?You may want to ask your doctor for advice about facilities in the area.While you cannot always take tours of facilities before going to rehab, it is always best to check. Simply ask, ""Do you allow tours of your facilities before choosing a rehab center?"" If not, you can look for online reviews of facilities via Google or any other review website such as TheFix.com."

See your doctor.,
Investigate hormones as a potential cause.,
Ask your doctor about side effects of medication.,
Ask your doctor if you could be experiencing heart failure or kidney failure.",How to Treat Fluid Retention1," The first thing you should do if you are retaining fluid is to see your doctor. Your doctor can perform a physical exam and tests to determine the cause of your fluid retention. There are many different conditions that can cause fluid retention including:A heart condition, such as heart failure or cardiomyopathy
Kidney failure
Underactive thyroid
Cirrhosis of the liver
An issue with your lymphatic system
Deep vein thrombosis
Excess fat in your legs
A burn or other type of injury
Pregnancy
Being overweight
Being undernourished;
, For women, it’s not uncommon to experience some water retention in the days leading up to your period, due to hormonal shifts within the body.Birth-control medication can also cause fluid retention. So can any other type of medical hormonal treatment, including hormone replacement therapy.

If you’re experiencing fluid retention leading up to your period, the retention will likely end shortly after your cycle has concluded.
However, if the retention is uncomfortable or persistent, a doctor may prescribe you a diuretic. This pill will increase water processing through your body and let you pee out the fluid that you’ve retained., If your diet is healthy and you do not lead a sedentary lifestyle, your fluid retention could be a side effect of one or more medications you’re currently taking. If your body continues to retain fluid for more than a few days, schedule an appointment and speak with your doctor regarding ways to reduce fluid retention as a medication side effect.Medications most likely to cause water retention include:

Antidepressants
Chemo therapy medicine
Some pain relievers
High blood pressure medications

, Both of these serious medical conditions can cause the body to retain fluid.In these cases, fluid retention is sudden and severe: you’ll notice a palpable, rapid change and a large amount of fluid being retained, especially in the lower portion of your body.

If you’re concerned about heart failure or kidney disease, contact your doctor as soon as possible. These are potentially life-threatening conditions, and the sooner a doctor can diagnose heart failure or kidney disease, the more effectively they can be treated.

Walk and move around through the day.,
Elevate and compress swollen extremities.,
Wear compression stockings.",How to Treat Fluid Retention2," For individuals who lead a largely sedentary lifestyle, or anyone who works at a job which requires them to remain seated for multiple hours, gravity can draw fluids into the lower extremities of your body. This can lead to water retention in your feet, ankles, and legs. Avoid this by walking frequently throughout the day. Keep your blood circulating, and your lower extremities will not retain water.This also occurs during long plane rides, during which passengers remain immobile for many hours.
If you’re on an international flight, plan to stand up and stretch or walk around at least a few times.

, If you’re concerned that you may be retaining water in your feet, ankles, and lower legs, you can elevate the swollen parts of your body. This will let gravity drain some of the retained fluid from your feet and allow fluid to distribute through your body.For example, if your feet are swollen in the evening, recline on a sofa or bed with your feet on a pillow.

, If you find that your feet and ankles regularly retain fluid while you are sitting down or standing—for example, at work—you can purchase a pair of compression support stockings. These exert pressure on your feet and lower legs, and don’t allow fluid to build up in these areas.Support socks or tights are relatively common. You should be able to purchase a pair at your local drug store.

Prepare garlic for cooking.,
Cook the garlic over low heat.,
Consider adding raw, completely crushed garlic to foods after cooking.",How to Use Garlic Against Stress and Toxins for a Better Mood1," Remove the skin by first placing the bulb on a cutting board or hard surface. Then gently, but firmly, apply pressure with the palm of your hand at about a 20 – 30 angle. This will cause the layers of skin that hold the bulb together to separate. Garlic cloves are best either chopped or crushed and then allowed to sit for 10 – 15 minutes to allow for the activation of the allicin in the garlic. You can use a garlic crusher or the side of a large knife to crush the garlic.


Always buy fresh garlic to use in food.
Garlic added to food can relieve nasal congestion when taken daily.;
, To maximize garlic’s effects, use it as close to raw as possible. If nearly raw garlic is “too much” for you, add the garlic near the end of the meal’s cooking time. Don’t overcook the garlic, because it loses some of its potency with high and prolonged heat. Add it to sauces, rub it over meats and poultry, or add it to vegetables, mixing it in well.


Garlic can be added to taste to just about any meal. In food, it is safe for children and pregnant or nursing women.Avoid high-temperature stir frying of garlic.Don’t use a microwave when cooking with garlic. This reduces the allicin produced.For a quick meal sauté garlic with vegetables. For example, sauté some fresh spinach and add the crushed garlic when the spinach is nearly done. Remove from heat and sprinkle lemon juice over the spinach-garlic mixture.
You can add a variety of leafy greens in addition to spinach.

See your dentist, who may prescribe physical therapy exercises.,
Avoid motions or activities that cause pain to your jaw.This may sound obvious, but avoiding triggers for your jaw pain, such as chewing gum, yawning, or even singing, can help to prevent worsening of the pain.,
Focus on good posture.Especially for those who work at a computer all day, getting up to move around and changing posture frequently is important.,
Apply heat to relax your jaw muscles.,
Use ice packs to help relieve pain.Applying ice packs can reduce the inflammation and pain by constricting the blood vessels around your TMJ.,
Massage your jaw area to relax your muscles.,
Get physically active.If you don't already exercise regularly, now may be a good time to start!",How to Treat TMJ Problems Without Surgery1," There are a variety of exercises that can be used in the treatment of TMJ problems. The main aim of these exercises is to make use of your jaw muscles and to increase the jaw's mobility without fear of pain.Most exercises are focused on relaxing the muscles of your neck, your shoulders, and your jaw. Tension in any of these can worsen TMJ pain.
If your dentist identifies ""trigger points"" for your TMJ pain (trigger points are areas of muscle that are prone to causing you pain), she may recommend that you see a massage therapist for help in loosening these muscles.;
, Also, eating softer foods can help, as this decreases the stress and strain of chewing.


Pencil biting, pipe smoking and other repetitive movements and positions (such as with playing certain instruments like the violin or viola) are also thought to be associated with TMJ.
Opt for foods such as oatmeal, eggs, mashed potatoes, soups, and other options that are gentle on your jaw in order to decrease the pain.

, TMJ problems can be worsened by tense neck and shoulder muscles, which happens frequently to those who are poised over a computer keyboard all day.


If at all possible, break up your workday by scheduling in a walk or other activity every couple of hours. This will give your neck and shoulder muscles a chance to relax, and may help to ease the discomfort in your TMJ.
In addition, pay attention to sleeping positions. Sleeping on your side or stomach may put pressure on your jaw, exacerbating TMJ pain. Try to sleep on your back instead, and don't elevate your head too much., Applying heat can increase the blood flow to your jaw muscles and help to relax them. Start by taking a warm, moist towel and place it on the side of your jaw. Apply the towel for five minutes or until you feel increased comfort.You can apply this warm, moist towel four to five times in a day.
This procedure can help relieve discomfort and increase jaw flexibility.

, Use a cold pack, take a plastic bag and fill it with ice cubes, or simply keep a towel in your freezer and apply it on your jaw and face. Apply it for 10 minutes each time, four to five times per day.


Always wrap cold packs in a towel before applying them to your skin. Putting ice or a cold pack directly on your skin can cause frostbite.

, Give yourself a gentle massage with your fingertips to relax your jaw muscles and to provide relief from muscle tightness. Take two fingers and apply firm pressure with your fingertips over your jaw area. Move your fingertips over the jaw areas in perpendicular and small sweeping motions.You can do this gentle massage for one to two minutes initially, and then three to five minutes on each side of your jaw.
Always be gentle to avoid further problems and pain.

, Exercise produces endorphins, which are natural pain-killing chemicals in the brain. As a result, maintaining a healthy exercise regime can help to combat the pain in your jaw. A general guideline to follow is to do moderate-intensity aerobic exercise for 30 minutes at least five times per week, or 150 minutes total. Ideally, you want to choose sports that elevate your heart rate such as swimming, biking, speed walking, or running.


In addition to aerobic exercise, try to incorporate two to three days of strength training, which will build muscle and improve bone density.

Take dried garlic as a supplement.,
Take a garlic tincture.,
Add garlic to preparations to ease coughs and sore throats.,
Talk to a qualified healthcare professional before beginning any supplementation.",How to Use Garlic Against Stress and Toxins for a Better Mood3," No standards have been developed for children, but to treat a type of high blood lipid disorder, 300 mg of dehydrated garlic powder three times a day was safely taken by children.


2 – 7 gm of aged garlic extracts should be taken daily in divided doses. An example of this is the product Kyolic. Aged garlic contains some allicin (the “active” component of garlic), but not as much as other products. This is why you need to take much more of it.
Dried garlic powder, such as Kwai and Garlicin, has not been well-standardized and does not contain a great deal of allicin, though some may be produced after digestion. Most of the clinical studies have been done using Kwai with dosages ranging from 600 – 1,200 mg daily in divided doses.
Allicin powdered extract, such as Allisure, Allimax, Alliforce and Alli-C, are powdered extracts that contain significant amounts of allicin in a standardized form. Because of this standardization and the higher amounts of allicin in these products, you don’t have to take much to get the benefits. Take 6 – 10 mg daily.
6 – 900 mg of garlic tablets or capsules should be taken daily in divided doses. These are generally the best choice for most people, as they provide a standardized or known amount of the active ingredient (allicin).

, 2 – 4 ml of tincture (extracts in alcohol) should be taken daily. Tinctures will only contain a small amount of allicin but can be a good alternative for those that don't like garlic in their food.


Do not use tinctures if you are in recovery from alcoholism. Tinctures use 95% alcohol to extract herbs.
Garlic oil does not contain allicin because of the processing necessary to produce the oil
Some products may indicate on the label an “Allicin potential”or “Allicin yield.” This is an attempt to standardize, but studies have indicated that this value is not exact or stable.

, Raw garlic can be added to a number of homemade remedies to reduce the severity of throat infections and coughs. For example, make a throat gargle by pouring 1 cup (237 mL) of boiled water over two chopped garlic cloves. Allow to steep for three hours, then strain and gargle.For a cough, peel and crush two garlic bulbs and leave exposed for 15 minutes (this allows allicin to form). Crush in a mortar and pestle after the quarter hour has passed and stir into a small pot of runny honey. Allow to infuse overnight. One teaspoon of this mixture can be taken for coughs, colds, and sore throats when needed.Be sure to label the honey for clarity of contents and purpose.

, Garlic can interact with a number of prescription medications including blood pressure medicines (these include nifedipine (Adalat, Procardia), verapamil (Calan, Isoptin, Verelan), diltiazem (Cardizem), isradipine (DynaCirc), felodipine (Plendil), amlodipine (Norvasc), and others); oral contraceptives; anticoagulants (blood thinners) like warfarin (coumadin); various other medications. Talk to your physician about the medications you take and if garlic could interfere with these. Since garlic can increase bleeding, it should be discontinued one to two weeks before surgery.

Take over-the-counter painkillers to reduce mild to moderate inflammation and pain.,
Use muscle relaxants to relax your jaw muscles.,
Try taking tricyclic antidepressants.,
Take corticosteroids to reduce severe inflammation.,
Get an occlusal splint from your dentist to prevent teeth grinding and clenching.,
Have crowns and bridges put on to correct and adjust your bite.,
Look into osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) to relax your jaw muscles and ligaments.,
Try TENS (Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation).",How to Treat TMJ Problems Without Surgery2," Using over-the-counter painkillers can inhibit the production of prostaglandin, the substance responsible for pain and inflammation in your body. Do not take these drugs continuously for longer than 10 to 14 days. Any of the following can be tried for pain control:Naproxen (275-500 mg twice a day). Naproxen works by inhibiting the release of inflammatory substances, COX-1 and COX-2. This is the medication of choice for treating joint inflammation, because it has been proven to be effective in joint diseases.
Ibuprofen (200-800 mg every six hours). Ibuprofen provides fast-acting pain and inflammation relief when taken in liquid gel form.
Acetaminophen (500-1000 mg every four to six hours). This does not help with inflammation, but can serve to combat pain.

, These are available over-the-counter or by prescription. Your best bet is to speak to your dentist if simple over-the-counter painkillers have not been sufficient to control your pain. Your dentist can then advise you on which type of muscle relaxant is most effective, or he can recommend another treatment altogether depending upon the nature and severity of your TMJ pain.A short-term course of long acting benzodiazepines, such as Valium, can be used to treat severe acute TMJ symptoms.

, These drugs, in low dosages, can help to relieve TMJ-related pain. An example of this medication is amitriptyline (Elavil). Start from a low dose of 10 milligrams, to avoid side effects. The dosage can be increased over time until the pain is relieved.For patients who also experience anxiety and/or depression, treating the condition with methods such as medication or relaxation/stress management training can also be helpful for TMJ pain.
Tricyclic antidepressants are generally considered after lifestyle changes, NSAIDs and muscle relaxers have shown to not be effective.
Once the effective dose of the tricyclic has been determined, it is generally prescribed for up to four months and then tapered down to a lower dose.

, Corticosteroids mimic your body's natural adrenal production, causing a reduction in inflammation and pain due to TMJ. Steroids are used when other treatments for TMJ have failed to relieve your pain and discomfort. Your dentist can inject the corticosteroids into your TMJ joint, to help relieve severe pain.

, If you have the habit of clenching your jaws and grinding your teeth, your dentist can take a teeth impression and make acrylic splints to fit on your upper and lower teeth. TMJ is weakly associated with teeth grinding (bruxism).These splints help reduce your clenching and grinding habits by preventing the teeth from contacting each other.


The shape of the splints also helps to keep your teeth in their appropriate positions and to correct bad bites.
You can wear the occlusal splints throughout the day, except when you are eating.
You can use night guards that are similar to splints during the night if you have a habit of grinding your teeth.
Your dentist will advise you on the exact splints or mouth guards that will suit your TMJ problems.
Using a splint in addition to making lifestyle changes is more effective in treating TMJ pain than using the splint alone.

, Replacing missing teeth by applying crowns, bridges, and grinding uneven surfaces helps to distribute the biting and chewing forces equally between all your teeth surfaces; however, correction and adjustment rarely provides full relief from TMJ problems., In osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT), your dentist uses special forceps placed in between your upper and lower teeth to gently open your mouth. The mouth is gradually opened more and more on each visit. With the help of OMT, your ability to open your mouth will improve, even without muscle relaxants.

, In TENS, a current or pulse of electricity is applied by a device to stimulate your nerves and contracted muscles. This stimulation makes the muscles contract and relax, almost as if they were massaging themselves. TENS also stimulates the production of endorphins, which are natural pain-relieving agents. It is a non-invasive method, and 30 – 60 minutes in each session of TENS normally provides a good result.

Understand the causes of hepatitis B so that you can seek treatment immediately if you have been exposed.,
Obtain preventative care if you believe you have been exposed.,
Look for the symptoms of a hepatitis B infection.,
See a gastroenterologist or an infectious disease expert to be tested for hepatitis B.,
Treat acute hepatitis B.,
Determine whether you need to begin treatment for chronic hepatitis B.,
Discuss your treatment options with your doctor.,
Discuss a liver transplant if your liver is severely damaged and in danger of failing.,
Understand the limits of the treatments.,
Take steps to avoid transmitting the disease to others.,
Avoid ingesting substances that may further damage or burden your liver.,
Maintain your social support network.",How to Treat Hepatitis B," The hepatitis B virus is transmitted through blood, saliva, semen, or other bodily fluids. Common causes of transmission include:Sexual contact with an infected partner. Transmission can occur via blood, semen, vaginal secretions, and saliva.
Transmission through infected needles. This includes people who may be sharing needles for intravenous drug use and it includes health care workers who may be at risk of accidental needle sticks.
Transmission during childbirth. If the mother is infected, she may transmit it to her infant during birth. However, if the mother knows that she is infected, the infant can be vaccinated upon birth.;
, If you think you may have been exposed to hepatitis B, see a doctor immediately. If you receive care within 12 hours, it may prevent the infection. You doctor will likely do the following:Give you an injection of hepatitis B immune globulin to boost your immune response
Vaccinate you against hepatitis B

, Symptoms usually start one to four months after the initial exposure. Symptoms may include:Abdominal pain
Dark urine
Fever
Joint pain
Not being hungry
Vomiting and nausea
Feeling weak and tired
Jaundice (your skin and the whites of your eyes turn yellowish)

, The doctor may do several tests.The doctor will confirm the presence of the virus with a blood test and whether it is acute or chronic.
The doctor might also do a liver biopsy to see if you have liver damage. This involves removing a very small piece of liver tissue through a thin needle and analyzing the tissue in the lab.

, Most cases of hepatitis B are acute. Acute cases of hepatitis B, contrary to what the name might suggest, are infections that will go away on their own. 95% of cases will clear on their own and the illness illness typically goes away within a few weeks and liver function is normal within six months. Treatment is usually not indicated in the acute stage.


Get plenty of bed rest, drink lots of fluids, and stick with healthy foods. This will help your body clear the virus efficiently.If you are in pain, discuss what painkillers your doctor recommends, even for over the counter medications (acetaminophen, aspirin, or ibuprofen) or herbal supplements. You don’t want to take anything that will be hard on your liver.Schedule follow-up blood tests with your doctor to track the natural course of the infection. These blood tests will help your doctor determine whether the virus is being cleared.
If your liver is becoming damaged, your doctor may recommend lamivudine (Epivir)., If your body has not cleared the virus within a few months, you may have chronic hepatitis B. Your doctor is likely to prescribe medications if you show the following symptoms:High virus levels in your blood
Decreasing liver function
Signs of long-term liver damage and scarring (cirrhosis)

, There are several possibilities depending upon your age and circumstances.Antiviral medications can reduce the viral load in your body. Possibilities include lamivudine (Epivir), adefovir (Hepsera), telbivudine (Tyzeka) and entecavir (Baraclude). These medications will slow the progression of the disease and decrease your chances of sustaining liver damage.Interferon-alpha is a medication which contains a synthetic version of the protein your body makes to fight the virus. This option is often given to younger people who may want to become pregnant in the next few years and do not want to have a long treatment process. However, it has significant side effects including depression, anxiety, flu-like symptoms, breathing problems, a tight feeling in the chest, and hair loss.Nucleoside/nucleotide analogues are substances that prevent the virus from replicating. Some well known ones include adefovir (Hepsera), entecavir (Baraclude), lamivudine (Epivir-HBV, Heptovir, Heptodin), telbivudine (Tyzeka) and tenofovir (Viread). However, these medications have a serious drawback in that the virus may mutate and develop resistance to these drugs after several years of use., If necessary a surgeon can remove your liver and replace it with a healthy one.


Sometimes a piece of a healthy liver from a living donor may be used.

, Even though medications can reduce the number of viruses in the blood to nearly zero, low numbers of the virus still live in the liver and elsewhere.Monitor yourself for resurgences of the disease and if you feel the symptoms returning, go to the doctor immediately.
Ask your doctor what he or she recommends for long-term follow up.

, It won’t spread through casual contact, but it could through the exchange of bodily fluids.Be open with your partner and encourage him or her to get tested and vaccinated.
Use a condom during sex to reduce the risk of transmission.
Don’t share needles, syringes, razors or toothbrushes, all of which could have small amounts of infected blood on them.

, This includes alcohol, recreational drugs, and over the counter drugs or supplements.Alcohol itself can damage the liver, so you should abstain from drinking alcohol to protect your liver while your body fights the infection.
Avoid recreational drugs which may cause liver damage.
Ask your doctor which over the counter medications you can take for mild conditions like a cold, flu, or headache. Even over the counter medications may burden your liver when it is in a damaged or vulnerable state.

, You will not infect friends through casual contact and the social support is important for your psychological and physical health.


Seek out support groups for people with liver disease.Remind yourself that with appropriate treatment and monitoring, the prognosis for people with hepatitis B is usually very good.

Increase your iron intake.,
Take vitamin B12.,
Get more folate (folic acid).,
Limit your alcohol intake.",How to Treat Anemia1," If you take an iron supplement as directed by your doctor, you should be able to improve your iron levels over time, which may treat anemia caused by iron deficiency. There are some side effects from iron supplementation, including dark stools, stomach upset, heartburn, and constipation. If your anemia is mild, your doctor may just recommend that you eat more iron-rich foods. The following are good sources of iron:Red meat (beef and liver)
Poultry (chicken and turkey)
Seafood
Cereals and breads fortified with iron
Legumes (peas; lentils; white, red, and baked beans; soybeans; and chickpeas)
Tofu
Dried fruits (prunes, raisins, and apricots)
Spinach and other dark green leafy vegetables
Prune juice
Vitamin C helps your body absorb iron, so your doctor will likely recommend that you drink a glass of orange juice or consume foods high in vitamin C along with your iron supplement.;
, If your anemia is caused by a vitamin deficiency, take a vitamin B12 supplement if your doctor recommends it. Most likely, your doctor will give you a vitamin B12 injection or pill once a month.This will allow your doctor to monitor your red blood levels and determine how long treatment is needed. You can also get vitamin B12 from food. Foods high in vitamin B12 include:Eggs
Milk
Cheese
Meat
Fish
Shellfish
Poultry
Foods fortified with vitamin B12 (like soy beverages and vegetarian burgers), Folic acid is another B vitamin that is needed for proper blood cell growth. A folate deficiency can cause anemia, so your doctor will most likely recommend a supplement dosage to treat your condition. If your symptoms are moderate to severe, you may be given folate injections or pills for at least 2 to 3 months.You can also get folate from your diet. Foods with high levels of folic acid include:Bread, pasta, and rice fortified with folic acid
Spinach and other dark green leafy vegetables
Black-eyed peas and dried beans
Beef liver
Eggs
Bananas, oranges, orange juice, and some other fruits and juices

, Alcohol can keep your body from producing blood cells, create defective red blood cells, and prematurely destroy your blood cells. While an occasional drink won't do any lasting damage, repeated or heavy drinking can cause anemia.If you're already anemic, take care to limit your alcoholic intake, since it will only make your condition worse.
The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism recommends no more than 1 drink per day for women and no more than 2 drinks per day for men as ""moderate"" consumption."

Recognize gastritis.,
Go to the doctor if you think you may have gastritis.,
Discuss your medical history with your doctor.,
Get additional tests if your doctor recommends it.",How to Relieve Symptoms of Gastritis1," Gastritis is a general medical term that can refer to many different diseases, such as dyspepsia (indigestion), peptic ulcer disease caused by H. pylori, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Not everyone has symptoms when they have gastritis. However, you may have gastritis if you suffer from the following symptoms:A burning pain in your stomach. It may improve or worsen when you eat.
An aching feeling in your stomach.
Nausea or vomiting
Abdominal discomfort
Early satiety (feeling full after only a little bit of food)
Bloating;
, Get medical attention if you suffer from gastritis for longer than a week.Go to the doctor immediately if you are vomiting blood, have streaks of fresh red blood in your stool, or black tarry stools.
Go to the doctor immediately if you experience weight loss, painful swallowing, and bloody vomiting. You may need an EGD test.
If you use prescription or over-the-counter painkillers, particularly those with aspirin, be sure to tell your doctor. Some painkillers may cause gastritis.

, This may help your doctor determine whether you are likely to be vulnerable to gastritis. Risk factors include:An infection with ""Helicobacter pylori"". Not all people who have this bacteria develop gastritis.
Regular use of over-the-counter painkillers including aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, etc.), or naproxen (Aleve, Anaprox). These medications may make your stomach lining vulnerable to being irritated by your stomach acids.
Your age. The stomach lining gets thinner as you get older, which increases your vulnerability.
Alcohol use. Be honest with your doctor about your drinking. Alcohol can irritate your stomach lining, making it more vulnerable to your stomach acids.
Use of tobacco
Obesity (where your BMI is over 30)
Hiatal hernia
Pregnancy
Stress. If you have been under severe stress, such as recovering from surgery, an injury, burns, or a severe infection, this increases your risk for developing gastritis.
An autoimmune disorder. Tell your doctor if you have an autoimmune disorder such as Hashimoto’s disease, type 1 diabetes, or if you know you have a B12 deficiency. These disorders make you more likely to develop autoimmune gastritis. This occurs when your immune system attacks the lining of the stomach.

, Because gastritis can have many different causes, your doctor may need to do additional tests to determine exactly what is causing it for you. Your doctor may suggest:A test for H. pylori. The doctor may test for H. pylori bacteria in several different ways. It can be done through a blood test, a stool test, or a breath test. If your doctor recommends a breath test, you will drink a cup of liquid that has radioactive carbon in it. It is clear and has no taste. If you have H. pylori, they will break down the fluid when it reaches your stomach, so it you will have it on your breath. A stool test is where a stool sample is taken and tested in the lab for H. pylori. It’s considered equally effective to the breath test.
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy, or an EGD. During this procedure, the doctor uses a thin tube with a camera on it to look at your digestive tract. The images will show areas of inflammation. If the doctor finds an area that looks inflamed a small tissue sample may be taken and tested for H. pylori.
An x-ray. During this test you will drink white liquid containing barium. The barium coats your esophagus, stomach, and intestines, making them easier to see on the X-ray. This allows your doctor to look for areas with problems.
If H. pylori is detected by one of these tests and you are treated for it, it is recommended to have a repeat test in 4-6 weeks to confirm eradication.

Get blood transfusions.,
Take iron reduction pills.,
Get a bone marrow transplant.",How to Treat Anemia2," If you have severe anemia from a chronic disease, your doctor may recommend blood transfusions. You'll be given healthy blood that matches your own via an IV. This is done to give you a large amount of red blood cells immediately. The transfusion will take between 1 and 4 hours to complete.Depending on the severity of your condition, your doctor may recommend regular blood transfusions.

, If you're getting frequent blood transfusions, your iron levels may build up. High levels of iron can damage your heart and liver, so you'll need to reduce the amount of iron in your body. Your doctor may give you an injection to reduce iron levels or will prescribe a medication.If prescribed a medication, you'll need to dissolve the tablet and drink the solution. Usually, this treatment is needed once a day., The marrow inside your bones contains stem cells, which develop into blood cells that your body needs. If you have anemia caused by a failure of your body to develop functional blood cells (aplastic anemia, thalassemia, or sickle cell anemia), your doctor may suggest a bone marrow transplant. The stems cells will be injected into your bloodstream and from there they'll move to your bone marrow.Once the stem cells reach your bone marrow and graft on, they'll begin to create new blood cells, potentially treating the anemia."

Identify symptoms of mild anemia.,
Recognize symptoms of severe anemia.,
See your doctor for a blood test.",How to Treat Anemia3," Some people's symptoms are so mild, they may not realize it, but there are identifiable subtle signs of anemia. If you have only mild symptoms, schedule an appointment with your primary care provider. Mild symptoms include:Fatigue and weakness since your muscles aren't getting enough oxygen.
Shortness of breath, which is a sign your body needs more oxygen. You may only notice this when doing a physical activity, if your anemia is mild.
Pale skin because you lack enough red blood cells to make up the red hue of your skin.

, Severe symptoms are signs that more of your organs are affected by the decreased oxygen in your bloodstream and are trying to circulate more blood through your body. These also indicate that your brain is being affected. If you have severe symptoms, see a doctor as quickly as you can. You may want to go to urgent care of the emergency room which can assess you sooner. Severe symptoms include:Dizziness
Headache
Decrease in cognitive ability
Fast heartbeat

, Your doctor will confirm anemia with a simple blood test called a Complete Blood Count, which determines the number of red blood cells your body has to see if they're too low.Your doctor can help you figure out if your anemia is acute or chronic. Chronic means it has been going on for a while and that you are in no immediate danger. Acute anemia means it is a new health problem and that the problem should be identified quickly to prevent progression to something more dangerous. Once a cause is determined, the correct treatment can be started.


Your doctor may also order a body imaging scan (like a CT or MRI) or more advanced blood tests. If all tests are inconclusive, a bone marrow biopsy might need to be done."

Ask your doctor about changing painkillers.,
Take an antacid.,
Kill bacteria with antibiotics.,
Take histamine (H-2) blockers.,
Try proton pump inhibitors to reduce acid.",How to Relieve Symptoms of Gastritis2," Some painkiller medications, including commonly used over-the-counter medications, can cause gastritis. They are responsible for 15-30% of ulcers.Always discuss any changes in medications with your doctor before making them, including changes in over the counter-medications. If your doctor thinks switching may be helpful to you, acetaminophen (Tylenol) is less likely to give you gastritis than:Aspirin
Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, etc.)
Naproxen (Aleve, Anaprox)

, These medications, such as Tums, neutralize your stomach acid, making it less acidic and less irritating to the lining of your stomach. They are fast acting.


They can be purchased at your local drug store or grocery store without a prescription and taken as needed.
Side effects can include constipation or diarrhea.

, If your doctor expects that an H. pylori infection is causing your gastritis, you may be prescribed antibiotics to kill it. Always take the full course of antibiotics even if your symptoms subside. This is important for not creating strains that are resistant to antibiotics. Your doctor will most likely prescribe these three medications for H. pylori:


Clarithromycin
Amoxicillin OR metronidazole OR levofloxacin, depending on if you are allergic to any specific antibiotics
Omeprazole or another PPI

, These medications lower the amount of acid your body releases into your digestive tract. This helps to alleviate discomfort and let inflamed tissues heal. These medications are available by prescription and as over-the-counter products. Note, however, that these do not work immediately. Their mechanism of action is to reduce the amount of acid pumped in the stomach (at the molecular level). This can take 3-4 weeks, and if the drug is stopped, the effect can be lost. Common ones include:Ranitidine (Zantac)
Famotidine (Pepcid)
Cimetidine (Tagamet)
Nizatidine (Axid)

, These medications reduce the amount of acid your body produces and are more effective than H2 blockers. These medications are available over-the-counter and in prescription strengths. If you take them for long periods of time you may need to take calcium supplements to reduce your risk of hip, wrist, and spine fractures. Common proton pump inhibitors include:Omeprazole (Prilosec)
Lansoprazole (Prevacid)
Rabeprazole (Aciphex)
Esomeprazole (Nexium)
Dexlansoprazole (Dexilant)
Prantoprazole (Protonix)

Cut down on foods that may irritate the lining of your stomach.,
Eat smaller meals more often.,
Reduce your alcohol intake.",How to Relieve Symptoms of Gastritis3," Note that this tip will work only if you are suffering from GERD, not if you are suffering from peptic ulcer disease.Foods that are particularly likely to do this include:Heavy, greasy, fried, or fatty foods. Avoid foods that are deep fried such as French fries and many types of fast foods. These foods are likely to make your gastritis worse.
Acidic foods. Foods that are acidic will not neutralize your stomach acids. Avoid large doses of things like vinegar, tomatoes, lemon juice and other acidic fruit juices.
Spicy foods. Spices, including hot chili peppers, may also irritate the tissues of your digestive tract.

, This will prevent your digestive system by being overloaded at any one time. The small meals will keep a more constant flow of food through your system, reducing the amount of time that your stomach acids are sitting in an empty stomach.Reduce the amount that you eat at breakfast, lunch and dinner. This will make you hungry sooner and you can add light snacks between breakfast and lunch and then again between lunch and dinner.
Don’t give in to the urge to snack on unhealthy, fried foods that will aggravate your gastritis. Avoid French fries, potato chips, and anything that is deep fried.

, Alcohol can irritate the lining of your stomach and bring on an episode of acute gastritis. If you know you have gastritis, you may want to abstain from alcohol completely until it heals. If you do drink alcohol, keep it moderate and stay within the recommended limits.Women and men over 65 should drink no more than one drink per day. Men under 65 should drink no more than two drinks per day.
A drink is a 12 ounce beer, a 5 ounce glass of wine, or a 1.5 ounce shot of hard alcohol.

Drink excessive amounts of alcohol.",How to Get the Hiccups1," Sparkling water, soda, and other carbonated beverages can all cause hiccups.Drinking quickly might increase the odds when consuming this sort of beverage.;
, Eating something dry such as bread or crackers quickly without anything to drink might cause hiccups as well. The shift in liquid balance may disrupt your diaphragm.

, Eating food spicier than you're used to could irritate the nerves around your throat and stomach, which can cause hiccups.Eating food spicier than you can handle can also upset your stomach.


This doesn’t happen to everyone.

, Sudden temperature changes in the stomach sometimes cause hiccups. This can happen if you drink a hot drink, then follow it with an icy one.The same results will work with hot and cold foods eaten in rapid succession.


Permanent tooth damage is a possibility as the enamel on your tooth can fracture. Do not make a habit of this activity, and never try it if you have porcelain tooth implants, or if your teeth feel painful or sensitive to heat or cold.

, Being intoxicated is classically linked to having hiccups. The older cartoons would often portray a drunk character fumbling over words with hiccups sprouting out."

Talk to your doctor.",How to Prevent Air Sickness on a Plane," Pay attention to what you eat for at least 24 hours before your trip. Try not to eat fatty, greasy, or heavily spiced or salted meals. Instead, try eating smaller, but more frequent meals or snacks, prior to your flight. Avoid eating a heavy meal just before traveling.Do not eat foods that make you aware of your stomach. For example, avoid foods that cause a feeling of heartburn or reflux. The less you concentrate on your stomach, the better.Try not to eat anything immediately before flying, but don’t board the plane with an empty stomach either.;
, Alcohol intake prior to traveling can be a trigger for airsickness in many people. Try to avoid consuming alcohol, and also be sure to drink plenty of water., Most of the time, you can choose your seat as you purchase your plane ticket. Take care to choose a seat over the wing, and by the window.The seats over the wings will feel the least amount of motion during flight. Having a window seat will allow you to focus your gaze on the horizon, or another fixed object in the distance.If those seats are not available, then choose a seat very near the front of the plane, and by the window. The front of the plane is another section that feels less motion while in flight.

, Being well rested as you begin your flight can help your body to maintain a more relaxed state., Preventing airsickness is better than trying to treat it once the symptoms have started. Your doctor may be able to help by prescribing medications used to prevent motion sickness.Several classes of medications are available to help with motion sickness. Some are available over-the-counter, such as dimenhydrinate (Dramamine), and meclizine.More effective agents are available with a prescription, such as scopolamine products. Scopolamine is most often prescribed in a patch form that you place behind your ear about 30 minutes before flying.
Other drug options are available, but many have side effects that may not be right for you. Examples include promethazine and benzodiazepines.Promethazine is commonly used to treat nausea and vomiting symptoms caused by an illness, but also causes sedation which can last for several hours.Benzodiazepines are also useful in preventing airsickness, but they work primarily by controlling anxiety problems. Benzodiazepines also can cause heavy sedation. Some examples of drugs in this group include alprazolam, lorazepam, and clonazepam.Your doctor will know what drug is best for you., Some routine medications can make you more susceptible to feeling nauseous than others. Your doctor may be able to help you temporarily adjust your medications for your upcoming trip.


Never change your medication regimen on your own. Doing so can also cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and other problems that you do not want happening while you are in the air. Plus, you may be putting yourself at risk of worsening your medical condition.

, Although the evidence surrounding the effectiveness of acupressure or ginger is not entirely conclusive, some people believe that these options are effective. The bands apply pressure on the wrist to stimulate acupressure points, believed to help with controlling nausea and vomiting., Focusing on something closer to your face and eyes, worsens the confused motion signals in your brain.Try using headphones to listen to music, listen to a recorded book or work-related topic, or watch an in-flight movie to help pass the time.

, Gazing far off at a fixed point, such as focusing on the horizon, helps to reassure your brain and stabilize your equilibrium. Taking that seat by the window can help you to look at a fixed point far away, like the horizon., Make sure you have fresh air blowing around your face. Breathing fresh, cool, air can help you to relax, and keep you from becoming too hot. Personal mini-fans may also help to keep the air cool, and moving around you., Rapid and shallow breathing makes your symptoms worse. Taking slow and deep breaths has been shown to help manage motion sickness symptoms better than breathing normally.Using techniques that encourage slow and deeper breathing helps you to engage a part of your nervous system, called the parasympathetic nervous system, that works to calm things down. This type of breathing helps you to relax and create a calmer state throughout your body., This can help you to relax, but it also helps to stabilize the movements of your head. Use a neck pillow if that makes you feel more comfortable., Avoid ingesting anything that could be an irritant to your stomach. Consider eating dry crackers and drinking cool water over ice during your flight.Drink plenty of water during your flight to stay hydrated., If you begin to feel queasy, stand up. Lying back or lying over in the seat is not helpful. Standing up can help your body to establish a sense of balance, and hopefully counteract the feeling of nausea., Smelling and hearing others around you that are airsick is a big trigger, causing your own airsick feelings to escalate. Changing seats on a plane is not always easy, but it may be worth the asking., Try to stay positive, as relaxed as possible, stay cool, and focus on other things.If you are traveling for business, think about the presentation you will be giving. If you are traveling for fun, then anticipate the relaxing vacation you are about to enjoy.

, Listening to music with headphones can help you to focus on the music, relax your mind and body, and block out any noises around you that may heighten your stress and anxiety, like crying babies, or other people that may be airsick., Anxiety is a trigger for getting airsick. By using cognitive behavioral therapy methods, you can learn to control feelings of anxiety and fear, and overcome getting airsick., This technique teaches you to focus your thoughts and energy on controlling your muscles, and helps you to become more aware of different physical sensations.Progress your way up or down your body, starting with your toes for example. Focus on tensing a muscle group and holding it for about five seconds, relax the muscles for 30 seconds, repeat a few times, then move on to the next muscle group., Even some pilots are susceptible to getting airsick. To overcome this problem, many pilots, as well as people that have jobs that require frequent air travel, will try habituation training. This involves repeated exposure to the thing that makes you sick, like taking short trips in airplanes often, especially just before a long flight., Studies involving pilots who have trouble with motion sickness have shown promising results. By using biofeedback combined with relaxation techniques, they have overcome problems with motion sickness.In one study, pilots learned to overcome their motion sickness by being placed in a tilted, revolving, chair that caused them to get sick. They were monitored for changes in areas such as body temperature, and muscle tension. By using biofeedback instruments and relaxation methods, the group learned to control their motion sickness., If your airsickness gets progressively worse or is severe, you should ask your doctor for a recommendation for a doctor who specializes in diseases of the ear, nose, throat, equilibrium, and neurological systems."

Swallow a large mouthful of air.,
Force yourself to burp.,
Take a shower with an abrupt temperature change.,
Trigger sudden emotions.",How to Get the Hiccups2," Suck in a mouthful of air, close your mouth, and swallow. This is one of the only methods successfully used by a research team, who believe that hiccups might be a reaction to dislodge large pieces of food from the esophagus.You could simulate this by chewing and swallowing a moderately large mouthful of bread. Trying this with other foods, especially large amounts, is not recommended, due to the risk of choking.
Trying this too many times is likely to lead to an unpleasant, bloated sensation.

, Some people who burp on command repeatedly will induce a hiccuping fit.The same effect can be achieved by sucking in air rapidly to the back of your throat. Avoid overstimulating your glottis, or the flap at the back of your throat, by closing and reopening it rapidly.This is the same motion that occurs when you hiccup, so stimulating it intentionally may trigger hiccups.


Your glottis is active when you say ""uh oh.""Be aware of straining it from burping or screaming as a form of singing. Understanding where your glottis is and when it is stimulated will reduce your chances of straining it.

, Sudden temperature changes may stimulate certain nerves that can trigger a hiccuping session.It is the same technique mentioned earlier about eating or drinking foods that contrast in temperature.


Temperature change can also cause hives or swollen skin.

, Nervousness and excitement are likely emotions that will trigger hiccups.This is probably the least reliable method since most people hiccup only occasionally despite daily mood shifts. Still, if there is a movie, video game, sport, or other activity that makes you excited, scared, or nervous, be aware that it may induce the hiccups.

Hiccup from bowel issues.,
Start hiccuping from a respiratory condition.,
Develop hiccups from the brain.",How to Get the Hiccups3," Many types of gastrointestinal conditions like inflammatory bowel disease, a bowel obstruction, or gastro-esophageal reflux disease can cause hiccups.These types of diseases can be caused by a lack of fiber, lack of exercise, travel, consuming excess dairy, stress, and pregnancy., These conditions include pleurisy, pneumonia, and asthma. Strain on the respiratory system affects your diaphragm which causes hiccups.Respiratory conditions can stem from multiple sources like:


Genetics
Inhaling toxic agents (cigarettes, oil fumes, etc.)
Accidents

, Traumatic brain injuries, brain tumors, and strokes can all cause hiccups. Hiccups can even arise from the internal, psychological brain due to grief, excitement, anxiety, stress, hysterical behavior, and shock.


While psychogenic hiccups are rare, they occur in both children and adults."

Stay in the shade.,
Avoid tanning.",How to Examine a Mole," The main way to tell if a mole is atypical is to know the difference between them and normal moles. Atypical moles, also known as dysplastic nevi, are most commonly seen on the chest and back.These moles are usually greater than 6 mm in diameter and have more than two shades of brown or black on them. They look different than normal moles because their margins are irregular and, in most cases, they have a raised center, which is called a ""fried-egg” appearance.Atypical moles have a greater chance of forming a cancer.Normal moles are usually smaller than 6 mm, do not have more than two shades of color in them, and have regular and well-defined outlines on the skin. At times, normal moles may turn into atypical moles if they have unusual multiplication of the pigmented cells.Freckles are different from moles. They are not from an increase in pigment producing cells. To make freckles, some of the pigments produced by the skin group together to form granules and cause the characteristic ‘freckling’ of skin. Freckles are usually lighter and smaller than moles, are flat, and are very common on the face, chest, and upper arms.;
, To detect skin cancer earlier, it is necessary to perform a regular self-examination. You should do a thorough and complete body examination once every month. Though there is no set age when you should start examining yourself, it is suggested that you should start examining yourself at the age of 25.


It is easiest to examine yourself after you shower. You will already be naked and you can get to every part of your body., The best place to examine yourself is a room with plenty of light. You will need both a full length mirror and a handheld mirror. You should also have a ruler or tape measure and a journal handy to measure your moles and record your findings.If you find a mole you want to keep an eye on, you may want to have a camera handy to keep track of its appearance.
For self-examination, the American Society for Dermatological Surgery (ASDS) has created the Skin Self Examination (SSE) kit. This kit provides a document which can be printed and used as a journal and also includes instructions on performing a self-examination.The American Academy of Dermatology has a body map that can help you mark the location of any moles about which you want to consult your doctor.

, Performing a thorough skin self-examination for moles is an easy process, but it takes time. You need to remove your clothes and stand in front of a full-length mirror. Visually examine your body for the location of your moles.Inspect your entire body, including your face, ears, neck, front and back of your arms, under your arms, chest, sides, abdomen, and both sides of your legs in the mirror.
You also need to check your hands, palms, fingers, finger and toenails, ankles, the bottom of your feet, and in between your toes.
Don't forget to check the skin of your buttocks and genitals as well.
Women must also examine beneath the breasts.
Though it seems odd, you should also look at your scalp. For ease of examination of the scalp, use a comb or a blow dryer to move your hair. If it is difficult to examine the scalp, you could ask someone else to help you.
The handheld mirror can be used to view areas that cannot be seen on the full-length mirror., As you examine your body, you will likely find moles. When you come across moles, you need to examine them. Take the ruler and measure how big they are. In your journal, write down the appearance, location, and size of the moles, as well as the date you examined each one.


You should also take pictures to help check for changes over time., If you have a mole that is atypical, it is possible that it might be melanoma, a type of skin cancer. Melanoma arises from melanocytes, the skin cells that produce melanin, which gives skin its color. Melanocytes also produce moles.Since moles have many of these cells, melanomas can develop in moles.However, melanoma does not always come from existing moles.


Melanoma can come from any area of your skin. They are most common on the back, legs, arms, and face, although they can occur anywhere.
You are ten times as likely to get melanoma if you have more than five atypical moles than someone who has none.When you perform your thorough examination of your moles, differentiate between atypical and normal moles so you can check the atypical ones for melanoma. Early detection of skin cancer improves its outcome and increases survival.Feel the mole to check if it is elevated. You should keep track of changes in size, shape, color, elevation, or any new symptom such as bleeding, itching, or crusting over the mole. This is done with successive examinations. Therefore it is very important to keep a journal of your examination findings., This is a handy acronym to help you learn how to identify characteristics of melanoma. Use the following reminders to help you distinguish between benign and potentially cancerous moles.“A” is for asymmetry. Benign moles are usually symmetrical. In other words, if you draw a line through the middle of the mole, the two halves will look similar in size and shape. If you see an asymmetrical mole, have it examined by a doctor.
“B” is for border. Benign moles usually have smooth borders. Melanoma lesions may have irregular borders that look like they have jagged or notched edges. If you notice any whitish or opaque growth on the mole with edges of the growth rolling in and curling, the mole may be melanoma. This effect occurs in cancer as the skin cells rapidly multiply.“C” is for color. Benign moles are usually the same color throughout the mole (generally brown). A melanoma lesion may have multiple colors in the same mole. Moles that are black or red may also be at risk for being melanoma.
“D” is for diameter. Benign moles are usually 6mm or less in diameter (about the size of an eraserhead). You can use a ruler or tape measure to measure your moles. If your mole is more than 6mm in diameter, consult with your doctor.
“E” is for evolution. This is the most important factor to keep in mind is whether your moles undergo any changes from what’s “normal” for you. If your mole changes in size, shape, or color, see your doctor.

, If your mole exhibits any signs of the atypical characteristics of a mole, or if you notice any changes that seem unusual for your skin, you should consult a doctor. If you catch it early, the severity of the melanoma is much less than if you find it at a later stage. This is especially true if a family member has been diagnosed with skin cancer.If you have more than 100 moles, you should see a doctor to make sure there is not some other problem. They can also do a more extensive examination of your moles, which is helpful because your doctor has a better idea of what to look for.If you have a lot of moles on your back, you may want a doctor to examine those. Since you cannot look at those up close, the doctor may be better equipped to notice melanoma.If you have received prior radiation therapy for other cancers as a child, you should get checked by a doctor. Radiation therapy can induce skin cancer., When you go to the doctor with an atypical mole, s/he will perform a thorough examination of the skin. S/he may take total body photographs in order to keep track of your moles. Physicians often use dermatoscopes or microscopes to obtain a magnified image of the mole.


If an atypical mole or melanoma is suspected, a skin biopsy will be done. In this procedure, a thin layer of skin is removed using a scalpel blade.
At times, the entire mole is removed by incising the skin. The removed tissue is sent to a laboratory for analysis, which takes a few days. Your physician will then inform you about the results.
Further treatments may be carried out, depending on the results. Your physician may refer you to a dermatologist for more examination., Melanoma has some risk factors that should be taken into consideration. Skin cancer is at a high risk of recurrence, so make sure you are extra cautious if you have been diagnosed with skin cancer in the past. Common risk factors include:pale or less pigmented skin
exposure to UV rays, even via tanning beds
past sunburn
older age
skin previously damaged by radiotherapy treatment,
any condition that suppresses the immune system, such as AIDS
medications or medical treatments, such as chemotherapy, that suppress the immune system
a family history of melanoma
If you fit any of the risk factors for melanoma, you should perform self-exams often and let your doctor examine your skin periodically as well., Even if it’s a cloudy day, your skin can still absorb damaging UV rays from the sun. Apply a sunscreen with at least an SPF factor of 30 to avoid sunburns, which may increase your risk of melanoma.Look for a “broad-spectrum” sunscreen that blocks both UVA and UVB rays.Apply about a palmful or shot-glass full of sunscreen lotion to all exposed skin.

, When you can, stay in the shade outdoors. If you have to be outdoors, stay out of the sun during “peak hours,” usually between 10 AM and 2 PM.Wear protective clothing, such as lightweight long-sleeved shirts and pants, long-sleeved swim shirts or rash guards, hats, and sunglasses when you’re outside., Tanning can cause skin cancer, including melanoma. Avoid tanning beds and tanning booths.If you want to look tan, experts recommend that you use a sunless tanner instead. Look for a product that contains dihydroxyacetone, or DHA."

Eat a diet of whole, fresh foods.,
Avoid alcohol and stimulants.,
Incorporate foods that support your thyroid.,
Increase your intake of thyroid-supporting nutrients.,
Limit thyroid-suppressing foods.",How to Boost Thyroid Function1," If you have thyroid problems, you should adopt a healthier, clean eating diet plan. This generally means your diet consists is one of whole, non-processed foods. Promoting a healthy lifestyle for yourself leads to healthier thyroid function.Clean diets full of unprocessed and whole foods help eliminate inflammatory foods, which can have negative effects on your thyroid.
Many people who have thyroid issues have gluten sensitivities. Try to limit, or eliminate completely, the gluten in your food.;
, To help promote healthy functioning of your thyroid you should avoid alcohol, caffeine, and tobacco products. These products cause stress hormones to increase, which can affect your thyroid and lead to a hormone imbalance.If you don’t want to give up alcohol and caffeine forever, you should cut them out of your diet for a few weeks, then use them in moderation. There are some studies that suggest black coffee may be beneficial for neurological health.

, Certain foods can help your thyroid work better. For any thyroid disease, make sure you include the foods that support your thyroid gland. These foods include:Berries, such as blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, gooseberries, blackberries, elderberries, salmon berries, and blackberries. Berries contain high levels of antioxidants which help boost your immune system and dampen inflammation.
Lots of fresh vegetables. Include a wide variety of colors, such as greens, plus red, orange, yellow, and purple vegetables, and all types of vegetables, like leafy, stem, florets, and tubers.
Fish, like salmon, mackerel and tuna. These fish are high in omega-3 fatty acids. Non-fish sources of omega-3 fatty acids are walnuts, borage, and flaxseed oils. Omega-3 fatty acids are important building blocks for naturally produced anti-inflammatory substances in your body.
Foods with vitamin D. You can eat fish and mushrooms, or dairy products fortified with vitamin D. To increase vitamin D, you can also spend 10 to 15 minutes in the sun.
High-quality protein. Try to get one at every meal. Good sources of protein include poultry, beans, eggs, legumes, and nuts.

, You should increase the amount of foods with nutrients that boost the function of your thyroid. Try to eat at least one serving of food containing these nutrients each day.


Eat more vitamin A. Foods high in Vitamin A include vegetables, like sweet potato, spinach and other dark leafy greens, carrots, pumpkin, broccoli, red peppers, summer squash; fruit such as cantaloupe, mangoes, and apricots; legumes, meat, liver, and fish.Tyrosine is essential for good thyroid function. You can find this in turkey or egg whites.
Selenium also helps regulate thyroid production. Brazil nuts are the best source of selenium. You can also find selenium in tuna, mushrooms, beef, sunflower seeds, halibut, and soybeans.Check your iodine. In developing countries, supplementing your iodine intake with iodine-based salt can improve thyroid function; however, in many developed countries, you may be at risk for an excess of iodine, which can cause autoimmune thyroiditis. Talk to your doctor about your iodine intake and if you need to adjust it.

, If you are have hypothyroidism, that means your thyroid works slower than normal. Some foods may interfere with your thyroid’s function by suppressing it, which can make hypothyroidism worse. Limit certain vegetables, such as cabbage, Brussels sprouts, rutabagas, broccoli, and bok choy. These foods can interfere with iodine uptake in the thyroid. If you want to eat them, make sure to steam them and don’t eat them raw.It is recommended to limit peanuts/peanut butter as this can interfere with iodine uptake in our bodies.
You should eliminate foods that have high levels of mercury, such as swordfish, mackerel, shark, and most tuna. These foods interfere with your thyroid.

Avoid confusing round ligament pain with actual labor.",How to Avoid Round Ligament Pain," Any sudden onset of pain should be checked out as soon as possible by your OB/GYN to determine the cause. Pain in the lower abdominal area could be the sign of something more severe, including appendicitis or even preterm labor. Don't just assume that you have round ligament pain.


See a doctor immediately if you have pain and also fever, chills, pain when urinating, bleeding, or pain that is more than ""moderate"".;
, If you are standing when the pain begins, then sit down. If you are sitting, then get up and walk. Bending over, stretching, and lying down are ways to change your position to stop the round ligament pain., Round ligament pain can be felt on either side, but most women feel the greatest discomfort on their right side.Lying down on the opposite side where the pain is occurring helps to relieve the pressure and stop the pain., Jumping up quickly from a sitting, lying down, or resting position, can cause the ligaments to contract, resulting in sudden pain. Move slowly when changing positions to help prevent the already stretched ligament from cramping, going into a spasm, or contracting, causing the pain to occur., If you feel like you are about to sneeze, cough, or even laugh, try to flex your hips and bend at the knees. This movement can help reduce the sudden pull on the ligaments that can trigger the pain., Resting is one of the primary measures to reduce the pain associated with the stretching of the round ligament., Excessive heat is not healthy for your baby. However, applying some heat can help to relax the round ligament and relieve the pain. Do not use a heating pad on your belly when you are pregnant, but there are some other techniques you can use:A warm bath can be very relaxing, and help ease the pain caused by the round ligaments as they stretch to support the growing uterus.
A warm (not hot) compress on the side of the pelvis where the round ligament pain is occurring may help relieve pain and discomfort as well.
Soaking in the tub, or even a warm swimming pool, also helps to relieve the pain by lightening the load, as the water provides buoyancy.However, you should avoid hot tubs and jacuzzis, since they can raise your body temperature to unsafe levels for your baby., Prenatal massage can bring relief to common pregnancy discomforts such as round ligament pain. Consult with your doctor or a licensed prenatal massage therapist to safely perform the massage. Rubbing or very gently massaging the area can help to relieve the pain, and to help the mother relax.Make sure that you find a certified prenatal massage therapist. Regular massage therapy techniques are often unsafe for the developing baby because they use too much pressure.The American Massage Therapy Association has a ""Find a Massage Therapist"" feature that will allow you to search for certified prenatal massage therapists., Using an over the counter pain medication that is safe for use during pregnancy, such as acetaminophen, can help alleviate the pain as well. Be sure to ask your doctor about taking any medications, including acetaminophen, during your pregnancy.Do not take ibuprofen during pregnancy unless it is recommended by your OB/GYN (which is unlikely). NSAIDs like ibuprofen (Advil) and naproxen (Aleve) are not usually safe during the first two trimesters, and are almost never safe to use during the third trimester., For your safety, and to protect your baby, talk to your doctor when you're considering adding any form of exercise.A commonly recommended stretching exercise is done by kneeling on your hands and knees on the floor. Then lower your head to the floor, and keep your rear raised in the air.Pelvic tilts, hip hikers, and kneeling exercises may also be helpful., Certain yoga moves are recommended to help with round ligament pain. Two commonly recommended poses are the cat cow pose and the savasana pose.


To do the cat cow pose, kneel on all fours with fingers spread wide and pointing forward. Inhale and round the back high, letting the head fall and curling your pelvis under. Exhale, pulling the belly towards the mat, and extending the back body wide to stretch the ligament. Repeat several rounds.The savasana position in often the final relaxation pose in yoga sequences. To do this pose, curl into a fetal position with your arm extended to support the head, or use a pillow. This move is practiced on your left side while pregnant, with a pillow in between the legs to relieve pressure from the lower back., Placing a pillow between the knees and under the belly when lying down and/or sleeping can help relieve pressure from the ligaments. The pillow between the knees helps with added comfort.

, Sitting or standing for long amounts of time without breaks can put extra pressure on the growing and stretching ligaments. If a job or class demands extended amounts of standing or sitting, try to take as many breaks as possible and rest.Take steps that work for you to be more comfortable while sitting. If possible, use an adjustable chair as you progress through your pregnancy, and try to avoid crossing your legs while sitting.Consider using a pillow or cushion, that conforms to your body, to provide support for your lower back, and helps you to maintain good posture., Try to avoid locking your knees and allowing your hips to lean forward. Plus, if the arch in your lower back is increasing a lot, you may be more likely to suffer from round ligament pain.

, Staying well hydrated during your pregnancy helps to keep your body healthy, including stretching ligaments and muscles. Adequate fluid intake also helps to avoid unwanted problems such as constipation, and bladder infections., Maternity belts, or abdominal support garments, are worn under the clothing and are not visible. Pregnancy support bands or belts help to lift the uterus, hips, and ligaments, and provide support for the back., Physical therapy during pregnancy can also help to relieve round ligament pain. Physical therapists have extensive knowledge of your musculoskeletal system and can recommend exercises and stretches that are appropriate and safe to do while pregnant., If your round ligament pain is accompanied by vaginal discharge or bleeding, your doctor needs to know as soon as possible. Also contact your doctor immediately if you see any of the following:Pain that lasts more than a few seconds
New symptoms like low back pain, fever, chills, faintness, and nausea and vomiting beyond the first trimester

, Constant pain or pressure, pain or discomfort when walking, pain when urinating, and increased pressure in your pelvic region can be warning signs of something more serious that just round ligament pain. Contact your doctor as soon as possible if you experience these symptoms., Labor pain does not typically occur until the third trimester. Round ligament pain begins during the second trimester, as the uterus begins to grow and expand.Round ligament pain can be confused with Braxton-Hicks contractions. While this form of contraction can begin during the second trimester, a Braxton-Hicks contraction is not painful."

Minimize stress.,
Do more aerobic exercise.,
Incorporate more strength training.",How to Boost Thyroid Function2," Stress can have negative effects on your thyroid. Stress overworks the adrenal glands, which can accompany an underactive thyroid. Cortisol levels are also increased by stress, which affects insulin levels and hunger.Stress also causes people to overeat or turn to junk food, which can negatively affect the thyroid.
Learn stress-relieving techniques, such as deep breathing, yoga, or tai chi. Other approaches can include meditation, massage, and getting enough sleep.
Taking time off from your responsibilities can be very beneficial and restorative as well.

, Increasing your level of physical activity can also help boost your thyroid function. You should set a goal of 30 minutes of moderate physical activity at least five days a week.Try walking, swimming, rowing machines, ellipticals, stair steppers, or any form of cardio exercise that you enjoy. Talk to your physician to make sure there are no limitations.
Start slow and progress at your own pace. Set reasonable goals for yourself.

, Strength training can also help boost your thyroid function.You should add two to three days of strength training to your weekly exercise routine. Strength training also helps promote weight loss and reduce stress.


Try using weight machines at the gym. You can also lift free weights. Talk to your doctor about the proper exercises for you.

See your doctor.,
Undergo thyroid replacement therapy.,
Take a supplement.",How to Boost Thyroid Function3," If you have any of the risk factors or symptoms of thyroid disease, see your doctor and let her know your concerns. Thyroid disease can be treated and the outcomes are generally very good. You will need to get a blood test as well as a physical exam and review of your symptoms.Don’t put off seeing your physician. Knowing is always better than not knowing.
Certain medications can interfere with your thyroid function. When you visit your doctor, you should let her know about any medications you take, including supplements or natural, herbal remedies. If you have been prescribed drugs such as lithium, thioamides, alpha interferon, interleukin-2, cholestyramine, perchlorate, expectorants, aluminum hydroxide and raloxifene, talk to your physician about the risk of thyroid disease.

, Thyroid replacement therapy is a medically prescribed treatment for hypothyroidism. It helps replace normal thyroid function. The most common is synthetic T4 that works the same way as the T4 your body makes.The synthetic T4 is taken once a day by mouth, usually in the morning thirty minutes before breakfast.

, You can help boost your thyroid function by taking nutritional and vitamin supplements that provide the body with the nutrients needed to support a healthy supplement. Do not start taking supplements without speaking to a practitioner who is well versed in this area of expertise. Taking supplements to specifically affect thyroid function should be guided approach.You can take supplements for vitamin D, vitamin A, zinc, selenium, B12, and omega-3 fats.
Make sure when you take a selenium supplement that you don’t take over 200 mg a day."

Diagnose thyroid problems.",How to Boost Thyroid Function4," The thyroid gland plays a very important role in a number of critical functions. The thyroid helps maintain energy levels, normal temperature, weight, clear thinking, the response of the body to other hormones, and the synthesis of proteins. The thyroid is located at the base of the neck and wraps around the front of the neck, like a bow tie or a butterfly. Thyroid problems can develop suddenly or develop over the course of years.The most common conditions that affect the thyroid are hypothyroidism, which is an underactive thyroid, and hyperthyroidism, an overactive thyroid.
The most common form of hypothyroid disease is Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is an autoimmune disorder where the body is producing antibodies to the thyroid. This leads to the decreased production of thyroid hormones and an underactive thyroid.

, There are a number of factors that may put you at risk for hypothyroidism. Knowing the risk factors can help you determine if any symptoms you have may be related to your thyroid function. If any of these risk factors apply to you, talk to your physician about thyroid screening. Screening can help diagnose thyroid disease early. These risk factors include:Age: As with many disorders, the risk of hypothyroidism increases as you age.
Gender: Women are at greater risk for hypothyroidism.
Family History: Thyroid disease tends to run in families. If a close relative has had thyroid disease, you are at greater risk.
Autoimmune disease: The presence of any autoimmune disease increases the risk of thyroid disease.
Medical history of radiation to the neck or chest.

, Thyroid disease is diagnosed by both physical symptoms and lab results. Your doctor will take blood and test your thyroid stimulating hormones (TSH) to determine if you are at risk.


Symptoms of hypothyroidism include fatigue, depression, difficulty concentrating, weight gain, slower heartbeats, dry skin, thinning hair, sensitivity to cold, irregular menstrual cycles, constipation, and swelling around the neck.

Know the difference between a Baker's cyst and something more serious.,
Rest your affected knee.,
Ice your knee around the cyst.,
Use a compress.,
Elevate your leg.,
Take an over-the-counter (OTC) pain medication.",How to Cure a Baker's Cyst1," Though you may be able to treat your Baker's cyst at home, you want to make sure it is, in fact, a Baker's cyst and not something that requires medical attention, such as deep vein thrombosis or arterial obstruction. If you experience swelling or purplish marks in the toes and feet, you should see a doctor right away.;
, You should rest your knee until it no longer hurts to put pressure on it. Note any pain you specifically feel around or behind your knee while flexing and extending your leg. You should rest your knee as often as possible for at least a day or two.

, You should ice your knee injury as soon as possible. Icing helps reduce swelling and inflammation around the injury, which will also help relieve some of the pain. Only leave the ice on your knee for fifteen to twenty minutes at a time. Allow the area to warm to room temperature (another fifteen to twenty minutes) before reapplying the ice. This can help reduce swelling and pain for the first day or two after the initial injury, and you can ice your knee as often as you want during this period.


Wrap a bag of ice (or something frozen, like a bag of peas) with a towel (never directly to the skin) before you apply it.

, A compress helps reduce swelling to the injured area, and it also helps to stabilize your knee. Tie an elastic bandage (ace wrap), trainer's tape, a brace, or even a piece of clothing around the injury.


Tie it tightly enough to stabilize your knee but not so tightly that you cut off circulation.

, Elevating your leg also helps reduce swelling, and it returns blood to the heart. While laying down, raise your leg above the level of your heart (or as high as you can without causing pain). If you can't raise the injured leg, try to keep it at least parallel to the ground.


Also try placing pillows under your legs when sleeping to keep them elevated.

, You can take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, acetaminophen, aspirin, and naproxen, to help reduce pain and swelling.Follow the dosage on the label and stay within the recommended daily allowance. Take medications with meals and water.


Aspirin should not be given to children or adolescents under 19 due to the possibility of Reye syndrome (brain and liver damage), especially if the child has chickenpox or the flu.Talk to your doctor before giving aspirin to your child.
Medical professionals recommend consulting your doctor before taking NSAIDs if you have liver, kidney, or stomach issues."
"
Have your doctor evaluate the injury.,
Consult your doctor if the cyst ruptures.,
Ask your doctor about steroid injections.,
Ask your doctor about draining the cyst.,
Discuss surgical excision of the cyst.",How to Cure a Baker's Cyst2," You should have your doctor investigate and treat the underlying cause of the cyst. Causes can include knee trauma, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and cartilage or tendon trauma to name a few., Even if you’ve already consulted your doctor for a treatment plan, you should return if you suspect the cyst has ruptured or encountered other complications. If your Baker’s cyst ruptures, the fluid will leak into the calf area in your leg, which can lead to:The sensation of water running down your calf
Redness and swelling
Sharp pain due to the leaked fluid and subsequent inflammation, which can lead to blood clots.
Since these symptoms can resemble those of a blood clot, it important that you see a doctor immediately in the event that you need to be treated for a clot. Dislodged blood clots can lead to life-threatening conditions.If your doctor determines that you’re not at risk for complications due to the rupture, then your leg will reabsorb the fluid in anywhere from one to four weeks, and your doctor will recommend or prescribe a pain medication., A clinical study has shown that swelling, pain, and range of motion all improve after direct injection of corticosteroids into the cyst for patients who suffer from osteoarthritis-induced Baker's cysts.Your physician will inject a needle with corticosteroids directly in the cyst cavity. The steroids help reduce the inflammation and swelling at the site.


Your doctor may also use an ultrasound machine to visualize the cyst and help guide the needle.

, Your doctor may also remove the fluid within the cyst itself. If you have secondary cysts (fluid accumulation from front and back of the knee), your doctor may also remove fluid from the front or side of the knee as well. This will allow greater comfort by reducing pain and swelling and allowing you to move your knee more freely. Your doctor will use an ultrasound to correctly inject a needle into the fluid and will pull back on the plunger to suck it out.Your doctor will use an 18- or 20-gauge needle due to the thick fluid within the cyst(s).
Your doctor may also need to perform the procedure more than once depending on the amount of fluid present or because the fluid has accumulated as multiple sites.
It is common for your doctor to perform both an aspiration (drainage) followed by a steroid injection. Multiple studies have shown reduction of symptoms and better function of the knee after both procedures., This is a last resort if symptoms persist, other treatments have failed, or the cyst has become very large. While you are under anesthesia, your surgeon will make small (three- to four-millimeter) incisions around the cyst to drain the fluid. The surgeon may not remove the entire cyst because it can typically resolve on its own. The surgeon will stitch the incisions once the cyst has been drained.The procedure typically takes an hour (or maybe less based on the size of the cyst). A larger cyst will take longer because the swelling may have wrapped it around nerves and blood vessels.
You can expect to be given pain medication as needed.
Once home, follow the RICE therapy method (rest, ice, compression, and elevation).
Your surgeon may suggest crutches or a cane to keep weight off the area for several days.

See a physical therapist.,
Perform standing hamstring stretches.,
Try a lying hamstring stretch.,
Perform seated hamstring stretches.,
Use knee bends.,
Try static quadriceps contractions.",How to Cure a Baker's Cyst3," Inflammation to the area of a Baker’s cyst can cause muscle tightness and joint stiffness.You should perform pain-free flexibility and strengthening exercises to help rehabilitate the area and keep joints and muscles active. This will help prevent future weakness and/or stiffening of the surrounding muscles and joints.


You should focus on your quadriceps, hamstrings, buttocks, and calf muscles., Find a stool or object that is about 1.5 feet (50 cm) high. Rest the foot of your uninjured leg on the stool with your knee slightly bent. Lean forward and down—keeping your back straight—until you feel a stretch in your thigh. Hold the position for thirty seconds.Perform three repetitions twice daily, as well as before and after other exercise.
If you do not feel much of a stretch, try leaning slightly to the side of the leg you are stretching as well as forward., Lie flat on your back. Bend your knee on the leg you want to stretch. Place one hand on the back of your thigh and the other on the back of your calf. Pull your leg toward you with your hands, keeping your knee bent around 20°. You should feel a stretch at the back of your thigh. Hold the position for thirty seconds.Repeat three times per session twice daily in addition to before and after exercise.
If you can’t reach your leg to pull it, try placing a towel around your leg. You can then achieve the same stretch by pulling on the towel instead., Sit down on the edge of a chair for this exercise. Bend your good leg in a normal sitting position, and place your injured leg in front of you with your knee bent only slightly. Lean forward from this position (keeping your back straight and head up) until you feel the stretch around the back of your thigh. Remain in this position for thirty seconds.


Do three repetitions per session twice daily or before and after exercise., While sitting, alternate between bending and straightening out your knee as far as you can without causing additional pain. This exercise will help you maintain your normal range of motion.Perform once a day with up to twenty repetitions if you feel no pain.

, Place a rolled towel under your knee with your leg out straight. Push your knee down against the towel to tighten your thigh muscles (quadriceps). Place your fingers on your quadriceps in order to feel the muscle tighten as you contract.Hold each repetition for five seconds and repeat ten times as hard as possible without producing pain.

Find a nasal steroid spray if you want long term effects.,
Choose an antihistamine nasal spray in advance to prevent flares.,
Use a decongestant if you do not have regular allergies.",How to Choose an Allergy Nasal Spray1," If you have chronic and consistent hay fever or allergic rhinitis, you can work on a long term solution by taking nasal corticosteroid sprays (sometimes just known as nasal steroids) on a regular basis.These sprays are extremely effective at reducing congestion, postnasal drip, and other nose allergies. These may take a few hours or even a few days to have a full effect, but unlike antihistamines, they can stop symptoms after they appear.Some nasal steroid brands include:


Flonase (generic name: fluticasone propionate)
Nasonex (generic name: mometasone furoate)
Nasacort AQ (generic name: triamcinolone acetonide)
Veramyst (generic name: fluticasone furoate)
Beconase AQ (generic name: beclomethasone)
Nasarel (generic name flunisolide);
, Antihistamines stop symptoms like runny nose and sneezing by blocking the histamines that are normally released during an allergic reaction, but they must be taken in advance to work.If you know you will be around your allergen, you can take an antihistamine to stop a reaction before it begins. While antihistamines come in a variety of forms, including pills and drops, you can get a prescription for the following nasal sprays from your doctor:


Astelin (generic name: azelastine nasal)
Astepro (generic name: azelastine nasal)Patanase (generic name: olopatadine), If this is a rare allergic reaction or if you have not had one before, a decongestant can help. Decongestants can clear temporary allergic reactions, but they will not provide long term relief.Decongestants work by constricting the blood vessels in the nose and thereby decreasing swelling, however they only work up to three or five days maximum. After that you may experience what is called “rebound congestion” as blood vessels will not shrink with the use of a decongestant. That is why you should not use decongestant sprays for longer than three days, and do not use them if you have glaucoma or high blood pressure.You might consider:


Afrin (generic name: Oxymetazoline)Sinex Nasal Spray (generic name: phenylephrine nasal)Neo-Synephrine—Nasal (generic name: phenylephrine)"
"
Ask a pharmacist.,
Check for interactions with other medications.,
Watch out for side effects.,
Determine how often you want to use it.,
Consider trying a generic brand.",How to Choose an Allergy Nasal Spray2," Any drug store, grocery, or other store with a pharmacy will have a pharmacist on staff. The pharmacist can give you advice and recommendations on different brands of nasal spray. You can even ask them if it will interact with any other medications you are currently taking. You might ask:


Which medication is the most effective for my type of allergies?
Should I avoid certain sprays if I have particular medical conditions, such as glaucoma?
Is this safe for a pregnant woman to take?
Are there any side effects?
Let the pharmacist know if you have allergies to other medications or if you have any conditions that might make using a nasal spray difficult (such as a nasal polyp)., Medications run the risk of causing severe reactions if they interact poorly with certain other medications. Write down a list of all the medications you take, noting their generic name as well as their brand name. Take this list to a pharmacist. They will be able to tell you if there are any interactions between the drugs.


You can also consult the packaging of the medication or look online to see if there are any interactions. Some medications interact with several other drugs, so it is always good to get a pharmacist to help you.
You generally do not need to take both a decongestant pill and spray at the same time. One will work just as effectively, and some may cause side effects such as anxiety in high doses., Most medications have a slight chance of causing side effects. Side effects with nasal sprays can include nose bleeds, blockages, irritation, or drowsiness.Read the packaging of every spray before you buy it, and consider your personal risk. Some people with certain medical conditions are at higher risk of complications.


Pregnant women should always consult a doctor before starting a medication, including nasal sprays.
Children run a slight risk of slowed physical growth if they use nasal steroids. Avoid giving nasal steroids to your child for more than two months out of the year to help prevent this.If you have high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, glaucoma, or hyperthyroidism, you should not use a decongestant., Some nasal sprays need to be used only once a day; others must be taken three or four times a day for maximum effectiveness.Read each spray’s instructions to see how often you will be required to use the spray, and decide how often you will be able to use it.

, Generic brands of nasal sprays will have the same active ingredient, dosage, and strength as brand name medications, although they may have different inactive ingredients.These are typically cheaper options that you may want to consider when choosing a nasal spray. Refer to the generic name of a popular brand, and look for alternatives in your local drug store or pharmacy.


The generic name of a medication is typically listed after the brand name on the packaging. It will also be listed as an active ingredient on the ingredients’ list.
You can compare the active and inactive ingredients, found on the packaging, to see which medications are the most similar to one another.

Talk to your doctor.,
Track your symptoms.,
Get an allergy test.",How to Choose an Allergy Nasal Spray3," There are many conditions that have the same symptoms as seasonal allergies. These include colds, asthma, sinusitis, and nasal polyps.Before you start a nasal spray, make sure that you are really suffering from allergies. Your doctor can not only diagnose your allergy, but they can also recommend the best spray for your particular symptoms.

, To help you uncover the root of your allergies, you should keep a detailed record of when your symptoms flare up and what you think causes them. Common symptoms for seasonal allergies include itchy eyes, sneezing, and a runny or stuffy nose.On your phone, computer, or in a journal mark down:


What time of day do you experience symptoms?
Where are you when you feel the symptoms? Outside? Inside?
What seems to be the trigger? Is it pollen, dust, mold, or pets?

, If your allergies are severe, you may want to ask your doctor for an allergy test. These are typically tests where you are pricked with your suspected allergen. The doctor will note what kind of reaction it causes. Allergy tests can be useful for finding the underlying cause of your allergy so that you can choose proper medication and avoid the allergen in the future."

Do not allow pets into certain rooms in the house.",How to Choose an Air Purifier to Reduce Cat Dander," You must have a forced air system in order to install a whole house model. Most people choose room purifiers because you can transport them from room to room or other locations.


If you have a forced air heating system, you should look for a model that can be installed within this heating system. If you buy a room air purifier, allergens will circulate through the air by the forced air heating and cooling system, so you will find it is harder to clean the air room by room.;
, Air purification units that emit ozone have been found to put you at risk for other respiratory health concerns.

, Look for an air purifier that can purify an area larger than this number.

, If the machine does not say it contains a HEPA filter, then it is not designed to remove extremely fine allergens from the air.

, It is recommended that HEPA filters are replaced at least once per year, which should be calculated into the total cost of the air purifier. Newer models, that may be more expensive up front, may save you money in the long run.

, The best air filtration models test the dirtiness of the filter, instead of suggesting you replace the filter after a certain amount of time.

, If you are unsure what the air quality is in your home and your allergies are extremely sensitive, this can tell you when it's time to clean the house and remove dander from your cat, in addition to using an air purifier.

, Places like achooallergy.com and allergybuyersclub.com advertise models that are well known for removing cat dander. Compare these models based on features and price.

, Looking on Amazon.com, Costco.com, Overstock.com or Buy.com may yield a discounted price on the air purifier of your choice.

, Run it at least 4 hours per day to reduce pet dander in your home. Replace the filter frequently, as recommended by the manufacturer.

, This will reduce the amount of dander in the room, so that you can place a room air purifier in specific locations where it will do the most good. Doctors recommend that you bar cats from bedrooms immediately to reduce dander where people sleep.

These range in weight from 10-20 pounds, have a handle for moving, and stand on the floor or table in the room of choice. They generally cost less than whole-house models, ranging anywhere from $60 to a couple hundred dollars.Room air purifiers require annual replacement of the filter that captures airborne particles responsible for allergies. Over time, this expense can approach the cost of the air cleaner itself.
Some newer models have cleanable and reusable HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filters.
Air purifiers and filters can be purchased at your local department store or hardware store.;
, This is an inexpensive option which works with your house’s built-in heating and cooling unit. You simply replace your furnace’s filter with your filter of choice.Filters come in four different varieties: flat filters, extended media filters, electronic filters, or ultraviolet filters. Replacement is required every 1-3 months. These are considered the most efficient way to filter household air because as long as the fan is running, the system is continuously filtering the air in your home.Your house’s current heating and cooling system contains a flat filter that is used to protect your furnace from large particles of dust. Replace it with a pleated filter that attracts allergens like pollen and pet dander. They cost about $15 and should be replaced every 2-3 months., An extended media filter is a whole-house filter piled in the shape of an accordion. Its shape makes it more effective than fiberglass filters. The filter is built into your home’s ductwork, and requires professional installation. Media filters range in price from $400-$600, and the filters, which should be replaced annually, cost $40-$60.The pile of filters makes it more effective than flat fiberglass filters in catching allergens and air pollutants.

, Also known as electronic filters, these filters put a high voltage charge on particles to attract them like a magnet. Electrostatic precipitators are built into the ductwork of your home and cost anywhere from $600 to $1000 installed. Electronic filters will never need to be replaced but wash the collector plates require in soapy water every few months.Ionization, or the process of charging particles, has been known to create trace amounts of ozone and cause lung irritation.
The electric charge is also responsible for attracting allergens like pollen and pet dander.

, Ozone generators are a type of room purifier which emit small amounts of ozone by design. Manufacturers suggest that the byproduct reduces allergens such as dust, smoke, pollen and mold.However, studies have shown that these claims are inaccurate, that packaging by manufacturers is misleading, and that the emission of ozone can cause health hazards.The state of California has banned the sale of ozone generators due to health concerns.
Ozone generators are typically purchased for places where ozone is needed, such as places where there is gaseous pollution. They should not be used to remove allergens such as dust, mold spores, pollen, or bacteria., When choosing an air purifier you have to consider the size of your household or office. Air purifiers range in size from some that are compact and portable to some that take up a lot of space. Always get one that is made to operate in a space that is slightly larger than yours actually is. This will help to guarantee that the machine will be capable of removing allergens and emitting fresh and clean air., HEPA filters (high-efficiency particulate air) are the most effective at capturing air pollutants such as dust, pollen, mold spores, and pet dander. The HEPA filter guarantees that 99% of these contaminants are completely filtered. It is the model most recommended by doctors.The HEPA filter can be vacuumed meaning that it only has to be replaced every 5 years as opposed to every few months with other filters.
It is important for those with allergies to avoid purchasing just any air purifier or vacuum cleaner. Ensure that you are purchasing a “true HEPA” by checking the particulate size noted by the manufacturer on the box., The indicator is a light that lets you know when it is time to clean or replace your filter. Whether it’s a room purifier or a whole-house model, ensure that your purifier has a service indicator to make sure the air cleaner works effectively., Air purifiers can be noisy, particularly when they operate on the highest setting (the setting on which most manufacturers test their devices). Look for a system with quiet operation functions or choose a model designed for a larger area so it will clean better even at lower, quieter speeds., Search for an air purifier that requires no tools to remove the filter for cleaning or replacement. Look for a system that contains a pop-out door that allows the filter to be easily pulled out for replacement. The average person may put off changing a filter due to the difficulty or tediousness of the task., Manufacturers list the airflow rating in CFM or cubic feet per minute. The airflow rating is a measurement of the air change per hour (ACH) or how many times the unit purifies the room during one hour. Look for a purifier that has 4-6 air exchanges per hour, or once every 10-15 minutes.The manufacturer’s ACH rate is usually calculated at the maximum operating speed for the maximum room size. Running on maximum speed usually means a noisier air purifier. If you prefer to run your machine at a lower speed, oversize your purchase by 20-40%., The clean-air delivery rate (CADR) measures the volume of air filtered and delivered by an air cleaning system.In short, it measures how quickly it can remove airborne pollutants. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers certifies the CADR of air purifier systems. A system with a CADR above 350 is excellent while anything below 100 is poor.The CADR measures how quickly the system can remove smoke, dust, and pollen. Smoke ranges from 10-450, dust from 10-400, and pollen from 25-450. The higher the number, the faster the machine., The “Asthma and Allergy Friendly” endorsement is a fairly new certification from the Asthma and Allergy Foundation. This certification signifies that the air purification system won’t just redistribute pollutants, but will actually reduce them.In order to meet specifications of the program, the air cleaner must reduce bio-allergen levels as a result of removal (and not just re-distribution, and must not contribute to ozone levels.This Asthma and Allergy Friendly certification was started in 2006 and the program independently tests consumer products.A list of certified devices can be found on the Asthma and Allergy Friendly Program’s website., Online consumer reviews are often helpful in determining whether products are as effective as they claim to be. Reading consumer reviews can address certain features that may not be discussed by the manufacturer such as lifespan, ease of changing the filter, effectiveness towards specific allergies, and more. There are many website, such as Consumer Reviews, that provide reviews and buying guides for consumers."

Consider taking SNMC (Stronger Neominophagen C).,
Try Cordyceps mushrooms.,
Experiment with high doses of vitamin C. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) isn't a direct treatment for hepatitis C infection, but it is thought by some that high doses can help stimulate the immune response to eliminate viruses from the bloodstream.,

Don't share needles.,

Be cautious with tattoos and piercing.,
Cut back on alcohol.",How to Get Treatment for Hepatitis C," Initial symptoms of hepatitis C infection occur within the first six months of infection (acute HCV), but they are often mild and, most of the time, may not appear at all. Only 20–30% of people with HCV show acute symptoms.These typically include: fatigue, mild fever, nausea, muscle and joints aches, reduced appetite, abdominal pain, dark-colored urine and yellowish discoloration of the skin and eyes (jaundice).If you notice any of these symptoms, especially if you use or have used illegal IV drugs or have received blood transfusions in the past, then make an appointment with your doctor for an examination and testing.


Chronic HCV is usually asymptomatic. People with chronic HCV usually have chronic liver disease as well. Symptoms relating to chronic liver disease include: fluid accumulation in your abdomen (called ascites), swelling on your legs (called edema), itchy skin, spider veins on skin, bruising, reduced clotting ability of blood, unexplained weight loss, drowsiness, confusion and slurred speech.
Your doctor will order urine and blood tests that look for HCV and high levels of liver enzymes, which indicate liver damage.
In more advanced cases, your doctor may recommend a liver biopsy — taking a small sample of liver tissue (via a long, thin needle) and looking at it under a microscope for evidence of injury.;
, When consulting with your doctor, it's important to be honest about a past or current history of injecting illicit drugs, such as heroin, because it's the biggest risk factor for contracting hepatitis C and many other types of infections.Doctor-patient confidentiality will typically prevent you from getting in trouble with the law, unless you're putting your child or other people in direct harm from using or selling.


Depending on your family situation and history of drug use, social services may be informed and have to get involved.
If you're pregnant and using illicit drugs, your doctor may feel compelled ethically or forced by law (depending on the state) to force addiction treatment on you so your baby is not harmed any further.Getting treatment for your drug addiction is just as important, if not more so, than dealing with hepatitis C infection. Seek addiction treatment immediately.

, Once it's established that you have hepatitis C, the primary (and only) medical treatment is with antiviral medications that are meant to clear the HCV from your body.Commonly used older antivirals for hepatitis include: pegylated interferon (Roferon-A, Intron-A, Rebetron, Alferon-N, Peg-Intron), ribavirin (Rebetol), lamivudine (Epivir-HBV), adefovir dipivoxil (Hepsera) and entecavir (Baraclude).Newer types of antivirals tailored specifically for HCV are classified as either protease inhibitors or polymerase inhibitors and include: boceprevir (Victrelis), telaprevir (Incivek), simeprevir (Olysio), sofosbuvir (Sovaldi) and daclatasvir (Daklinza).The goal of antiviral treatment is to have no HCV detected in your body at least 3 months after you finish the medication(s).
Although drugs to treat hepatitis C have gradually improved over the decades, they still have serious side effects, such as flu-like symptoms, debilitating fatigue, hair loss, depression and destruction of healthy red and/or white blood cells., Older antiviral medications were typically taken daily and for up to 72 weeks to be able to rid the body of HCV, but side effects were a common concern due to toxicity. Newer antiviral drugs tend to be more effective at killing HCV, so they can be taken for shorter periods of time (daily for between 12-24 weeks) and consequently lead to less serious side effects.As such, follow your doctor's instructions very closely to avoid unwanted side effects.


Sometimes combining newer anti-viral medications with existing ones (ribavirin with interferon, for example) can be more effective than solo drug therapy.
Interferon therapy is given by injection by your doctor, but most other antivirals are taken orally as pills at home. It's best to always take antivirals pills with food or after meals.
Regimens and dosages of antivirals vary depending on the hepatitis C genotype, extent of liver damage and other medical conditions.

, If your liver is severely damaged and it's not functioning properly, then a liver transplant becomes a possible option.If your doctor finds that your liver damage is severe enough, she can put you on the waiting list for a transplant. Receiving a liver transplant is not a sure thing — you may wait for many years, and some patients even die while waiting for a transplant.


During a transplant, the surgeon removes as much of your damaged liver as possible and replaces it with a healthier liver from a deceased donor or a portion of healthy liver tissue from a living donor. Liver tissue actually grows relatively quickly and can regenerate itself better than other organs.
Realize that a liver transplant is often not a cure for hepatitis C, as treatment with antiviral drugs typically must continue.
Certain things can make you ineligible for being on the transplant waiting list. You must, for instance, stop drinking alcohol to be considered for a liver transplant. Talk to your doctor about what you must do to ensure a place on the list.
In approximately 50% of the patients with chronic hepatitis who get a liver transplant, the HCV infection recurs and causes liver injury again.The 5-year survival rate after a liver transplant is between 60–80%, depending on the surgical expertise, health of the new liver tissue and lifestyle of the patient.

, The evidence for most herbal and alternative theories is anecdotal — meaning it is supported only by personal experience and not rigorous scientific testing. This means that there is absolutely no scientific evidence that any of the treatments listed below will actually be effective.

For instance, research has shown that milk thistle, which is thought to promote liver health, is about as effective as a placebo in treating liver disease.Zinc, colloidal silver, and many other supplements have been shown to have no positive effects on treating HCV. Some, including zinc and colloidal silver, can be dangerous and toxic., Taking herbal remedies and/or supplements for infections and other diseases is often confusing and difficult to understand their potential effectiveness. Your doctor is not likely to know much about herbs/supplements and medical websites don't often mention them, so you need to seek out a knowledgeable health professional. Licensed herbalists, naturopaths or even chiropractors might be a great way to start.


Spend quality time online researching various herbs/supplements that can positively impact hepatitis C. Unfortunately, specific dosage information is rare to come by because so many variables are involved.
Always tell your medical doctor if you're taking or thinking of taking herbs/supplements because some may interact dangerously with medications.In most cases, herbs and medications can be taken concurrently.
As a general guideline, you can use herbs as dried extracts (capsules, powders, teas) or tinctures (alcohol extracts).Unless otherwise indicated, make herbal teas with 1 tsp. of dried plant material per cup of very warm water.
Steep covered for up to 20 minutes, especially if you're using the roots of a plant.
Drink between 2–4 cups of the herbal tea per day.



, Milk thistle extract has been used to treat liver problems for many centuries. The most helpful compound in milk thistle is called silymarin, which has been shown to protect the liver from various viruses, toxins, alcohol and many drugs. The studies are mixed, but milk thistle (silymarin) seems to have the potential to reduce the symptoms of chronic hepatitis and improve quality of life, although it may not always improve liver function tests or reduce HCV levels in the blood.Look for standard silymarin extracts that contain 70% silybin for best results, as they seem to be the most effective.
Silybin is a strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory that can stimulate the immune system, which is why it's helpful for all causes of hepatitis and cirrhosis.
People with ragweed allergies should be cautious with milk thistle products. Milk thistle can also have estrogen-like effects, so people with hormone-sensitive conditions (breast cancer, for example) should be careful too.
The effective dose to help with hepatitis C is not known, so some experimentation is needed.

, SNMC is a liquid supplement that contains glycine, glycyrrhizin and cysteine in a 20:2:1 ratio all mixed in a saline solution.SNMC is helpful for reducing hepatitis symptoms, improving liver function (based on enzymes in the blood) and healing liver tissue, but it doesn't directly kill HCV.SNMC solution is often administered via daily intravenous (IV) injections, although some recent studies suggest that oral forms (drinking it) may be just as effective for chronic hepatitis.
Typical formulations of SNMC are 2,000 mg of glycine, 200 mg of glycyrrhizin and 100 mg of cysteine all mixed in a 100cc IV bag of saline solution.
Glycyrrhizin is the main active compound in licorice root, which has also been used to treat liver disease for centuries.

, Cordyceps are types of mushrooms commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat liver diseases. Some studies show Cordyceps mushroom can stimulate immune function and improve liver function in patients with hepatitis B, so it may be worth a try also for hepatitis C.Cordyceps mushroom supplements typically come in capsules, but also liquid extracts. An ideal dosage for hepatitis C is not known, so some experimentation is needed.


Cordyceps may slow down blood's ability to clot, so be cautious if you're on blood-thinning medications. Always tell your doctor about all supplements you're taking so there's less risk of a negative reactions with drugs.
Another type of mushroom that helps with chronic hepatitis B infection and may also be helpful for hepatitis C is Reishi mushroom., This belief, however, is not backed by scientific research.Vitamin C is also a strong antioxidant that has some antiviral abilities, so it might be worth experimenting with for HCV due to its relative safety and lack of expense.


High dosages of vitamin C range from 3,000 mg to 10,000 mg daily, spread out over the day. The vitamin can be taken as capsules, muscle injections or IV bags.
The effective dose to help with hepatitis C is not known, so some experimentation is needed.
It's best to build up to higher daily doses and not take more than 1,000 mg at a time because it can trigger loose bowels and short-term diarrhea.
Be aware that high doses of vitamin C can also cause kidney stones., A newly discovered and tested Chinese herbal compound called SBEL1 seems to have the ability to inhibit and kill HCV by about 90%, at least in lab studies on human liver cells.Research on patients with HCV is next, so learn more about SBEL1 and remember it for potential future use against hepatitis.


SBEL1 is extracted from a medicinal herb found in Taiwan and Southern China normally used by local populations to treat sore throats and inflammation.
Scientists are excited that SBEL1 can make a big impact on hepatitis C worldwide, as it's estimated to affect 150–200 million people and cause more than 350,000 deaths each year., Hepatitis C (and B) are transmitted through contact with infected blood, so illicit drug users who share needles to inject are at greatest risk.As such, either stop the drug use altogether (ideally) or always use clean, unused needles for injecting.


In addition to needles, don't share any drug paraphernalia, such as syringes, containers or any preparation equipment — they can all be contaminated with infected blood.
Heroin users are particularly at risk due to the greater likelihood of using needles and syringes to deliver the drug directly into the bloodstream.
Many states have safe needle exchange programs, which provide a place for people to turn in used needles and get new, sterile needles, no questions asked.The hope is to prevent the spread of diseases like HCV and AIDS through the sharing of infected needles.

, Having unprotected sex with someone who is infected can also pass on hepatitis causing viruses, although it's much more common with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) than HCV for reasons that are not entirely understood.Regardless, always use condoms for sexual activities, even with people you think you know well.


Unprotected receptive anal sex has the highest risk of transmitting STDs and other blood-born viruses such as HCV.
Up to 40% of HCV infections are of unknown cause, although a good percentage of those cases are due to secretive drug behavior from spouses and significant others.

, Although they are not common methods of spreading viral infections, there still is risk with piercing and tattooing because they use needles to puncture the skin. As such, be cautious about body piercing and tattooing and always choose a reputable shop that's been there for a while.Ask the service provider how they go about cleaning their equipment and preventing the transfer of contaminated blood.


If the shop or parlor seem evasive or hostile to your polite questioning, go somewhere else.
Make sure the service providers always use sterile or new needles. Consider buying your own sterile tools and giving them to the employee to use on you.

, Reducing your alcohol consumption (or stopping completely) is not a method for directly preventing hepatitis C infection, but alcohol (ethanol) is toxic to the liver and speeds up the progression of every liver disease.As such, limit your consumption to no more than one to two drinks daily if you're healthy, but stop immediately if you have any infection that impacts your liver.


Binge drinking (more than three to four drinks in an evening) is especially damaging to your liver, particularly if you have any type of hepatitis.
Grain-based alcohol (vodka, whiskey) is much worse for your liver than red wine, which contains some health benefits due to the antioxidant content. Beer is between the two in terms being damaging.

Move unnecessary furnishings out of the bedroom.,
Never eat in the bedroom as this is an invitation to pests.,
Avoid the use of harsh chemical cleaners.",How to Allergy Proof a Child's Bedroom," If that isn’t an option, opt for low pile carpeting and vacuum it regularly with a vacuum cleaner equipped with a HEPA filter. In addition, if you keep carpeting in the bedroom, professionally clean it on a regular basis.;
, Wash sheets, pillowcases, and blankets each week in temps of at least 130 F.  Avoid padded headboards, bed skirts, or fabric canopies where allergens can collect.

, The higher the MERV rating, the more effective the filter is. For more information on MERV ratings refer to the sources section below. Use a quality air filter with a high MERV rating to ensure that small particles like allergens and dander are caught. Use a room air purifier inside the bedroom all the time. At night have the clean air blowing towards the head of the bed.

, Keep the bedroom door shut and groom or clean the pet on a regular basis. Keep the bedroom door shut at all times to prevent pets from wandering in.

, Instead use window blinds and keep them dusted on a regular basis.

, Seal off any drafty areas around the window frame. Periodically clean the windowsill and check for moisture buildup. Windows are a prime location for mold and mildew growth, the spores of which can set off allergies. If the climate you live in is damp, use a dehumidifier to keep down moisture and inhibit mold and mildew.

, Items like stuffed toys and books can be great hiding places for allergens and other triggers for allergies. If possible, store them in another room of the house.

, Cockroaches and other critters will join you in the bedroom if they find food there. As if their presence isn’t bad enough, they can leave secretions and saliva that can set off allergy symptoms.

, You might think the smell from cleaners is a good thing, but it only means that the air and surfaces have chemical pollutants left behind that can trigger allergies or asthma. Avoid other odor causing items like scented candles and air fresheners. Be sure to use fragrance free detergents as well.

Make sure you know exactly what you are allergic to.,
Choose restaurants that have a wide variety or no foods of the allergy you have.,
Ask your server about ingredients in their food before ordering it.,
Many restaurants really appreciate it if you tell them about a food allergy so that they can prepare your order away from other foods.,
Stay away from people that ordered something you are allergic to, particularly if you have an extremely severe allergy that can be triggered by smell.,
Order water.,
Pick out the parts you are allergic to.,
Bring the antidote to your allergy.",How to Avoid Food Allergies when Eating at Restaurants," Ask your doctor or local pediatrician about your allergies and what they are. Your doctor will likely tell you about your allergies. Look back at your family line, and see what your family is allergic to.;
, Some restaurants offer food for just people with nut allergies, while some just give you a bunch of options. In general, big chain restaurants will also have standardized menu with ingredients lists you can look up online (although you still should check with the staff of the specific restaurant you're going to about their procedures, in case they do things differently). Generally, you can just search ""(Name of Restaurant) Allergy Information.""


Call restaurants to see their policies on food allergies. Certain restaurants have different policies when it comes to food allergies. Depending on the restaurant, and types of food they have, the policies will be different.
Ask around to friends or relatives who also have food allergies. They might have good ideas on what restaurants have the best policies as well.
Also, most large cities have online forums for people with food allergies. You can check those out to find out which local restaurants other food-allergic people recommend.

, Your server has probably had to cook before, and knows what is in the food. Tell them what you are allergic to and ask what they recommend. If they don't have any information, politely ask to speak to the manager.


You can also bring a Chef Card for them to take back into the kitchen. This can be as simple as an index card you make yourself, or you can also order one from a company online. Chef Cards have your allergy information written on them, so that the actual cooks can know what you mean in your own words. If you are going to a restaurant where the cooks might not speak English, such as a Chinese restaurant, you can bring a Chef Card in the anticipated language, such as Mandarin. Also, if you are very sensitive, be sure to specify on the cards, to the waiter, or both that cross-contamination of ingredients is something to watch out for.

, They may take special care to use a clean cutting board or knives. This is especially important for severe allergies.

, Also keep in mind that different situations, such as an adult calmly eating a peanut butter sandwich versus a toddler smearing his peanut butter all over the table, carry different levels of risk. You might want to bring wet wipes to clean your seating area before you eat there. You can also bring your own silverware.

, Some pops and milk can contain things like soy and dairy products. If you do order them, look at the label or ask your server if they have soy milk or caffeine free pop.

, If you ordered a salad, but are allergic to tomatoes, with a fork and spoon, carefully lift the tomato out of the salad and onto a napkin or dirty plate. Please note that this should only be done if you have a very mild allergy. Also, if you are very clear about your allergy, and the staff is very clear that they can handle it, and then your food shows up with your allergen in it, don't be afraid to send it back or to leave the restaurant entirely.

, If you accidentally eat or touch your allergy, you need to have an antidote (like an epinephrine auto injector) nearby. Administer the medication yourself if possible, or ask your server to do so if you are completely incapacitated.

Check the pollen count.,
Plan outdoors activities for low-pollen times.,
Stay indoors when it’s very windy.,
Plan your day in advance.,
Take allergy medicine.",How to Reduce Your Exposure to Pollen1," Allergy websites and most local weather reports often provide a pollen count for the day or week. A high pollen count means that there is an especially large amount of pollen in the air that day.This is a valuable source of information for those prone to allergy. If high pollen counts are forecasted, start taking allergy medications before your symptoms start., Pollen count generally increases around mid-spring and stays high throughout the summer. However, different trees, grasses and blossoms can be especially allergy-producing at different times of the year. Find out what varieties of trees, plants and grasses are growing around you, and what time of year they tend to pollinate. You can research your area on the internet or ask a local garden store or landscape professional. Plan any hikes, camping trips, and major gardening projects for lower-pollen times.


Pollen levels tend to spike in the early morning. When possible, schedule outdoor activities for late morning or, better yet, midday.
If you live in the southern hemisphere, watch for higher pollen count during October to March for grasses and August to March for tree pollens.

, Wind carries pollen quickly and often from far away. Even if you don’t have trees or grasses in your immediate area, a strong wind can blow pollen in from a great distance. Silver Birch pollen, for instance, is very small and is easily transported for long distances by wind. Pollen levels can be especially high on hot, dry, windy days., This is especially important if you know you're going to be in high-pollen areas like parks and gardens. Gardens, parks, forests, and meadows are simply the areas with the highest concentration of pollen, so avoid them when you can. But if you absolutely have to attend an event such as a garden wedding at the height of the pollen season, prepare for the day accordingly.


Take allergy medicine in advance, wear sunglasses to protect your eyes, or accessorize with a head scarf to keep pollen out of your hair.

, There are numerous over-the-counter allergy medications like Claritin, but it's still wise to speak with your doctor about your allergies. They can suggest the best allergy medication for you, and explain possible side effects. Keep your allergy medicine with you so you can take it right when symptoms start. Preferably, however, take allergy medicine before symptoms start - go ahead with your medicine when the pollen count is high or you know you'll be exposed to a lot of pollen throughout your day.

Close your windows.,
Change your clothes promptly at the end of the day.,
Wash your hair before going to bed.,
Change your bedding often.,
Groom your pets regularly.,
Vacuum every week.",How to Reduce Your Exposure to Pollen2," Your goal is to keep the pollen that is outside, outside. Keep your car windows and house windows closed and use air conditioning instead, especially when the pollen count is high or you’re in the midst of pollen season. Unfortunately, this comes at an additional financial cost, so decide how often you want to use this method.


Alternatively, have a new and efficient air filter added to the air intake of your car, so that you can use outside air to circulate around the car instead of air conditioning.If you don’t have air conditioning in your home, it may help to swap bedrooms with a housemate whose room faces the fewest allergy-producing trees and plants. It will help to reduce the exposure when you let fresh air into your room.

, Pollen collects on your skin and clothes when you’re outside, so when you get home remove your day clothes immediately and toss them in the hamper or washing machine. This will prevent the spread of hitchhiking pollen to the couch, your bed, and other clothes. Wash your clothes before wearing them again.


Use an electric dryer or indoor clothes line instead of drying your laundry outdoors.You may also want to leave your shoes at the door after spending time outside to avoid tracking pollen indoors.

, Pollen not only settles on your clothes throughout the day, but also on your skin and in your hair. Going to bed with pollen in your hair will transfer that pollen to your pillow, and you'll sleep with your face in pollen all night long. A soap-free rinse in the shower before bed will do the trick to remove pollen from your skin, but for the best defense overnight wash your hair, as well., Sheets, blankets, comforters, and especially pillowcases should be changed often, at least on a weekly basis if not twice per week. Thoroughly wash bedding before reusing. Have spare sets of bedding so you can swap the sets out often without overwhelming yourself with doing laundry every three days. Keeping a clean, pollen-free bed will protect you from inhaling pollen all night long.

, Your dog, outdoors cat, rabbit, ferret, or other loveable pet can easily track pollen into the house. Commit to brushing them daily to remove as many allergens as possible from their fur, especially if they sleep in bed with you. Groom them in a wood or tiled area so that you can easily clean up without hair and pollen getting into the carpet.

, No amount of washing and prevention will stop all pollen from entering your home. Vacuum at least once a week to help remove the residual pollen that’s carried inside on people and pets. Use a vacuum cleaner with a small-particle or HEPA filter."

Cut your grass short.,
Plant low-allergy plants in your garden.,
Protect your eyes from pollen.",How to Reduce Your Exposure to Pollen3," Mow your lawn regularly to discourage the growth of flowers and weeds. Manually cut or pull up any tall grasses that you didn’t specifically plant, as grass pollen causes allergies as much as tree and flower pollen. Use the mower on a short setting to keep grass trimmed and tamed.


Have someone mow for you, if you can. Paying your neighbor’s kid to mow for you will save you from pollen exposure and provide them with a responsible and profitable activity!, Various grasses—like rye grass, Bermuda grass, and Johnson grass—are worse for causing allergies. Replace them with low growing plants that produce less pollen, like Irish moss, bunchgrass, or dichondra. If your garden contains any other high-allergy culprits, replace them or at least prune or remove their blooms.When you're done gardening, leave your gardening gloves and tools outside so you don’t transport dirt and pollen into the house. If you have an outdoors sink, wash your hands before going indoors, as well., When you’re working in the garden be sure not to touch your face or rub your eyes, which will just directly transport pollen to your most susceptible areas. You can also wear well-fitting sunglasses when outside to protect your eyes from pollen landing in them.If you know you’re going to be exposed to large amounts of pollen or are severely allergic, wear goggles and an allergy mask – a filtered mask that covers your mouth and nose."

A rabies vaccine vial.
1 or 3 ml syringe with a ½ inch needle.
Cotton balls soaked in alcohol.
Sterile gloves.
Puncture proof container.
Access to a trash can.

, The gloves will prevent the transmission of harmful microorganisms by creating a physical barrier between your hands and the surface it touches.If necessary, replace the syringe needle with a new needle, preferably a gauge 23-25 needle that is ½ inch long., There should be information on the vial’s package insert that will help you to determine the appropriate amount of sterile water to be mixed with the rabies vaccine powder in the vial.


Once you determine this information, lift the top of the vial to open it.

, Do this in a circular manner, starting from the inner to the outer part to eliminate harmful microorganisms.Allow it to dry.

, To do this, hold the sterile water bottle upside down using your non-dominant hand. Pull back the plunger to aspirate or obtain the proper amount of sterile water to be mixed with the vaccine.


Make sure that the black line or marker in the plunger is lining with the numbered scale on the syringe to obtain the correct amount of sterile water.Once this is completed, roll the rabies vaccine vial between your palms until it looks clear.This will prevent the vaccine from foaming.

, To do this, hold the vial upside down with your non-dominant hand and inject the 1 ml syringe into the rubber on top of the vial using your dominant hand. Draw back the plunger of the syringe until its black line or marker reaches or lines with 1 ml on the numbered scale. Remove the syringe., If bubbles are present, tap the syringe with your fingers. The bubbles should just float to the top and disappear.


Bubbles in the syringe can make the injection process more painful because it adds to the volume of the content of the syringe. The more volume injected into the muscle, the more painful it is., This will prevent the transmission of harmful microorganisms., This will help to establish trust and cooperation., These materials include:

Make sure you discard the broken neck in a puncture proof container.

, To do this, hold the ampule upside down with your non-dominant hand and inject the 1 ml syringe into the hole using your dominant hand.Draw back the plunger of the syringe until its black line or marker reaches or lines with 1 ml on the numbered scale.
Remove the syringe.

, If you find any, tap the syringe with your fingers to make the bubbles to float and disappear.

, Make sure the person has told you or been tested for any allergies to food, dyes, preservatives, or animals. This is an important step, as the rabies vaccine is made up of killed rabies virus which may cause an allergic reaction.

, The ideal injection site depends on if you are giving the vaccine to an adult or to a child.


For adults, intramuscular injection is on the deltoid muscle or the rounded muscle on the upper arm near the shoulder.
If the child is 3 years or older, the deltoid muscle can be used.
For younger children, the vastus lateralis muscle which is located on the middle, outer sides of the thighs is used.Before you inject the vaccine, always assess the site for any scars, bruises or swelling. If these are present, use the other arm for adults and use the other thigh for children., Do this by moving from the inner to the outer part of the injection site to eliminate harmful microorganisms.Let the area dry.

,


Always pull back the plunger to check if blood appears. This is to make sure that you do not hit a nerve or vein. If blood appears, remove the needle and dispose of it properly. Then, prepare a new injection. If there is no backflow of blood, continue to inject the medication slowly.Pull the syringe out in the same angle you injected it to prevent injury to the muscles.After all of the vaccine is injected and the syringe has been removed, release the pinched skin.

, This will prevent any blood from leaking.Do not rub the area as this may irritate the injection site.

, You do not want to prick yourself or put others at risk of being pricked by accident.Throw the cotton balls in the trash can.

, Do this with antibacterial soap and clean water.


To avoid infections and transmission of diseases, never reuse needles and syringes. Always use a new one for each vaccination., The rabies vaccine comes from killed rabies virus and is an active immunizing agent that is used to prevent infection caused by rhabdovirus. So, it works by letting the person’s body to create its own protection or antibodies against the virus.

, The two commonly used rabies vaccines are: Human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV), or Rabies Vaccine BP Pasteur Mérieux and Purified chick embryo cell (PCEC) rabies vaccine, or Rabipur.


They should be stored at a temperature of 2 to 8 °C (36 to 46 °F) and must be discarded if they are not used one hour after they have been reconstituted or prepared., Receiving a rabies vaccine once you have been exposed to a rabid animal (e.g., by a bite, scratch or lick in an open wound) is called post-exposure prophylaxis. But the vaccine can also be taken ahead of time by high risk persons such as animal handlers, veterinarians and travellers who will go in places that have a high rate of rabies infection, which is called pre-exposure prophylaxis.


For pre-exposure prophylaxis or vaccinations given ahead of time to high risk persons, 1 ml of rabies vaccine is injected in three doses – at days 0 (first dose and the day the vaccine is given), 7 and 21 or 28.For post-exposure prophylaxis or vaccinations given when the person is bitten or scratched by a rabid animal, 1 ml of Human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG) is given intramuscularly on days 0, 3, 7, and 14.For persons previously immunized, which means they have received three doses of pre-exposure prophylaxis or a complete post-exposure prophylaxis, only human rabies vaccines such as Human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV) or Purified chick embryo cell (PCEC) should be given on days 0 and 3 and no Human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG)., In the U.S., rabid animals like raccoons, foxes, skunks and bats account for the highest number of cases of rabies passed on to humans.In Canada, rabid animals like foxes, dogs, skunks, bats, cats, cattle, swine and horses have been known to become infected with the rabies virus.
In Africa, Latin America and Asia, dogs account for the highest number of cases of rabies passed on to humans.

, This is a normal reaction after a vaccination due to the penetration of the needle or the concentration of the drug at the injection site.Side effects like a fever and a headache are also normal reactions to the vaccine due to the introduction of the killed virus. These symptoms can last for about 24 to 48 hours.

, If you experience any itchiness at the injection site or other parts of the body and a stomach ache, these may be signs of an allergic reaction to the vaccine. Seek medical attention if these reactions occur to prevent a severe allergic reaction. Let your doctor know if you experience any other reactions such as:Burning, crawling or itching sensation on the injection site
Confusion
Diarrhea
Dizziness, nausea, chills, fever, and/or headache
Irregular heartbeats
Joint inflammation, muscle pain, stiffness and weakness,
Rashes
Seizures, shortness of breath, tightness in the chest
Swelling of the eyelids or around the person’s eyes
Vomiting

, If your pet is bitten by a rabid animal carrying the rabies virus, the virus is then transmitted to your pet and will increase your risk of getting the virus if you are bitten by your pet.Rabies vaccine for dogs and cats are effective for three years.
For ferrets, the vaccine is given annually.
If you have livestock like sheep, cattle, goats or horses, get them vaccinated; depending on the vaccine used, the effect can last from 1 to 3 years.

, Instead, provide adequate housing and tall fences so they can roam within a restricted area on your property. This will prevent the likelihood of them getting bitten by other animals carrying the rabies virus., Do not attempt to catch or remove the wild animal on your own as this increases your chances of getting bitten."

Change your bedding regularly.,
Wash bedding.,
Vacuum regularly.,
Steam clean regularly.,
Damp dust.,
Wash stored blankets and clothing.",How to Reduce the Dust Mite Population in Your Home1," Most dead skin build-up occurs in and around your bed because you spend so much time there. This attracts dust mites and accumulates allergens. You will want to have multiple blankets, sheets and pillowcase covers to switch out with.;
, Wash all blankets, sheets, pillow cases, bed covers and other bedding with detergent in hot water at a minimum of 131°F weekly to kill dust mites and remove allergens. High water temperature can kill dust mites better than just using detergent. Also wash curtains.Set your washing machine to its hottest setting. If the water isn’t hot enough, check your hot water heater. Most hot water heaters have an adjustable knob to change the maximum temperature.If you can't wash bedding in hot enough temperatures, throw them in the dryer for at least 15 minutes at a temperature above 130 °F to kill mites. Afterward, wash and dry the bedding so allergens are removed. You could also dry items in direct sunlight.
Use a product that contains essential oils, like eucalyptus, cedar or tea tree oil to add to the wash’s effectiveness. Using detergent plus bleach will remove most allergens and a significant amount of dust mites, even in cold or warm water. Items can be washed again to reduce mite levels further. Know that live mites can be transferred from mite-infested items to mite-free items during washing.Hot tumble dry items for an extra half an hour after drying or dry clean items to kill dust mites. This will not get rid of the allergen dust mites produce, however.

, Vacuum everything that you can, including couches, mattresses, armchairs, floors, mattresses and other places where people frequently sit or lay down on. To trap allergens effectively, your vacuum should have a double-layered microfilter bag or a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. This is important because it helps ensure that dust is not recirculated into the air.


Vacuuming removes surface dust but can’t remove most dust mites and dust mite allergens. Mites are tiny enough to pass through the vacuum cleaner bag. However, vacuuming keeps dust down so these areas aren’t as attractive to mites. Get underneath and behind furniture to keep ""dust bunnies"" from forming.
If you have severe allergies, leave the area being vacuumed and let someone else do the work. Stay away from the vacuumed room for about two hours to let everything settle.
Keep your vacuum serviced so that it continues to work well.
Use a water vacuum to keep mites inside the water container so you can dump the water into your toilet and flush it.
You may wish to wear a mask when you vacuum to avoid inhaling allergens. Even if you don’t have allergies, it’s best to leave the house for about half an hour after vacuuming for the remaining dust and allergens to settle.

, Steam cleaning dissolves dirt and grime, removes germs from surfaces and kills dust mites. However, the moisture that accumulates in carpet padding from steam cleaning creates an ideal environment for dust mites. Think about using dry cleaning methods instead., Feather dusters and dry cloths will stir up allergens into the air. Use a damp or oiled mop, rag or electrostatic cloths to clean hard surfaces once a week. This will help keep dust and dust mites down.

, Whether you packed up clothing for a move or it’s starting to get cold for winter, wash all these items before using them. Dust mites love to settle into the fibers of unused and unwashed clothing and blankets as they collect dust in storage. Washing them ensures that both mites and allergens are destroyed so you can enjoy your items sneeze-free.

Give epinephrine for severe reactions.",How to Administer Vaccines," The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is the government body that regulates the vaccination schedule in the United States. They have downloadable vaccination schedules for babies, kids and teens, and adults available on their website. Follow these basic guidelines when deciding which vaccines to administer to your patients.

Immunization schedules may vary a little depending on factors like where your patients live and what medical conditions they have.;
, People in different parts of the world need somewhat different vaccines, based on what illnesses are more common there. Use this interactive tool created by The World Health Organization (WHO) to enter your country and get a custom vaccination schedule for anywhere in the world.The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has a similar tool for European countries., Before administering a vaccine, do a complete history and physical exam and review your patient’s vaccination history.Ask if your patient is taking any medications, has any allergies, or has ever reacted to a vaccine previously. If they have ever had a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to any part of the vaccine, do NOT give it. If your patient is moderately to severely ill, weigh the risks and benefits – wait for them to get better, if possible. Be aware of the following contraindications to specific vaccines, and avoid the vaccine if any are present:Hepatitis B: yeast allergy

Rotavirus: history of intussusception; severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)

Diptheria/Tetanus/Pertussis: history of encephalopathy within a week of previous dose of DTP, DTaP, or Tdap

Hib: younger than 6 weeks old

Measles/Mumps/Rubella (MMR), Varicella, and Herpes Zoster: severe immunodeficiency, including HIV; pregnancy

, You do not have to memorize the dosage guidelines of every vaccine. Consult a dosing chart such as this one at immunize.org or from the CDC., Most vaccines can be given directly into the muscle (intramuscular), but some are administered by the subcutaneous (Subcut, or into the fatty layer), nasal, intradermal (ID, or into the skin), or by mouth. Consult an immunization chart or ask your supervisor if you’re unsure about the best route of delivery. Follow these general guidelines:IM vaccines: Diptheria/Tetanus/Pertussis (including DTaP, DT, Tdap, and Td), Hib, HepA, HepB, HPV, inactivated and recombinant influenza (the most common flu shot), meningococcal conjugate and serogroup B, pneumococcal conjugate, pneumococcal polysaccharide (can also be given Subcut), polio (or Subcut)

Subcutaneous: MMR, meningococcal polysaccharide, varicella, zoster, MMRV (ProQuad)

Intranasal spray: live attenuated influenza (LAIV, also called Flumist)

Intradermal: Fluzone influenza

Oral: Rotavirus

, Most vaccines are delivered by the IM route. Deliver an IM injection directly into the muscle belly of a large muscle group. Insert the needle perpendicular to the patient’s body using a quick thrust motion.The muscle lies below the fatty layer, so a longer needle is needed than for a subcutaneous injection.

Choose a needle that is between 22 and 25 gauge. The length should be dictated by the patient’s body size.

, Select the right needle length for IM vaccines to make the injection more comfortable for your patient and to ensure that all the vaccine gets into the muscle. Needle length is based on your patient’s age and body size, as follows:Newborns (<1 month): 5/8” into the upper, outer (anterolateral) thigh

Infants (1-12 months): 1” into the anterolateral thigh

Toddlers (1-2 years): 1-1.25” into the anterolateral thigh, or 5/8-1” into the deltoid (upper outer arm)

Kids and teens (3-18 years): 5/8-1” into the deltoid, or 1-1.25” into the anterolateral thigh

Adult <130lb (59 kg): 5/8-1” into the deltoid

Adults 130-152lb (59-69kg): 1” into the deltoid

Females 153-200lb (69-90kg) and males 130-260lb (59-118kg): 1-1.5” into the deltoid

Females 200+ lb (69kg) and males 260+ (118kg) lb: 1.5” into the deltoid

, Both adults and children can receive Subcut injections with a 5/8” needle that is between 23-25 gauge. Give the injection into the fatty tissue over the upper, outer (anterolateral) thigh muscle for infants age 1-12 months. For anyone over 12 months, you can use the anterolateral thigh as well, or the fatty area over the triceps muscle.Insert the needle at a 45° angle to the patient’s body while gently pinching up the skin into a tent to allow for better access.Inject into the fatty tissue below the skin and above the muscle layer.

, Use a short, narrow needle for ID vaccines, like a 15mm, 26 gauge needle. Insert the needle just shy of parallel to the skin, into the topmost layer of skin.To give an intradermal vaccine with a pre-filled injection device, first gently shake the device then follow these instructions:Hold the device with your thumb and middle finger, keeping your index finger free
Insert the needle at a 90° angle into the deltoid, using a short, quick motion
Hold light pressure on the skin and push the plunger with your index finger.
Remove the needle from the skin in a quick motion. Direct the needle away from you and other people and push the plunger with your thumb to activate the needle shield until you hear a click. Throw it away in a sharps container.

, FluMist, the live attenuated flu vaccine, cannot be injected. Remove the rubber tip protector. Place the tip inside your patient’s nostril while they’re in an upright position. Tell them to breathe normally. Push the plunger as quickly as possible in a single motion – the dose-divider clip will stop you halfway. Pinch the dose-divider clip and remove it, then repeat the procedure in the other nostril., Record the date, dose, and injection site any time you give a vaccine. Do this in your EMR (Electronic Medical Records) or paper records, as advised by your administrator. Enter the data into an immunization information system if one is used in your setting.In the pediatric population, provide a vaccination schedule for the parents indicating which are completed and which are next.A Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) contains information about the benefits and risks of each vaccine. If possible, give your patients and patients’ parents a copy of a VIS with each vaccination.

, Check and re-check the vial label of the vaccine you’re about to give. Check the expiration date – throw it away if it's expired and use a new one. Before using a vaccine, check the labeling to see if it requires specific handling, for instance shaking the vaccine vial and/or using the reconstituting mix (diluent).If you’re administering more than one vaccine, draw them up, label them appropriately, and re-check the labeling.
Use the “Rights” checklist: Right patient, right vaccine and diluent (when applicable), right time (right patient age, time interval, vaccine isn’t expired), right dosage, right route/needle, right site, right documentation., Wash your hands thoroughly with warm water and soap. Lather the soap for at least 30 seconds and scrub under your nails, between your fingers, and up your wrists. Dry your hands with a clean paper towel.

Put on disposable gloves to administer the injection.Make sure your patient doesn’t have a latex allergy; if so, use non-latex gloves.

, Choose and locate the right injection site. Open a new, sterile alcohol wipe. Rub the site in a circular motion starting in the center and extending out 2-3 inches. Let the alcohol dry.If giving more than one vaccine, use a separate injection site for each one., Stabilize the arm or leg that will receive the injection with your non-dominant hand. Using the appropriate IM or Subcut needle, hold the needle about an inch from your patient. Insert it quickly at the appropriate angle. Push down on the plunger with steady pressure to inject the vaccine. Remove the needle at the same angle you inserted it.

Dispose of the needle in a sharps container.

, Apply gentle pressure to the area immediately after removing the needle. Cover this with a small piece of gauze and hold it in place with medical tape. Tell your patient they can remove the bandage later that day., Many patients, especially parents thinking about vaccinating their child, are nervous about vaccines. They may think that vaccines can make their child ill or cause autism. Address these questions calmly and directly:

Ask outright, “Do you have any fears or concerns about vaccines that we can discuss?”
Offer a lead-in to the conversation like, “I know some parents worry that vaccines can cause autism or health problems. If you have those concerns, I’d like to discuss them until you understand and feel comfortable.”
Don’t get outwardly frustrated or talk down to your patients.

, Be direct and honest in your discussions but remember that your patient probably isn't medically trained. Use language to explain and answer questions that the average person will understand.

Avoid terminology like, “MMR is a live attenuated vaccine in which the virulence of the pathogen is reduced.” Instead, say something like, “The measles vaccine uses a weak form of the virus. It’s strong enough to get your body to made defenses to it, but not strong enough to make you sick.”

, Immunizations can cause minor reactions like soreness, swelling, and redness at the injection site, and a low fever. Notify your patient that this is not dangerous or uncommon, and it is not a sign that the vaccine is making them or their child sick. Explain that it is their immune system making the defenses it needs., If your patient complains of swelling, redness, pain, itching, or mild bleeding at the injection site, let them know this is normal. Then take steps to make them feel more comfortable:For pain, redness, swelling, or itching, apply a cold compress to the area. Give them a mild pain reliever like ibuprofen.
If the injection site is bleeding, apply a bandage over the area. If it continues to bleed, place a thick gauze pad over the site and tell your patient to apply constant pressure.
Raise their arm above the level of their heart for several minutes to slow bleeding.

, If your patient expresses fear or anxiety about getting the shot, or complains of blurred vision, dizziness, or lightheadedness, they may pass out. Try to avoid this by having your patient lie down for the vaccination, sit with their head between their knees for several minutes, and apply a cool damp cloth to their face and neck.Be patient and wait until they're ready to give the vaccine.

If your patient falls or passes out, check for injury before moving them. Then place them on their back with their feet elevated. Call for emergency services if they do not recover within a few minutes. Be comforting and offer them juice or candy to help raise their blood sugar, which can help them feel better more quickly.

, Rarely, a patient may experience a severe allergic reaction to a vaccine called anaphylaxis. Watch out for the following signs, and alert your patient or a second party to do the same and seek medical care if they arise:Starting to itch all over
Sudden or severe skin redness or hives
Swelling of the lips, face, tongue, or throat
Wheezing or shortness of breath
Abdominal cramps
Drop in blood pressure and possible loss of consciousness

, Unless the redness and itching is localized only to the area of the injection, the best treatment is to give epinephrine. If you are a trained healthcare provider, administer aqueous epinephrine 1:1000 dilution (1mg/ml) IM. If you are not a trained professional or do not have epinephrine available, call emergency services right away.Give them Benadryl while waiting for help to arrive, if they are conscious and can swallow.

Use the patient’s EpiPen if they have one.

Add an allergen barrier to your bedding.,
Use synthetic fabrics.,
Change your flooring.,
Use tannic acid.,
Reduce stuffed toys.,
Try not to sleep on your couch.,
Leave your bed unmade.",How to Reduce the Dust Mite Population in Your Home2," Encase your mattress, box spring and pillows in dust-proof, allergen-proof covers available from specialty supply mail order companies, bedding and some department stores. Made of tightly-woven fabric, allergen-proof covers prevent dust mites from colonizing or escaping. You are closest to the mites and their feces in your bed, so enclosing your mattress and pillows in a dust mite cover pretty much eliminates the mite problem there.


Mattresses covered in fitted sheets are protected from the accumulation of human skin scales on the surface. These sheets are usually also waterproof., Replace down pillows with synthetic-filled ones. Also, replace woolen blankets with nylon or cotton cellulose ones. Memory foam mattresses are supposed to create an environment that is unfavorable to dust mites. You might consider replacing your mattress with memory foam., Carpet is a haven for dust mites, especially if it sits on concrete, which holds moisture and provides a humid environment for dust mites. Remove wall-to-wall carpeting to help with dust mite allergies, especially in bedrooms. Replace with bare floors, such as linoleum, tile, vinyl, wood or anti-allergenic carpet.


Also, remove furnishings that collect dust, such as fabric curtains, horizontal blinds and upholstered furniture.
Don’t forget to remove all rugs and mats from the home as they too harbor dust mites.
Bare floors can be damp-mopped or cleaned with electrostatic cloths.

, Tannic acid neutralizes the allergens from dust mites naturally. Tannic acid powder can be purchased from health food stores and other specialist providers. Sprinkle it liberally over mattresses, couches, pet beds and other dust mite havens to help reduce the impact of allergens.You can also make your own solution of tannic acid by adding one cup of weak tea to a gallon of water, spraying carpets and vacuuming 3 hours later.

, Minimize your child's stuffed toys to one or two favorites. Get plastic toys or washable stuffed toys instead. If you choose washable stuffed toys, wash them often in hot water and dry thoroughly.


Keep stuffed toys off beds.
Put any non-washable stuff toys that you keep in the freezer every couple of weeks to kill living dust mites.

, This can attract more dust mites to the area by providing ample food in the form of your dead skin cells. Couches tend to be more difficult to protect from dust mites than beds. It is better to sleep in a bed with a dust mite cover for protection from allergens and mites.

, That’s right, now you have a legitimate reason not to make your bed every day! Leaving the bed unmade each morning with the sheets exposed to air will air-dry and release moisture from bedding. This significantly reduces the number of dust mites you have to contend with. "
"
Ventilate your home.,
Use direct sunlight.,
Reduce clutter.,
Reduce humidity.,
Control temperatures.,
Install a filter.,
Use an air purifier.,
Freeze items.",How to Reduce the Dust Mite Population in Your Home3," Open windows and screen doors to allow fresh air to circulate. This reduces humidity and can help move dust and other allergens out. Do this often to reduce dust mite populations.

, Sunlight kills dust mites, but keep in mind that it does not remove dust mite residue.Hang bedding, clothing and other furnishings outside or in direct sunlight. Air blankets, rugs and other heavy bedding items outside as often as possible. Open curtains and blinds to let the sun shine in.

, Excess items in the bedroom such as books, magazines, clothing baskets, knickknacks, ornaments, toys and piles of clothing that make it hard to clean or dust create an excellent home for dust mites. A good rule of thumb to follow is that if it can collect dust, it can be a haven for dust mites. Try making a mimimalist bedroom.

, Dust mites thrive in humid environments because they absorb water from the atmosphere. Avoid humidifying, and use a dehumidifier or air conditioner to keep relative humidity below 50%. A hygrometer, available at hardware stores, measures humidity levels in the home so you can have more control.

, Dust mites do very well in temperatures between 65°F and 84°F and a relative humidity of more than 50%. To cut down on dust mite populations, make your home less comfortable for them. Along with a reduction in humidity, consider lowering your in-home temperatures to below 70°F or more. , A high-efficiency media filter in your furnace and air conditioning unit can help remove allergens and reduce dust mite populations. Look for a filter with a Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) of 11 or 12 and change the filer every three months at least. Leave the fan on for a whole house air filter. , There are many types of air purifiers that can be attached to the central air return. These purifiers decrease irritants and food sources for dust mites with most filters removing 50 to 70% of material. HEPA filters, however, will remove up to 99% of dust mite feces, dust, animal dander, pollen, cockroach feces, and other materials. , Non-washable bedding, toys, furnishings and other items can be frozen to kill dust mites. Freeze these items for 24 to 48 hours. Though this method will destroy mites, it does not remove allergens."

Get enough protein.,
Choose the right fats.,
Eat limited amounts of carbohydrates.,
Incorporate other immunity-boosting foods into your diet.,
Eat antioxidants.,
Be skeptical of ""immune-boosting"" products.,
Increase your intake of Zinc.,
Make sure you are getting enough copper.,
Get enough vitamin C. Vitamin C increases your white blood cell count and enhances the cells' effectiveness.It is also an antioxidant, which means that it prevents the destruction of existing white blood cells.,
Be mindful of your vitamin A levels.,
Take vitamin E. Vitamin E, like vitamins C and A, is an antioxidant, and is also beneficial for your skin and eyesight.In addition to supplements, you can find vitamin E in olive oil, nuts, and some fruits and vegetables.

,
Try other natural remedies.,
Consider colostrum supplementation.,
Talk to your doctor about immunoglobulin injections.,
Eat a healthy diet.,
Exercise regularly.,
Stop smoking.,
Drink enough water.,
Limit alcohol consumption.,
Sleep for at least six to eight hours a night.,
Get regular medical screening tests.This will help catch illnesses early on so that you can get the most effective treatment.

,
Be hygienic.,
Manage stress.",How to Strengthen Your Immune System," Eating a balanced diet ensures that the right nutrients reach the bone marrow, where white blood cells are produced. Start by making sure to eat plenty of protein, which is the most important component of white blood cells.You can get protein from meat, dairy, eggs and vegetables.;
, Avoid saturated fats, but eat plenty of unsaturated fats. Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease, but unsaturated fats aid absorption of fat-soluble vitamins in the body. These ""good fats"" are found in canola, olive, safflower, soybean, and cottonseed oils.

, Consuming appropriate amounts of wheat, corn, and cereals helps to create the energy required for the body to produce white blood cells. However, consuming excessive amounts of these foods will result in lower levels of T-lymphocytes (and thus lead to lower immune responses) , There are a number of particular foods that can help. These include:


Garlic Almonds Kale Navy beans Reishi mushrooms Blueberries and raspberries Yogurt Green,Matcha,and Tulsiteas

, Antioxidants are vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that help repair damaged cells in the body.Examples of antioxidants are Beta Carotene, Vitamins C and E, Zinc, and Selenium. These nutrients can be found in certain fruits or vegetables, or can be taken with a supplement.


Beta Carotene is found in apricots, broccoli, beets, spinach, green peppers, tomatoes, corn, and carrots. Vitamin C is found in berries, broccoli, nectarines, oranges, strawberries, bell peppers, tomatoes, and cauliflower. Vitamin E is found in broccoli, carrots, nuts, papaya, spinach, and sunflower seeds. Zinc is found in oysters, red meat, beans, nuts, and seafood.

, There is no scientific evidence that has proven that increasing the number of immune-fighting cells is a good thing. In fact, in some cases, increasing the number of certain ""good"" cells in your body can increase the risk of stroke.Medically speaking, the best thing you can do for your immune system is to live a healthy daily lifestyle and get proper and timely medical treatment for illnesses and infections.

, Zinc is one of the most important components of enzymes present in white blood cells, and a deficiency of this mineral can result in a weaker immune system.You can get zinc from meat, fish, and milk.


Supplements are also available, but you should consult your doctor before taking them regularly.

, You only need a very small amount of copper to be healthy (the total amount of copper in a healthy human body is only around 75-100 milligrams ), but it does play a very important role in metabolic and immune function, neutralizing free radicals and possibly even reducing some of their harmful effects You can get copper from organ meats, leafy green vegetables, and cereals.


That being said, too much copper can cause it to act as a pro-oxidant in your body, and in larger quantities it may contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease.As such, you should exercise caution and be sure to check with your doctor before increasing your copper intake.

, In addition to supplements, you can get vitamin C from oranges, berries, and most citrus fruits.


For adults, tolerable upper intake levels of vitamin C are about 2,000 mg .

, Vitamin A is also an antioxidant, and helps your immune system to function more efficiently.In addition to supplements, you can get vitamin A from carrots, tomatoes, chilis, and squash.

,, Echinacea,ginseng,aloe vera,and green teaare all said to boost your white blood cell count.Selenium is found in tuna, beef, and Brazil nuts. , If you have a weak immune system, you may need supplementation. Colostrum powder containing immunoglobulinsis a convenient option since it is available over the counter (without a prescription) in the form capsules for oral consumption. For most people, a month of consumption is adequate every five years.

, If you have an especially weak immune system, you may need intravenous injections of immunoglobulins (polyvalent IgG antibodies) extracted from donor human blood. This is always by a doctor's advice and only if you have primary immune deficiencies, autoimmune diseases, severe inflammatory diseases, or acute infections.

, Many people only think about their health when it is in danger; don't wait until you are sick or injured to care for your body. Making healthy food choices on a daily basis is one of the best ways to maintain your cardiovascular health, improve your energy levels, and keep your muscles and bones strong. A healthy diet should be high in fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins, and low in excess sugar, fat, and alcohol.


Citrusy fruits like oranges, tangerines, and tomatoes contain Vitamin C, which helps protect the immune system.Eat chicken, turkey, salmon, tofu, and other lean meats. These foods are rich in protein without the extra fat that is found in red meats and shrimp. Other protein sources included quinoa, kidney beans, and black beans.

, Getting enough exercise improves your cardiovascular health, and greatly reduces the likelihood of certain chronic diseases.. Exercise increases the flow of blood through different parts of the body, and it increases the body's excretion of harmful metabolites, helping your immune system function properly, and may even decrease your chances of developing heart disease, osteoporosis, and cancer.So run, bike, swim, walk -- whatever gets you moving!


Children and adolescents aged 6-17 should get 60 minutes of exercise per day. Most of this time should be spent doing aerobic activities, while the rest of the time should be spent doing muscle-toning activities. Adults aged 18-64 need at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of aerobic exercise each week and at least two days per week of muscle strengthening activities like lifting weights. Older adults aged 65 or older with no existing medical conditions should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate exercise like brisk walking, and two or more days of muscle strengthening exercises. , Smoking harms nearly every organ in the body, damages your immune system and increases the likelihood for stroke, heart attack, and lung cancer. Nicotine binds to hemoglobin in the blood in preference to oxygen reducing its capacity to deliver oxygen to each cell of the body.In addition, smoking exposes the body to carcinogenic chemicals and tar, which results in an increase in infections by putting your immune system into overdrive., Water helps energize your muscles, improve bowel function, and balance your body's fluid levels.You should drink 8 glasses of water every day.


Avoid quenching your thirst with soda, alcohol, tea, or coffee, as these drinks actually dehydrate you.

, When it is metabolized in the body, alcohol results in the formation of harmful chemicals, which can destroy white blood cells. Alcohol also decreases the absorption of many vitamins and minerals, adversely affecting white blood cell count., Getting adequate sleep not only improves your mood and energy levels, it prevents strokes and helps you manage your weight.Sufficient deep sleep also helps the cells replenish and regenerate and is therefore necessary if you want to maintain a healthy immune system.,, Hygiene goes beyond looking and smelling your best. Taking the proper precautions can help prevent the onset and spread of infections or other illnesses.


Wash your hands regularly with soap and water. This is help get rid of any dirt, germs, or bacteria you may have picked up throughout the day. You should wash your hands after using the restroom, before, after, and while cooking food, after handling animals or animal waste, and before eating.
Shower daily. If you don't want to wash your hair every day, then invest in a shower cap and rinse your body with soap and water. Use a loofah or body sponge to remove excess dirt and dead skin cells.
Brush your teeth twice a day, and floss every night. This will help prevent the gum disease Gingivitis.

, Stress isn't just an emotion; it has physical repercussions, and chronic stress can negatively affect your immune system.Stress strains the body's resources, which can decrease the function of your immune system.Overcoming stress can be done in two ways, and will ideally involve a little of both. Avoid the activities and people that cause you extreme stress, if possible. While this will help, you must also learn how to cope with the inevitable ups and downs of life in a healthy way. Spend time doing relaxing activities like meditating, dancing, or having sex.
If you think you have chronic stress, consider seeing a therapist or other professional to help you manage your condition.

If you're unsure which particular foods seem to cause problems for you, keep a food diary for two or more weeks.,
Write down everything you eat and drink.,
Carefully record the timing, type, and severity of reactions.,
Discuss your findings with a dietitian or health care provider.,
Once you have collected thorough information about your diet and symptoms and have discussed it with a medical or nutritional professional, consider performing an elimination diet or challenge test to pinpoint particular food allergies.,
Select a list of foods to eliminate.,
Begin the elimination diet by strictly avoiding the selected foods entirely for 1 to 4 weeks.,
Keep track of all foods that cause reactions upon reintroduction.,
Repeat the process if necessary until reactions disappear.,
Perform an oral challenge test.,
Seek a test if you're still unsure and for the sake of certainty.,
Request a skin prick test.,
Request a blood allergy test.",How to Pinpoint Food Allergies," Having a record of foods and symptoms can help you associate particular foods or ingredients with particular reactions. Once you have an idea of a few foods that may be causing discomfort, you can try elimination diets or formal allergy testing at a health care provider’s office.;
, It is essential to have a complete record of everything you consume during the weeks of your food diary.


Continue to eat your regular diet, but carry a small notepad with you everywhere to record snacks, vending machine purchases, and other drinks or bites to eat you may have throughout the day.
Include all ingredients. For example, if you eat an oatmeal cookie, write down all ingredients or save the ingredient list if the cookie is store-bought. This will help you pinpoint potential allergens, as you should be able to distinguish between an oat and an egg allergy by knowing exactly what everything you eat contains and performing an elimination and reintroduction later.

, In some cases, food intolerance can be confused with actual allergic reactions, and temporal reactions may point to the wrong offender foods.


Write down the details of symptoms such as itchiness, swelling, hives, stomach discomfort, diarrhea, nausea, cramps, fever, and any other reactions of the skin or gastrointestinal tract. This will help identify the type of sensitivity you have and the management techniques that will be most appropriate for your food intolerance or allergy.

, Once you have a detailed food diary, you can discuss potential offending foods with a nutrition specialist or allergist to identify particular foods to avoid or strategies to reduce reactions.

, If you experience anaphylaxis from any foods at all, do not attempt to perform an elimination diet or oral challenge without the supervision of a physician. If your reactions are typically mild or nondescript, however, an elimination diet or oral challenge can help narrow the list of possibilities.

, After carefully reviewing your food journal for foods that appear to be related with symptoms, make a list of foods to eliminate entirely from your diet, albeit temporarily.


Unless you suspect an allergy to a very pervasive ingredient, such as gluten or lactose, avoid dramatically restricting your daily diet by selecting no more than five individual foods to eliminate at a time.

, Continue recording your diet and symptoms during this time. If symptoms have subsided or disappeared, add one food each week back into your diet and continue to track reactions.


If the re-introduced food causes no reaction for the entire week, cross it off your list of potential allergens and introduce the next food the following week. Continue this way until you have identified the particular food or foods that cause reactions, avoiding them and discontinuing the challenge for the week if your symptoms return.
Be thorough when eliminating foods. For instance, if you suspect that honey is the allergen, check labels for cookies, sauces, cereals, flavored nuts, bottled teas. If you eat a lot of pre-packaged or prepared items, always check ingredient labels to see whether foods you might not suspect could possibly contain the potential allergen.

, Make a list of the food that caused symptoms and keep the food out of your daily diet until you can discuss the reactions with a health professional or get tested for the specific allergen.


If you experienced a reaction from a food with more than one ingredient, write down all ingredients in the food item, including additives, preservatives, dyes, and nutritional supplements. Although applesauce, mustard, or soda may seem to be the allergen, the offender could really be a spice, food coloring, or sugar substitute.

, If you continue to experience symptoms, albeit reduced in severity or frequency, it is possible you identified the majority of allergens in your diet or that you missed hidden allergens that are present in processed foods.


If you need help tweaking your elimination diet, consult a dietician or allergist for advice. In some cases, he or she may be able to examine your list of suspect foods and your food diary to identify potential areas for experimentation.
For example, a nutritionist may be able to look at your notes and identify offending food groups or types (such as seeded fruits or emulsifiers in sauces), cross-contamination (often with nuts or grains), or incomplete elimination (due to hidden sources of the offending ingredient or multiple published names of ingredients on food labels).

, If you experience swelling, hives, or any symptom of anaphylaxis upon eating certain foods, do not perform an oral challenge test without the direct supervision of a physician or allergy specialist.


An oral challenge test involves consuming small but increasing portions of a single potential allergen, allowing time in between increasing doses to detect reactions. If no reaction is experienced, an increased amount is consumed.
Only one specific food is tested at a time in oral challenge tests to avoid confusion with other potential allergens. Do not perform more than one oral challenge test per week unless under the supervision of a health professional.

, In many cases, it can be difficult to pinpoint food allergies. If you have already performed a food diary exercise and an elimination diet or oral challenge, a health professional should be able to specify potential allergens through skin prick tests or blood tests. In cases of mild or variable reactions to foods, multiple types of food allergy discovery methods are necessary to confirm a particular allergy. Examining the combination of information gained from food diaries, elimination and oral challenge attempts, and skin or blood allergy tests usually helps identify specific food allergies.

, In most cases, skin prick tests can be performed quickly and safely in the office of your primary care provider or in that of an allergy specialist.


Skin prick tests involve drawing a grid on your skin and inserting tiny amounts of potential offenders under the surface of the skin. Any square on the grid that shows a reaction may indicate a specific food allergy or sensitivity.

, Blood tests for allergies are able to screen for many more food allergies than skin prick tests, and can sometimes provide information that better represents true allergies (skin prick tests may only indicate a skin allergy to contact with the food).


A blood allergy test involves a small blood draw that will be sent to a laboratory for testing. It can take several weeks to get results, which often includes a print-out of all tested foods and the particular results for each food.

Use only green cleaners.,
Stick to a weekly cleaning routine.,
Get a HEPA vacuum.,
Place covers on your pillows and mattresses.,
Wash all linens at least once a week.,
Wash or remove fabric window treatments.,
Replace caulk in your bathrooms.",How to Allergy Proof Your Home1," Choose only green cleaners, which are ones that do not contain bleach and quats (quaternary ammonium compounds). These chemicals are known for triggering allergic reactions. Or, make your own home cleaning solution by mixing together 50% water and 50% vinegar in a spray bottle.Some groups, such as the Environmental Working Group (EWG), evaluate and list green cleaning products on their websites.;
, On the same day each week, mop/vacuum your floors. Use a dusting wand or microfiber cloth to wipe down other surfaces. Don’t forget to look up top, too. Ceiling fans, crown molding, and the tops of bookshelves are all places where allergens can gather.If possible, allergy sufferers should leave household cleaning to someone else. If the person with allergies must clean, wear a disposable dust mask, especially while vacuuming.

, These types of vacuums are designed to remove and trap small particles, even down to 0.3 microns in size. Look for the seal of the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (or a similar organization for your country). Be aware that some vacuums are marketed as “allergen removers,” without being HEPA.Throw out and wipe down the debris collection area of your vacuum regularly. This will keep allergens from sneaking back out into your home.

, Buy covers that are woven with a fabric pore size smaller than 6 microns. This means that the openings in the weave are too small to let in dust mites and other allergens. The cover should zip-on and be washable for even more protection. Buy enough covers to fit your box spring, mattress, and sleep/throw pillows.Non-woven covers have a shorter lifespan and are more likely to collect allergens in their dimpled areas., Gather all of your bed sheets, pillowcases, and linen covers. Throw everything into the washing machine and set it to “Hot.” You want the water to get to at least 130 degrees Fahrenheit (54 degrees Celsius) in order to kill off the allergens. Dry everything on high heat.Don’t forget to wash your children’s stuffed animals. Throw them in your dryer on high heat for a half-cycle (around 20 minutes) to kill off any dust mites., Choose curtains that are machine-washable and clean them on a monthly basis, at minimum. You can also vacuum them weekly using a brush attachment. Even better, replace the fabric with wooden blinds or shades., Every two years or so, peel up the caulk around your sinks and tubs and apply a fresh coat. Remove and replace any cracked or damaged tiles at the same time. Cleaning your bathroom carefully as well will keep mold at bay."

Add mats to all doorways.,
Remove or store any clutter.,
Replace flooring with hardwood or tile.,
Select easy-to-clean furniture.,
Keep your pets well groomed.",How to Allergy Proof Your Home2," Place a mat outside each entryway and one inside as well. These mats will catch and trap many irritants, keeping your home cleaner. Shake them out often. You could also make a policy of removing your shoes when inside and ask guests to do the same.If you go with no-shoes option, place a basket or bookshelf bin by each doorway for shoe storage.

, Go from room to room and gather any items that gathering dust or need to be thrown away. Recycle or toss any extra newspapers or magazines. Look for any knickknacks that you can place into plastic bins for storage.Don’t forget to look over your child’s room. Extra toys or stuffed animals could be donated or stored in bins.

, Carpet absorbs almost every category of allergen, like pet dander and dust. Pulling up the carpet, especially in your bedroom and bathrooms, will substantially reduce your level of allergens in your home. If you must have carpet, go with a low-pile and shampoo it frequently.If you are worried about your floors being too cold, add in some washable area rugs., Look for dressers, chairs, bed frames, and other pieces that are made of less allergenic materials, like plastic, metal, or leather. Some types of sealed or natural woods are also okay if they are without major grooves where dust can hide. Avoid upholstered furniture whenever possible as it is next to impossible to fully clean.While vintage wood or painted furniture can be attractive to the eye, it might harbor problematic allergens like off-gas and lead paint., Bathe and comb your pets as often as you can. This is especially important to do during seasonal changes when loose hair and dander reaches its peak. Establish a “pet-free zone” in your home, usually your bedroom, where the air quality will be close to dander-free.People who ban their cats or dogs from their bedrooms are less likely to develop animal allergies as an adult."

Toss any plug-ins.,
Open the windows.,
Take care of your indoor plants.,
Install true exhaust fans.,
Use a hygrometer.,
Complete an air testing kit.,
Meet with an allergist.,
Change your air filters.",How to Allergy Proof Your Home3," Those cute little plug-in air fresheners or candles may be sending out volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into your home’s air. These VOCs can then cause or make worse any respiratory problems. They can also trigger headaches and migraines., Go into each room and crack at least one window on a weekly basis. Pollen counts peak between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m., so it’s best to open everything up in the early morning or evening. Even keeping your windows open for ten minutes can refresh the air in your home.Installing screens on your windows and keeping your air conditioning running will help to limit the outdoor allergens (and pests) that will enter your home., Household plants, such as English Ivy, can absorb toxins in the air and help to keep your home allergen free. However, they can also release mold into the air if they are overwatered or not trimmed back. Select plants that you are comfortable caring for and you’ll see cleaner air as a result., The fans in your kitchen and bathroom should send the air they suck in directly outside. Otherwise, you may be shooting dangerous moisture and particles into your attic or right back into your home. Follow the track of your exhaust fans and install new ones if necessary., Purchase this device at your local hardware store and go from room-to-room checking the readings. Follow the instructions on the package. If you get more than 60 percent humidity in any space, then you’ll want to put a humidifier in that area. High humidity creates an ideal breeding ground for mold.High temperature can also contribute to mold. Try to keep your home temperature between 68 and 72 degrees Fahrenheit (20-22 Celsius)., Buy a household air care kit at a hardware store or online. Follow the directions carefully and gather the samples as requested. When you send off the materials, you’ll receive a report back that will assess the levels of allergens, such as dust mites, in your home. This will help you to target certain problem areas., They will perform a series of tests to see exactly what you are allergic to. They can also offer suggestions regarding minimizing allergens in the home. Some will even do “home visits” to allergy-proof your space., Look at the manufacturer’s instructions for your AC unit and change filters according to that schedule. Install a filter that has a MERV rating of 8 to 12. A pleated filter is a good idea, too. For extra protection, add portable room air filters. These trap allergens in the air and require regular cleaning/filter changes.Make sure that none of your portable filters produce ozone as part of their cleaning process. This can irritate allergy sufferers."

Consult your doctor.,
Take antihistamines.,
Use decongestants.,
Ask your doctor about steroids.,
Discuss allergy-reducing injections.",How to Prevent Cat Allergies1," When you suffer from cat allergies, talk to your doctor about the severity of your symptoms. If the allergy is severe, your doctor may recommend moving your pet to a new home. If the symptoms are mild, your doctor may recommend lifestyle changes or medications.


The type of drug and the dosage for you by your doctor will vary depending on your particular case, so always follow your doctor’s and the manufacturer’s instructions for each medication.;
, Your allergic reaction causes your body to create excess histamine. An antihistamine works by blocking the receptors that the excess histamine would normally bind to, thereby negating the cellular effect of higher histamine in your blood. This means is will help alleviate your allergy symptoms, such as sneezing, itchy eyes, and runny nose. Generally, first generation antihistamines, like Benadryl, cause more drowsiness, so you may choose to avoid those. Other side effects of these medications include dizziness, dry mouth, headache, and GI upset. You may need to experiment with different ones to find the one that works best for you.


Some common brands of antihistamines include Allegra, Astelin, Benadryl, and Claritin.Long term use of antihistamines generally is safe. However, it can cause side effects and liver issues, especially for people who are at risk of these.

, Decongestants can be used to treat the symptoms of congestion caused by allergies. This includes nasal and throat congestion. It also helps with other common allergy symptoms, so it may be a better option if you suffer from other cat allergy symptoms along with your congestion.


The most popular brand of decongestant is Sudafed. However, decongestants are sometimes combined with antihistamine, which can be found in Allegra-D and Dimetapp Decongestant., Steroids work by suppressing your immune system, thereby reducing inflammation. These medications work best when used on a regular basis instead of an as needed basis and are only available by prescription. They can take longer to start working, so give at least two weeks before deciding if it works for you.Steroids for allergies usually include nasal sprays such as Flonase and Nasonex.
Although long term oral steroid usage is not recommended, intranasal steroids do not show the same long-term side effects. Because of this, long-term usage is generally acceptable of intranasal steroids as long as you use a low dose and use it only during allergy season., If your symptoms are hard to control, having a series of anti-allergy injections, also known as immunotherapy, can help reduce your allergic reactions to cats. These shots introduce a small amount of the cat allergen into your system. Every one to two weeks, you will get another shot that increases the dose of the cat allergen, which goes on typically for three to six months. It works to help train your immune system to tolerate the cat allergen.


These injections can take years to achieve their full effect. Maintenance shots are needed every four weeks for five years.
This option may be desirable if you really want to have or love cats but can't fight your allergy any other way.
It doesn't always work. It also should not be undertaken if the patient is elderly, under five years old, or is immunocompromised.Be aware that allergy shots can be very expensive and may not be covered by insurance.

"
"
Avoid visiting households that own cats.,
Take care being around people who own cats.,
Avoid holding cats.",How to Prevent Cat Allergies2," If your allergy is severe, ask the people in advance if they own cats. If you find they do, let them know that you won't be able to come because you are allergic. To still spend time with these friends, ask to meet them at a different place or invite them over instead.


If they are really good friends or you can’t avoid going to visit, ask if they have a cat-free zone. If not, see if they can create one for you by keeping the cat in another room, vacuuming, and changing linens to reduce the cat dander., Once you visit a place that has a cat, the cat dander left on your clothing can cause a continued allergic reaction. When you return home, wash your clothes on in hot water in order to remove the dander from your clothes.This is true of people who own cats. Their clothes likely have dander on then, especially if you can see visible cat hair. Without making a big deal out of it, simply let such people know that you have a bad allergy to cats and that you will have to keep your distance.
In the workplace, this may mean sitting away from cat owners. However, don't be rude about it. You may have an allergy but the cat owner also has feelings. Explain things kindly, in the spirit of compromise.

, This may seem like common sense, but even if you love cats, avoid direct contact with any cat. This will minimize the chances of setting off your allergy because your allergies can be triggered by the allergens left on your hands. There is a protein in the saliva of cats (Fel D1) that seems to trigger allergic reactions.By not stroking the cat, you avoid picking up this allergen. If you must pet the cat, wash your hands immediately with soap and warm water.You should also avoid bringing a cat close to your face or kissing a cat.

Keep the cat out of the house.,
Designate cat-free zones.,
Try a separation period.,
Have the cat bathed weekly.,
Groom the cat daily.",How to Prevent Cat Allergies3," If you can’t bring yourself to get rid of your cat, try making him an outside cat. This will limit your exposure to him. You can keep your cat in a cattery or cat house, located in the garden. This allows him freedom to roam outdoors during the day.

, A reduction in the cat dander in the areas of the house where you spend most of your time will aid your allergies. Don't allow the cat to enter your bedroom at any time. Since you sleep here, you will breath in cat dander all night if he/she is hanging around in there. Keep the doors shut to any rooms you don't want cats to enter.


You have to keep this up at all times. Any cat dander can aggravate your allergies. Plus, the more everyone does it, the more it'll become an ingrained habit., To test if your cat is really causing your allergies, send him away to stay with someone else for a month or two. Clean your house very well when he leaves to get rid of all the dander and clean it at least once a week in case any dander remains. Track your allergy symptoms over this time period, noting how they change.


If he is really the problem, you should see a change in your allergies pretty quickly., Although your cat will likely not enjoy it, you should have him bathed once a week. This can be done by a household member who isn't allergic. If you live by yourself, look into paying for a cat groomer to do it. try to wash you cat a maximum of twice a week as washing them creates tangles in their fur and dries out their skin.


Also consider using allergen reducing shampoos. These help cut down on how much dander your cat will shed on a daily basis., To cut down on shedding, brush or comb your cat's fur thoroughly each day for 10 to 15 minutes. Make sure you discard the fur after each grooming. To avoid spreading allergens inside your home, do this outside. If possible, have a non-allergic member of your household do this for you.


Grooming will improve the texture of the cat's coat, which will help remove all sources of allergens from the cat’s spittle, any outdoor pollen and dirt, and anything else the cat has brushed up against.
Although this doesn’t reduce the allergens, it may reduce the spread of them by reducing the amount your cat sheds."
"
Clean your home frequently.,
Wear an air filter mask when cleaning.,
Use a HEPA filter.",How to Prevent Cat Allergies4," When you have a cat, try to clean often. Dust, wash linens, and brush off sofa surfaces at least once a week. Use brushes that attract pet hair, duct tape around your hand, or a lint roller to collect hairs from areas where your cat hangs out. Discard all hair immediately. You can also:


Use damp dusting to help keep down the amount of allergens blown into the air.
On a daily basis, sweep the floors where pets frequents. Allergens on the floor will blow into the air if walked or sat on.
If you can, replace your carpeting with tile or wood flooring. If you do have carpet, always use HEPA filters in your vacuum.
Wash all cat toys, bedding, and your own bedding often in hot water. This will also reduce the allergens floating around your home.

, If you own a cat, always wear a mask when you clean, especially in areas where the cat spends most of his time. The mask will keep out any allergens from your breathing canals, which will reduce any allergic reactions you may have.


If you have a significant other or roommate, ask him or her to clean the areas frequented by the cat. If not, think about hiring help to clean for you.

, In order to remove some of the allergens from the air in your home, use a HEPA filter in your heating and cooling system. You should also use one in your vacuum as well. This kind of filter is finer quality, so it collects airborne allergens to help prevent your cat allergies. You can also add a HEPA air purifier to the room where the cat spends most of his time.


To help this, you should vacuum daily or at least once a week. If you can find one, buy a vacuum cleaner that is guaranteed to collect pet hair and dander.

Recognize the warning signs.,
Seek out your doctor.,
Plan the road to recovery.,
Follow your doctor's orders exactly once at home.,
Take it slow and easy.,
Eat a healthy diet.,
Revisit your doctor if necessary.,
Resume your usual routine gradually, and with your doctor's permission.,
Protect yourself and your immune system.,
Take care about returning to school or work.",How to Recover From Pneumonia," For healthy individuals, pneumonia can start like the flu or a bad cold. The major difference is that the feeling of being sick will last much longer when you are suffering from pneumonia. If you are experiencing prolonged sickness, you may have pneumonia, so it is important to know the symptoms to look out for. Specific symptoms will vary from person to person, but they generally include some or all the following. Fever, sweating and shaking chills
Cough, which may produce phlegm
Chest pain when you breathe or cough
Shortness of breath
Tiredness
Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea
Confusion
Headache;
, If you are experiencing the above symptoms, and have a fever of 102°F (39°C) or higher, you should notify your healthcare professional. He will be able to advise you on the best course of action. This is especially true for vulnerable groups, which include children under two, adults over 65 and people with a weakened immune system. , Once at your doctor's office, she will perform a number of tests to determine if you do indeed have pneumonia. If you do, the doctor will be able to either recommend treatment or, in some cases, suggest hospitalization. When you visit the doctor, you can expect her to begin with a physical exam and to possibly move on to a number of other tests. The doctor will listen to your lungs with a stethoscope, listening specifically for crackling, bubbling, and rumbling sounds when you inhale, and for areas of your lungs where the sound of breathing cannot be heard as normal. The doctor may order a chest X-ray.
Note that viral-based pneumonia does not have a known treatment. Your doctor will inform you what to do in this case.
For hospitalized cases, you will receive antibiotics, intravenous fluids, and possibly oxygen therapy to treat pneumonia.

, Pneumonia is treated primarily with antibiotics, usually azithromycin, clarithromycin, or doxycycline. Your doctor will chose which specific antibiotic you should take based upon your age and medical history. Once your doctor provides you with a prescription, have it filled immediately by bringing it to your local pharmacy. It is very important that you finish the full course of antibiotics prescribed by your doctor and follow any instructions written on the bottle, unless instructed otherwise by your doctor. Even if you feel better, stopping antibiotics early can create bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics., For otherwise healthy individuals, the antibiotics prescribed by your doctor will typically begin to make you feel better in approximately one to three days. During these first days of recovery, it is vital that you get plenty of rest and that you drink plenty of fluids. Even after you begin to feel better you should not overexert yourself, as your immune system is still recovering. This is important because overexertion may lead to a reoccurrence of pneumonia.


Drinking fluids (particularly water) will help break up mucus in your lungs.
Again, finish the entire course of medication prescribed by your doctor.

, Eating the right food cannot cure pneumonia, however, a good diet can assist in a normal recovery. Colorful fruits and vegetables should be eaten regularly. They contain antioxidants, which help your body resist and recover from disease. Whole grains are important as well. They are a good source of carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals that will boost your immune system and boost energy. Finally add protein-rich foods to your diet. Protein provides the body with anti-inflammatory fats. Always check with your doctor if you plan on making significant changes to your diet.


Try eating oats and brown rice to add whole grains to your diet.
Try eating beans, lentils, skinless chicken, and fish to add protein to your diet. Avoid fatty meats, such as red meat or processed meat.
Again, drink plenty of fluids to hydrate and help thin out any mucus in your lungs.
Some studies have suggested that vitamin D helps with recovery from pneumonia, though this is unproven.
Chicken soup is a good source of fluids, electrolytes, protein, and vegetables!

, Some (but not all) doctors will schedule a follow up visit. This will typically take place one week after your initial visit, and the doctor will want to make sure the prescribed antibiotics are working. If you do not feel any improvement over the course of this first week, you should call your doctor immediately to schedule a follow up appointment.


Normal recovery time from pneumonia is one to three weeks, though you should begin to feel better after several days of antibiotics.
If symptoms persist for a week after you have begun taking antibiotics, this may be a sign you are not recovering, and you should contact your doctor immediately.
If the infection persists with antibiotic treatment, patients may still require hospital-level care.

, Keep in mind that you will be easily exhausted and you may want to start slow. Try to be out of bed and be active without becoming too tired. You can gradually work your way up to one or two daily activities in order to give your body a chance to fully recuperate. You can begin with simple breathing exercises in bed. Inhale deeply and hold for three seconds, then release with lips partially closed.
Work your way up to short walks around your home or apartment. Once this is not exhausting, begin to walk longer distances.

, Remember that while recovering from pneumonia, your immune system is in a weakened state. It is a good idea to protect your weakened immune system by avoiding individuals who are ill and by avoiding highly populated areas such as shopping malls or markets.

, Given the risk of infection, you should not return to school or work until your temperature returns to normal and you are no longer coughing up mucus. Again, doing too much can risk a reoccurrence of pneumonia.

Determine whether you have chronic bronchitis.",How to Treat Bronchitis," Keeping yourself hydrated is important while your body is fighting infection, and drinking fluids with a warm temperature can help soothe your sore throat and keep the phlegm, the substance you cough up when you have bronchitis, loose and easier to expel.Try these warm fluids to help you get through bronchitis:


Warm water with lemon and honey. Heat up a mug of warm water and add lemon juice and honey to taste. The honey coats and soothes your throat, and the lemon provides vitamin C and other nutrients.
Chamomile, peppermint, or another herbal tea. Herbal teas, especially those made to help treat sore throats, serve the dual purpose of hydrating your body and treating your symptoms.
Warm soup. Chicken broth or soup is nourishing and soothing. Garlic soup is another healing option that helps treat the symptoms of bronchitis. Sauté minced garlic in a little olive oil, add chicken or vegetable broth, heat it to a simmer, and drink it hot.
Saltwater. You don't want to drink saltwater, but gargling warm saltwater can help soothe your irritated throat membranes. Stir a teaspoon of salt into 8 ounces of warm water. Gargle the water and spit it out.;
, Since bronchitis is an infection in your lungs, it can make you feel extremely tired. Listen to your body and take a rest, especially in the first few days of the infection, when your chest feels heavy and it's difficult to breathe. Your lungs need time to heal.At the beginning of the infection, when it's at its worst, take a few days off of work or school. Rest in bed or on the couch, and try not to go anywhere that will require you to exert yourself.
Exercising while you have a lung infection can make it worse. Avoid running, swimming, biking, and other exercises that lead to heavy breathing while you have bronchitis.

, Bronchitis can make your chest feel heavy and painful, especially when you're coughing frequently. Applying heat can help ease the pressure. Try one of the following methods of heating your chest:


Fill a hot water bottle with water and lay it on your chest.
Use a heating pad on your chest. Place it over your clothing so it doesn't overheat your skin.
Cover yourself with an electric blanket.
Take a warm bath or shower.

, When your lungs are irritated, hydrating them with warm, moist air helps sooth your bronchial passageways.If you allow your throat to dry out, your lungs can become more irritated, prolonging the infection. Try the following methods for breathing humid air:


Use a humidifier. Humidifiers are machines that add moisture to the air in a room. They're available for purchase at drugstores.
Boil a pot of water on the stove. The steam produced from the boiling water can increase the room's humidity.
Use a nebulizer to breath in saline and purified water mists.
Place a bowl of water on the radiator. The heat from the radiator causes the water to evaporate and humidify the air.
Take a steamy shower or bath. Make sure the bathroom door is closed so you get the benefits of breathing in the moist air.

, Inhaling smoke can bring on painful coughing fits when you have bronchitis. It can also delay your lungs' healing process. Avoid smoking or inhaling secondhand smoke. Stay away from these lung irritants, too:


Areas with excessive pollution, such as streets with high traffic volume.
Areas with a strong chemical smell, like the inside of factories, hair salons, and gas stations.

, The act of coughing when you have bronchitis helps expel the infection from your lungs. Coughing up phlegm is a normal symptom. If you take an over-the-counter cough suppressant, you prevent your lungs from healing.


If your coughing is extremely painful or constant, you should see a doctor to make sure you aren't experiencing symptoms for something other than bronchitis. Often times pneumonia and bronchitis have similar symptoms. It is important to see a doctor in order to differentiate the two.
Never take an over-the counter suppressant without first consulting a doctor.

, Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) containing aspirin or ibuprofen can help relieve the pain caused by the infection in your chest. Be sure to not to take more than the recommended dosage., You should avoid taking cough suppressants if possible, but there's nothing wrong with taking medicine meant to treat your sore throat.


Look for an over-the-counter medicine containing benzocaine, with helps soothe irritated throat tissue. It comes in syrup and cough drop form.
Use natural cough drops. Cough drops made with simple ingredients like honey and lemon are available at health food stores. If you feel up to it, make your own cough drops following these steps:

Pour a half cup of honey and a few drops of peppermint extract or eucalyptus oil into a small pot.
Place the pot over medium high heat. Stir it constantly as it comes to a boil.
Monitor the temperature of the honey with a candy thermometer. Remove it from heat when it reaches 300 degrees F (149 degrees C), the the temperature at which the honey will harden when it cools.
Use a spoon to scoop drops of honey onto a baking sheet lined with oiled parchment or wax paper. Wait for the drops to harden, then suck on them to soothe your throat.



, In such cases herbs such as Adhatoda vasica, Hedychium spicatum, Curcuma longa, Terminalia belerica, Ocimum sanctum, and Glycyrrhiza glabra might help to soothe the bronchial linings, liquefy the mucus, helps to get it expelled from the lungs and provide relief from the symptoms of constant irritant coughing etc. Herbs such as zingiber officinale, Piper nigrum, Piper longum,Tinospora cordifolia might help to improve the immunity of the patient suffering from chronic bronchitis. These herbs help to prevent the frequent attacks of bronchitis. Natural remedies are not subject to the same testing regime as medicines and may not contain the ingredients listed on the label.

, Your body usually heals itself from bronchitis after a week or so. However, there are cases in which the lungs are unable to expel the infection.Make a doctor's appointment if you experience the following:


You have a pre-existing condition that could affect your body's ability to take care of the infection on its own.
You cough so much you can't sleep at night.
You cough up blood.
It feels weak to cough.
You keep coughing, yet hardly any/no mucous comes up.
You notice an increase in the amount or thickness of the phlegm you cough up.
Your coughing lasts more than a week, and doesn't seem to be going away.
You have a fever that lasts more than a couple of days.
You feel light-headed or have trouble getting enough oxygen.

, If your cough keeps you from sleeping at night, or causes extreme pain, your doctor may prescribe or recommend an over-the-counter cough suppressant. Coughing constantly over a long period of time can be hard on your body, and your doctor may decide that a cough suppressant would be beneficial to your health., Bronchitis is usually caused by a virus, but since it irritates the lungs, it makes the body more susceptible to getting a bacterial infection at the same time.


If your doctor determines you have a bacterial infection, you may be prescribed an antibiotic. The antibiotics will help heal the bacterial infection, but will not treat the underlying case of bronchitis.
Smoking increases the chances of getting a bacterial infection in your lungs.

, Chronic bronchitis is a lung infection that persists over the course of several years, with symptoms that ebb and flow over time. It is usually caused by smoking or the continual inhalation of another lung irritant.If you have chronic bronchitis, your doctor may prescribe an anticholinergic bronchodilator or steroids to help open up the lungs' constricted airways.
If your body is having trouble delivering oxygen to your bloodstream, your doctor may prescribe oxygen therapy, such as the use of an oxygen tank at home.
You may also benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation, a breathing exercise program facilitated by a therapist."

Know the properties of various poisonous gases that could be used for a gas attack.",How to Survive a Gas Attack1," These include:Tear gas (lacrimators) - such as chloroacetophenone and o-chlorobenzalmalononitrile; these are often used to disperse crowds. They will impact the eyes, throat, nose, and sometimes skin.
Chlorine gas (choking gas) - bleach odor, yellow-green color. Also phosgene and diphosgene are choking gases.Mustard gas (vesicant or blister gas) - colorless, can smell of mustard/garlic/onions or have no smell.
Nerve gases - G-agents Sarin, Tabun, Soman and V-agents - odorless, colorless, and tasteless. The poisons enter through the skin, inhalation and ingestion, and death is very fast.
Sternutators (vomiting gases) - diphenylchloroarsine or adamsite, causes severe sneezing, coughing, nausea and vomiting.

"
Be aware of any yellow-green gas floating around with the strong smell of bleach.,
Move quickly into an area with clean air in order to minimize exposure to the gas.,
Grab a cotton pad or any fabric and soak it in urine.,
Remove all clothing that may have been exposed to the gas, being sure not to let the clothes touch your face or head.,
Clean your body thoroughly with a lot of soap and water.,
Call emergency services and wait for help to arrive.

",How to Survive a Gas Attack2," Some soldiers in WWI described it as pepper and pineapple.If you are exposed to chlorine gas, you may have trouble breathing or seeing and will feel a burning sensation.;
,


If indoors, exit the building as quickly as possible.
If outdoors, move to the highest ground. Since chlorine gas is more dense than air, it will sink to the ground.

, Hold it up to your nose as a mask. The Canadian military survived the first large-scale chlorine gas attack in WWI by using urine instead of water, under the presumption that the urine crystallizes the gas, Cut the clothes off so that they don't need to make additional contact with your skin as they're peeled off. Seal the clothes in plastic bags.

, Rinse your eyes with water if your vision is blurred or your eyes burn; if you wear contact lenses, throw them away. However, water mixed with Chlorine gas can turn into Hydrochloric acid, so be careful.

Be aware of a usually colorless gas that smells like mustard, garlic, or onions--but note it doesn't always have an odor.,
Move from the area from where it was released onto higher ground, as mustard gas is heavier than air.,
Remove all clothing that may have been exposed to the gas, being sure not to let the clothes touch your face or head.,
Rinse any exposed parts of your body with plain water.,

Reduce your exposure to fungal and bacterial pathogens.,
Reduce your exposure and susceptibility to viral pathogens.,
Reduce your exposure to ambient air pollutants.,
Reduce your exposure to indoor air pollutants.",How to Reduce Lung Inflammation1," Pathogens are microorganisms that can cause disease. Certain species of bacteria and fungi can cause lung inflammation. Exposure to some of these pathogens is associated with occupational or environmental conditions. For example “Hot Tub Lung,” and “Farmer’s Lung” are common names for two kinds of mold-related lung inflammation. Mold can grow almost anywhere that is moist enough. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), “the key to mold control is moisture control.” To help prevent mold in your home, keep the humidity between 30-60%. If you find mold, clean the affected surface with a detergent and dry the surface completely.
Prevent condensation by properly insulating areas. Avoid installing carpet in bathrooms or kitchens, where sink splashes may keep the carpet damp.
Use appropriate personal protective equipment such as masks or respirators when cleaning moldy areas.;
, Influenza is a common cause of pneumonia, which is infection and inflammation of the lungs. Most cases of influenza do not lead to pneumonia, but those that do can be very serious. Influenza and pneumonia can both be prevented with vaccines.


Talk to your healthcare provider to see if you are a candidate for influenza and/or pneumonia vaccinations.
Avoid contact with people with influenza and/or pneumonia.
If you must come into contact with people with influenza and/or pneumonia, wear appropriate protection, such as a mask, gloves, or gown.

, Ambient air pollutants are found outdoors, and originate from natural processes, fires, and industrial operations. Six pollutants are designated as criteria air pollutants by the EPA. These include nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxides, ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and lead. These are monitored by the EPA and are subject to a number of regulations. Particles smaller than 10 micrometers are particularly harmful, as they can get deep into the lungs. Exposure can be particularly problematic for those with pre-existing lung conditions.


You can monitor the Air Quality Index in the region where you live. This information and some guidelines for exposure are available at http://www.airnow.gov/.
If you are going to be in an environment where there are aerosolized particles or chemical vapors, it is important to wear proper protective equipment.
Get fitted for a mask or respirator. The Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) provides guidelines about which masks or respirators are best for certain exposures. , Exposure to indoor air pollutants can cause headaches, fatigue, and a number of other non-specific symptoms. This sometimes causes entire buildings of workers to fall ill. Commonly encountered indoor air pollutants include combustion products, volatile organic compounds, and formaldehyde. Ventilate your home properly with clean outdoor air.
Get rid of the source of the pollutants, if possible.
Install a home air cleaner. "

Educate yourself about your medical conditions.,
Discuss your current medications with your physician.,
Inquire about medications available to reduce lung inflammation.",How to Reduce Lung Inflammation2," In order to understand how your medical conditions may be related to lung inflammation, it is important to educate yourself. There are many helpful resources available on the internet, including Mayo Clinic, The American Lung Association, The American Heart Association, Cancer.gov, and Cancer.org. These resources have information written specifically for the layperson.


Write down your diagnoses or have your healthcare provider write down your diagnoses.
Ask your healthcare provider about resources to better understand your medical conditions.

, Chemotherapy, radiation, and some medications can contribute to lung inflammation. There are other medications available that can help reduce lung inflammation, if you have been diagnosed with this condition. It is important to know what the risks from any medications or treatments are.


Write down, or have your healthcare provider write down, the names of all of your medications and treatments.
Ask for resources to read about the specific drugs and treatments you may be receiving.

, There are a number of medications available that can be used to treat lung inflammation and associated conditions. The type of medication used for treatment depends on your particular diagnosis. For example, if you have pneumonia, you’ll likely be prescribed antibiotics that will help destroy pathogens causing the infection. If you have lung fibrosis, there are fewer drug options to slow the disease, but new therapies are entering the drug market. A list of drugs that can reduce lung inflammation or are used to treat related diseases are shown below.


Beclamethasone dipropionate (inhaled corticosteroid used to treat COPD) Fluticasione propionate (inhaled corticosteroid used to treat COPD) Flunisolide (inhaled corticosteroid used to treat COPD) Budesonide (inhaled corticosteroid used to treat COPD) Mometasone (inhaled corticosteroid used to treat COPD) Ciclesonide (inhaled corticosteroid used to treat COPD) Methylprednisone (oral steroid used to treat COPD) Prednisolone (oral steroid used to treat COPD) Prednisone (oral steroid used to treat COPD) Hydrocortisone (oral steroid used to treat COPD) Dexamethasone (oral steroid used to treat COPD) Cromolyn sodium (inhaled nonsteroid used to treat COPD) Nedocromil sodium (inhaled nonsteroid used to treat COPD) Amoxicillin (antibiotic used to treat bacterial pneumonia) Benzylpenicillin (antibiotic used to treat bacterial pneumonia) Azithromycin (antibiotic used to treat bacterial pneumonia) Pirfenidone (drug used to slow lung scarring caused by pulmonary fibrosis) Nintedanib (drug used to slow lung scarring caused by pulmonary fibrosis) Ceftriaxone (antibiotic used to treat pneumonia and respiratory infections)Supplemental oxygen (used to ease symptoms in a wide range of lung disorders)

Quit smoking.,
Keep your immune system healthy.,
Maintain a healthy weight.,
Exercise your lungs, especially following surgery.",How to Reduce Lung Inflammation3," Smoking is a major risk factor for lung inflammation, emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, and lung cancer. Chemicals contained in smoke are not only cancer causing, but also change how the immune system functions. Quitting smoking can be challenging, but with the correct support and planning, it is possible. There are many factors which may contribute to lung inflammation over which you have no control, but smoking is not one of them — quitting is something you can actively do to help keep your lungs healthy.


Consider writing down your goals and what you don’t like about smoking.
Gather a support system. Discuss your plans to quit smoking with you friends and family. Surround yourself with those who can support you.
Consult a smoking cessation professional. Smoking cessation professionals can help you create a plan of attack to be successful.

, A major risk factor for developing pneumonia is a weakened or suppressed immune system. Those individuals who have HIV/AIDS, are organ transplant recipients, or who have been on long-term steroid therapy are at highest risk. There are some steps you can take to ensure your immune system is functioning as well as it can.


Ensure you have adequate intake of Vitamin C. Vitamin C and zinc have been shown to improve the human immune system and also to improve the outcome of pneumonia and other infections. Get enough sleep. Studies have shown that individuals who do not get enough sleep are more susceptible to infections and recover more slowly after becoming ill. , Though no study in humans has directly linked lung inflammation to obesity, studies in animals demonstrate a link between inflammation in the lungs and chemicals produced by fat tissue. It is thought that obesity can also increase susceptibility to infections and lung damage caused by environmental factors.Get 150-300 minutes of moderate exercise per week. Brisk walking and swimming are examples of moderate exercise.Plan to eat healthy. Eat foods high in nutrient content. Avoid processed foods and alcohol. If you need help creating a healthy eating plan, talk to a dietician.Be consistent. Sticking with your healthy eating plan, exercise, and surrounding yourself with a support group can make long-term success a reality.

, The muscles surrounding your lungs can be strengthened with exercise. This can prevent infections and pneumonia, for which many people are at risk following surgery.Taking deep, even breaths can keep your lungs clear of secretions and can strengthen your lungs. In some cases, you will receive an incentive spirometer and a list of exercises. It is important to follow your healthcare provider’s recommendations with regard to exercising your lungs.

Avoid exposing yourself to people with active TB.,
Know if you are ""at-risk"".,
Lead a healthy lifestyle.,
Get the BCG vaccination to prevent TB.,
Schedule a TB test if you have been exposed to someone with tuberculosis.,
Begin immediate treatment for latent TB.,
Begin immediate treatment for active TB.,
Stay at home.,
Ventilate the room.,
Cover your mouth.,
Wear a mask.,
Finish your course of medication.",How to Prevent Tuberculosis," Obviously the most important precaution you can take to prevent TB is to avoid being around people with active TB, which is highly contagious, especially if you have already tested positive for latent TB. More specifically:


Don't spend long periods of time with anyone who has an active TB infection, especially if they have been receiving treatment for less than two weeks. In particular, it is important to avoid spending time with TB patients in warm, stuffy rooms.
If you are forced to be around TB patients, for example if you work in a care facility where TB is currently being treated, you will need to take protective measures, such as wearing a face mask, to avoid breathing in the TB bacteria.
If a friend or family member has active TB, you can help to rid them of the disease and lessen your own risk of contracting it by ensuring that they strictly follow treatment instructions.;
, Certain groups of people are considered to be more at-risk of developing TB than others. If you are a member of ones of these groups, you need to be more vigilant about protecting yourself from TB exposure. Some of the main at-risk groups are as follows:


People with weakened immune system, such as those with HIV or AIDs.
People who live with or care for someone with active TB, such as a close relative or a doctor/nurse.
People who live in crowded, confined spaces such as prisons, nursing homes or homeless shelters.
People who abuse drugs and alcohol, or have little or no access to proper health care.
People who live in or travel to countries where active TB is common, such as countries in Latin America, Africa and parts of Asia .

, People who are in poor health are more susceptible to the TB virus, as their disease resistance is lower than in healthy people. Therefore, it is important to do your best to lead a healthy lifestyle.


Eat a healthy, balanced diet with plenty of fruit, vegetables, whole grains and lean meat. Avoid fatty, sugary and processed foods.
Exercise often, at least 3 to 4 times a week. Try to incorporate some good cardiovascular exercise into your workouts, such as running, swimming or rowing.
Cut down on alcohol consumption and avoid smoking or taking drugs.
Get plenty of good quality sleep, ideally between 7 and 8 hours a night.
Maintain good personal hygiene and try to spend as much time as possible outdoors, in the fresh air., The BCG (Bacille Calmette-Guerin) vaccine is used in many countries to help prevent the spread of TB, especially among small children. However, the vaccine is not commonly used in the US, where infection rates are low and the disease is highly treatable. Therefore, the CDC does not recommend the vaccine as a routine immunization. In fact, the CDC only recommends the BCG vaccine for U.S. citizens in the following situations:


When a child has been tested negative for TB but will continue to be exposed to the disease, especially strains that are resistant to treatment.
When a healthcare worker is continually exposed to tuberculosis, especially strains that are resistant to treatment.
Before travelling to another country where tuberculosis is prevalent.

, If you have recently been exposed to someone with active TB and believe there is a chance you might have contracted the disease, it is important to consult your health care provider immediately. There are 2 methods for TB testing:



Skin test: The Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) requires injecting a protein solution sometime between 2 and 8 weeks after contact with an infected person. The patient must return to the medical provider 2 or 3 days later to have the skin reaction interpreted.

Blood test: Although it's not as commonplace as the skin test, the TB blood test only requires a single doctor visit and is less likely to result in misinterpretation by a medical professional. It is the necessary option for anyone who has received the BCG vaccination, as the vaccine can interfere with the accuracy of the tuberculin skin test.
If your TB test is positive, you will need to undergo additional testing. Health professionals will need to determine whether you have a latent TB (which is not contagious) or active TB disease before proceeding with treatment. Tests may include a chest x-ray and a sputum test., If you test positive for latent TB, you should consult with your doctor about the best course of action.


Although you don't feel sick with a latent TB, and it isn't contagious, you will probably be prescribed a course of antibiotics to kill the inactive TB germs and prevent tuberculosis from turning into an active disease.
The 2 most common treatments are: Taking isoniazid daily or twice a week. The duration of the treatment is 6 or 9 months. Or taking rifampin daily for 4 months.

, If you test positive for active TB, it is essential that you begin treatment as soon as possible.


Symptoms of active TB include cough, fever, weight loss, fatigue, night sweats, chills and a loss of appetite.
Nowadays, active TB is highly treatable with a combination of antibiotic medications, however the duration of treatment can be quite long, usually between six to twelve months.
The most common medications to treat TB include isoniazid, rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane), ethambutol (Myambutol) and pyrazinamide. With active TB, you will usually need to take a combination of these drugs, especially if you have a particularly drug-resistant strain.
If you follow your treatment plan exactly, you should start to feel better within a matter of weeks and you should no longer be contagious. However, it is essential that you finish your course of treatment, otherwise the TB will remain in your system and potentially become more drug resistant., If you have active TB, you will need to take precautionary steps to avoid passing the disease onto others. You will need to stay at home from work or school for several weeks following diagnoses and avoid sleeping or spending long periods of time in a room with other people.

, The TB virus spreads more easily in enclosed spaces with stagnant air. Therefore, you should open any windows or doors to let fresh air in and contaminated air out.

, Just like when you have a cold, you will need to cover your mouth whenever you cough, sneeze or even laugh. You can use your hand if necessary, but using a tissue is preferable.

, If you are forced to be around people, it's a good idea to wear a surgical mask that covers your mouth and nose, at least during the first three weeks following infection. This helps to lessen the risk of you passing the virus to someone else.

, It is absolutely essential that you finish whatever course of medication your doctor prescribes. Failing to do so gives the TB bacteria a chance to mutate, making the virus much more resistant to medications, and therefore more deadly. Finishing your course of medications is the safest option not only for you, but for those around you."

Ask your healthcare provider which medications you should avoid on the day of the test.
Do not smoke within 24 hours of the test.
Do not drink alcohol within 4 hours of the test.
Do not exercise strenuously within 30 minutes of the test.
Wear comfortable clothing that allows you to breath easily.
Do not eat a heavy meal within two hours of the test.;
, A history of smoking, chronic coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath are a few of the symptoms that are important for the medical staff to consider as they analyze your spirometry test results., They may show you one or more breathing techniques that you will use during the test. Pay attention to the type of breaths they take and be ready to try them yourself., This clip closes your nostrils, ensuring that all of the air you expel during the test will exit through your mouth to be measured by the spirometer., A tight seal is necessary to prevent air leakage.It is important that all the air you are about to exhale goes into the spirometer for accurate measurements., Your lungs should feel filled to their maximum., Think of this as trying to get all of your air out as quickly as possible. It is important that you exhale quickly for an accurate measurement of the volume you can expel within the first second., Your lungs and throat should feel empty. It is important that you discharge all the air for an accurate measurement of how much you exhaled in one entire breath., The test can make you feel lightheaded, so make sure to breathe evenly when appropriate to prevent dizziness., Although breathing this way may feel unnatural, this pattern allows the spirometer to measure pulmonary functions such as lung capacity and airflow.

, You might need to increase your inhalation, the speed of your exhalation, or the duration of your exhalation for the next attempt.

, Multiple measurements give you a chance to correct performance errors, and provide the necessary data for the test results., The medical professional who administered the test may not be able to give you the results right away. It depends on the type of medical professional who is administering the test. You may have to wait to speak with your doctor about the results after they’ve been reviewed by a specialist., Your height, weight, age, and sex are some of the variables the specialist considered when comparing your test results against the standard measurements. Your doctor should be able to answer questions about how these variables factored into their diagnosis., Diagnoses may include asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, . Test results might also be used to determine eligibility for surgery. Your doctor will work with you to determine the right medications and lifestyle changes necessary to maintain and improve your pulmonary health.

, In addition to using the homeopathic medicines to clear congestion, there are some useful household measures can be used for the temporary relief of congestion.


The inhalation of steam coming from boiling water can soothe nasal as well as chest congestion to a great extent. The steam acts as a humidifier and helps loosen the mucus and facilitates its easy expectoration.
Eat ginger and garlic with your meals, as this helps to fight infection. Garlic acts as an anti-microbial and ginger possesses anti-inflammatory properties.Eating spicy food, especially a hot spicy soup, dissolves mucus in the air passages, clearing out the bacteria, virus, and allergens.
Chew on 4-5 holy basil leaves each day, procured right from your garden. They are known to be anti-inflammatory and help to relieve chest congestion.
Gargling twice daily with a teaspoon of salt in a glass of water helps to soothe a sore throat, which is a common accompaniment of nasal/chest congestion.

Wash your hands with soap and water frequently.,
Avoid sharing personal items.,
Limit your exposure to people who may be infected.,
Limit the amount of time you spend in overcrowded places.,
Gargle water.,
Get vaccinated.,
Keep the weather in mind.,
Wear a face mask when exposing yourself to irritants.,
Understand why having a strong immune system is important.,
Exercise regularly.,
Eat green, leafy vegetables.,
Take vitamin C supplements.,
Get enough sleep each night.,
Quit smoking and avoid other harmful irritants.,
Stay at home when you know you have become infected.,
Cover your mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing.,
Clean objects that you or other infected individuals touch.",How to Prevent Upper Respiratory Infections," When you come into direct contact with a virus, it becomes very likely that you will develop an infection unless you wash your hands right away. When you touch something that has been exposed to a virus and do not wash your hands, you may accidentally touch your face and thus transmit the infection into your system.In order to keep this from happening, use soap and warm water to wash your hands after:


Touching door knobs
Touching commonly shared objects like the remote or the telephone
Touching handrails and other commonly used public objects
If you do not have warm water and soap available to you, you can use sanitizers, alcohols, or other disinfectants to clean your hands;
, As a preventative measure, try to avoid sharing personal items with other people, even if they don’t seem to be infected. This is particularly important if you have a weak immune system.Things to avoid sharing include:


Utensils, water glasses or bottles, and food
Towels
Toothbrushes

, If you have a friend who has come down with a URI, call them on the phone to give them your well wishes, rather than visiting them in person. A sick person can very easily transmit a virus to a healthy person (in this case, you), so take steps to avoid spending time with a sick person if you can.If you do end up visiting a sick person, or work in a health institute such as a doctor’s office, make sure to wash your hands with warm water and soap as soon as you leave the person’s side. You could also consider wearing a face mask to avoid coming into contact with any viruses.

, When you spend time in crowded places, you are more likely to come into contact with someone who is infected. Places that you should avoid, particularly during flu or cold season, include malls, parks, concert venues, community meetings, large office buildings, and local gatherings.


If your work involves spending time with large groups of people, consider wearing a face mask to lower your risk of developing a URI.

, Gargling water can help to keep your oral mucosa moist, which can help to prevent the development of infection. The water can also help to flush away bacteria, viruses, and microorganisms that may have become lodged in the lining of your throat.Try gargling water three times a day. You can also gargle warm salt water to get the same effect.

, There are vaccines that you can get that lower your chances of developing a URI. In particular, the flu vaccine is widely available and effective. These vaccines are usually given as a shot.You can usually get the flu vaccine at health centers, pharmacies, and at your doctor’s clinic.

, During cold season, consider placing a cool humidifier in your room. Humidifiers can help to keep the membranes in your nose and throat moist, which in turn can help to prevent you from developing a URI.


When you go outside when the temperatures have dropped, make sure to dress warmly.

, Dust can be harmful and can cause infection so it is advisable to avoid construction sites if possible. If you cannot, such as if you work in construction, consider wearing a mask to limit the amount of irritants that you are exposed to.Other irritants to avoid include:


Tobacco smoke, wood smoke, car exhaust fumes, pollen, and industrial pollution.
Check to make sure that your cooking vent is working properly, as cooking fumes can also cause irritation that can lead to a URI., When your immune system is functioning properly, it can help to fight off many infections that can lead to a URI; however, keeping your immune system strong can take a little bit of work, but there are many things you can do that can boost your immune system’s strength.

, When you exercise regularly, you can keep the neutrophil function in your white blood cells running properly. This function is partly responsible for fighting off infection. Moderate exercise includes brisk walking, jogging, biking, or swimming.


Try to exercise for 30 minutes five times a week when possible., These vegetables, which are also called cruciferous vegetables, can help to make your immune system stronger by regulating intra-epithelial lymphocytes in your body. These lymphocytes are stimulated by aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AhRs), which are responsible for the first line of defense in your body against foreign substances that enter your body. They also help with wound repair.


Try to eat four to five servings of green leafy vegetables every day., This vitamin is an antioxidant that may help to strengthen your immune system. Vitamin C can help to kill free radicals in your body, which can lead to infections if allowed to develop unchecked. You can take a vitamin C supplement each day; aim to get roughly 500 mg to 1,000 mg of the antioxidant per day.


You can also eat foods rich in vitamin C. These foods include citrus fruits like oranges, lemons, kiwis, mangoes, cantaloupe, papaya, pineapple, berries and watermelon., When you do not get enough sleep, it reduces your immune system’s ability to function as well as the functions of many other systems in your body. When you sleep, your body grows and repairs damaged cells and tissues, making your body stronger when it comes to fighting infection.


Everyone needs a different amount of sleep, depending on your age, lifestyle, and a variety of other factors; however, in general, adults who are 18 years and older need roughly seven to nine hours of sleep, while school-aged children need between nine and eleven hours of sleep., When you inhale cigarette smoke, the chemicals in the cigarette can cause the lining in your nose, mouth, and throat to become inflamed. When this lining becomes irritated, your body produces more mucus, which in turn can trap bacteria and viruses, thus increasing your chances of developing a URI.Other substances to avoid include chemical smoke, fumes from car exhausts and cooking, and wood smoke.

, If you have developed a URI, keep yourself at home for at least two or three days (you may need to stay at home longer depending on your symptoms). Keep in mind that every time you cough, sneeze, or even talk, you run the risk of infecting someone else.

, Because URIs are very contagious, it is important to cover your mouth and nose whenever you sneeze or cough; however, you should not do this with your hand. If possible, sneeze or cough into a tissue or the crook of your arm.The reason you should avoid coughing into your hands is because you use your hands for a variety of activities, including touching objects that others may touch, which means that you are very likely to infect others. If you do cough or sneeze into your hands, wash them with warm water and soap.

, Viruses and bacteria can be easily transmitted by touching an object that an uninfected individual also touches. Because of this, it is important to clean any objects that you touch while you are sick. You can use a 70% alcohol disinfectant to do this.These objects include:


Remote controls, keyboards, telephones, refrigerator door, stair railings, and door knobs.

Inform yourself about acute bronchitis.,
Look for a cough.,
Watch out for other common symptoms.,
See your doctor for diagnosis.,
Get treatment for acute bronchitis.,
Be aware of infant bronchitis.",How to Recognize Bronchitis Symptoms1," Acute bronchitis is the inflammation and infection of the lower respiratory tract. For it to be acute, the condition typically lasts for less than three weeks. Acute bronchitis can be due to viral or bacterial etiologies. It can even be caused by a combination of both if you end up with a case of secondary bronchitis infection.


About 90% of acute bronchitis infections cases are viral, which come from many viruses such as the adenovirus, rhinovirus, influenza virus, and coronavirus.;
, The most common symptom of bronchitis is a cough. With acute bronchitis, the cough will start out dry and hacking. After a few days, the cough will begin to produce sputum. Sputum is a type of loose mucus that can be clear, white, yellowish, and green colored. Sometimes, if the cough is harsh enough, it may be blood-tinged.Although cough is the primary symptom of bronchitis, it can be a symptom of many other diseases as well such as pneumonia, asthma, or cancer. If this is your only symptom, look for other symptoms as well to pinpoint exactly which condition you have.

, There will likely be runny nose or nasal congestion, at least to some degree. You may run a slight fever and have chills with acute bronchitis. There may be wheezing, especially at night, or shortness of breath. This wheezing and coughing can also cause chest discomfort. There may also be some pain associated with very strong coughing fits, which can cause the muscles between the ribs to become sore.


It is possible to break or fracture a rib from strong coughing.
If your fever is exceptionally high, you may have another condition such as pneumonia because a high fever is not common with bronchitis., There are no tests known or commonly performed to diagnose acute bronchitis. Especially in the early stages of the condition, acute bronchitis looks a lot like the common cold. In order to get diagnosed with acute bronchitis, your doctor will run a series of tests that will rule out other conditions that present with similar symptoms to bronchitis. The doctor will first perform a physical exam where he or she checks your ears, nose, throat, and temperature. He or she will also listen to your lungs with a stethoscope to listen for lung congestion.


The doctor may also order a sputum test. He or she will take a sample of your sputum and test it for viruses and bacteria such as whooping cough. The sputum can also be tested to see if you have allergies that is causing the cough.
Your doctor may also do a pulmonary function test, where you blow into a device called a spirometer. This device tests how much air your lungs can hold and how quickly you can expel air from them. This will help rule out asthma and emphysema.
If you have an elevated fever or other signs or symptoms suggestive of pneumonia, the doctor might give you a chest X-ray to rule it out., Most bronchitis is viral, which means that antibiotics do not help. If this is the case, your doctor might suggest the simple treatment of rest, lots of fluids, and fever-reducing over-the-counter medication. He or she may also suggest the use of a humidifier to help loosen mucus and help coughing, a burst of oral steroids or an inhaler for three to five days if there is significant wheezing, and, rarely, cough medicine.


If your doctor suspects that your bronchitis may be bacterial, he or she may prescribe you antibiotics. Since most acute bronchitis is viral, this likely won't be the case. However, there has been an increase in antibiotic prescription for bronchitis in recent years, despite this fact., Acute bronchitis is not diagnosed until a child turns two years old. If you have a child younger than that who presents symptoms similar to acute bronchitis, she likely has bronchiolitis, which is a conditions caused by respiratory syncytial l virus or other viruses. It is associated with a higher mortality and morbidity rate in small children due to their low immunity.


This condition presents with a cough that sounds congested that is usually without sputum production, since infants typically won’t give you sputum. I can also be accompanied by a high fever and wheezing or trouble breathing. RSV bronchiolitis can turn into pneumonia and occurs most often in children under one year. It occurs more often in premature infants.
To test for RSV bronchiolitis, there is a quick and easy test available in most emergency rooms that test nasal secretions from the child for the virus.
Children with bronchiolitis are sometimes admitted to the hospital for close observation and supportive care with breathing treatments to open the airways, suctioning, fluids if they aren't drinking well, supplemental oxygen, and antibiotics if they have a bacterial infection. "

Treat chronic bronchitis.",How to Recognize Bronchitis Symptoms2," Chronic bronchitis affects over 10 million people in the US and is responsible for 40,000 deaths. It is condition that lasts at least three months and occurs at least two years in a row. It is caused by inflammation that is accompanied by swelling and excessive mucus production. This causes the lungs to lose their cilia, which are the hair-like appendages that help move mucus and other substances through the respiratory system. When this happens, the mucus stays stationary, which causes the growth of bacteria and stops up the airways.The primary cause of chronic bronchitis is tobacco use. Because of this, chronic bronchitis is a common precursor to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema. , The people at the most risk of chronic bronchitis are those who are or have been heavy smokers. You are also at risk if you have had severe bacterial or viral infections that affected the lungs or if you breathed in industrial dusts and fumes. When tobacco smoke or air pollutants such as dust or soot is breathed into the airways, it causes them to become irritated. The cells of the lower respiratory tract that secrete mucus, the goblet cells, go into overdrive. This causes them to secrete mucus at a very high rate into the respiratory passages, which causes a chronic cough.Research indicates that inflammation of the airways persists for more than 13 years after a person has stopped smoking.
People with occupations such as metal molders, grain handlers, and coal miners are at an increased risk due to the excessive environmental irritants., The main symptom of chronic bronchitis is sputum production from a cough that occurs every day for at least three months, which reoccurs at least two years in a row. The mucus causes obstructions to airways, and this causes even thicker mucus as a consequence. Unlike acute bronchitis which starts within in a few days, chronic bronchitis's onset is gradual. The mucus produced is typically yellow or brownish in color.


You will likely also have chest tightness, shortness of breath, and sometimes struggling to breathe. You may also experience fatigue, a sore throat, muscle aches, nasal congestion, and headaches.
Since chronic bronchitis often comes hand in hand with COPD, you may see all the symptoms of COPD such as wheezing lungs, weight loss, and cyanosis, which is a bluish or grayish skin discoloration due to low oxygenation. , Your doctor will likely give you a chest X-ray to check the extent of the damage. This will also exclude pneumonia or lung cancer. Chronic bronchitis will not show any specific signs on the X-ray, but it will tell the doctor if your condition has evolved into COPD.


You may also get a pulmonary function tests. These will test your lung capacity and oxygen levels. These are also likely given while you are receiving treatment over a period of time to see if the treatments are working., The major point of treatment is to quit smoking immediately. This can be done with or without help. If you have smoked for a long time, you may find it easier with help, such as nicotine patches and gums, group therapy, prescription medication, and shots. If you have already quit smoking, there are different kinds of treatment, depending on how bad your chronic bronchitis is.


People with chronic bronchitis should get a yearly flu shot as well as a pneumonia shot.
For chronic bronchitis caused by any factor, you may be given special breathing exercises to increase your lung capacity and help your respiratory system. You may also be told to do more modest exercise, such as light walking or other light cardiovascular exercises. This should be done for 15 minutes at least three times a week to start.Your doctor may also prescribe medication for the condition, such as inhaled beta agonists and steroids to help open up your airways. This works for any cause of bronchitis. You may also be prescribed oral steroids, but talk with your doctor first about the side effects.
Antibiotics are sometimes prescribed when you have an acute flare caused by a bacterial infection.
If you have extremely low oxygen levels, you may be given supplemental oxygen. This is typical in cases that have progressed to COPD."
"
Know who gets the disease.,
Understand how the disease is spread.,
Recognize the symptoms of the infection.,
Be aware that symptoms usually begin 2-14 days after exposure to the bacteria.,
Know the treatment for the infection.,
Contact your doctor or local health department if you suspect you may have been exposed to the bacteria.",How to Recognize and Treat Legionnaires' Disease," Those most at risk includes:


People 65 years of age or older.

Smokers.
Those who have a chronic lung disease, like emphysema.
People with weakened immune systems from diseases or who take drugs that can suppress the immune system.;
,


People get the disease when they breathe in small droplets of water in the air that has been contaminated with the bacteria. Examples of how this may occur include:
Inhaling the steam from a hot tub that has not been properly cleaned or disinfected.
Breathing the air of a large air-conditioning unit that has the bacteria in the system.
Being near someone who has the disease, especially through kissing and breathing in close to each other.
The inhalation of vapors from a whirlpool or heated wading pool contaminated with the bacteria.



, Look for:


High fever.
Chills.

Cough.
Muscle aches.

Headache.

, A milder form of the infection (caused by the same type of bacteria) is called Pontiac Fever. The symptoms are usually the same, however, there is no pneumonia.

, The majority of cases can be successfully treated with antibiotics. People who are in good health will generally recover.

, If you traveled in the last two weeks before becoming ill, be sure to mention this to your doctor.

, Give your stomach a complete break from liquids and solids right away. If you really need to eat, go with small portions of non-acidic foods like grains (crackers, rice, oatmeal), non-sour fruits and vegetables (potatoes, bananas, leafy greens).

, Take an antacid to neutralize the acidity in your stomach if you feel the stomach ache is related to indigestion or you are experiencing heart burn.


Tums and Milk of Magnesia (Magnesium Hydroxide) are the most common brands, but you can find other brand names with similar ingredients at the drugstore.

, If you feel bloated, simethicone is an over-the-counter anti-bloating remedy that should help clear out any excess gas.


To find out if gas is your problem, try massaging your stomach and listening for gurgling sounds. Hear them? You probably have some excess gas in there. Simethicone can help clear it out.

, Pepto-Bismol is the most common brand, but you can find other brand names with similar ingredients sold over-the-counter at the drugstore.

, It may seem impossible, but sometimes all a stomach ache is asking for is a good, solid bowel movement.

, Resting your body, warming your organs and calming your mind can all help with a stomach ache. Sometimes stomach pain comes as a reaction to a stressful day.

, Sometimes the reason for a stomach ache (or heartburn) is because your stomach acid has gone up into your esophagus. Sit upright in a comfortable position and give your stomach acid plenty of time to go back to where it belongs.

, If you don't have a heating pad, wet a washcloth with hot water and then place it on your stomach. Keep it there as long as needed.

, Slowly apply pressure with two fingers in a circular motion along your lower and upper abdomen.

, If you are able, take a nap. In most cases, your stomach ache will be gone when you wake up. If you can't fall asleep, try to rest on your back, letting your stomach stretch out.

, Yogurt is a great line of defense against upset stomachs. It is full of healthy probiotics that soothe your stomach. In a study by University of Manchester, women with irritable bowel syndrome saw a decrease in bloating by 78 percent when they consumed yogurt daily.

, Probiotics come in many forms and have been reported to significantly reduce stomach trouble. Kombucha, yogurt, kefir and lacto-fermented vegetables are all good sources of probiotics.

, Mix an 8 oz. glass of drinking water with two tablespoons of baking soda.

, A number of herbs are particularly effective at reducing stomach pain. Try these:


Make cinnamon tea. Gently boil two cups of water and two cinnamon sticks together for 15-20 minutes. Remove cinnamon sticks and pour into a mug or glass. Add a tablespoon of honey for sweetness.
Make peppermint tea. Some people prefer peppermint tea to cinnamon tea. Both will help to soothe your stomach and help you relax.
Make caraway tea. Gently boil two cups of water and two teaspoons of caraway seeds together for 15-20 minutes. Strain the liquid into glass and add a tablespoon of honey for sweetness. Or, consume caraway oil. Caraway oil is often used for digestive ailments including stomach and intestinal spasms.
Consume fennel. Ever wonder why Indian dishes often use fennel seed? It works to get rid of gas and aid indigestion. Try eating a spoonful of fennel seeds or making a fennel seed tea.
Consume ginger. Upset stomachs can benefit from ginger, which is used as a way to treat nausea and relieve indigestion. Eat it raw, make a tea or buy ginger capsules.

, An old folk recipe with a lot of modern praise, it may not work for everyone, but, if you feel up for it, give it a shot — it might be just what your stomach needs. Try mixing a tablespoon of honey and a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar in a glass of water. Drink up!

, The enzymes in these fruits have been taken orally for centuries to relieve stomach pain. However, don't overdo it. These same fruits, in large quantities, are known to cause stomach aches.

, Carbonated beverages can work to settle the stomach by initiating a burp which vents built-up gas.

, Dry bread or crackers make you feel stuffed, at the same time give your peristaltic rhythms a way to keep going and prevent ionic loss.

Hydrate yourself with ice chips and clear fluids.,
Ease into a bland diet.,
Return to your normal diet as early as possible.,
Keep clean.,
Stay rested.,
Let the virus run its course.,
Take ginger.Ginger is traditionally used as a treatment against nausea and stomach cramping.,
Soothe your symptoms with peppermint.,
Try activated charcoal capsules.Some health food stores will actually sell activated charcoal tablets in the supplement section.,
Draw yourself a mustard bath.As odd as it may sound, a lukewarm bath with a little mustard powder mixed in might bring you a little relief.,

Use acupressure to ease your nausea.,
Don't bother asking for an antibiotic.,
Consider requesting an anti-nausea medication.,
Avoid taking over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medicines.",How to Get Rid of a Stomach Virus," The biggest risk associated with any stomach virus is dehydration. As a result, the most important thing you can do to help your body get rid of the virus is to keep yourself hydrated as much as possible.


You should try to get 8 oz (250 ml) of fluid every hour as an adult. Children need 1 oz (30 ml) of fluid every 30 to 60 minutes.Drink slowly, taking small sips instead of large gulps. Fluids will sit in your stomach more effectively if you introduce them to your system gradually instead of all at once.






Drinking too much plain water as you recover can dilute the few electrolytes still in your system, so try to include an oral electrolyte solution in your drinking routine as you fight the bug. In addition to a loss of water, you are also losing sodium, potassium, and other electrolytes. An electrolyte solution can help replace some of those lost minerals, as well.
Other good drinks to consider include diluted juices, diluted sports drinks, clear broth, and decaffeinated tea.






Avoid sugary drinks. Adding sugar to your system without also adding salt can make diarrhea worse. Carbonated, caffeinated, and alcoholic drinks should all be avoided, too.






If drinks are hard to tolerate, suck on ice chips or a frozen popsicle, instead.;
, As soon as your stomach feels ready to take on solid foods again, you should begin eating to restore any lost nutrients. While there is little scientific evidence to show that bland foods are inherently easier to digest than less bland foods, most people do seem to take to them better when nausea is still moderately strong.


A traditionally bland diet would be the BRAT diet, which includes bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast. Other decent options include baked potatoes without butter, bagels, pretzels, and crackers.
You should only do this for a day or so. Bland foods are certainly better than nothing, but relying on them completely during your recovery will deprive your body of the nutrients it needs to fight off the bug.

, After surviving on a bland diet for a day or so, you should start returning normal foods back into your eating routine. Bland foods may sit in your stomach well, but when eaten alone, they do not provide all the nutrients you need to get rid of the bug.


Introduce normal foods back into your diet gradually to avoid further stomach upset.
Low-sugar carbohydrates are an excellent choice at this point, including plain cereals and grains. Other good options include peeled fruits, lean proteins like eggs, chicken, and fish, and simple cooked vegetables like green beans and carrots.Try eating a little low-sugar yogurt. Fermented dairy products are believed to reduce the amount of time you suffer from intestinal upset. Moreover, the bacteria in yogurt is considered ""good"" bacteria that can help regulate the environment inside your stomach, thereby assisting your body as it fights off the virus.







, Stomach viruses are strong and can survive outside of the human body for quite some time. Even worse, you can catch the same virus from someone else after you have already recovered once from it. To avoid endlessly catching the same stomach bug over and over again, make sure that you and the spaces you live in are as clean as possible.


Even though a stomach virus is different from food poisoning, you can still spread it through food. Try not to handle anyone else's food when you are ill and always wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before eating., As with any illness, rest is a valuable remedy. Resting allows your body to devote more of its resources to getting rid of the stomach virus.


Essentially, you should remove yourself from your daily routine completely while fighting a stomach virus. Your body needs 6 to 8 hours of sleep to function well under normal circumstances, and when you get sick, you should try to at least double the amount of rest you get.
As hard as it may sound, you should also avoid worrying about the things you are not getting done. Worry causes your body to experience stress, which only makes it more difficult for your body to spend resources fighting the bug.







, Ultimately, the only thing you can really do to get rid of a stomach bug is to let it run its course. As long as you do not have a condition that compromises your immune system, your body should be able to fight the virus naturally.


That being said, essential care is still a vital part in getting rid of a stomach virus. The tips outlined here are all aimed at giving your body what it needs to fight the virus on its own. If you do not take care of your body, your body will struggle to recover.
If your immune system does have some form of deficiency, you should call your doctor at the first sign of symptoms.

, Ginger ale and ginger tea are the most often used treatments when battling a stomach virus.


You can make fresh ginger tea by boiling two to four 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) slices of fresh ginger in 8 oz (250 ml) of water for five to seven minutes. Let cool to a drinkable temperature and sip away.
Ginger ale and bags of herbal ginger tea can be found readily in the store, as well.
In addition to ginger beverages, you can also use ginger capsules and oils, usually available in health food stores or the supplement section of a drugstore.

, Peppermint has numbing properties that are commonly thought to calm nausea and stomach spasms. You can use peppermint both internally and externally.


You can take peppermint internally by sipping on peppermint tea, chewing on a clean peppermint leaf, or taking a peppermint capsule supplement. Herbal peppermint teas can be found in the store, or you can make your own fresh tea by boiling a few leaves in 8 oz (250 ml) of water for five to seven minutes.
To benefit externally from peppermint, soak the a washcloth in cold peppermint tea or put two to three drops of peppermint oil on a washcloth soaked in cool water.

, Activated charcoal is believed to draw out toxins and may help cripple the toxins in your stomach.


Follow the instructions on the label of activated charcoal to avoid an accidental overdose. Usually, however, you can take several capsules at once and several doses within a single day.

, According to folk medicine, mustard has the ability to draw impurities out of your body while improving blood circulation.


You can use warm water if you do not have a fever, but if you do have a fever, keep the water lukewarm to prevent it from rising any further.
Add 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of mustard powder and 1/4 cup (60 ml) of baking soda to a full tub of water. Stir it gently with your hands until the mustard and baking soda fully dissolve before soaking yourself in the bathwater for 10 to 20 minutes.

, If your stomach muscles have worked so much that they have begun cramping up, a warm towel or warm heating pad on your stomach might be able to soothe the pain.


If you have a high fever, however, this treatment can cause your temperature to climb further and should be avoided.
Relaxing cramping stomach muscles can ease the symptoms of your stomach virus, but by putting yourself in less pain, your body can relax more overall. This allows your immune system to spend more of its resources on fighting the virus and may help you get better faster.

, Based on theories concerning acupressure and acupuncture, certain pressure points in your hands and feet can be manipulated in order to ease pain and discomfort in your stomach and intestines.


One technique you can try is a foot massage. A gentle foot rub can help ease your nausea and limit your desperate trips to the bathroom.
If your stomach virus has brought a headache along with it, use acupressure on your hand. Take the index finger and thumb of one hand and pinch the webbing between the index finger and thumb on your other hand. This technique can minimize a headache tremendously.

, Antibiotics are effective against strains of bacteria, but unfortunately, they are not effective against viruses. A stomach bug caused by a viral infection cannot be effectively treated with an antibiotic.


The same principle applies to anti-fungal medications, as well.

, If severe nausea lasts past 12 to 24 hours, your doctor might recommend the use of an anti-nausea medication to settle your stomach enough for you to retain fluids and a small amount of food.


Note, however, that anti-nausea medications only ease your symptoms. They do not get rid of the virus. Since an anti-nausea drug will help you keep down more fluids and foods, though, you can at least provide your body with the nutrients it needs to do the fighting itself.

, Unless, of course, you have your doctor's approval. These over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medicines can be very effective, but that is part of the problem. For the first 24 hours or so, you need to let your body do what it can to expel the virus from your system. Unfortunately, diarrhea and vomiting are natural parts of the process.


After the virus has been expelled from your system, your doctor may permit you to take an anti-diarrheal drug to treat residual symptoms.

Recognize the symptoms of acid reflux.,
Understand the risk factors for GERD.,
Recognize the symptoms of ulcers.,
Know when to seek immediate medical attention.,
See your doctor.,
Ask your doctor to check for Helicobacter pylori.,
Ask a pharmacist to recommend an antacid.",How to Get Rid of Acidity1," “Acid reflux” is what causes the burning pain or discomfort in your chest or throat called “heartburn” (which doesn’t have anything to do with your heart). If you have other symptoms, you may have a more serious condition, like gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), also known as acid reflux disease.Here are some symptoms to look for:Pain that worsens when you lie down or bend overRegurgitation of food into your mouth (be careful of aspirating or inhaling gastric contents)
Acid taste in the mouth
Hoarseness or a sore throat
Laryngitis
Chronic dry cough, especially at night
Asthma
Feeling like there’s a “lump” in your throat
Increase in saliva
Bad breath
Earaches;
, Acid reflux occurs when the valve at the entrance to your stomach, called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) doesn’t close properly, allowing stomach acid back up into your esophagus. This causes the burning known as “heartburn.” If this happens more than twice a week, you have acid reflux disease, also known as GERD. Below are some common risk factors for acid reflux disease:Eating large meals
Lying down right after a meal
Being overweight or obese
Bending over after eating
Bedtime snacking
Eating trigger foods, like citrus or chocolate
Drinking certain beverages, like alcohol or coffee
Smoking
Pregnancy
Taking NSAIDs (aspirin, ibuprofen, etc.)
Hiatal hernia. A hiatal hernia occurs when the stomach bulges up into the chest area through an opening in your diaphragm. It will need to be surgically treated., Most ulcers are caused by a bacterial infection called Helicobacter pylori.The most common sign of an ulcer is a dull or burning pain in your belly. The pain may come and go, but may appear strongest at night or between meals.Other symptoms of ulcers include:Bloating
Burping or feeling like you need to burp
Lack of appetite
Nausea or vomiting
Weight loss

, In addition to the above symptoms, ulcers can cause internal bleeding in the stomach and intestines, which can be extremely dangerous. If you see any of the following symptoms, get medical treatment immediately:Dark red, bloody, or black stool
Difficulty breathing
Dizziness or fainting
Feeling tired for no reason
Paleness
Vomit that looks like coffee grounds or contains blood
Sharp, severe stomach pain

, If you have frequent or persistent heartburn, you should see your doctor. If you have GERD and don’t seek treatment, it can cause serious medical conditions, including esophagitis (an inflammation of the esophagus lining),esophageal bleeding or ulcers,the pre-cancerous Barrett’s esophagus,and increased risk of esophageal cancer.If you have ulcers, these require medical treatment. They can cause other conditions, including internal bleeding, stomach perforation, and gastric outlet obstruction (where the passageway from the stomach to the small intestine is blocked).In some cases, ulcers from Helicobacter pylori can cause stomach cancer.
Some medications, such as Fosamax ( an osteoporosis drug), steroids, and immunosuppressants, can cause excessive acid production. If you are taking these medications, do not stop taking them until you have consulted with your doctor.

, Since the 1980s, doctors have discovered that the type of bacteria called H. pylori causes most stomach ulcers. About ⅔ of the world’s population carries H. pylori, but for most people it doesn’t cause any symptoms.Between 30-67% of people in the United States are estimated to carry H. pylori.In developing countries, that figure can be as high as 90%.You can get H. pylori from food, water, or eating utensils. You may also contract it through contact with saliva, fecal matter, or other body fluids of infected people.Because the sanitation conditions in developing countries are often different than those in the US and other countries, you may contract H. pylori if you travel to another country, especially if you drink the water or eat undercooked food. Poor hygiene and poor sanitation, while preparing and cooking food, are also common ways to get H. pylori.
If you have H. pylori, you should have your whole family or any people you live with tested as well. Reinfection can occur unless the infection is eradicated in everyone with whom you live in close contact.Your doctor can use noninvasive techniques to test for 'H. pylori, such as urea breath test, serology, and stool antigen tests.


, If you can’t get to the doctor immediately and want some relief from acid reflux symptoms, ask your pharmacist. S/he can recommend an effective (but temporary) over-the-counter antacid. A pharmacist can also help advise you to choose an antacid that won’t interact with your other medications. Common choices include:Zantac, 150 mg once per day
Pepcid, 20 mg twice per day
Lansoprazole, 30 mg once per day
Antacid tablets, 1-2 tablets every 4 hours

Talk with your doctor about stopping NSAID use.,
Reduce your stress.,
Stop smoking.Smoking is bad for your health, full stop.,
Maintain a healthy weight.",How to Get Rid of Acidity2," Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can cause ulcers.NSAIDs reduce inflammation by blocking certain enzymes in your body. One of these enzymes also produces a chemical that protects your stomach lining from stomach acid. Using NSAIDs reduces this protective chemical, which can lead to ulcers.Common NSAIDs include aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), ketoprofen (Orudis KT), and nabumetone (Relafen).They also come in prescription strengths.
When using over-the-counter NSAIDs, do not use them for more than three days for fever or 10 days for pain relief. If you need long-term pain relief, talk with your doctor about other options.NSAIDs are more likely to cause ulcer complications when you use them long-term (1-4% of users will develop ulcers). The risk increases the longer you use them.The elderly and people with H. pylori co-infection are also at a higher risk of developing life-threatening ulcer complications when using NSAIDs., In the past, it was commonly believed that stress caused ulcers. Doctors no longer believe this is true; most ulcers are caused by H. pylori infections. However, stress can make ulcers worse.It may also increase stomach acid secretion in some people.Set aside time to relax. Take a pampering bubble bath. Go shopping just for fun. Take up a new hobby. Making time for leisure activities can help you destress.Try yoga or tai chi. Yoga and tai chi are forms of exercise that focus on deep breathing and meditation. They have both been found to relieve stress in clinical studies.Get some exercise. Physical exercise can decrease feelings of stress and anxiety. Aim for at least 2.5 hours of moderate physical activity every week.Get social support. Often we feel stressed when we’re facing a lot of pressure and don’t feel supported. Talk with family or friends, join a support group, go to church — whatever makes you feel like you’re part of a supportive community.
See a mental health professional. Some people believe that you need to have “huge” issues to see a therapist, but this simply isn’t true. If you’re feeling stressed or anxious, seeing a counselor or therapist could help you discover why and learn ways to deal with your feelings., While smoking hasn’t been shown to increase stomach acid production, it can cause acid-related discomfort and physical damage in several ways.Smoking increases your risk of GERD by weakening the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), the muscle at the entrance of the stomach that keeps acid from flowing back into the esophagus. Smokers have a much higher risk of frequent and chronic heartburn.Smoking weakens your immune system and increases your risk of H. pylori infection, which increases your likelihood of developing stomach ulcers. Smoking also slows the healing of ulcers and makes them more likely to reoccur.Smoking increases pepsin, an enzyme produced by your stomach that may harm your stomach lining in excessive amounts. It also decreases factors that help heal your stomach lining, including blood flow and mucus production., Carrying excess weight in your abdominal area puts pressure on your lower esophageal sphincter, forcing your stomach contents and stomach acid into the esophagus and causing heartburn.This is also why heartburn is a common side effect of pregnancy. If you have a BMI greater than 29, losing weight may help reduce your heartburn.Before starting any weight loss regimen, consult with your physician.
If you are severely overweight (BMI equal to or greater than 40), bariatric surgery may be an option to help you reduce your weight and improve acid reflux symptoms. Talk with your doctor about whether this surgery is right for you."

Drink lots of water.,
Monitor your alcohol consumption.,
Watch your caffeine intake.,
Avoid eating before bedtime or lying down.,
Eat smaller meals.,
Avoid high-fat foods.,
Avoid spicy foods.,
Avoid high-acid fruits.,
Drink a glass of milk.,
Chew gum.",How to Get Rid of Acidity3," Staying hydrated by drinking enough water each day can help keep stomach acid in your stomach, where it belongs.You may want to look into “alkaline water,” which may help reduce stomach acidity. Because you need some acidity to help you digest properly, talk with your doctor before trying alkaline water., If you have problems with stomach acid, you may need to reduce or even stop drinking alcohol. The biggest culprits are beverages with a low ethanol concentration (<5%), such as beer and wine.Fermented alcoholic beverages (beer, wine, champagne, sherry, etc.) are considered powerful stimulators of stomach acid production.No direct link has been discovered between alcohol and stomach ulcers, but people who have ulcers are also more likely to have cirrhosis of the liver, a condition often caused by heavy alcohol consumption.Alcoholic beverages produced by distillation, such as whiskey and gin, do not appear to stimulate stomach acid production.No matter what you choose to drink, drink only in moderation. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism recommends that you consume no more than four alcoholic drinks per day and no more than 14 per week if you are male. If you are female, consume no more than three alcoholic drinks per day and no more than 7 per week.A “standard” drink is any of the following: 12 ounces of regular beer (5% alcohol by volume, or ABV), 8-9 ounces of malt liquor or high-gravity beer (7% ABV), 5 ounces of regular wine (12% ABV), 3-4 ounces of fortified wine (17% ABV), 2-3 ounces of cordial or liqueur (24% ABV), 1.5 ounces of brandy or 80-proof spirits (40% ABV)., Caffeine appears to stimulate acid secretion in the stomach.Coffee, in particular, may cause heartburn because of caffeine and other substances coffee contains.Even uncaffeinated beverages, such as tea, can cause heartburn. For example, mint herbs such as peppermint or spearmint can provoke heartburn.If you can’t live without your coffee, choose an espresso, French roast, or other dark roast coffee. Not only do they contain less caffeine, they also contain the compound N-methylpyridine, which may actually block your stomach’s production of stomach acid., Eating within two to three hours of lying down or going to sleep can cause heartburn. It takes roughly two hours for your stomach to empty its contents into your intestines. Stay upright for two to three hours after eating to avoid heartburn.If your heartburn is worse at night, try elevating the head of your bed by four to six inches, or use a wedge-shaped pillow to help you sleep in a semi-elevated position., Eating large meals can put undue pressure on your stomach, which can cause acid reflux symptoms. Eat smaller meals throughout the day to avoid putting pressure on your stomach.Wearing loose clothing can also help you avoid putting excess pressure on your stomach., High-fat foods tend to decrease the pressure in your lower esophageal sphincter (LES), which could mean that stomach acid backs up through it into the esophagus. Go for lower fat foods and incorporate plenty of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains into your diet.


High-fat foods may also increase the amount of time it takes for your stomach to empty its contents into the intestines, putting you at increased risk of acid reflux symptoms.Chocolate not only contains a lot of fat, it also contains methylxanthine, which has been shown to relax your LES and cause heartburn in some people., Spicy foods, such as peppers, raw onions, and garlic, can cause your LES to relax, allowing stomach acids back up into the esophagus. If you suffer from frequent acid reflux symptoms, avoid spicy foods., Citrus fruits and tomatoes (yes, tomatoes are fruits!) are high in acid, which can worsen your heartburn symptoms.If you have frequent acid reflux symptoms, skipping these fruits may help.


Oranges, grapefruits, and orange juice are common triggers of heartburn symptoms.Tomato juice and tomatoes are also highly acidic and may trigger heartburn.
Pineapple juice is highly acidic and may cause heartburn., The calcium in milk can act as a temporary buffer for stomach acid. However, because it’s also a high-fat food, it may trigger your stomach to produce more acid, in the long run, so choose a low-fat version.Try drinking goat’s milk or skim cow’s milk. Both of these options are very low in fat., Chewing gum stimulates your body’s production of saliva, which acts as a natural acid buffer. Chewing gum when you feel heartburn coming on may help.Avoid mint gums. Mint, especially peppermint and spearmint, may actually trigger heartburn."

Try licorice.,
Try ginger.,
Try cranberry.,
Try baking soda.",How to Get Rid of Acidity4," Several studies have shown licorice root (the herb, not the sweet candy) to be effective in helping your esophageal lining resist irritation from stomach acid.Make sure you look for de glycyrrhizin ted (DGL) licorice. The active ingredient glycyrrhizin can cause serious side effects.When using licorice to treat acid reflux, take 250-500mg three times daily. Chew the root either one hour before or two hours after meals.You can also make a licorice tea by infusing 1-5 grams of dried licorice root in 8 ounces of water. Drink this tea three times daily.You should not take licorice if you have any of the following conditions: heart failure or heart disease, hormone-sensitive cancers, fluid retention, high blood pressure, diabetes, kidney or liver disease, low potassium, or erectile dysfunction. Pregnant and breastfeeding women should not take licorice.

, Ginger has been used to treat indigestion in traditional Chinese medicine.No scientific evidence has found ginger to be effective at treating symptoms of acid reflux, but ginger does also have other health benefits, such as treating nausea and upset stomach.Take ginger supplements in capsule form or take ginger with meals. Eating raw ginger on its own may actually cause mild heartburn.

, Preliminary research suggests that cranberry may inhibit the growth of the bacteria H. pylori in your stomach.While it isn’t known for sure whether cranberry helps prevent ulcers related to H. pylori, it is generally safe to consume and provides other health benefits, including keeping your urinary tract healthy.Try drinking 3 ounces of pure cranberry juice (not “cocktail” or a juice blend) per day.You can also eat 1.5 ounces of fresh or frozen cranberries.
Cranberries have high levels of oxalate, which is related to the formation of kidney stones. If you’re at high risk for kidney stones, talk to a doctor about whether cranberry is right for you.

, Baking soda, or sodium bicarbonate, is a natural antacid that may help neutralize stomach acid that has found its way back into your esophagus. Your pancreas naturally produces sodium bicarbonate to help neutralize excess stomach acid.Alka-Seltzer is the brand name of a common over-the-counter version of sodium bicarbonate.
Take one half-teaspoon, dissolved in water, every two hours for heartburn.If you are on a low-sodium diet, don’t use sodium bicarbonate as it does contain sodium."

You can also try mixing the lemon juice with regular tea, and it is permissible to add a small amount of honey to help it go down. Just don't add too much honey or you may further upset your stomach.;
, Chamomile tea can act as a natural anti-inflammatory, helping your digestive tract to relax while easing food through your system.Simply steep a chamomile teabag in boiling water for 5-10 minutes or until tea is cool enough to drink. Sip until all the tea is gone or until your stomach ache subsides.


This is especially helpful if you're going right to sleep as chamomile tea tends to aid in falling asleep.
Always be careful with drinking hot liquids. Test the tea with a spoon before sipping from the cup to be sure it is cool enough to sip.

, Peppermint can also help relax digestive tract muscles, and it also helps with bile flow, which helps with digestion.Peppermint tea can be purchased in grocery and health food stores in ready to use teabags and as loose tea. Simply steep the tea in boiling water until it is cool enough to drink and sip until it is gone or until you begin to feel better.


If you have peppermint growing on the side of your house, you can cut a stem worth of the plant's leaves and hang to dry for use as tea. In doing so, you can have homegrown peppermint tea on hand for when you have junk food-related stomach aches.

, You can also chew on soft ginger candies. Both of these help to soothe the stomach.

, Some stomach aches can be soothed by applying a heat treatment to the outside of the stomach. This relaxes the muscles and can distract from the pain.If you have a hot water bottle, fill it with hot water and lie down. Place the bottle on your stomach and relax until the ache begins to subside.


While laying down with the hot water bottle applied, you may fall asleep—this can also help you through your stomach ache.
You could also use a heating pad if you do not have a hot water bottle.

, Pepto-Bismol can be used to treat an upset stomach, among other things. As with any medicine, it is best to check with your doctor before taking Pepto-Bismol if you are taking any other medications, as drug interaction could be involved., 1/2 cup of rice boiled in six cups of water for 15 minutes creates an effective rice ""tea"" that you can drink to try and alleviate an upset stomach. Once the concoction has boiled, strain out the rice and add a small amount of honey or sugar. Drink the finished beverage warm.

, While it may seem like something as bitter as burnt toast would intensify rather than alleviate an upset stomach, the burnt part of the bread may actually help your upset stomach feel better. The burnt bits of the toast are said to absorb certain elements in the stomach that may contribute to your feeling ill.


Apply a small amount of honey or jelly to make the toast more palatable.

, Apple cider vinegar can be helpful at calming an upset stomach when mixed with hot water at a ratio of one tablespoon to one cup along with a tablespoon of honey. The concoction can help with cramping as well as gas in your stomach and may help with heartburn as well.

, Junk food, according to some, is engineered to be difficult to put down.For this reason, especially, it is important to avoid binge-eating junk food, as this can give you a stomach ache due to the lack of fiber in most junk food and the high levels of sugar, fat, and carbohydrates.


Most foods have serving sizes listed on their packages along with the nutrition information for a serving. Measure and eat only one serving of a junk food item to avoid getting a stomach ache.
You can also buy single-serve packs of snacks so you do not overeat.

, Fresh fruit or a fruit smoothie might satisfy a craving for a sweet treat. Salted nuts might curtail your potato chip craving in much the same way.Junk foods in moderation typically aren't the cause for stomach-aches. It is typically the frequency or amount that they are eaten. In order to cut back on frequency, choose healthy snacks in lieu of junk-food containing snacks throughout the day. In general, you should be able to find a healthy substitute to any kind of junk food. Having these foods on hand and eating them instead of junk food will help you prevent stomach aches you may get from eating too much junk food.


Be sure to cut fresh fruit as soon as you get it home to put in a container in the refrigerator so it's ready to eat when you get cravings.
Try mixing nuts with dried fruits for a sweet and salty snack.

, Drinking water instead of beverages that may cause stomach aches is a good way to help prevent a stomach ache. This is especially the case if you are having a serving of another junk food. Coffee, alcohol, and carbonated drinks may upset your stomach by themselves or if consumed along with junk food.


Sodas in particular can cause stomach aches because of the sugar and other ingredients they contain.

See a dentist if your dental issue is severe.,
Be aware of the risks of using clove oil.",How to Make Clove Oil," You can find whole cloves and ground cloves at your local health food store. If you decide to use whole cloves, you will need to buy at least five to ten whole cloves to make enough oil to fill a one ounce glass container. If you decide to use ground cloves, you will need at least one to two teaspoons of ground cloves to fill a one ounce glass container.Keep in mind the more whole or ground cloves you use, the stronger the oil will be. You should then adjust the dosage of the clove oil if the oil itself is stronger and more potent.
If you use ground cloves, you may decide to strain out the cloves once the oil is made. This is based on preference only and is not required to make an effective bottle of clove oil.;
, The olive oil will act as the carrier oil and will help to extract the properties from the cloves. You can use extra virgin olive oil or virgin olive oil.The amount of olive oil needed for the clove oil will depend on how much clove oil you plan to make. You will need no more than one ounce of olive oil to make one ounce of clove oil.

, A dark, sanitized glass jar will ensure the oil does not spoil or get contaminated. Use a jar with an eye dropper for easy application of the clove oil.You can also use a clear glass jar with an air tight lid to store the clove oil. You can put the glass jar in a paper bag and store it in a dark place to ensure the oil does not spoil.

, Once the cloves and the oil are combined and have had time to settle, you can decide to leave the cloves in the oil or strain out the cloves.You can buy cheesecloth at your local baking store or create an easy strainer with a coffee filter.

, If you are using whole cloves, use clean hands to place five to ten cloves in the one ounce jar. If you are using ground cloves, you can place ¼ cup of ground cloves into a 12 ounce jar.If you decide to use a higher amount of cloves in the oil, keep in mind the oil will be more potent and you may need to use less of it when applying it to your skin.

, Once the cloves are in the jar, slowly pour the olive oil in the jar until it sits one inch above the cloves in the jar.


If you are using ground cloves, you will pour one cup of olive oil into a 12 ounce jar. Let the one cup of olive oil drain into the jar completely., Make sure the jar is well sealed before you shake the jar three to four times. This will ensure the cloves and the oil are well combined., The cloves and the olive oil need time to interact so the olive oil can extract the chemical properties of the cloves. You should let the jar sit in a cool dark place and ensure it is sealed well to avoid any contamination of the oil., After ten to fourteen days, you will have useable clove oil. You can decide to keep the whole or ground cloves in the oil or strain out the cloves. This is based on preference and is not required to use the clove oil.To strain out the cloves, place the cheesecloth or the coffee filter over a clean glass jar. Keep the cloth or filter in place with a rubber band around the top of the glass jar. Slowly pour the oil over the cloth or filter into the clean glass jar. The cloves will then be strained out of the oil.
If you decide not to strain out the whole cloves or ground cloves, you can use the same cloves several times by filling the jar up again with olive oil and letting it sit for ten to fourteen days. After two to three uses, you should replace the old cloves with fresh cloves.

, Before you apply the clove oil to your mouth, you should rinse it with a warm salt water solution. This will flush out your mouth and allow the oil to work effectively on your dental issue.If you are using clove oil as a mosquito repellant, you do not need to rinse your mouth out before applying it to your skin. Applying clove oil to your skin can repel mosquitos for up to five hours., Soak a clean cotton ball in the clove oil. Then, gently hold it against your sore tooth or gum. Try to get as much of the clove oil as you can on the sore tooth or gum.You can also use a clean tissue to apply the clove oil by soaking the tissue in clove oil and applying it to the sore tooth or gum.

, Clove oil has been shown to help manage dental pain and act as a temporary solution to dental issues like root canals and dental plaque build up. But you should not use clove oil as a permanent medical treatment for any of your dental issues. See a dentist if your dental issue is severe and requires medical attention., While clove oil is known natural remedy that can work effectively, there are also several health issues associated with clove oil. Never apply clove oil to broken skin and do not take large amounts of clove oil. Side effects of ingesting too much clove oil include mouth pain, vomiting, sore throat, difficulty breathing, kidney failure, and liver damage.Keep in mind children should not take clove oil via the mouth as it can cause severe side effects like seizures and liver damage. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, you should avoid using clove oil as there is not enough reliable information to confirm clove oil is safe for use in these medical conditions.
If you are scheduled to have surgery of any kind within the next two weeks, you should not use clove oil. Clove oil contains eugenol, which slows blood clotting and can lead to bleeding during or after a surgery.
Do not use clove oil if you are taking any anticoagulant drugs or medications that slow blood clotting, for example, aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, clopidogrel, diclofenac, or dalteparin.

Grind roots, seeds and other hard herbs in a coffee grinder or mortar and pestle.,
Mix the ground or dried herb with a bit of oil or water until it forms a moist paste.,
Spread a thin layer of the poultice preparation on a clean piece of cloth, then apply to the affected area of the skin.,
Apply a layer of plastic wrap over the poultice to hold it in place and retain heat.,
Leave the poultice in place until it has dried or cooled, or until the symptoms have subsided.

,
Reapply the poultice as necessary, using a fresh cloth and fresh herbal preparation every time.

",How to Apply a Poultice,"


You may use fruits and vegetables in poultices, too. These are usually grated instead of ground.
Already-fine herbs and powders don't need to be ground.;
,


Some herbs should be warmed before application as a poultice. Warm poultices are particularly useful for drawing out pus and soothing inflammation.
Warm the herbal paste either in the microwave or a double boiler. Some purists might disagree with microwaving herbal medication, but there is no arguing the microwave's convenience.
You may create a poultice from a single herb, or a combination. With combination poultices, several steps--for example, cutting, grinding, grating, mixing and heating--are involved with creating the herbal application.

,


Cheesecloth is ideal for applying poultices.
Depending on which herbal formulation you're using, you will either apply the herbal preparation directly to your skin (with the single layer of cloth over it) or place another layer of cloth between your skin and the moistened herbs.

,


If you don't have plastic wrap handy, you can use a clean bandage to hold the poultice in place.

Wiggle your tooth with your tongue.,
Use a finger to move the tooth a little more.,
Try biting into crunchy foods.,
Brush your teeth.,
Grasp the tooth with gauze.You can tug at the tooth to help loosen it, even if it isn’t ready to come out on its own, or if you don’t want to pull it.,
Try waiting.,
Don't force a tooth that won't come out.,
When all else fails, see a dentist.,

See a dentist if pain doesn't go away.",How to Make a Loose Tooth Fall Out Without Pulling It," The great thing about using your tongue to loosen your tooth is that you can do it almost anywhere, no matter what. Try pushing your tooth back and forth; whatever you can do with your tongue that doesn't make your tooth hurt is fair game.


You may feel an itchy feeling at the base of your tooth, near the root. This is a sign that the tooth is getting ready to come out.;
, Each day, using a clean finger, you can gently wiggle the loose tooth.This will help the tooth gradually come out naturally. Don’t try to force the tooth to move, however.


Make sure to wash your hands well with soap and warm water before trying this method.

, Another way to get your loose tooth out is simply by enjoying a normal, healthy snack! Apples or pears make excellent choices because of their tough skins and crisp texture.If your tooth is very loose, it might be difficult to bite into food with it. However, biting with other teeth and then chewing can still help to loosen it.
If the tooth is not very loose and you bite hard into something, there might be some pain. Be careful until you can tell how it feels to bite with the tooth.

, When a tooth is really loose, even pushing on it just a little bit can make it fall out. Sometimes, even brushing your teeth is enough to make the tooth fall out (or make it looser). Brush your teeth as normal (at least twice a day), being sure to go lightly on the loose tooth., Using some sterile gauze and your fingers, grasp the tooth and gently tug or wiggle it.


If you do want to pull the tooth, you can use this same method, by giving the tooth a quick twist as you tug at it. The gauze can also help soak up any blood.
You can also apply a small amount of oral anesthetic to the tooth and gum area before tugging at it if you are worried about it hurting.

, If your tooth just won't seem to come out, it may not quite be ready to fall out, so be patient.If your loose tooth isn't hurting you, distracting you, or getting in the way of your other teeth, you have no reason to worry about waiting.


Usually, your baby teeth fall out in the order that they came in, starting around age six or seven.However, teeth can fall out in a different order and at different times. Your dentist will examine your teeth and answer any questions you might have about losing your teeth.

, Generally, it's a bad idea to try to remove a tooth that's slightly loose but not ready to fall out. Forcing a tooth to come out can hurt and often leads to lots of bleeding, and possibly infection. If a tooth is forced out before the adult tooth is ready to emerge behind it, there can be problems in the future, such as crooked teeth or a lack of space for new teeth to emerge.Tricks to force a tooth out, such as by tying one end of a string around the tooth and the other end around a doorknob, then slamming the door, are not a good idea. These can break the tooth off or cause other injury.
If you do accidentally knock one of your teeth out before it's ready to fall out naturally, contact your dentist, who can help ensure that the problem is taken care of.

, If your baby tooth is causing you pain and it won't come out no matter what you seem to do, don't be afraid to get help. Schedule an appointment with your dentist; he or she will be able to tell what is keeping your tooth from falling out normally and may even be able to painlessly take it out for you.

, You can expect a small amount of bleeding when you lose a tooth. After your tooth has come out, you should try to gargle water or keep on spitting out water a number of times until it's not bloody and it's clear.


Don’t necessarily be alarmed if it looks like there is a lot of blood. As the tooth area bleeds, the blood mixes with saliva, which can make it look like there is more than there actually is.
You can make a saltwater gargle with 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 cup of warm water. Stir to mix it and gargle. The salt helps fight infection.

, Even if your tooth has been so loose that it seemed to be barely hanging on, it may bleed a little when it falls out. Don't worry; this is perfectly normal. If this happens to you, put a small ball of clean gauze in the hole where the tooth used to be to soak up the blood.Bite on the gauze to hold it in place for about 15 minutes. Most of the time, the bleeding should take less time than this to stop. If bleeding won't stop, call your dentist.

, If your mouth is a little sore after your tooth comes out, you don't simply have to wait for the pain to go away. Over-the-counter pain medicine such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen can make a sore mouth feel much better; just be sure to take the right dosage for your age and size according to the directions on the bottle.


Ask an adult to help you take the right dose of medicine.
Children should not take aspirin unless a doctor says otherwise.

, Cooling the area can also help with any pain you may have after losing a tooth. Place a few pieces of ice in a plastic bag (or use a bag of frozen vegetables) and wrap the bag in a light cloth. Hold this against your cheek in the spot where your mouth hurts for about 15-20 minutes. Over time, the pain, swelling, and inflammation should gradually decrease.You can also buy pre-made cold compresses from most pharmacies. These work the same way as home-made compresses.

, Most teeth that fall out naturally should cause no long-term pain. However, sometimes when a tooth becomes loose or falls out because of an injury or dental disease, there can be pain or damage. Sometimes, even more serious problems like abscesses (fluid-filled ""bubbles"" caused by infections) can occur. If left untreated, these problems can make you sick, so be sure to see a dentist if the pain from losing a tooth doesn't go away on its own.


Sometimes bits of a tooth may be left behind after one falls out. Usually, these will fall out in time as well. However, if there is redness, swelling, or pain caused by a piece of tooth that remains behind, contact a dentist for help."

, Do this at the last possible moment. Your head and the tops of your shoulders should be all that are out of the window. Leaning any more of your body out of a window is unsafe. You could fall or even be hit by a passing object. Try to keep your seatbelt on if possible.


Be especially careful with this step. There has been at least one reported death when a person leaned out too far in an attempt to vomit., If you look down, you will soil the car. You may even get vomit into the window frame, which will be difficult to get out and may leave a smell, so look away if you can. , Creating a smaller hole for the vomit to escape from will project it farther away from the vehicle. (Imagine how water from a hose sprays farther and with more force when you cover part of the opening.) You may not be able to control it at this point, but it’s worth a shot. , Try to vomit straight outward if you can. If you can’t project outward, try to aim toward the rear of the car. You may get some on the vehicle, but you’re much less likely to get vomit in your face this way.

, If you didn’t project well, you may need to sponge off the exterior of the car later or take it to a car wash.

, If there are napkins or tissues available, try to wipe your mouth. If you have gum, mints, or something to drink, try to get the taste out of your mouth.

Clean up.",How to Vomit from a Moving Car2," If you can’t get to a window that rolls down or if you are driving, a container in the car is a good back-up plan. If there is a grocery or garbage bag in the car, that’s usually your best option. A large fast-food container may also work in a pinch. A shirt or jacket will work. Purses are great containers if you have time to empty one first (and are willing to throw it out later).

, If the container you have found is flimsy (like a paper bag), try to put it inside another container so that you don’t burst the bag when you vomit.

, If you can’t find a container, be prepared to vomit into the floor. Make sure there is nothing that could get soiled. If you did find a container, you may have to put it in the floor for a while until the driver can get to a place for you to discard it.

, Try to hold the edges up around your face so that you don’t spill (especially if it’s a piece of clothing).

, If your driver can get to a garbage bin soon, you should hold on to the bag until then so that it doesn’t spill. If not, you can temporarily put it inside another container where it won’t spill or sit it in the floor.

, Try to wipe your hands and face if you can. Have gum, mints, or something to drink.

Get your bucket.,
Hold the bucket up to your face.,
Hold back your hair.,
Vomit.,
Clean out your bucket.,
Clean yourself off.,
Get some fresh air.,
Use acupressure.,
Try relaxation techniques.",How to Vomit in a Bucket," Your bucket doesn’t need to be anything special, just a place for you to vomit into. It should be small enough that you can hold it in your hands and hold it up to your face.


If you are sick, or feeling nauseous, make sure you are prepared. Keep a bucket near where you are resting. At the very least, make sure it is easily accessible.
If you have kids who might vomit, putting the bucket near the bed is a good bit of preparation in case they can’t make it to the bathroom. Make sure your children knows what the bucket is for, so they are prepared if they need it.;
, If possible, you want the bucket at a level that will allow you to keep your head facing forward. While most people will want to tilt their head downward, this makes it more likely that you’ll get vomit into your nasal passages. That’s an uncomfortable complement to already getting sick. This is a great advantage to using a bucket instead of a toilet., Make sure nothing is in your way before you vomit. The point of the bucket is to keep your vomit from going everywhere. Letting your hair get in the way will only create a bigger mess.


If you have a friend or family member nearby, this can be something helpful for them to do. That way, you can use both hands to hold the bucket.

, Once you are in position, it can be best to let it all out. Vomiting doesn’t feel good, but it can be a necessary way for your body to tell you something is wrong. Keep your head forward, and breathe deeply after finishing.Don’t pull your head away from the bucket until you feel confident you have finished.

, Once you have finished vomiting, you’ll need to clean out the bucket. Vomit, like other bodily fluids, can contain germs that lead to infection. Dump the vomit into a toilet and flush away. Use soap and water to rinse out whatever is left in the bucket. Use paper towels to wipe up anything else, and throw them away when you are finished.You can also use a 1:10 bleach solution (1 cup of bleach mixed with 9 cups of water) to disinfect further. If you do this, make sure to keep the mixture on the bucket for 10 minutes, and keep the room well ventilated. Do not mix with any other cleaning agents.
It may be easier to line the bucket with a trash bag before vomiting. A used plastic grocery bag works just fine. Simply line the bucket with the bag, and after vomiting, simply toss the bag in the trash. Great for quick cleanups, and less odor accumulation, since you may replace the bag anytime. Make sure the bag has no holes in it.
If you are still feeling sick, and not able to fully clean out the bucket, get away from it. Vomit has a pretty strong smell, which can trigger you into vomiting again., Rinse out your mouth with water until the taste is gone, and wash off your hands or any other part of your body. If you need it, a shower can feel refreshing while also getting you clean.

, Tight spaces, or other stuffy situations, can increase nausea. Therefore, if possible, get out of the room for a few minutes, or at least open a window, then take several deep breaths of fresh air., Similar to acupuncture, acupressure is based on traditional Chinese practices and uses the body's natural pressure points. Applying occasional pressure to the P-6 pressure point on your wrist, can help lessen nausea and vomiting.With the palm of one hand facing up, place the first three fingers of your other hand over the wrist while feeling for the two large tendons under the thumb. The point you seek is about three finger lengths below your wrist.
Apply pressure to the point using a circular motion while making sure you are pushing down on the point. This should not cause any pain or discomfort and you can continue to apply pressure for two or three minutes.
Repeat on your other wrist. Locate the pressure point on your other wrist, then apply pressure in a circular motion for a couple of minutes.

, Divert your attention from your discomfort by thinking about something calming. This method is most effective if you have practiced the technique before the need arises to relieve your nausea. There techniques which might help:Autogenic relaxation. This involves finding something to take your mind off the nausea (or whatever else you are feeling). Repeat a word or phrase to yourself, not related to your nausea. Try to think of something peaceful or relaxing. As you repeat this idea, make your deepen your breathing and relax your muscles.
Visualization. Picture a peaceful or calming setting in your mind. Think about how your various senses would experience this place, things you might feel, smell, or hear, as well as what you would see. It can help to close your eyes and sit while you do this.
Deep breathing. Find a quiet place to sit. Take a normal breath, then a deep breath. Breathe in slowly through your nose, and let the air fill your lungs and abdomen. Exhale slowly, through your mouth is better, but it can be through your nose if that is more comfortable."

Know when to seek help.",How to Vomit Without Making a Mess," Vomiting may come on suddenly, but many people experience symptoms of illness that precede the act of vomiting. Rush to a bathroom, garbage can, or a safe outdoor area if you experience any of the following:


dry heavesthe sensation that you're about to vomit
abdominal paincontraction of the stomach musclesdizzinessother stomach ailments, such as diarrhea;
, If you're very sick, overly intoxicated, or experiencing food poisoning, you're going to need to vomit no matter what you do. But if you're only experiencing mild nausea, there are some steps you can take to reduce or prevent the need to vomit. Try the following options to manage your nausea:step outside and get some fresh air
take deep, slow breaths through your mouthsuck on a mint candy or chew gum
smell the inside of your wrist or armpit (the smell of perfume or deodorant may distract your body from the sensation of nausea)
sniff something scented, like essential oil
pinch your arm or tug on your hair (physical sensations can sometimes distract the body)

, If at all possible, try to anticipate when and where you will vomit if the need arises. The most ideal place is in a rest room (in the toilet, if possible), but obviously that may not always be feasible to get to a rest room. If you cannot get to a restroom, try to at least find a plastic bag or trash can to vomit into, as this will greatly reduce how much of a mess you make.If you're going to induce vomiting, wait until you can get to a toilet, trash can, or plastic bag. If you believe that you may vomit uncontrollably in the near future, stay close to a bathroom or keep a trash can/plastic bag on hand.

, Once you've eliminated the potential for making a mess of your immediate environment, your next focus should be on keeping yourself clean. Whether you've made it to a bathroom, found a trash can, or stepped outside to a safe outdoor environment, you'll want to prepare yourself as best you can for what's about to happen.


If you have long hair, tie it back, tuck it behind your ears, or hold it in place behind your head. Vomit in your hair will quickly ruin your night and make an absolute mess.Remove any long, dangling necklaces, or at least tuck them into your shirt. This could create a similar complication as long hair.
Try to direct the stream of vomit away from your shoes, pants, and hands (if you're on all fours). Aim slightly ahead of where you're standing/sitting/crawling.
If indoors, keep your head above the toilet or trash can. Try to lower your head enough that no vomit will splatter outside the container you're vomiting into.
If you're sick in bed, keep a trash can and a stack of towels next to the bed. That way, if you can't reach the trash can or make it to the toilet, you can put down a towel to vomit onto/into. The towel can easily be washed, and it will be much easier to clean up than if you threw up in your bed or on the carpet., After vomiting, you will probably feel sick and a little disgusted. This is normal, as vomiting can be extremely stressful on the body and leaves a revolting aftertaste in the mouth and throat. Even if you managed to complete the actual process of vomiting without making a mess, you'll want to clean yourself up after throwing up to feel better and cleaner.


Brush your teeth, or at the very least rinse your mouth out. Using mouthwash is best, but in a pinch even water will help.Splash some clean, cold water on your face, and wash away any residual vomit that may have clung to your lips, chin, or facial hair.
Suck on a breath mint or chew gum to ensure that your breath does not smell.Wash your hands with soap and water., No matter what the cause of your vomiting was, your body will most likely experience some mild to moderate dehydration after you vomit. That's because your body loses water and nutrients any time you vomit.


When you feel that you will not vomit anymore and you think you can stomach it, slowly drink a glass of cold water. Do not chug the water or attempt to drink it quickly - just sip on it slowly and steadily.If you can keep water down, try drinking a little bit of a sports drink or other electrolyte-rich beverage (such as Gatorade, Powerade, or Pedialyte).Do not try to eat any food until you are feeling completely recovered.
Let yourself sit and relax for a few minutes after vomiting. Avoid any immediate activity, and focus on getting rehydrated and letting your body calm down., Smells can trigger nausea in many people. For some, even the smell of certain meals being prepared or eaten may induce nausea/vomiting.If you are prone to vomiting, or if you are feeling nauseated and want to avoid vomiting, stay clear of any kitchen areas where food is being prepared or eaten. You may also want to avoid other unpleasant odors, such as bathroom odors or the smell (or sight) of someone else vomiting.

, For many people, overeating is a cause of nausea and/or vomiting. If you are prone to bouts of nausea, or if you know that the size of your stomach has shrunk, it's best to avoid eating too much or eating too quickly to help ensure a calm, stable stomach.Try eating multiple smaller meals throughout the day instead of one or two really large meals.Eat bland foods. Avoid sweet, spicy, fried/greasy, and acidic foods, as these are known to cause stomach problems.
Avoid milk and dairy products. You may also want to avoid carbonated drinks, as these may upset some peoples' stomachs., Drinking in excess is a major cause of nausea and vomiting. Even if you don't tend to drink in excess, some people who are prone to stomach problems may become nauseated after consuming even moderate amounts of alcohol. It's always best to moderate your alcohol intake, but if you know drinking will make you vomit, you may be better off avoiding it altogether., If you've eaten too much, drank too much alcohol, or have a fever, vomiting is a somewhat normal reaction your body is having to the contents of your stomach or the presence of a virus. However, sometimes nausea and vomiting are indicative of more serious medical problems, and should be closely monitored. Seek medical assistance immediately if you experience any of the following:


known or suspected ingestion of any kind of poisona head injury that caused vomitingblood (bright red, brownish, or black) or the presence of ""coffee ground""-like contents in your vomitdehydration after vomiting
headache, stiff neck, or confusion
vomiting four or more times in a 24 hour period
bloated or swollen abdomen prior to nausea/vomiting

Use an oral rehydration solution to keep your child hydrated.Use a commercial solution, such as Pedialyte. It is possible to make your own hydration solutions, but due to the high risk of error, pediatricians recommend that you use commercial rehydration solutions.
Have your child drink slowly. Give your child 1-2 teaspoons (5-10 ml) of solution every 5-10 minutes.Avoid fruit juice, soda, and plain water. These will not adequately hydrate and restore your child’s electrolyte balance., Do not offer your child solid foods for the first 24 hours of vomiting.Once your child has stopped vomiting, have your child eat bland, soft foods such as jell-o, mashed potatoes, broth, rice, and banana.Do not press your child to eat if s/he does not want to.


Avoid high-fiber foods and high-sugar foods.Breastfeeding an infant will help hydrate the baby and give him or her adequate nutrition., Young children may inhale or choke on vomit if they are lying on their back. Have your child lie on his or her side.Prop older children up with pillows.

, Young children should not be given over-the-counter medications, such as Pepto-Bismol or antihistamines. These could cause severe illness if given in the wrong doses.


Consult with your pediatrician to determine whether there are medicines that are safe to give your child.

, If your child cannot keep any liquids down, or if his or her symptoms become worse, call your pediatrician.You should also call your child’s doctor if you see any of the following:Vomit has blood in it
Vomit appears green or bright yellow
Your child is dehydrated
Your child’s bowel movements are black or tarry"

Use whitening gel.,
Use whitening toothpaste.",How to Get Whiter Teeth at Home2," Find an ADA-approved gel to use on your teeth and read the instructions to understand the process of using a whitening gel. Then, brush the gel onto your teeth with a small brush, just as you normally would -- for at least two minutes. Then, spit out the remaining gel and rinse out your mouth until the gel is gone.


Whitening gels do not use a strong bleaching agent, so sensitivity is unlikely.
Continue using the whitening gel twice a day for fourteen days, or for however long the product is recommended on the instructions. You'll see results in just a few days.

, Make sure the toothpaste is ADA approved before you purchase it. ADA approved whitening toothpastes whiten your teeth by gently removing their surface stains through polishing, chemical chelation, or other processes that do not require bleach. You can find many of these toothpastes over the counter. Use the toothpaste just as you would use any other toothpaste, brushing your teeth for at least two minutes and then rinsing your mouth.

Use hydrogen peroxide.,
Purchase a bottle of hydrogen peroxide from your local drugstore.,
Use a mixture of the hydrogen peroxide and water as a mouthwash.,
Brush your teeth with a hydrogen peroxide and baking soda paste once a week.",How to Get Whiter Teeth at Home3," Commercial whitening kits aren't cheap; for a cheaper solution, you might like to consider whitening your teeth at home using hydrogen peroxide for a similar effect. Bleaching teeth with hydrogen peroxide is acknowledged as a safe practice by the American Dental Association.

, Hydrogen peroxide is commonly used to treat skin wounds, but its antiseptic properties are also good for oral hygiene. Hydrogen peroxide is typically packaged in a brown bottle. The opaque packaging keeps light from altering the makeup of the solution. Buy a 3% solution, which is safe for oral use and weak enough so it won’t cause sensitivity.

, Use it daily before you brush your teeth to whiten your teeth naturally. Make sure to mix it in a 50/50 solution with water. Here's how you should do it:


Pour about 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of the antiseptic into your mouth, and swish it around for 1 minute. The solution will begin to foam; this is how you know it is working. The hydrogen peroxide combined with oral bacteria cause bubbles to form in your mouth, but this will not taste good. Some people dislike this method because of the bad taste.
Spit out the solution, and rinse your mouth with water.
Brush your teeth as you normally would.

, This mixture will help keep your teeth looking white and clean. Here's how you can make it:Pour 2 teaspoons (10ml) of hydrogen peroxide into 3 teaspoons (15ml) of baking soda. Mix these together until a paste forms. Play with these measurements until you find a consistency that you like. The paste should be similar in thickness to toothpaste.
Add a tiny bit of mint toothpaste to your homemade paste to give it a fresh flavor. You can also add a drop of peppermint extract.
Mix in a dash of salt. The salt will exfoliate your teeth as you brush. However, salt is quite abrasive, so don't use it too often and always use a soft toothbrush.
Dollop the paste mixture onto your toothbrush.
Brush the paste onto your teeth in small, circular motions. Once all teeth are covered, let the mixture sit on your teeth for 2 minutes.
Rinse the solution off your teeth by swishing with water from the bathroom sink.
Brush your teeth with toothpaste to rid your mouth of any remnants of the hydrogen peroxide mixture.

Wet your toothbrush and dip it into baking soda.,
Brush your teeth for 2 minutes.,
Spit out the baking soda.,
Add lime or lemon juice to the baking soda.",How to Get Whiter Teeth at Home4," All of the bristles should be covered with water so that your toothbrush bristles are white.

, Use gentle pressure to brush your teeth. Spit if necessary.

, Rinse your mouth clean with water (you don't want baking soda in your mouth for a long period of time). Using mouthwash after can help to remove the bad taste of the baking soda if it is unbearable. Use this method once or twice a week for the best results.


If you experience any tingling after using baking soda in your mouth, see your dentist. It may indicate tooth decay.
Overusing this method can cause damage to the enamel that coats your teeth. Talk to your dentist about how often you should be trying this., This involves adding the juice of a lime or lemon to the baking soda:Squeeze the juice from 1/2 a lemon or lime.
Mix the fresh juice with a 1/4 cup of baking soda. Expect a little bubbling.
Dab a damp cotton wool ball or corner of a clean face wash cloth into the mixture. Rub the mixture over the teeth, making sure to get it into the gaps and corners near your gums, and right down to the ends of each tooth. Also rub the backs of the teeth.
Leave for one minute then immediately brush off. Don't leave it too long as it is acidic and can wear away your precious pearly whites. It can also have a negative impact on your tooth enamel.
Use once weekly or less often. Over time, you should see some whitening results.

Avoid foods or beverages that stain your teeth.,
Eat natural teeth helpers.",How to Get Whiter Teeth at Home5," Where possible, you may be able to prevent further staining by making some lifestyle changes. This includes stopping all smoking, and reducing your consumption of beverages containing tannins––soda, coffee, red wine, and tea all contain tannins.In some cases, you can help keep tannin drinks away from your teeth by drinking them with a straw (do not drink hot liquids through a straw).

, Some foods can actually help you keep your teeth white. Here are a few of them:Eat more apples, celery, and carrots. They're like a fruit and veggie toothbrush for the teeth and they help increase the production of saliva in your mouth, removing plaque.As an added bonus, their high levels of vitamin C help to kill off odor-causing bacteria and strengthen your gums.
Eat more strawberries. They contain a natural astringent (malic acid), which helps to lift stains. To get the most benefits, consider rubbing half a strawberry over your teeth or mashing the strawberry and applying it to your teeth. Leave for one minute, then rinse clear.Rinse with a glass of half lemon juice and half warm water once a week. This will lighten your teeth. Don't do it more than once a week though, as the lemon juice can erode teeth too.Eat more hard cheese. It helps to increase saliva production in the mouth, thereby removing the bacteria that stains teeth and it is also a good source of helpful minerals, such as calcium and zinc."

Purchase a regular brush and consider adding a braces-specific proxabrush to get between brackets.Get a regular brush with soft bristles.Make sure the brush size and shape fit your mouth, which can help reach all areas of your mouth.Buy a proxabrush, or “Christmas tree” brush, if you like. This may help you more effectively clean between braces.Replace any brush with frayed bristles or every 3-4 months.;
, Run your toothbrush(es) under water and put a pea-sized dollop of toothpaste on it.This can ensure the most effective cleaning of your teeth, braces, and oral cavity.


Use fluoride toothpaste. It can help strengthen your teeth and remove plaque, which may build up around braces with improper brushing.Braces may make your teeth sensitive, so you may want to use a fluoride toothpaste formulated to minimize sensitivity., Section your mouth into top, left, right, and bottom quadrants for brushing. Setting up specific sections can help you make sure that every surface is properly cleaned.


Brush whichever section you want or what makes you most comfortable.
Make sure to brush your tongue and the roof of your mouth as well.
Hold your toothbrush at a 45-degree angle using gentle pressure.Make sure the brush stays in contact with the surface of your teeth and gum line.Brush from outer to inner tooth surfaces with short strokes and repeat the process for each section of your mouth.Brush the inside surfaces of your front teeth by angling the brush vertically and making several up and down strokes.Pay attention to the surfaces around and in-between your braces, which is where plaque can build up.Brush chewing surfaces, your tongue, and soft palate using a scrubbing motion that gently goes back and forth.Wearing braces means that your gums will always be slightly inflamed, so expect small amounts of bleeding. This is normal.

, When you’ve finished using your regular brush, consider using a proxabrush, or “Christmas tree” brush. This may help you more effectively clean between individual brackets if you are concerned your regular brush isn’t enough.Work on two teeth at a time.Insert the brush from the top of the wire between two brackets and then repeat from the bottom., Each time your brush your teeth, take time to floss as well. Because debris can easily get stuck in teeth with braces and plaque can build up, flossing is can help remove lingering debris.Remove about 18 inches of floss from the packaging. Wrap it around your middle fingers.Grasp the rest between your thumbs and forefingers.Gently feed the floss between the top of your tooth near the gum and the main arch wire of your bracket.Use a gentle sawing motion on the side of each tooth.Ask your orthodontist if there is a specific type of floss you should use.
The floss used to clean dental bridges may be a good option because it has a tip that gently goes between your teeth and gums.
Try water-flossing if you don’t like regular floss or your doctor suggests it.

, Rinse your mouth with mouthwash after you’ve brushed and flossed. Studies have shown that using a mouthwash may decrease plaque, which can be a problem for people with braces. It may also clear lingering food particles or bacteria.Swish the mouthwash in your mouth.
Buy a mouthwash with chlorhexidine, which many oral care professionals recommend. Mouthwashes containing alcohol can dry out your mouth and cause bad breath., You may have some tenderness if you recently had your braces tightened or adjusted.Don’t let this deter you from brushing. Take an over-the-counter pain medication to relieve discomfort.


Take over-the-counter pain relievers such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen sodium, or acetaminophen.
Let your orthodontist know if you are in a lot of pain.It is better to return to your orthodontist for another 5 minutes to get a small adjustment than to suffer from increased pressure, which may produce longterm negative effects.

, Brush and floss your teeth and braces daily as well as after meals. This can minimize plaque and remove debris and bacteria.


Brush and floss after meals if you are able.

, Watching what you eat can promote overall and oral health. Eat a balanced diet that is low in sugary foods to minimize plaque or stain formation around your braces.Eat lean proteins, fruits and vegetables, and legumes.
If you eat something sugary, consider brushing your teeth when you’re done.
Some examples of sugary foods and drinks to stay away from are soft drinks, sweets, candies, and even wine.

, Certain foods and colored drinks can stick to or damage your braces. Staying away from them can help you avoid problems with your teeth and braces.Some foods to avoid are:


Popcorn
Corn on the cob
Chewing gum
Whole apples
Sticky foods, such as caramel., If you clench or grind your teeth, you could damage your teeth or braces. Ask your dentist or orthodontist about using a mouth guard.


Grinding wears can cause sensitivity and damage such small chips and cracks in your teeth.
Avoid biting your nails, opening bottles, or holding things in your mouth.

, Regular checkups and cleanings with your dentist are important to maintaining oral health. You should also visit your orthodontist regularly to help correct your teeth. Visit your dentist at least twice a year and your orthodontist as often as she suggests.


Consider using a dentist and orthodontist who work together.

Brush your teeth twice a day.,
Floss daily.,
Gargle with mouthwash.,
Schedule regular dental appointments.",How to Get Whiter Teeth at Home6," While brushing and flossing won't remove existing stains, good mouth hygiene is essential to preventing more staining and to keeping your teeth in excellent shape. The first most useful thing you can do is to brush your teeth regularly, to remove plaque, pieces of food and drink residue. Plaque will attack your teeth and gums if left in place and brushing (in conjunction with flossing) helps to disturb its ability to grow.


Brush before or after breakfast and before going to bed. This is a minimum; many people also like to brush after lunch and even after snacks, especially if they are sugary snacks.

, Floss is the most effective way for you to remove plaque build-up from in between your teeth and near the gums. With plaque removed, your teeth will appear much cleaner and therefore brighter.


Floss at least once a day. A good time is at night, after brushing and before going to bed.
Experiment with different types of floss until you find one that works best for you. Some floss types may be too rough, too slippery or too flavored for you, so keep looking for one you do like.

, Mouthwash kills bacteria and can contain elements aimed at strengthening your teeth. Used along with brushing and flossing, mouthwash can help reduce the bacteria, kill bad odors and keep your teeth healthier and cleaner. Some mouthwashes also whiten teeth, consider trying those.


As with floss, not all mouthwashes are the same. Experiment with different types until you find a mouthwash you like and that leaves your teeth and gums feeling fresh. Also, remember to dilute the mouthwash with water if you feel discomfort or a slight burning sensation.

, Have your dentist clean your teeth professionally at your regularly-scheduled appointments. This will help you maintain good dental hygiene, spot any cavities, and keep white, healthy teeth. Remember to talk to your dentist before you try any teeth whitening product to make sure that it won't hurt your teeth.


If you have very sensitive teeth and gums, or crowns or some other dental work that won't react well with a whitening product, your dentist will know.
Serious teeth darkening is usually best remedied by professionals.

Stick to soft food.,
Eat cold foods if feeling pain.,
Choose foods that can be purchased or prepared in different ways.",How to Eat With Braces1," ""Mushy"" foods like bananas, mashed potatoes, yogurt, and scrambled eggs are all soothing on the gums and will not risk breaking a bracket.Smoothies packed full of fresh and frozen fruit and vegetables are especially soothing in the first few days after getting braces put on. Not only can they help alleviate the soreness, but smoothies can also pack a nutritional punch when made with fruit, yogurt, milk, and even nutrient-rich leafy greens, like kale. This is a great way to ensure that you are getting the vitamins and nutrients you need when you don't feel up to eating solids.Noodle dishes, such as ravioli, spaghetti, and macaroni and cheese are also good meal options.It's helpful to consult cookbooks and other resources so that you can develop your own arsenal of healthy and tasty soft food recipes. Useful cookbooks devoted specifically to recipes for people with braces include The Braces Cookbook (two volumes), Tender Teeth Cookbook, and Surviving Braces.;
, Treat yourself to something chilled, such as ice cream, popsicles, milkshakes, or frozen yogurt. The cold temporarily dulls the pain from your braces., For example, melons are often eaten in slices that you bite right into. However, melons can also be cubed, which people with braces may find easier to eat. Choosing more versatile foods, or foods with different variations, can help open up possibilities!


Because of its teeny kernels, popcorn is a major no-no for most braces-wearers because it has a tendency to get lodged in your gums underneath the bracket and cause irritation. However, it is possible to buy hull-less popcorn.Popular brands include Just Poppin' and Amish Country Popcorn.

Stop and think.,
Stay calm.,
Look everywhere.,
Ask around.,
Get help.,
Wear your retainer.,
Be consistent.,
Never wrap it in a napkin.,
Use memory strategies.,
Get a case.,
Motivate yourself to keep it safe.,
Call your orthodontist.,
Be prepared for the replacement cost.",How to Find Your Retainer," Before panicking and running all over looking for it, sit down and think about what you were doing the last time you remember having it. Try to mentally recreate the scene: where were you? Who were you with? What were you doing? Try to reconstruct a detailed memory, including how you were feeling, the flavor of food you might have been eating, the scents in the room, and any other details you can remember.Try to remember the events that followed your last memory of having it with you. If you last took it out to eat chips and have a soda, think about what you did next. Did you go put your dishes in the sink? Perhaps you brought your retainer with you to the kitchen. Did you run to the restroom? Perhaps you took it there. Or perhaps you put it under your napkin while you were eating, and folded the napkin and then inadvertently disposed of the whole thing. In that case, it may be in the trash.;
, Otherwise, your stress hormone level will rise, causing you to have a fast pulse and sweaty palms. These intense emotions cloud your judgment and memory, can easily distract you from being able to recall where you last had it.If you feel yourself start to panic, take a few deep breaths, in through your nose and out through your mouth. Sit down and close your eyes for a few minutes before resuming your search.

, If you've retraced your steps and still cannot find it, it is time to start looking in more unexpected places. It could easily be in the bathroom, in your room, backpack, or locker. Just because it wasn't in your nightstand doesn't mean it's not under your bed.


Take a systematic approach to your search; you are more likely to be successful if you treat each room or location like a crime scene and carefully analyze it, rather than if you start throwing other items around and digging through things in a panic.When you enter a room to search, begin on one wall or section of the room, and then work in a circle until you've searched the entire room. Remember to search in levels, including ground level (looking under furniture and on the ground), in drawers and on desks and tables, and on top of higher furniture and shelves.

, Don't be embarrassed to tell your parents, friends, or roommate that you've lost your retainer. It's a better alternative to having crooked teeth because you didn't wear your retainer.


Let people know where you saw it last and see if they happened to see it. Some people are unfamiliar with retainers and may not realize it is not trash. For example, if you lost it in a restaurant or cafeteria, be sure to tell those working there that you've misplaced it; they may have tossed it in the garbage without realizing.

, If all else fails, ask someone to help you search. Other people won't feel the same anxiety you might be feeling, so they can search with a clear head. They might also be able to help see things you've overlooked.


In the case of parents, remember that they'd probably rather help you find your retainer than pay for a new one!

, If it's in your mouth, you won't lose it. This is especially helpful in the early stages when you are just getting used to this new addition to your routine.In most cases, for at least the first month, the only reasons you should remove it is to eat, brush your teeth, or play contact sports. After that, you should wear it every night for two years, and then at least three nights a week for the rest of your life., Keep your retainer in the same place every time you remove it, so that you won't have to spend time searching for it in the future.


Keep it somewhere convenient, out of the reach of children and pets. A shelf in your bedroom or in a bathroom medicine cabinet can be a good option.

, The most common way that retainers are lost is when they are removed at a restaurant or in the cafeteria and wrapped in a napkin so that no one will see them, and then inadvertently discarded with the trash.It might be embarrassing to have your retainer on display for the whole table to see, but probably not as embarrassing as having to ask a restaurant hostess to dig through the trash to find your lost retainer.

, When you do have to remove your retainer in a situation where you can't quickly put it in its normal place, use memory strategies to remember where you've put it. If you put your retainer down mindlessly, it will be harder to remember where you've put it later. But if you are mindful of where it is when you put it down (what psychologists call ""effortful processing""), you can use recall strategies to remember.Say where it is, out loud, as you put it down. For example, ""I'm putting my retainer on the counter next to the aloe vera plant."" Saying things out loud makes your brain consciously think about your action, which can help you remember what you did later.Tell someone. When you take your retainer out, tell whoever you are with where you're putting it. You can even text a friend! That way, if you can't find it later, you can always ask. This has the same benefit of saying it out loud, but with the added benefit of having a second person to help remember.
Practice mindfulness. Mindfulness is a meditative practice that involves focusing on sensations, sights, sounds, and other details of the present moment. By making an effort to be mentally present in your day-to-day routine, you can avoid mindlessly setting your retainer down and instead train yourself to think consciously about the moment as you remove it., There will always be those times when you have to remove your retainer and have nowhere to put it discreetly, such as when you're eating at a restaurant or when you want to chow down on popcorn at the movie theater. It is worth it to spend a little money on a case, just as you would for glasses or anything else you need to keep track of.Choose a case in a very bright color, so that it will be eye-catching and easy to spot if you misplace it. If it does happen to get thrown in the trash, it will be easier to find.If you carry a purse or backpack, keep the case in the bag at all times. That way, when you remove the retainer, you can stash it right back in a special pocket in your bag so you don’t forget where it is.
Consider a carrying case with a clip for added security. You can clip the case onto a loop on your clothes or in your bag so that you don't drop it inadvertently. These are available from Amazon or websites like Dentakit.

, Retainers are costly, so if you know that you will suffer a financial setback by losing it, you might do a better job of keeping it safe.


If your parents typically pay for your retainers, resolve to pay for your own replacement if you lose it. Knowing that you will have to give up allowance or work odd jobs to pay for a replacement can be a great motivator!
If you typically purchase your own retainers, promise yourself a reward if you manage to not lose it before it's time to replace it again. The reward might be something you've been wanting to purchase for yourself like new shoes or a belt, a day at the spa, or a truffle from the candy store. Make sure it is something you wouldn't normally reward yourself with, so that it will be motivating to you!
The only way these motivators will work is if they encourage you to practice memory strategies and make an effort to remember where you put your retainer, so commit to putting in the extra cognitive work!

, It's important to get a new retainer if you absolutely cannot find yours. Otherwise, your teeth will shift and you will lose whatever progress you have made in shifting them.


Call if you haven't found your retainer after a few hours. Your orthodontist will want to schedule an appointment promptly to prevent tooth relapse,and it will take a few days to have new retainers made., Retainers are expensive, and most cost a couple of hundred dollars (US) per piece (top or bottom).


Ask your dentist or orthodontist about her replacement policy for lost retainers. Also ask if you can get a reduced rate if you purchase more than one retainer at a time, so that you can have a backup on hand if you need it again."

Avoid hard or extremely crunchy foods.,
Avoid eating anything sticky or chewy.,
Avoid foods you would normally bite into with your front teeth.,
Avoid stringy foods.,
Avoid foods high in sugar content.",How to Eat With Braces2," Some foods are simply too tough to safely bite into with braces. As a general rule, you want to avoid biting into anything that could break or pop off a bracket or bend your wires.


Hard foods to be avoided include ice, hard candies, hard pretzels, pizza crust, croutons, nuts, and seeds to name a few.
You should also stay away from foods with a hard center, including ribs or chicken legs. Pull the meat off the bone instead.

, Sticky foods can stick to your brackets and be hard to clean off.Really sticky and chewy foods can even pull your orthodontic appliance away from your teeth. If this happens, you'll have to make an appointment with your orthodontist to have the appliance re-fixed; this can slow down treatment progress.


Stay away from taffy, caramel, Airheads, Skittles, jellybeans, Mentos, Jolly Ranchers, Starburst, licorice, and candy bars that have caramel. Peanut butter is fine.

, This means foods like sub sandwiches, pizza, hamburgers, celery, carrots, and most fruits that you can grab and go (like apples, peaches, pears, etc.).


Using your front teeth to bite into certain foods can damage the brackets. It can also cause food build-up in and around your braces, which may make you feel self-conscious.

, This is especially necessary if you have a palate expander, where food can easily get caught. Be especially careful with foods that get stringy when they melt, like mozzarella cheese., Foods high in sugar can cause plaque build-up and damage the enamel on your teeth.


The combination of sugar and plaque causes acid in the mouth, which can lead to swollen gums, decay, and discolored teeth. Keep in mind all of the time and efforts you have put into straightening your teeth before you reach for high-sugar foods that only damage them.

Slow down.,
Bite with the side of your mouth.,
Make modifications to foods you like.,
Consider alternative treatments if eating becomes too uncomfortable.",How to Eat With Braces3," Chew slowly and carefully. The days of taking huge bites of food or ""wolfing down"" your meal are over once you get braces. SLOW is your new motto!Foods that you used to eat by the handful should now be eaten one at a time - like chips, for example., Especially within the first few days and weeks of getting your braces put on or tightened, it may be all but impossible to bite into anything with your front teeth for a while. Instead, bite and chew on your side and back teeth.Learning to use your side and back teeth more will also help prevent food from getting visibly stuck in your braces, which is what often happens if you bite into something like a sandwich, pizza, or burrito with your front teeth., Though there are lots of foods that are better than others for your braces, you don't have to cut all of the non-ideal foods out of your diet. Instead, use your creativity and make appropriate modifications that accommodate your appliance.


Cook hard or crunchy foods. Foods that have a heavy crunch, like vegetables, could loosen the brackets on your braces if eaten raw. However, a lot of vegetables, such as carrots and celery, soften when cooked. So cook them before eating and this way avoid having to make an emergency visit to your orthodontist!
For foods or meals that are likely to have hidden chunks of meat or vegetables, such as burritos, sandwiches, and wraps, your best bet is to eat these with a fork and knife.Foods traditionally considered bite-size or a single serving, like a sushi roll, are challenging to eat with braces. There is the possibility of choking or gagging if you eat these foods whole. Instead, try cutting pieces and portions in half to make sure that you can chew it slowly and completely.For foods with cores or pits, such as apples, pears, and peaches, slice them into thin pieces, instead of biting into them. You can even eat corn on the cob by running a sharp knife down the length of the cob and cutting off all of the kernels., If you find that eating becomes painful or unmanageable because of poking brackets or mouth sores (called cankers), try applying dental wax. Dental wax forms a barrier between your bracket and gums and lips and can provide hours of pain relief from irritation. "

Warning signs include teeth that look as though they’re sitting sideways, teeth that overlap each other, and teeth that protrude significantly farther than the surrounding teeth. Crowding is the most common issue addressed by braces.To determine whether your teeth are crowded, you can use dental floss. If floss is very difficult to slide between teeth, your teeth may be crowded too closely together.;
, Teeth that are crowded or too close together may make it difficult even for dental professionals to properly clean them. The buildup of plaque on teeth can cause abnormal enamel wear, cavities, tooth decay, and gum disease. Gum disease is one of the leading factors in the development of periodontitis, and patients with crowded teeth have a high risk of developing this disease.


Many things can cause crooked or crowded teeth. For some people, their bones are simply too small to contain all their teeth properly, which causes teeth to shift and crowd together. This usually happens due to genetic heritage, meaning that in most cases we inherit the upper jaw from one of our parents and the lower jaw from the other parent.
Other people may experience crowding once their wisdom teeth grow in making the front teeth look crooked as their roots and bone support is weaker than one of the back teeth.

, Crowding isn't the only situation that can cause problems. If you have missing teeth, proportionally small teeth, or large gaps between your teeth, this could also impair the functioning of your bite and jaw. Spacing is one of the more common issues addressed by braces., When you bite down, your teeth should fit together. If there is a large space between your upper and lower teeth, or if your upper or lower teeth protrude significantly past the others, you may have bite problems that need to be corrected with braces.


Upper teeth that extend past the lower teeth when you bite down covering more than half of their visible surface result in an overbite.
Lower teeth that extend past the upper teeth when you bite down result in an underbite.
There is also another case when you bite down and your lower front teeth do not touch the upper front teeth leaving a sagittal space called over jet.
Upper teeth that are positioned improperly inside the lower teeth result in a crossbite, which can lead to facial asymmetry if not corrected., When your bite is misaligned, your chances of having plaque and decaying food particles build up on and between teeth increase. This plaque and decaying food can lead to periodontal disease, gingivitis, dental abscesses, and even tooth loss, making brushing and cleaning very difficult and in most cases incomplete.Misaligned bites may also cause difficulty in chewing, which can lead to sore jaws and even gastrointestinal discomfort.
Misalignment in your jaws can cause tight and strained muscles, which can lead to frequent headaches.
Excessive overbites can cause your lower front teeth to damage the gum tissue on the roof of your mouth making chewing very painful.

, Routinely getting food stuck in your teeth can create a haven for bacteria that can lead to gum disease and tooth decay. Braces can help eliminate gaps or pockets in between teeth that trap bacteria and food particles.

, Frequent or persistent bad breath, even after brushing and flossing your teeth, may be a sign that bacteria are being trapped between crooked or crowded teeth and also that pockets might be present, which will lead to pus in your gums.

, If you notice a lisp, it may be the result of malocclusion, or misaligned teeth. Braces may help eliminate this lisp by properly aligning your teeth and jaw.

, If your jaw is misaligned, it may put extra stress on your temporomandibular joints, the hinges that attach your jaw to your head. If you frequently experience soreness or pain in this area, you may need braces to properly align your jaw and to correct your bite, which is causing unequal tensions in the TMJ.

, There are many reasons people choose to wear braces. Sometimes, it is merely a cosmetic decision. Many people associate straight, white teeth with health and beauty, and there is nothing wrong with wanting a pearly white smile. However, there are also medical reasons to consider braces.


Bite misalignment and malocclusion (teeth that are crooked and/or crowded) are the most common medical reasons to get braces.

, If you are an adult, you will need to wear braces anywhere from 12 to 20 months, on average.Most children and adolescents will need to wear braces for about 2 years.You will likely need to wear a retainer for several months following the removal of your braces, and if you are not patient and determined, then you might give up during the treatment. Make sure you’re ready for a long-term commitment.


Adults may need to wear braces longer than young children and teens. Additionally, because adult facial bones have stopped growing and are much more mineralized, braces cannot correct some conditions in adults (such as sleep apnea) that they can in children., Especially if you’re an adult who has never had braces before, hearing what the experience is like from someone who has had braces can help you determine whether braces are right for you.

, Standard metal braces generally cost between $5,000 to $6,000.More specialized braces, such as clear ceramic braces or “invisible” braces (like Invisalign) are often much more expensive.


Some health insurance plans in the United States do not cover braces. Check with your health insurance provider about your dental coverage and out-of-pocket expenses.

, While dentists do not have the specialized training that orthodontists have, they are a good place to start for advice about your teeth. A dentist may be able to help you decide if you should see an orthodontist about your teeth and jaws.


Your dentist may also be able to refer you to a reliable orthodontist in your area, and he or she can also prepare your case before the treatment starts if you need fillings, extractions, or fixing any other dental problems.

, If your teeth are not crooked or crowded enough to need braces for realignment, veneers might be a good option for you. Veneers are thin porcelain sheets that are bonded to the fronts of your teeth to improve their aesthetic appearance, and they offer instant results by making your teeth look straight and white and giving you a perfect smile., Your dentist can take X-rays and perform bite tests that will help determine whether you need to see an orthodontist.


Your dentist can also tell if your teeth are overcrowded or just a little tight.

, The American Association of Orthodontists maintains an online database of AAO-certified orthodontists, including a search feature to find an orthodontist in your area. You can also ask your regular dentist for a referral.

, Gone are the days of horrifying headgear and “metal mouth.” Depending on your budget, your dental needs, and your aesthetic preferences, you can choose from a variety of braces and orthodontic appliances.Standard metal braces are usually the least expensive and most effective option. However, some people may feel self-conscious about having very conspicuous braces.
Clear ceramic braces fit on the front of the teeth just like metal braces, but are less conspicuous. They are slightly less effective than metal braces and are also more prone to staining and breaking. They also generally cost more than metal braces.
Invisible braces are totally different than traditional braces. The most common type of invisible brace is Invisalign. Invisalign braces are a series of customized aligners that are worn to gradually shift teeth into place. Because you need to get multiple sets of aligners made to gradually move your teeth, Invisalign braces are the most expensive option and have limited indications as the effects can't be compared to regular braces because they generate different types of forces. They also do not work well for bite issues., For almost everyone, wearing braces is a safe, if sometimes uncomfortable, procedure. However, there are some risks associated with braces, so ask your dental professional for information.For some people, braces may cause some loss of length in tooth roots. While this almost never presents problems, it may in some cases cause unstable teeth.
If your teeth have been previously damaged, such as by a physical trauma or accident, the tooth movement caused by braces may cause tooth discoloration or irritation in the tooth nerve.
Failure to follow your orthodontist’s instructions may cause your braces not to correct your teeth properly. It may also result in some loss of correction after your braces come off.

, If you decide to get braces, you will need to take extra care of your teeth in order to prevent gum disease, tooth decay, and decalcification.


Be aware that it is much more difficult to clean teeth properly when you are wearing braces, particularly metal or clear ceramic braces that are bonded to your teeth.

Consider your exposure to high-risk areas.,
Think about how you could have contracted hookworm.,
Watch for a ""serpiginous rash.,
Look for mild coughing or sore throat.Once you've contracted hookworm, they find their way into your bloodstream.,
Notice signs of anemia.,
Do not ignore stomach pain.Hookworms migrate to the intestines, so gastrointestinal discomfort is not uncommon, especially following eating.,
Note that many patients do not exhibit symptoms.,
Seek early diagnosis.If you live in a high-risk area, ask the doctor to make hookworm testing part of your regular checkup.,
Follow the anthelmintic drug schedule your doctor prescribes.Anthelmintic drugs attack intestinal parasites like hookworms.,
Refrain from scratching itchy rashes under any circumstance.,
Protect your hands from fecal matter.When using the restroom, keep your hands away from your rectum.,
Complete iron therapy if necessary.Because hookworms cause blood loss, an infection often results in iron-deficient anemia.,
Revisit the doctor as directed.The appointment schedule may vary depending on the doctor's evaluation of your particular case.,
Wash your hands thoroughly.,
Always wear shoes outdoors.This is especially important if you are in a high-risk location.,
Have the veterinarian check and deworm cats and dogs annually.Even if your pet was dewormed when you adopted it from the shelter, it can come into contact with hookworms at a later time.,
Never let your pet lick you on the mouth.Dogs especially love to show their love by licking their human on the face, including the mouth.,
Take care when handling pet feces.,
Monitor children closely.Even for adults, containing a hookworm infection can be hard.,
Make sure your water and food are clean and sterile.",How to Get Rid of Hookworms When Infected," Hookworm is most common in developing nations in Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America.Areas with poor sanitation, water treatment, and plumbing/sewage infrastructure are especially at risk. The hookworm larvae live in the soil and migrate toward the surface in search of oxygen and sunlight. Coming into contact with soil in high-risk areas — whether by hand or by walking barefoot — increases your odds of infection.Sunbathing on your back can also cause infection.


Hookworms thrive best in a moist, sandy environment.;
, There are three ways to contract hookworm: through skin penetration, oral ingestion, and rarely via breast milk.If you either live in or have visited a high-risk area, think about whether any of those modes of transmission are possible. Skin penetration is most common through the feet, but can occur anywhere on the body.


You can contract it orally by eating food prepared by an infected host or coming into contact with infected feces. Dog and cat owners, especially, can contract hookworm while handling their pets' feces.Soil can become contaminated by pet feces, as well. Consider whether you've walked barefoot somewhere dogs or cats defecate.

,""If you have an infection type called ""cutaneous larva migrans,"" you may develop a very memorable rash. The word ""serpiginous"" shares a root with ""serpent,"" or snake. The rash has that name because you can see the hookworms moving around under the surface of the skin, like snakes. This rash migrates one to two centimeters a day, from which we get the ""migrans"" part of the name.

, When they reach the lungs, they penetrate the air sacs around the lung (alveoli) and cause inflammation. This may result in a mild cough or perhaps a sore throat while the larvae continue up the airway toward the glottis.Other symptoms of this stage might include:


Wheezing
Headache
Coughing up blood

, As the larvae approach the glottis, they get swallowed and make their way to the small intestine. They attach to the intestinal walls with their teeth, causing blood loss as they feed on protein. If they are allowed to mature in the intestines, they can cause malnutrition and anemia.Symptoms of anemia include:Fatigue
Weakness
Pale skin
A fast or irregular heartbeat
Shortness of breath
Chest pain
Dizziness
Cognitive problems
Cold hands and feet
Headache

, Because the hookworms repeatedly bite the intestinal wall, the pain is like an internal bee sting. Other gastrointestinal problems may include diarrhea, appetite loss, or weight loss.

, The severity of symptoms depends on the ""load"" or ""worm burden."" If you have 100-500 larvae in your system, symptoms will be mild or nonexistent. A medium load is 500 or larger, and a large load is 1,000 or greater., If you recently travelled to a high-risk area, see your doctor when you return. Give her a thorough history of your travels, as well as your interactions with dogs and cats. The doctor may perform the following tests to diagnose a hookworm infection:


Analysis of a stool sample for eggs and parasitesA chest radiograph to look for larvae in the lungs
A complete blood count (CBC) and iron panel to check for anemia

, Different species of hookworm cause different types of infections. Though there is a small degree variation for specific diagnoses, in general, treatment is the same for all types:


Take 100 mg of Mebendazole three times daily. The dosing for this drug is the same for both adults and children.
Take one 400 mg dose of Albendazole for most hookworm cases. If, after two weeks, the lab still finds eggs in your stool sample, you will take a second dose.
If you have an infection called ""visceral larva migrans,"" take 400 mg of Albendazole twice daily for five to twenty days.
Take 325 mg of ferrous sulfate three times daily for six weeks to treat iron deficiency.
Take 1000 mg of Vitamin C supplement daily for six weeks.
Take anti-itch medication like benadryl, atarax, or hydrocortisone cream for cutaneous larva migrans.

, The itching is caused by worms just under the surface of your skin. Scratching might get worms lodged under your fingernails. You might ingest them with food or introduce them to the rectum when using the restroom. Scratching also raises your chances of getting a bacterial skin infection.It's important to avoid scratching a hookworm rash at all costs. Covering the rash with long sleeves or pants might prevent you from absent-minded scratching.

, If larvae in your stool get on your hands or touch your skin, the process begins all over again. To be safe, consider wearing disposable latex gloves until the tests show you are free of hookworms.

, If you have this condition, the doctor will recommend a course of iron supplements and dietary change to normalize your levels. Very rarely, severe anemia may call for blood transfusions, iron injections, or IV iron therapy. The best food sources of iron are meat products, especially red meat. Other iron sources include:


Iron-fortified breads and cereals
Peas; lentils; white, red, and baked beans; soybeans; and chickpeas
Tofu
Dried fruits, such as prunes, raisins, and apricots
Dark leafy greens
Prune juice

, In general, though, you may be asked to return for a stool sample analysis after two weeks. If, at that time, the lab still finds hookworm eggs in your stool, the doctor will prescribe another dose of Albendazole. Six weeks after the initial treatment, the doctor will order another complete blood count. If your lab values don't fall within healthy levels, you will repeat the therapy for another six weeks, then repeat the CBC.

, Wash your hands after coming into contact with potentially contaminated soil or feces, and always before you eat. Make sure you are cleaning under your nails, between your fingers, and above your wrist.


Use warm or hot water and soap, scrubbing for at least 20 seconds. If you're not sure how long to scrub, simply sing the ""Happy Birthday"" song twice in a row.

, However, walking barefoot anywhere can put your skin in contact with larvae from dog or cat feces. Even flip flops or open-toed shoes can potentially expose your skin to infection.

, During its annual checkup, provide the veterinarian with a stool sample to be checked for worms. If he or she confirms that your pet has worms, get it dewormed immediately.

, If the pet has recently eaten, sniffed, or otherwise investigated infected stool, the A Caninum species may be transferred to your skin.

, Even if you think you’re being safe when picking up your dog’s feces or cleaning your cat’s litter box, it’s better safe than sorry. Use a special pooper scooper when picking up feces, rather than placing your hands anywhere in the vicinity of potentially infected stool.


If you can afford it, you might consider hiring a pet waste removal service., You have a rash you can’t itch, a pet whose mouth you have to avoid, and the constant threat of reinfection through your own stool. Children, then, need extra help to prevent spreading the infection to others or reinfecting themselves. Watch them especially when they’re around pets to make sure they stay away from their mouths. Don’t allow them to play in potentially infected soil, and especially make sure they don’t eat any dirt.

, Water for drinking, bathing, and cooking should be sterile. If you're not certain of the purity of the water, make sure you boil it and then allow it to cool down before use. Make sure your food is fully cooked.

Slip it back into place.,
Bend it back.,
Clip it off.",How to Fix a Broken Braces Wire1," Sometimes a braces wire can come loose from inside the bracket, which is the small metal or ceramic object attached to your tooth. If this occurs, or if the wire comes completely out, see if you can push it back in with your finger. If you can't push it back in, grab a mirror and a pair of tweezers. Grab the middle of the wire and bend it so you can stick the end back into its place in the bracket.


If you find that it still wants to slip out, use orthodontic wax to secure it in place. To apply the wax, dry off the bracket and wire with a cotton ball or q-tip. Take a pea sized amount of the wax, roll it into a ball, and place it on the edge of the bracket and the beginning of the loose wire, securing it in place.
Although this is not an emergency orthodontic situation, still call your orthodontist and let him know what happened to your braces. He will let you know if repairs can wait until your next appointment.;
, A ligature wire, which is the wire that is wrapped around the brackets of your braces, can come loose when you're eating or brushing your teeth. If this happens, the best option is to try to bend it back in place. Use a pencil eraser or q-tip to push the edge of the wire back into place. If it still continues to bother you, use orthodontic wax. Dry off the offending wire with a cotton ball or q-tip. Take a pea sized amount of the wax and place it over the dry wire, pushing it down until it covers the whole wire.


If the wire has caused a sore in your mouth, rinse your mouth with salt water or a solution of peroxide and water. Do this 2-3 times a day and keep wearing the wax over the wire. Your mouth should heal over time., There are times when a broken wire will not stay in place inside a bracket. The wire can also break off and no longer fit within the area it is supposed to fit. In this case, you may need to cut off the excess wire until you can get to the orthodontist to have the wire break repaired. Open your mouth, placing tissue or some other material under the broken wire to catch the part you cut off. Using a mirror to guide your movements, clip off the end of the wire with sharp fingernail clippers.


If you don't have sharp fingernail clippers, you can also use wire cutters or any clippers that will cut through the wire. Just be sure not to accidentally cut your lip.
Make sure you catch whatever wire you cut off. You don't want to swallow it or poke yourself with the leftover wire.
You might not be able to get all of the excess wire cut off, so be aware of the sharp edge it may leave. If the edge is still irritating your mouth, you can try use orthodontic wax on it."
"
Use orthodontic wax.,
Bend it back.,
Cut it off.",How to Fix a Broken Braces Wire2," The longer you wear braces, the more your teeth are pulled into alignment. When this happens, your teeth shift, which causes the wires used in your braces to shift as well. The closer your teeth get to one another, the more extra wire you will end up with along the back of your braces. The excess wire can cause irritation and discomfort. If it is just a small amount of wire sticking through, you can use orthodontic wax to help ease the discomfort until you can get it repaired. Dry off the area with a cotton ball or q-tip. Then, roll a pea sized amount of wax between your finger and apply it to the irritating wire in the back your mouth.You may also want to consider using cotton balls in this area of our mouth. It may be slightly more cumbersome, but it will work until you can get some wax or see your orthodontist., If the wire is longer than is comfortable and cannot be covered with wax, you need to move the wire. Try bending the wires back with your fingers. If the wire is too small, try using a pencil eraser to move the point away from the area that it is irritating.Make sure you don't move it to a place where it will irritate another area of your mouth. Also make sure you don't bend it to the point that you pop off one of your brackets. This will cause you to need additional repairs when you get to the orthodontist office.

, When you have a particularly annoying wire in the back of your mouth, putting wax on it and bending it back might not be the best method to fix it. If the wire is too long to apply wax to and too strong to bend, take a pair of sharp fingernail clippers or wire clippers and cut off the wire as close to the end as you can without damaging the bracket.Make sure you catch whatever wire you cut off. You don't want to swallow it or poke yourself with the leftover wire. To catch the wire, place a tissue or cloth under your mouth to catch it as you cut it off.If you don't cut it all the way off, you may need to use orthodontic wax on the back.

Understand the whys and hows.,
Pick and peel a banana.,
Rub the inside of the skin against your teeth.,
Brush your teeth.,
Repeat once a day.,
Try some other natural teeth whitening remedies.",How to Whiten Your Teeth with Banana Peel," Bloggers and vloggers across the internet claim to have effectively whitened their teeth in just a matter of weeks, using nothing more than a banana peel.


They claim that minerals in the banana peel (such as potassium, magnesium and manganese) are absorbed by the teeth, making them whiter.They also believe that using banana peel is kinder to teeth than many alternative options, as it is not abrasive (unlike many other natural whiteners).






However, this natural remedy also has its detractors -- one Colorado dentist tested the banana peel method over a 14 day period and recorded no noticeable improvement in the whiteness of his teeth.So the only way to know for sure is to try it out for yourself!;
, Choose a banana from your fruit bowl -- you want it to be ripe (as this is when it contains the most minerals) but not black.


Peel a single strip from the banana, leaving the rest of the skin intact (you can use it over the next few days).






Try to peel the banana from bottom to top (like the monkeys do) as this leaves more of the stringy flesh attached.







, Rub the inside of the banana peel against your top and bottom teeth, until they are completely coated in a layer of banana paste.

Once your teeth are coated, sit back and let the banana paste work its magic for approximately ten minutes.






Try to keep your mouth open and your lips away from your teeth -- this may feel a little uncomfortable, but it will prevent the banana paste from rubbing off.







, Once the ten minutes are up, take a dry toothbrush and use it to brush the banana paste into your teeth.


Brush using gentle circular motions, for between one and three minutes. This will help to get it into all the little nooks and crannies!






Then wet your toothbrush and use it to rinse the banana paste from your teeth. You can use your regular toothpaste if you like.







, It's unlikely that you'll see any results after just one treatment, so continue rubbing your teeth with banana peel for up to two weeks -- hopefully you will see a difference by then.


It can be difficult to notice changes in the color of your teeth, so it's a good idea to take a before and after picture. This way you can do a side-by-side comparison of the two.






Don't throw away your banana peels! They make an excellent mineral compost for plants -- all you need to do is add them to your compost bin, or grind them up in your food processor and sprinkle directly over the soil.







, If banana isn't really your thing, you can turn to other natural remedies for whitening your teeth:


Use strawberries and baking soda: A paste made from mushed up strawberries and baking soda helps to clear away surface stains and remove plaque. Simply brush the paste onto your teeth with a toothbrush for several minutes, then rinse away.







Use lemon: The citric acid in lemon is a natural bleaching agent, therefore it can help to whiten teeth. Mix some fresh lemon juice with a little baking soda or salt and rub this mixture onto your teeth with a toothbrush -- just be sure to brush your teeth with toothpaste afterwards, as acidic lemon juice can also wear away tooth enamel.







Eat more apples: Eating apples can help to whiten teeth, as their crunchy texture helps to remove excess food and bacteria from teeth and wipe away surface stains. The juice also contains malic acid -- an ingredient which is used in many teeth whitening products. "

Practice speaking slowly to friends and family.,
Read out loud five or more minutes a day.,
Try to sing part of a song at least once a day.,
Repeat words you find difficult to pronounce with your retainer.,
Speak more on weekends.",How to Talk With a Retainer1," To get more comfortable with talking while wearing your retainer, you should start by speaking slowly to those closest to you on a daily basis. The more you practice speaking, the more comfortable you will become with talking with a retainer. You should be able to talk with relative ease within one month to two months of getting your retainer.Your tongue will eventually adapt to the retainer. If you practice a lot, using all types of words, you will eventually be able to speak normally.
As you start practicing saying words while wearing your retainer, you may notice that you spit or drool when you speak. This is normal, as your mouth will be more full of saliva than normal due to the retainer.You can use a cloth to catch any saliva around your mouth or chin when you are first getting used to wearing and talking with your retainer.
The reason you may produce more spit with a retainer is because your mouth perceives it as a foreign object. Your mouth reacts to this foreign object the same way it reacts to a piece of food in your mouth — it increases the flow of saliva.;
, Another way to get your mouth used to the retainer is to practice reading out loud at least five minutes a day. You could choose to read a passage from your favorite book or pick a random section of the newspaper. Reading out loud to yourself or to someone else allows you to practice speaking and pronouncing different words.It may be a good idea to read the same passage out loud every day until you feel you can read it one time through clearly and confidently. Once you have read the passage out loud successfully, you can try a longer passage or a passage with more complex terms and longer words.

, Singing is another good way to help your mouth adapt to the retainer. You can sing the chorus of your favorite song to yourself in the shower or to an audience of family and friends. Maybe you choose a simple nursery rhyme or familiar tune that contains simple words. You can then practice singing this out loud once a day until you can sing the song clearly and without any issues., As you sing or read out loud, listen to yourself speak and note any words or phrases you may have trouble saying. This could be longer words or words with “sh” and hard “c” sounds, or also ""s,"" ""z,"" or ""t"", which require a certain position of the tongue over the retainer. You should repeat these words several times when you read them or sing them so you can practice pronouncing them. Over time, you should be able to say these challenging words properly while wearing your retainer.

, If you are shy about talking during the week at school in class or to your peers in the hallways, you should get into the habit of talking with your retainer in your mouth on weekends. On the weekends, you may walk around the house and talk to yourself or talk to your parents. It can be less intimidating to talk to an empty room or to sympathetic parents.

Brush your retainer at least once a day.,
Take out your retainer only to swim or eat.,
Keep your retainer in its case when it is not in use.,
Have your orthodontist adjust your retainer if it is uncomfortable or tight.",How to Talk With a Retainer2," Caring for your retainer can make it easier for you to talk while wearing it, as a clean retainer will not carry any odors or plaque build up. Odors and plaque build up can make it difficult to feel comfortable wearing the retainer and having in depth conversations with others. Keep your retainer clean and appealing by brushing it with toothpaste and a toothbrush at least once a day.Ask your orthodontist about cleaning your retainer, as some retainers should be cleaned with water and a toothbrush, rather than toothpaste. Some toothpaste, especially abrasive toothpastes, can damage certain retainers.Allowing plaque and bacteria to build up on your retainer is also harmful to your gums and teeth.
If your retainer seems to be carrying a very strong odor, despite regular brushing, you can try soaking it in a carbon tablet dissolved in water. Or you can dissolving a spoon of baking soda into a glass of water and allow your retainer to soak.

, In order to do its job properly, your retainer should remain in your mouth most of the time. You should only take it out at mealtimes or when you are going swimming, as you do not want the retainer to come into contact with pool water.You should talk to your orthodontist about this rule, as some doctors have additional guidelines around when you should wear your retainer. You may be advised not to wear your retainer when you are playing contact sports or any other sports that can cause injury to your teeth or could break the retainer.

, To avoid losing the retainer or damaging it, you should put your retainer in its case when it is not in your mouth. Put the retainer case in your backpack so you have it when you go to school and need to remove your retainer to eat or make sure it is always with you when you go to swim practice. Storing the retainer in its case will ensure it is safe and ready to use.The case should have a few holes to allow air to flow in and keep your retainer dry. A completely sealed case promotes the growth of bacteria by preventing your retainer from drying.

, If you have been practicing speaking with the retainer for over a month now and are noticing it is still uncomfortable and tight in your mouth, you may want to schedule a follow up appointment with your orthodontist.Your orthodontist may suggest a different retainer for your mouth or adjust the one you have so it fits your mouth better. Some retainers can rub against your mouth due to a misplaced wire and your retainer may feel more comfortable with only a minor adjustment by your orthodontist.

Find a surgeon you trust.,
Find out whether medicines you take will interfere with the extraction.,
Stop smoking a few days before the extraction.Smoking, as well as chewing tobacco or using other tobacco products, can interfere with the healing process of your socket.",How to Prevent Dry Socket After a Tooth Extraction1," The way the tooth extraction is performed has a big impact on whether or not dry sockets occur.Educate yourself on the procedure and talk to your surgeon about what to expect. Make sure you are provided with the information you need to ensure everything goes smoothly. You can expect the following preventative treatments from your surgeon:


Your oral surgeon will provide you with mouthwashes and gels designed to help the socket heal properly.
The surgeon will also dress your wound with antiseptic solutions and gauze to protect it when the surgery is over.;
, Certain prescription and over-the-counter medications can inhibit blood clotting, which can prevent the protective scab from forming over your empty sockets.


Oral contraceptives put women at greater risk of developing dry sockets.
If you are a woman taking oral contraceptives, it can help to schedule the extraction to take place during days 23 to 28 of your cycle, when your estrogen levels are low., Consider using a nicotine patch or other substitute for a few days, since inhaling smoke can greatly increase your chances for getting dry sockets.

"
"
Clean your mouth.,
Get plenty of rest.,
Avoid beverages other than water.,
Eat soft foods.,
Avoid smoking for as long as possible.Don't smoke for the first 24 hours after surgery.",How to Prevent Dry Socket After a Tooth Extraction2," Since your mouth may have stitches or an open wound, it requires special cleaning for the first few days. Do not brush your teeth, floss, or use mouthwash, or rinse your mouth out in any way for 24 hours. After that, follow this routine:If you have stitches and the gum covers the extraction site completely, then you can start brushing your teeth gently after 12 hours. Just make sure that you avoid the extraction area.
Rinse your mouth gently, without too much pressure, with saltwater every two hours and after every meal.
Brush your teeth gently, being careful not to touch the wound.
Floss your teeth carefully without going near the wound.

, Let your body's energy focus on healing, rather than other activities. In the first few days after getting surgery your mouth may be swollen and painful, so it shouldn't be difficult to take a few days off of work and school to allow yourself to rest.


Don't do a lot of talking. Let your mouth be still as the sockets begin to form a scab and the swelling goes down.
Don't do unnecessary exercise. Lie or sit on your sofa for the first 24 hours, then do light walking for the next few days.
Avoid touching the area of the extraction and also try not to sleep on that side for two to three days.

, Drink plenty of cool water after the surgery, but stay away from beverages that might interfere with the healing process. That means avoiding the following drinks:


Coffee, soda, and other drinks that contain caffeine.
Wine, beer, liquor, and other drinks that contain alcohol.
Soda, diet soda, and other drinks that are carbonated.
Hot tea, hot water, and other drinks that are warm or hot, since these can loosen the scab that is forming over the socket.
Don't use a straw when drinking liquids. The sucking motion puts stress on the wound, and can cause the scab not to form.

, Chewing tough foods is a sure way to break up the scab that is protecting your fragile nerves from exposure.Eat mashed potatoes, soup, applesauce, yogurt, and other soft food for the first couple of days. Graduate to semi soft foods when you're able to eat them without feeling pain. Avoid the following foods until your mouth has totally healed:


Chewy foods, like steak and chicken.
Sticky foods, like toffee and caramel.
Crunchy foods, like apples and potato chips.
Spicy foods, which can irritate the wound and prevent it from healing.

, If you can wait a few more days after that, your mouth will heal faster. Don't chew tobacco for at least a week after surgery.

"
"
Know when your socket is dry.Pain alone is not necessarily an indication that you have a dry socket.,
Go back to the dentist right away.",How to Prevent Dry Socket After a Tooth Extraction3," However, if you feel increased pain two days after the surgery in addition to other dry socket symptoms, your socket is probably dry. Usually, a dry socket heals itself after five days and the pain disappears. All you have to do is maintain good hygiene and avoid getting food stuck in the extraction site. Look for these issues to determine if you might have a dry socket:


Exposed bone. Look into your mouth at the surgical wound. If you don't see a scab, and you do see exposed bone, you have a dry socket.
Bad breath. A bad smell coming from your mouth could be an indication that the wound isn't healing properly.

, A dry socket must be treated by your dentist or surgeon to make sure it properly heals.The dentist will dress the wound with a salve and gauze to promote cell generation in the area. You may be given an extra painkiller prescription to deal with the increased pain, which can radiate from your mouth up to your ears.


Carefully follow the dentist's instructions for caring for a dry socket. Don't smoke, eat chewy foods, or otherwise exacerbate the situation.
You may be asked to return every day to have your dressing changed.
Eventually new tissue will form over the socket, covering the bone and the exposed wound which contains nerves and vessels. It may take a month or longer to fully heal.

Use colorful rubber bands.,
Get colorful brackets.,
Decorate your retainer.",How to Wear Braces With Confidence and Style1," Braces are made up of lots of little rubber bands. You can get the bands in different colors, ranging from green to purple!Sometimes these are called elastics.


There are small rubber bands that wrap around the individual braces. They are called ligatures. There are rubber bands that are called interarch rubber bands. These are designed to make sure your bite and jaw are properly aligned. They are connected to the brackets.
You could even choose colors that match your outfit because they need to be replaced daily and are also removed when you eat.Gray or silver bands are known for staining less when you eat or drink. Some people stay away from bright colors and opt for clear brands to try to make their braces less obvious.Orthodontists often offer elastics in sports team colors, school colors or seasonal colors, such as red and green around Christmas time. Black is also a popular color. Clear or glow-in-the-dark elastics are also available.;
, It’s also possible to get the actual teeth brackets – the part of the braces that literally fasten to your teeth – in different colors. Instead of trying to hide your braces, make them a fashion statement!


Alternate two colors on each tooth for the braces themselves or one color on the top teeth and another color on the bottom teeth. Play with contrasts.
Ask about glow-in-the-dark braces! Braces come in all different colors these days, and you can even request tiny designs on the brackets themselves from some orthodontists.Keep in mind that you can’t change the brackets once you pick them though. So if your brackets are bright green, that’s what you’re stuck with.

, It’s not just the braces themselves that can get colorful. Some people also have to wear a retainer, especially at night.


Retainers are available in all kinds of colors and designs too. Retainers can be decorated with everything from flowers to designs kids create themselves.
Some retainers can be designed so they contain a picture of the child or a favorite pet. Make your retainer your own so it expresses your individuality and is associated with things you like.
As with braces, retainers can come in many different colors, including glow-in-the-dark. Designer retainers may be more expensive, though. Check around.

Ask your dentist to construct a fitted tray.,
Consult with your dentist about using the gel.,
Desensitize and heal your mouth beforehand.,
Put a small amount of gel into the tray.,
Wipe away the excess materiel.,
Use the tray for the prescribed time.",How to Use Teeth Whitening Gel1," A poorly fitted tray can be created by your dentist. The custom tray can fit the curves and contours of your teeth to properly cover all applicable surfaces, and maximize the ability of the gel.There are a few downsides if an ill-fitting tray:


Tooth sensitivity can occur, but typically only lasts until the gel is removed.
Gum irritation is a common side-effect of whitening gel.Slight burns may even appear.
Some using whitening gels experience lips and throat as well.;
, Depending on the type of gel and the construction of tray, there could be variations in the amount of gel to use. Have your dentist provide you with instructions on how to use the gel, when to use it and for how long.These things depend on your clinical status and desired final result as well as your oral hygiene and eating habits, which are crucial in the whitening procedure. Your dentist may even demonstrate gel use.

, To decrease the chances of experiencing sensitivity complications, you’ll want to condition your teeth with something containing potassium nitrate and fluoride. There are a few things you can do to make the transition easier.


Brush using a de-sensitizing toothpaste for a few weeks prior to starting bleaching treatments.
Allow ample time for any inner-mouth cuts to heal.Use plain glycerin or alcohol-free mouthwash if there are any existing mouth ulcers
Give your tray a bleach-free test-run for fit and comfort.Check if the margins of the tray go over your gum line for more than 4 mm. If the do, you will need to have it reshaped by your dentist.

, Use either a dab per tooth or a small line into the front part of the tray.Do not fill the tray or spread the gel around. An ideal amount is about halfway up the inner front of the tray.


Approximately 0.5 ml of gel is the amount per arch you’d like to apply.Apply firm pressure and try moving the tray from left to right for a better distribution of the gel on your teeth. Do not push so hard the gel oozes outward.Some recommend bleaching just the front six to eight teeth since back teeth are rarely seen., Holding the tray firm with one hand, gently wipe away any excess that moves out towards the gums. Some recommend using a dry toothbrush, so there is not water dripping into the gel tray and diluting the product.Another method is to hold the tray firmly with one hand and use a tissue in the other hand to wipe the excess., While the gels are almost universally made with Carbamide Peroxide or Hydrogen Peroxide, and the general strength falls anywhere between 10% and 22%, there are nonetheless differing application times. Most effectiveness is lost after the first two hours, so typical usage is for two to three hours per day. Use the gel for 30–60 minutes the first time. Duration can be increased if there is no sensitivity.
Hydrogen Peroxide gels are normally used 30–60 minutes per session, once or twice per day.
Carbamide Peroxide bleaching gels are generally broken down into two larger groups of strength:


10%-16% – used for longer periods, two to four hours split into two sessions per day

20%-22% – used for 30–60 minutes once or twice per day"

Buy the right kind.,
Apply it directly to your tooth.,
Make a clove oil compress.,
Try fresh whole cloves.,
Use ground cloves.,
Make a mouth rinse.",How to Use Clove Oil for Tooth Pain1," When you pick out your clove oil, make sure you buy high quality oil. You should get 100% pure oil. Look for organic if you can. You don’t want anything lower than pure oil because you won’t get the same benefits from the ingredients.


Clove oil can be found at most health food stores.;
, Clove oil can be used directly on your tooth to help ease the pain. Grab a cotton swab and dip one end in the clove oil. Apply it directly to the tooth and around the gum where you are experiencing pain. Leave the oil on your tooth and surrounding gum for 20 minutes. When this time is up, rinse your mouth out with a salt water solution, which is just ½ teaspoon of salt in six ounces of warm water.


If the nerve of the tooth is exposed in your mouth, make sure you are extra gently in the area.
This oil does not taste the best. It may take some getting used to.
Try to swallow as little of this oil as possible., If you don’t want to put straight clove oil in your mouth, you can try a diluted compound and make it into a compress. Pour ½ teaspoon of olive oil into a bowl. Add two to three drops of clove oil to the bowl. Mix it together. Next, soak a cotton ball in the mixture. Then take the soaked cotton ball and place it directly over the painful tooth and gum area. Gently bite down on it, holding it in place.


Leave the compress on your tooth for 20 minutes. Remove the cotton ball and rinse your mouth out with a warm salt water solution.

, In addition to clove oil, you can also use clove in its whole herbal form. Take one to three whole pieces of clove and place them on the tooth right next to the painful one in your mouth. Wait a few minutes for the clove pieces to soften, then gently bite down on them, releasing the clove oils. Leave them in the area for 20 minutes.


Afterwards, rinse your mouth out with a warm salt water solution.
The cloves can taste really strong and cause tingling in your mouth. This is normal. The taste should disappear in your mouth about 10 minutes.You can buy whole cloves at most grocery stores.

, In addition to its whole form, you can also use ground clove as well. Measure out ⅛ teaspoon of ground cloves into a bowl. Mix in ¼ teaspoon of olive oil and stir together until mixed. Take a cotton swab and dip it into the mixture, then apply the clove infused oil to the painful tooth and the surrounding gum.


Leave it on the tooth for 20 minutes. After this, rinse your mouth out with warm salt water.
You can also just add a pinch of the ground clove directly in your mouth on the area of your painful tooth. Your saliva will mix with the clove and help your tooth.You can buy ground cloves in the baking section of most grocery stores.

, In addition to clove oil, clove infused water can also help your tooth pain. Put 10 to 15 whole pieces of clove in a pot of water. Let it simmer on the stove for 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let it sit until it cools to room temperature. Strain the cloves out and pour the infused water into a cup. Rinse your mouth with it, swishing it around your teeth for a minute or so. Spit the rinse into a sink.


You can use the remaining mouth rinse for days after you make it. Keep it in a sealed bottle and use it every time you feel pain in your teeth.
It will also help kill bacteria and leave your mouth feeling refreshed.
If the taste is too much, you can add sage or thyme to the mixture.

Select less obvious braces.,
Keep your teeth clean.,
Floss your teeth.",How to Wear Braces With Confidence and Style2," If you want braces to be less obvious, you can avoid the stereotypical stainless steel braces in favor of braces that blend in with your teeth to the degree they are barely noticeable. Sometimes adults with braces prefer them to be less obvious.


Braces come in tooth-colored ceramic or plastic. Sometimes, the braces will be cemented to the back of the teeth so they are less obvious. Clear braces are another name for ceramic braces.They are translucent, but they can break more easily.
Lingual braces are braces that you can’t see from the front. These braces go behind the teeth. They can make it hard to move your tongue properly, though, and can cause some speech trouble. They are usually more expensive than other kinds of braces. Similarly, the tiny rubber rings or fine wires that fasten the brackets together can be clear or colored, in addition to metal.
Check with your orthodontist about whether you are a candidate for mini braces. These braces have smaller brackets on each teeth and thus are less visible.

, Fresh breath and clean teeth can give you a beautiful smile with or without braces. You will need to take extra care of your teeth with braces, though.You should brush your teeth every time you eat, even if you’re eating a snack. Watch getting food caught in your teeth. This can be embarrassing when you have braces. Watch what you eat, and you won’t have to worry about this as much!Carry a small compact with a mirror in your purse so you can subtly check whether you have food in your mouth. The extra brushing is necessary to rid the mouth of food particles that can get trapped in the braces. Use an electric toothbrush or a soft brush with rounder bristles.
Rinse your mouth first with water to dislodge any food that could be stuck in your braces. Brush at your gum line first, while holding the toothbrush at a 45-degree angle. Then, clean the brackets of the braces by brushing near their top at a downward angle and then brushing near the bottom at an upward angle. Rinse again.

, Yes, believe it or not but you can and should floss your teeth even while wearing braces! This will keep your teeth healthy.


Try to floss once a day at least, under the wires in addition to between the braces. You can buy a floss threader or orthodontic flosser at drug stores that will make it easier to floss your teeth with braces.
Waxed dental floss also makes it easier to floss your teeth because it won’t get caught as easily on your braces.
Another way to reach teeth with braces is an interproximal or interdental brush. This goes between your teeth and is even better than flossing.

Focus on the long-term benefits.,
Smile confidently.,
Engage in activities.",How to Wear Braces With Confidence and Style3," Yes, it can be rough having braces now. However, you won’t need to wear them for a very long time, and you’re going to reap the benefits of a beautiful smile!


Be thankful that you can afford to get your teeth straightened. It’s a luxury in a way, not a burden! Braces will help correct overbites and underbites as well as crooked teeth.Remember that orthodontic treatment has many benefits. The orthodontist can use braces to guide your jaw’s growth and how permanent teeth come in. The orthodontist can help change whether you need teeth removed, as well as spacing of teeth and the width of dental arches. You will have less chance of such problems as lost teeth or speech problems.Braces usually stay on a person only from one to three years, although the time you will need to wear them can depend on the issue they are trying to fix.

, Yes, smile! If you show that you’re confident and it’s no big deal, people won’t think it’s a big deal.


Gone are the days that people are embarrassed about braces. Even Hollywood celebrities like Tom Cruise and Britney Spears have worn braces!Some fashion models have even worn braces on the runway!If you smile big, people are going to focus on your beautiful, natural smile, not the metal or other material within it. Smiles are infectious and will draw people to you who like your positive, happy attitude. It’s a positive cycle. If you act confident, people will react to you differently, and then you are likely to feel more confident!
Remember that other people probably aren’t focusing on or even noticing your braces anywhere near as much as you think they are.

, With braces, you can continue doing all of your normal activities, including playing sports. Don't change your life!


If you’re playing a sport where you risk getting hit in the mouth, you may need to wear a mouth guard made out of plastic that fits over your braces.Sometimes adults need braces. One reason for this can be if the teeth start shifting away from the gum line. Adult braces are becoming more common, and some adults also opt to show them off with different colors or designs, although work concerns can be a factor here.Don’t worry about kissing someone if you have braces. Just go really slow, especially at first. Try not to bump teeth together, and make sure his or her tongue doesn’t get caught on your braces!"

Remove the tray and clean your mouth.,
Clean and store the tray.,
Refrigerate the gel.",How to Use Teeth Whitening Gel2," After removing the tray, there may be some gel residue on your teeth, gums, or elsewhere in your mouth. It’s recommended you rinse, brush, and floss to remove the remaining gel, then continue on with your typical hygiene routine.


Apply a desensitizing gel if there is pain. If you do not have a desensitizing gel, try fluoride gel or a desensitizing toothpaste for five minutes.

, Using warm water and a toothbrush, gently scrub the tray. Some even recommend using cold water, since water that is too hot could damage the integrity of the tray. If you’d like to have a smoother coverage, substituting a Q-tip for the toothbrush is also a great way to clean out leftover gel.


After cleaning, put the tray in its tray holder and store in a cool, dry location out of the sunlight. , Depending on the brand, the shelf-life of some gels can be greatly improved with refrigeration. It’s recommend to follow the guidance and instructions in the package, but a gel that lasts for a year unrefrigerated may last up to two years in the refrigerator."

Look for whitening progress.,
Ensure you’re not overloading the tray.,
Shorten the treatments.,
Break up the treatments.,
Suspend treatments and see your doctor.,
Discontinue or minimize counteractive products.",How to Use Teeth Whitening Gel3," Most gels take consistent usage in order to see results. Optimum results have been shown in 20–30 minute sessions for some products. The minimum time for real results is roughly two weeks, with minimal shade differentiation showing up after a few days. Maximum results should take at least two weeks, but some programs take as long as four weeks to show the best results.Longer wear times can potentially create faster results, but also increase sensitivity possibility.
Results also depends also on your enamel structure, which may vary from person to person.
Using bleaching gel with higher concentration has the potential for quicker results. Results are maximized in the first few hours, and typical expectations can be four or five shades over the course of treatment., If too much of the gel is squeezing out of the top of the tray, the excess is probably causing the sensitivity. Try to use a smaller amount of gel with each succeeding treatment until a balance of coverage and minimal oozing is found. The goal is to have complete frontal tooth coverage without gel waste.

, Depending on the treatment, it’s possible to use the whitening gel for multiple hours per day or while you sleep. While the gel loses most effectiveness during the first two hours or so, lessening the amount of time that gel is touching teeth could help with any pain. If you are using the tray overnight, discontinue using the tray for such long periods.
Shorten the length of time using the tray. Some treatments call for over an hour of use. Try lessening the time by about 10 minutes per treatment, or to around 20 minutes.

, Since the amount of time used is directly related to the effectiveness of the gel, you may want to continue the current length of time the tray is being used. If you’re experiencing sensitivity, however, you may try breaking the treatments up into smaller periods.


Take a two-hour treatment and divide it into two separate one-hour treatments.
A one-hour usage could easily be broken down into two 30-minute periods.
The obvious downside to breaking up treatments is the usage of more gel than normal, however, you may also be able to maintain the whitening effect for a longer period of time.

, If you’re having major issues with sensitivity or pain, you probably need to suspend use of the gel. In general, you should probably take one or two courses of action.


Skip a few days. Or, skip a few weeks. Most sensitivity diminishes after the first few days, but some instances have been shown to take weeks to subside.Seek professional advice. Only a dentist can truly determine the cause of specific tooth sensitivity. If you’ve discontinued use of the gel, and you’re still experiencing pain, there may be a larger issue requiring an x-ray and/or dental work., While the gel tray is in your mouth, ensure you do not eat, drink, or smoke. Similarly, refrain from eating citrus fruit just after get application. Improve your results by minimizing coffee, tobacco, sodas, sports drinks, wine, and tomatoes in your daily diet. Drink with a straw. This helps staining fluids bypass the teeth."

Learn how clove oil helps.,
Be aware of complications.,
See your dentist.",How to Use Clove Oil for Tooth Pain2," If you are experiencing tooth pain, clove oil may help. Clove oil contains eugenol, a substance believed to cause the pain relieving effects found in clove oil. Eugenol has the added benefit of having antiviral, antibacterial, antiparasitic, antifungal, and anti-oxidant properties.


Eugenol is similar to NSAID pain relievers due to the similarity in their properties. Researchers believe eugenol reduces pain by preventing the synthesis of prostaglandins, which is a substance also in NSAIDs.It is so effective that dentists’ offices use it as a local anesthetic when giving temporary fillings., Although clove oil is typically considered safe, some people may be allergic to it. During dental visits, there have been some recorded cases of gum irritation and complications linked to the use of eugenol.Also, the FDA has reclassified the eugenol as a standalone substance as a Category III substance, which means there has not been enough evidence to prove its use.When used at home, avoid ingesting too much. Ingestion of clove oil in large amounts has been linked to respiratory and liver problems.Clove oil and fresh cloves are safe for use for anyone older than two years.
If you are on blood thinners or are diabetic, ask your doctor before using any home remedy with cloves., At the first sign of tooth pain, call your dentist. Even if you think it is something small, you should always have your dentist look at your tooth if it is in pain. Some tooth pain may be small and not last very long, but it may be something more serious. This is why you need a professional opinion for proper diagnosis and additional treatment.


While you are waiting to see your dentist, you can use clove oil to help dull the pain."

If you're lost and don't know which toothbrush to pick, talk to your dentist or orthodontist. Either of these professionals will be able to talk with you about your specific situation and help you make the best decision.;
, Electric toothbrushes come in two types: battery-powered and rechargeable. Both offer distinct advantages and disadvantages that you should consider before making your purchase.Battery-powered toothbrushes: These usually run on an AA battery. They are handheld and work similarly to a manual toothbrush, but the bristles either spin or pulsate, aiding your brushing power. With this model you may still have to use a brushing motion, since the power only enhances cleaning ability. On some models you can replace the bristles when they wear down and keep the battery-powered base. Battery-powered toothbrushes are a cheaper option, usually ranging from $5 to $25.

Rechargeable toothbrushes: These models are usually recharged in a base that plugs into a wall outlet. You won't have to worry about replacing batteries. They tend to offer more high-tech options like timers, pressure sensors, and reminders to replace the bristles. They also usually offer a variety of brushing options, like oscillation or vibration. Unlike with a battery-powered brush, you usually only have to guide the brush across your teeth, while the electric power provides all the brushing power. Accordingly, they are more expensive than battery-powered brushes. They usually range in price from $50 to $300, depending on the amount of features included.

, Both types of electric brushes offer different features. Some of these you may find necessary, while others may seem less important to you. By weighing your options and deciding what you consider essential, you'll be able to narrow down your choices and pick the best toothbrush for you.Timers: Some electric brushes include timers to tell you how long you've been brushing. This can be useful if you often lose track of time and don't brush long enough. Some more sophisticated timers keep track of how long you should brush in each quadrant of your mouth.

Pressure sensors: Some higher end rechargeable brushes include a sensor that will let you know if you're brushing too hard. This could be useful if you suffer from sensitive teeth or weak enamel. It could also be especially helpful if you have braces, since brushing too hard can damage them.

Travel cases: Some toothbrushes have travel cases included, or you can buy one separately. During travel, your toothbrush can get damaged if you don't protect it properly. Since electric toothbrushes can be expensive investments, you should consider a protective case if you'll be traveling often.

Multiple brush head compatibility: Most electric toothbrushes have detachable brush heads so you can replace the brush when bristles wear out and keep the electric base. Some bases will only fit one type of brush head, while others are compatible with multiple types. This could give you more variety if you have a preference for a softer or firmer bristle.

Different brush settings: Some more expensive brushes offer multiple brush settings, while cheaper options offer only one. If you want more variety, you should pick a brush that offers multiple settings. Some different settings include rotary (the head rotates only in one direction), counter-rotational (the head rotates in various directions), rotating-oscillating (different lengths of bristles rotating in opposite directions), oscillating-pulsating (in addition to oscillatory motion, there is an added pulsating motion for enhanced cleaning).

, While some people enjoy an electric toothbrush, there are others who prefer a manual toothbrush. Before buying an expensive electric model, it would be helpful to buy a cheaper, battery-powered model to see if you like the way electric brushes feel. If you like it and decide you want something more sophisticated, then you can invest in a more expensive model with more features., Especially with braces, food will be stuck in your teeth. You'll want to loosen this before you start brushing. Sip some water and swish it around for about 30 seconds. This will help dislodge any large chunks of food that might be stuck in your braces.

, This will help get rid of any debris or microbes that have gotten on your toothbrush since the last time you used it. Turn the faucet on and let the water run over the brush head for a few seconds. Then turn the brush on and let it spin under the water for a few seconds., You should always brush with a fluoride-based toothpaste to ensure your teeth stay healthy. If you're unsure about which toothpaste to choose, look for a stamp from the American Dental Association indicating that the ADA has evaluated and approved the product. Click here for a list of ADA-accepted toothpastes.

, The mouth is broken up into four sections, or quadrants: the upper right (quadrant one), the upper left (quadrant two), the lower left (quadrant three), and the lower right (quadrant four). The division is from your first central tooth to your last molar. When you brush you should spend at least 30 seconds on each quadrant. This will give you a total of two full minutes of brushing, which dentists recommend., Hold your toothbrush up against the gum line above your braces on your top row of teeth. Your toothbrush should be at a 45° angle to the gum line., Hold your toothbrush at the 45° angle and brush the outer surfaces of your teeth and braces. Brush all around the brace on each tooth, and then place your toothbrush directly on the brace to make sure that there is nothing stuck in it., The inner surfaces of your teeth are the back parts of your teeth that face in towards your mouth and throat. This is usually easier with an electric toothbrush. Instead of making a brushing motion, you can just place the brush on the inner surfaces and let the brush do the work.


Give special attention to the lower sections of the inner surfaces, as this is where the most tartar buildup can occur.

, The biting surfaces of your teeth are the bottom or top edges that you use to bite into food. Use a circular rotating motion to clean your biting surfaces. Make sure to reach the back teeth as well — cavities back here are common because these teeth are harder to reach., Once you've brushed normally, you have to clean the area between your braces. To do so, insert the bristles between your braces from the top and make a few brush strokes. Then insert it from the bottom and do the same. Repeat this motion until you cover all your teeth.Depending on the motion your electric toothbrush makes, you may not be able to use its electric features while doing this step. Spinning bristles, for example, could get stuck and possibly damage your braces. In this case, just turn the brush off and do this motion manually.

, Brushing your braces too hard could cause damage. With an electric toothbrush, you don't have to apply much pressure. You only have to place the brush on your teeth and braces and turn it on — the brush should do the rest.Some electric brushes have pressure sensors which will alert you if you're pressing too hard or even stop the bristles from moving when the toothbrush is pressed with too much pressure.

, Your tongue also needs to be brushed to ensure that you have a clean mouth, otherwise leftover bacteria will re-contaminate your mouth as soon as you stop brushing. Position your toothbrush on your tongue and use a front and backwards motion to scrub the surface of the tongue. Doing this will get rid of bacteria and give you fresher breath., Flossing is especially important when you have braces, because trapped food can cause infections and cavities. Insert floss between the wires of your braces. Work the floss between your teeth and use a gentle sawing motion. Then use that same sawing motion to clean the wires and brackets of your braces.Don't pull too hard when you floss, or you risk breaking your braces or pulling them out of place.
If flossing is difficult for you, dentists recommend a water pick to get similar results.

, Once you are done brushing your teeth, gums, and tongue, it is important to rinse your mouth out. Take a sip of water, swish it around your teeth, and then spit it back out.

, Dentists recommend brushing twice daily to keep your teeth healthy. With braces you may need to brush an additional time, especially if you eat something sticky or hard. It would also help to rinse your mouth with water several times throughout the day to dislodge and stuck food particles., Make sure to run your toothbrush under the faucet for a few seconds after every use. This will help get rid of food particles and microbes that could get you sick.

, Just like with a normal toothbrush, you'll have to replace the bristle section of an electric toothbrush every few months. The bristles will wear down and they will no longer be as effective., If you leave dead batteries in your toothbrush, they could leak. This will ruin your toothbrush and could even poison you if the acid gets into your mouth.

This will require medical treatment with antibiotics, as failure to treat it can lead to potentially dangerous complications down the road.


The good news is that seeking medical treatment promptly usually resolves the infection without complications.
Tonsillitis may also be caused by other things, such as a viral infection. It is not always caused by strep bacteria; however, it is always best to be seen by a healthcare professional to rule this out and stay on the safe side.

, The main thing that would prevent you from achieving these goals is tonsils that are so swollen or painful that it hurts to eat or drink.


Doctors recommend controlling your pain via medication so you can continue to eat and drink.
In extreme cases of tonsillar swelling, doctors can administer corticosteroid medication that diminishes the swelling.If you are unable to eat or drink, your doctor will likely prescribe IV fluids and calories to tide you by, until the corticosteroid and pain medications can take effect and decrease the pain and swelling in your tonsillar area enough for you to consume food and drinks orally., In almost all cases of tonsillitis, your doctor will recommend acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil) as needed for pain control.Both of these medications are available over-the-counter at your local pharmacy; follow the recommended dosing on the bottle.


Acetaminophen (Tylenol) tends to be the better choice as it combats fever as well as pain.Most cases of tonsillitis are the result of an infection, so acetaminophen can help to bring your fever down too.
However, you must be careful with acetaminophen, as it is added to so many medications, which makes it easy to overdose. Make sure to keep track of the total dosage and avoid taking more than three grams per day. Do not drink while taking acetaminophen.

,


Request an alternative antibiotic if you are allergic to penicillin.
Finish the antibiotics even if you feel better. Neglecting the remainder of your treatment may result in tonsillitis symptoms returning or worsening, or you may develop complications down the road if you do not finish your prescribed treatment.
Ask your doctor about what to do if you forget or miss a dose of the antibiotic.

, If antibiotics do not help, or if you experience chronic or frequent tonsillitis, then a tonsillectomy may be the last resort. Frequent tonsillitis happens when a person experiences infection multiple times over the course of one to three years.


Doctors perform a tonsillectomy to remove the two tonsils from the back of the throat. Besides being the final treatment option for tonsillitis, a tonsillectomy also alleviates sleep apnea or other breathing problems related to enlarged tonsils.
Doctors generally finish the surgery in one day, but patients fully recover in approximately 7 to 10 days.In the United States, criteria for a tonsillectomy are normally 6 or more tonsillar infections over the course of 1 year, 5 infections over 2 consecutive years, or over 3 infections per year over 3 consecutive years."

Give up tobacco.",How to Treat Gum Disease With Homemade Remedies1," According to the Academy of General Dentistry (AGD), there's a link between stress and your dental health. People under stress have a compromised immune system that makes it harder for them to fight off the bacteria that causes periodontal disease and makes them more prone to gum infection, but also general problems such as diabetes or heart disease.


Researchers have also learned that not all stress is created equal. In studies done at three different U.S. universities, participants experiencing financial worries were at greatest risk for periodontal disease.;
, Dissolve a small amount of sea salt in a cup of warm water. Swish a sip of the solution in your mouth for 30 seconds and spit it out. Repeat several times. Salt water will reduce swollen gums, gum bleeding and will also decrease the swelling caused by infection. However, if the infection has advanced to an abscess, then you will need antibiotics. Add this mouth rinse to your twice-daily brushing routine.

, Steep a tea bag in boiling water for 2-3 minutes, remove it, and allow it to cool until you can handle it comfortably. Hold the cooled tea bag on the affected area of your gums and keep it there for about five minutes. The tannic acid in the tea bag can work effectively to relieve gum infection.


Directly applying the tea bag to your gums is more effective than simply drinking the beverage. Plus, drinking too much tea has a dental downside: discolored, tea-stained teeth. Your teeth may change in color from yellow to brown and the stains are hard to remove, even after a professional cleaning

, Honey has natural antibacterial and antiseptic properties because of a substance called propolis in the honey, so you can put it to work treating your infected gums. Once you brush your teeth, rub a small amount of honey on the problem area of your gums.


Given honey's high sugar content, you want to be careful you don't over apply it and do your best to put it on your gums only rather than on your teeth.

, Cranberry juice can prevent bacteria from sticking to your teeth, so try drinking up to 4 ounces of the unsweetened juice daily.

, Make a paste from the juice of one lemon and some salt. Mix it well and apply to your teeth. Let it sit for a few minutes and gargle with warm water to rinse it off.


Lemons offer a win-win solution for treating gum disease. First, they're an anti-inflammatory, which makes them helpful in treating infected gums. Not only that, but lemons contain vitamin C, which can help your gums fight off infection and reduce the bacterial colonies creating a local alkaline pH.

, It's not just lemons that can help with gum disease, but also other foods full of vitamin C such as oranges, grapes, guava, kiwi mango, papaya, bell peppers, and strawberry. Vitamin C is an antioxidant, and antioxidants are found to promote connective tissue growth and bone regeneration, which can be affected by various gum problems.

, Older adults should particularly take note of this vitamin. According to the National Institutes of Health, higher blood levels of vitamin D seem to be linked to a reduced risk of gum disease in people age 50 and older.Get your vitamin D fix by soaking up the sun at least 15 to 20 minutes twice a week and eating D-rich foods such as salmon, whole eggs, sunflower seeds, and cod liver oil.

, Baking soda neutralizes the acids in your mouth, thereby reducing the chances of tooth decay and gum disease, so it's more of a preventive measure than an actual treatment for gum disease. Add a small amount of baking soda to a bit of warm water and mix to form a paste. Use this paste to brush your teeth using a soft toothbrush and low pressure.

, Tobacco decreases your ability to fight infection and delays healing. Tobacco users are more likely than nonsmokers to have serious gum disease that doesn't respond as well to treatment and that leads to tooth loss."

Take ibuprofen.",How to Treat Cavities," It is important to be able to recognize the signs and symptoms of cavities as soon as they appear. This way, you can get a head start on treating them and prevent them from becoming larger and more painful over time. If you experience one or more of the following symptoms, you may have a cavity:


Experiencing tooth sensitivity or a toothache. You might also feel mild-to-sharp pain when eating cold, sweet or hot foods.
You may feel pain when you bite down.
You may notice dark colored pits or holes on your teeth.
Teeth may break or chip and expose a dark inner surface.
Bad breath or taste in your mouth, especially after meals.
Some cavities (especially those at the back of the mouth or between teeth) will be invisible to the naked eye and may not cause any pain. These types of cavities can only be identified through x-rays, ultrasound or fluorescent lighting - which is why it is important to see your dentist regularly.;
, It is recommended that you visit your dentist approximately twice a year to get check-ups on your oral health. However, if you suspect you might have a cavity don't wait around for your bi-annual appointment, make a date with your dentist immediately. During your appointment:


Explain your symptoms and any signs of tooth decay you've noticed. This will help the dentist to locate the cavity.
Undergo an examination. The dentist will then conduct an examination to confirm that you have a cavity. He/she will often use a sharp metal object to feel for soft spots on the surface of the teeth which indicate the presence of cavities. X-rays will also be required to confirm the depth of the cavity and to decide if a root canal is needed.

, Fluoride treatments are used in the early stages of cavities, as fluoride can help teeth to restore themselves by remineralizing the tooth surface.


The treatment consists of a gel varnish, liquid solution or foam fluoride which is used to coat the teeth and strengthen the tooth's enamel.
When you undergo fluoride treatment, the dentist applies the fluoride in one of two ways: he/she will either apply the fluoride directly onto your teeth or places it into a tray that fits over your teeth. The treatment takes approximately three minutes to complete.Be very careful not to swallow any of the fluoride during the treatment.

, Fillings, which are also known as restoration treatments, are used when the tooth decay develops further into the enamel and becomes permanent.


The dentist removes the cavities using a drill, or the dentist may use a laser instead of a drill. Then the dentist fills the holes using tooth-colored resin material, porcelain or silver amalgam material.
Silver amalgam material may contain quantities of mercury, which some people object to based on fears over possible health risks. If this is a concern for you, consult with your dentist about the material he plans to use in your fillings.
Depending on the extent of the decay, fillings may take up to two appointments to complete., Custom-fitted tooth coverings called crowns are another way to treat cavities. They are only necessary when the tooth decay has become particularly extensive. The crowns are made of tooth-like material attached to metal and dentists can also opt for provisional or permanent crowns, depending on the material used. A provisionary crown is made in the same appointment and it cannot be used for more than three months. Crowns are important for aesthetic reasons, gum line, and functionality.


With crowns, your dentist removes the decayed portion of the tooth using a drill and takes a mold of your teeth.
The final model (cast) is then used to recreate the exact shape and bite of your natural tooth using a tooth-like substance such as porcelain, zirconium or even gold to make a personalized crown to replace your decayed tooth.
Once the crowns are ready, the dentist uses cement to apply them to your teeth. Crowns also take more than one appointment., A root canal may be the only option when cavities have penetrated deep into the tooth's pulp, and the inside of the tooth is decayed, infected or dead.


During a root canal, the dentist will make an incision near the top of the tooth, then remove the decaying pulp from the chambers and canals inside the tooth. The tooth will then be refilled with a rubber-like material and sealing paste.
Sometimes a tooth that has undergone a root canal will also need to be covered with a crown to prevent the tooth from re-fracturing. This may be done at the same time as the root canal, or several months later.If the tooth has a small amount of substance left, your dentist will choose a metal or fiber post to create the core build up that supports the crown.

, If the tooth cannot be saved, have it extracted. The only option for cavities that have affected the entire tooth is an extraction.


Your teeth are extracted if they are badly damaged and cannot be saved using any of the other methods.
Once a tooth is extracted it can leave a gap. While this is undesirable for aesthetic reasons, it may also cause other teeth to move around inside the mouth, which can cause a whole new set of problems.
Therefore, you should consider getting a bridge or dental implant to fill the gap and replace your missing tooth., It is important to brush your teeth at least twice a day, as it prevents cavity-causing bacteria from building up on the surface of your teeth.


Toothpaste that contains fluoride may strengthen your teeth. Small children may overdose if they eat fluoride toothpaste, so give them a pea-sized amount only and keep the tube out of reach.
It's also a good idea to brush your teeth within 30 minutes after eating very sugary or acidic foods, or drinking soda - as these items can precipitate tooth decay.

, Flossing needs to be done at least once a day, ideally before you brush your teeth at night.


Flossing removes bacteria and trapped food particles from between your teeth that your toothbrush is unable to reach.
Make sure to floss between each and every tooth - especially the hard to reach ones in the back - and floss gently to prevent your gums from becoming tender and swollen.

, Regularly using a mouthwash can help to kill bacteria, remove plaque, prevent gum disease and protect against bad breath.


Use a mouthwash that contains fluoride to help remineralize the teeth and prevent bacteria from forming acid.
You can also swish with calcium and magnesium powders dissolved in water. This will help the cavity-ridden teeth in two ways: firstly, it will add minerals back into the teeth and secondly, it will help to neutralize cavity-causing acid by keeping the mouth alkaline.

, Visiting your dentist just twice a year can help you to get ahead of your cavities.


Seeing your dentist regularly will help you to catch cavities early. It could mean the difference between getting a simple fluoride treatment or needing a painful and expensive root canal.
A dentist or dental hygienist can also give your teeth a thorough and effective cleaning, which removes plaque and helps prevent the development of cavities.

, If you don't already have them, sealants are a good way to protect your teeth against cavities.


A sealant is a thin, plastic coating placed on top of the back teeth to prevent bacteria and plaque from collecting in the groves of the molar teeth and causing a cavity.
Sealants are usually given to children as soon as their molars come in, but these sealants will only last for about ten years, so ask your dentist about having them replaced.It is important to have them checked to see if there is any chipping or discoloration that may be a sign of a new cavity

, Some sugarless gums can actually help you to avoid cavities, as chewing them increases saliva production, helping to get rid of food particles trapped between the teeth., Taking vitamin and mineral supplements is another option.

, This chemical has the intimidating full name ""casein phosphopeptide – amorphous calcium phosphate,"" but all its components are found in common foods (particularly milk). There is good evidence that toothpaste, mouthwash, and sugar-free gum that contains CPP-ACP is extra effective at restoring slightly damaged tooth enamel.This is called ""remineralization.""


CPP-ACP is most effective when you also use fluoride toothpaste, which is a good option if you have sensitive teeth.Remineralization only works if you catch the problem early.You cannot heal back advanced tooth decay with home treatments.

, Saliva helps prevent tooth decay. If you have a dry mouth, it may help to suck on sugarless candy, chew sugarless gum, and drink plenty of water. If your dry mouth is severe, ask your doctor for advice.Smoking, aging, various medications, and dehydration are common causes of dry mouth. If none of these seem likely, visit a doctor for a checkup.

, If you are experiencing a lot of pain as a result of a cavity, don't suffer in silence. You should schedule an appointment with the dentist immediately, but while you're waiting you can reduce the pain by trying some home remedies.


Dab some clove oil on the cavity-filled tooth and the surrounding gums. This can help to numb the pain and provide some relief.
Take a teaspoon of pure vanilla essence and swish it around your mouth for a minute or two to relieve pain.
Apply ice to the tooth. If the pain is not sensitive to cold, you can place an ice cube wrapped in a gauze next to your tooth for 5 minutes to help numb the pain.
Make a compress using vodka, gin or whiskey. Alcohol can help to temporarily numb any pain you are experiencing. Try dipping a washcloth into the alcohol and holding it against the offending tooth. It might sting at first, but this will quickly subside.

, Dissolve a teaspoon of sea salt in glass of slightly warm water, take a mouthful and swish it around your mouth for a minute or two, concentrating on the area with the cavity-filled tooth. Replace the sea salt with garlic salt for another effective remedy.

, Swish some vegetable oil around your mouth, then spit it out once it becomes foamy. This is meant to pull infection from the tooth and relieve pain.

, One surefire way of temporarily relieving tooth pain is to take ibuprofen. This will reduce inflammation and relieve pain. Make sure to use ibuprofen according to the manufacturer's instructions."

Brushing your teeth more gently. Brush your teeth gently with a soft-bristled toothbrush. Floss daily.
Changing your toothpaste. Toothpastes or mouthwashes that contain sodium lauryl sulfate can cause canker sores and continue to aggravate them. Try substituting natural toothpaste into your regimen.

Relaxing. Many people get canker sores during times of intense emotional stress. Like acne and eczema, canker sores can be exacerbated by stressors.;
, Diet can have a significant effect — beneficial and detrimental — on canker sores.


Avoid spicy or acidic foods, which can irritate sores further. Peppers and sodas should be shunned. Fruits and vegetables such as lemons, oranges, pineapples, apples, figs, tomatoes, and strawberries may also cause canker sores.Get more B12, zinc, iron, and folic acid.Take a vitamin supplement, or multiple supplements, that contain these every morning.

, Canker sores often appear after cuts and lesions break open the skin inside the mouth.


If you have braces or other orthodontics, eliminate areas that protrude into the skin. Talk to your orthodontist about eliminating sharp corners or wires that may cut into the skin. Ask for orally-safe wax that can be applied to orthodontics to help ward off cuts and other injuries.
Ill-fitting dentures may also cause canker sores.Talk to your dentist about options concerning your dentures.

, Simple canker sores, which are common and appear three or four times a year and last up to a week, are likely not caused by underlying health problems. If the lesions last longer or recur often, they may not be canker sores, and may be due to underlying health problems.Individuals with compromised immune systems may be at higher risk for canker sores.
Individuals with gastrointestinal tract diseases, such as Celiac disease and Crohn's disease, may also be at higher risk for complex canker sores.

, Mix a few pinches of salt in a glass of warm water. Swish around inside your mouth and spit out, repeating two or three times a day.


An alternative to this is baking soda. Mix one teaspoon baking soda with several ounces of warm water. Swish and spit out.
Alternatively, create a paste with equal parts baking soda and water. Dab the paste over the canker sore with a Q-tip and let dry.
Salt water and baking soda both help the mouth heal itself by reducing the acidity and bacteria in the mouth.

,


Pour a little bit of it into a plastic soda cap and dilute with an equal amount of water.
Dip the Q-tip into the peroxide solution and dab it only on the canker sore.
Turn the Q-tip around and repeat.
Empty the cap and rinse it with water.
Take care not to swallow any of the hydrogen peroxide if possible.
Hydrogen peroxide is an antiseptic that will reduce the amount of bacteria in your mouth and help the canker sore heal.
The canker sore should go away in about 2-3 days if you do it twice a day.

, Dab it on active spots a few times a day. The antacid effect of milk of magnesia neutralizes the acidic environment, changing the pH, and making it less supportive of the bacteria in the mouth that aggravate the canker sore., Combine one part diphenhydramine (sold as Benadryl) with 1 part antacid, such as Maalox or Kaopectate. Swish around your mouth and spit out.

, Regular old mouthwash does work, although there are different OTC mouthwash solutions that are specifically targeted to help treat canker sores. They include:


Diphenhydramine suspension washes (Benadryl Allergy liquid and others). These types of washes generally treat the pain of the canker sore. The mouthwash solution should not be swallowed., You can take over-the-counter painkillers, or apply benzocaine gels (such as Anbesol and Orajel) directly onto active sores.


Suck on ice chips. Try to hold them over the sores, allowing them to melt over the area. Ice should help numb the pain and reduce inflammation.

, Three of these remedies are designed to change the pH in your mouth. The theory here is that changing the pH will make your mouth less hospitable to the bacteria that are causing the canker sore:


Eat yogurt daily.
Apply a wet black teabag to the ulcer.
Squeeze the oil of a Vitamin E capsule onto the sore, repeating several times per day.

, Squeeze the lemon with a lemon squeezer or just squeeze is on the ulcer straight away.


If you squeezed the lemon with a lemon squeezer, wash your hands, put your finger in the juice then dab it on your ulcer.
Repeat it before breakfast, after breakfast, before lunch, after lunch, before tea, after tea, before dinner, after dinner and right before you sleep.
Leave it on for 1-5 minutes. Then rinse off, if needed.

, If you're constantly battling canker sores and none of the above fixes are working, perhaps there's an underlying issue.For some conditions, canker sores are an early and important sign that something else is wrong.

, Consider investigating whether you have Celiac Disease, Crohn's Disease, or inflammatory bowel disease. All three are autoimmune conditions that can cause frequent mouth sores.


You might also ask the doctor if it's possible you have Helicobacter pylori, more commonly known as H. pylori, which can cause stomach ulcers.

, If you've ruled out gastrointestinal disease, consider visiting an immunologist. There are a few rare immune conditions that can manifest as persistent mouth sores.

, You have two options for prescription mouth rinses:



Dexamethasone, a steroid mouth rinse that should reduce pain and inflammation. Dexamethasone should reduce the number of recurrences, but is generally reserved for more severe cases.Tetracycline, an antibiotic used for more extreme cases. Your sores will heal quickly, but your mouth will be susceptible to a fungal condition called thrush. Thrush is an infection of yeast fungus in the mucous membranes of the mouth.

, Topical ointments such as benzocaine (Anbesol), amlexanox (Aphthasol) and fluocinonide (Lidex, Vanos) may relieve pain and speed healing if applied as soon as canker sores appear.Doctors usually suggest treating sores with ointments 2-4 times during the day.


Other oral medication not specifically intended to treat canker sores may be helpful in treating canker sores. Cimetidine (Tagamet) and colchicine, gout medicines, are sometimes effective in treating canker sores.Steroidal oral medications are generally used as a last resort, only when canker sores don't respond to other medications. Doctors still don't know what exactly causes canker sores., Cauterizing — or burning the surface tissue — sores can keep open sores from getting bigger, and the burn will eventually heal over. Most cauterizations are performed with chemical solutions, such as silver nitrate.

Spot the symptoms of mono.,
Don't mistake mono for strep throat.,
See your doctor.",How to Treat Mono1," Mono is not always easy to diagnose at home. The best way is to look for the following symptoms, especially if they do not go away after a week or two.Severe fatigue. You may feel excessively sleepy, or just lethargic and unable to muster any energy. You may find yourself exhausted after the smallest bit of exertion. This can also manifest as a feeling malaise or general unwellness.



 


Sore throat, especially one that doesn't go away after taking antibiotics.






Fever.






Swollen lymph nodes, tonsils, liver or spleen.






Headache and body aches.






Occasionally a skin rash.





;
, Because of the sore throat, it is easy to at first think your mono is actually strep. But unlike strep, which is caused by the Streptococcus bacteria, mono is caused by a virus and cannot be treated with antibiotics. Talk to your doctor if your sore throat doesn't get better after taking antibiotics.

, If you suspect you have mono, or if you have figured out that you have mono but symptoms continue for more than a few weeks with rest, you should go see your doctor. Your doctor is likely to diagnose you based on your symptoms and feeling your lymph nodes, but they can also perform a blood test to find out more or less for sure.Monospot antibody tests check your blood for Epstein-Barr virus antibodies. You will get results within a day, but this test may not be able to detect mono during your first week of symptoms. There is a different version of the antibody test that can detect mono within the first week, but it requires a longer result time.
Tests looking for elevated white blood cell counts can also sometimes be used to suggest the presence of mono, but won't actually confirm mononucleosis for sure.

Make an appointment with your dentist.,
Rinse your mouth with warm salt water.,
Take over-the-counter pain relievers to manage pain and fever.,
Seek emergency medical treatment if severe symptoms become present.",How to Treat a Tooth Abscess1," If you suspect you have a tooth abscess, your first action should be to make an appointment with your dentist right away. Symptoms of a tooth abscess include fever, pain when chewing, a bad taste in the mouth, lingering bad breath, swollen neck glands, redness and swelling of the gums, discoloration of the tooth, swelling of the upper or lower jaw, or an open, pus-filled sore on the side of the gum.A tooth abscess is not necessarily painful; a severe tooth infection will eventually kill the pulp inside the root of the tooth, at which point the tooth will lose sensation. This does not mean you are OK, now. The infection is still active, and if left untreated will cause further, serious damage.
Depending on the type of bacteria involved in the infection and your immune system, an abscess can even cause facial deformities due to the constant accumulation of pus in the tissue.;
, Do this after meals to keep any particles from further irritating the abscess. It may also bring temporary pain relief to the area.Mix 1 tsp (5 g) of salt into 1 cup (250ml) of warm (not hot) water, and swish it around in your mouth to rinse, then spit out the water and repeat.
Remember that a saltwater rinse can NOT cure a tooth abscess, even if it makes it feel better. You still must be seen by a dentist because the symptoms may be aggravated severely by an anaerobic infection, which expands quickly.

, Medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol,) naproxen (Aleve,) ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin) can help relieve your tooth pain while you wait for your appointment.Take medications only as directed, even if doing so does not completely alleviate your tooth pain.
Note that these medications are also fever-reducers, and may mask a fever that the infection is causing. When using these medications, keep an eye out for any other symptoms that might indicate that the infection is worsening.

, It is possible for a tooth infection to spread rapidly, and affect not only other teeth, but your entire body, as well. If you experience any of the following symptoms, go to an emergency room right away: visibly increased swelling of the abscess, the jaw, or the face, swelling that spreads across the face or down the neck, skin discoloration, fever, vertigo, lack of energy, eyesight problems, chills, nausea, vomiting, or increasing or intolerable pain that does not respond to over-the-counter medications."

, Co-enzyme Q10(also known as ubiquinone) is a vitamin-like substance that helps the body convert sugars and fat into energy. According to the Mayo Clinic, early studies suggest CoQ10 taken by mouth or placed on the skin or gums may aid in the treatment of periodontitis., With the exception of prescription mouthwash, the Listerine formula has been shown to be one of the most effective mouthwash formulas for reducing plaque and gingivitis. It's recommended that you use it for 30 seconds twice a day, but always dilute it 50/50 with plain water.
While the essential oils that make up this solution can cause a burning sensation in the mouth, people often adjust to it after a few days of regular use.

, Try incorporating the use of a spray containing chlorhexidine (CHX), a powerful anti-bacterial with plaque-inhibiting properties, in your dental care routine. One study on elderly patients, a group at risk for periodontal disease, found that a once-daily application of a 0.2% CHX spray reduced plaque accumulation and inflammation caused by gingivitis., This product contains hyaluronic acid, a natural substance found in the connective tissues of the body. Research has shown that hyaluronate has anti-inflammatory, antiedematous and anti-bacterial properties that are effective in the treatment of gingivitis and periodontitis.When Gengigel is applied to gums, it stimulates the production of healthy new tissue. In trials at the University of Rostock, Germany, scientists found it can boost tissue healing by up to a half, increase blood supply, and reduce inflammation., Tea tree oil kills bacteria. Dental plaque is a bacteria. Thus, tea tree oil toothpaste can help get rid plaque and ease gum pain.


You can also add a drop of tea tree oil to your regular toothpaste every time you brush. If you use a tea tree oil extract, be sure not to swallow it, as it can cause stomach irritations, including diarrhea."

Dab some coconut oil on your canker sore.",How to Treat Canker Sores (Home Remedies)1," Take 1 teaspoon of sea salt or table salt with 1 cup of warm water. Stir the solution then use it to rinse your mouth several times. This helps to disinfect your mouth. It also helps to relieve the pain. After rinsing your mouth with the salt water, collect a pinch of salt and place it directly on the canker sore. This is usually a very painful process, but it's one of the best ways to speed up healing. You can do this 4 to 5 times a day., Pour about a teaspoon of Milk of Magnesia into a spoon. Take a clean cotton swab and soak it in the Milk of Magnesia. Dab the canker sore and let the solution sit on the sore for 5-10 seconds with your mouth open. The magnesium hydroxide will dehydrate the canker sore and speed up the healing process. Repeat this 7-8 times a day.Milk of magnesia is available in most pharmacies - usually in the aisle with products for constipation.

, Buy some alum powder (in the baking or spice section of your grocery store). Pour out a small amount (about the size of a pencil eraser) onto a spoon. Take a cotton swab and dip the tip into water and then into the alum. Apply directly onto the canker sore. Leave it on your sore for 1-2 minutes. It may burn a bit. Have a glass of water nearby to rinse out your mouth. Alum is used as an astringent to shrink the tissues. In addition, alum may stimulate the immune system, though that may be little help if your canker sore is not caused by a virus. Do this 1 to 2 times a day.Alum is used in baking and cooking, so if you swallow some, it isn’t a problem.

, Using a cotton swab, apply aloe gel directly to the canker sore. Leave it on for 1 to 2 minutes. Most likely the aloe will dissolve in your saliva. If not, rinse afterwards. You can repeat this treatment 4-5 times a day.

, Make a paste with about a tablespoon of baking soda and a few drops of water. Use a cotton swab and dab the paste onto the canker sore. Let the solution sit on the sore for 5-10 seconds with your mouth open. The baking soda speeds healing and increases the pH of the mouth, reducing the risk of bacterial infection. Repeat this 7-8 times a day., To make sage tea, use 1 level teaspoon of sage per cup of hot water. You can make the chamomile tea in the same way, or use 1 bag per cup of hot water. When the teas are cooled down, mix them equally and then rinse your mouth out. Both sage and chamomile are known to be anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory, reducing the risk of infection and general discomfort.You can also hold a chamomile tea bag against your canker sore. The chemical bisabolol in the tea will act as an anti-inflammatory and will reduce your canker sore's redness., You can buy these from your local herb or health food store. Let the lozenge rest on the canker sore until it dissolves. The DGL speeds healing and decreases the size of the canker sore. DGL is commonly used to treat ulcers in the digestive system. Don’t use lozenges with children, because it may be a choking hazard. Also, DGL is an acquired taste, so have that glass of water nearby.

, Mix a tsp of cayenne pepper with a couple drops of water. Use a Q-tip to apply the mixture to your canker sore. It may sound terrifying, but the capsaicin in the cayenne pepper triggers sensors in your body that alert you to pain. So after the spicy taste fades away, your body will basically ignore your canker sore for 30 minutes to 1 hour., While coconut oil has not been medically proven to get rid of canker sores, it does have anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial properties. So it can't hurt, but it can taste good!"

Identify the symptoms.,
Know who is at risk.,
See a doctor or dentist.,
Take pain relievers.,
Use ice or a cold compress on the side of your face experiencing pain.,
Stay hydrated.,
Use a salt water rinse.,
Avoid using tobacco products.,
Try clove oil.,
Flush the socket.,
Pack with medicated dressings.,
Have your oral surgeon pack the wound immediately after surgery.,
Use antibacterial mouthwash.,
Stick to soft foods.,
Avoid using tobacco.",How to Treat a Dry Socket," Dry socket has some common symptoms that may help you to determine if that is the problem. The most common symptoms of dry socket are:


Severe pain, especially radiating from the site of tooth extraction out across that side of your face. The pain is intense and you have to manage it continually.
Visibly ""empty"" appearance at the site of tooth extraction and the entire area will have a grey color compared to the usual purple, red, white, or yellow which indicates good healing.
Visible bone in the open wound on your gums.
Swollen lymph nodes in the jaw and/or neck.
Fever.
Foul taste or odor in the mouth.;
, While a dry socket may develop in anyone's mouth following a dental surgery, certain risk factors such as tobacco use, estrogen-based oral contraceptives, and use of corticosteroids or very bad oral hygiene and not following the instructions of your dentist may increase the chances of developing a dry socket., If you suspect that you've developed a dry socket following a dental surgery or tooth extraction, contact your dentist or doctor immediately.

, Though pain medication will not help the wound heal or prevent infection, it will help you manage the pain associated with a dry socket. Your doctor may recommend a prescription-strength pain medication, or you may wish to stick with over-the-counter medications like aspirin or acetaminophen.Do NOT give aspirin to children or adolescents. Use of aspirin in children or teenagers may cause complications with the liver and brain. Consult with your child's pediatrician for guidance on what medication would work best for your child.Don’t exceed the dosage with ibuprofen either because this can lead to severe stomach or intestinal bleeding.

, Use cold packs only for the first 48 hours.


Fill a sandwich bag with ice cubes, or wrap ice cubes in a clean towel. In a pinch, you can also use a bag of frozen vegetables wrapped in a paper towel.
Apply to the affected side of the face. Remove the bag if it starts to feel like it is burning your skin or you may damage your skin.
Keep the ice pack on for 20 minutes, then off for 20 minutes.
After two days you should switch to using a warm compress, as a cold compress will no longer reduce swelling or inflammation after the first 48 hours., Drinking clear liquids, especially water at room temperature, is crucial following any surgical procedure.Avoid alcohol after any surgery.
Water at room temperature is the best beverage to stay hydrated. If you like, you may wish to alternate water with a sugar-free sports drink.

, This will remove debris and help sooth inflammation.Add approximately half a teaspoon of salt to one cup of lukewarm water.
Stir the salt water thoroughly, so that it is mostly dissolved.
Very gently swish the salt water around in your mouth, focusing on the affected side of your mouth without creating negative pressure which can dislodge the clot.
Repeat after each meal and before bed, and any times in between when you believe a saltwater rinse might be helpful.

, The physical act of smoking a cigarette may cause a blood clot to come dislodged, and using chewing tobacco or passing smoke over the socket may further irritate the wound and prolong the pain and inflammation.Try using a nicotine patch if you don't believe you can't quit smoking during the time it takes for your mouth to recover.
Talk to your doctor about smoking alternatives.

, Some patients have found that using a few drops of clove oil to treat the site of an open dental wound may alleviate some of the pain.This should not be done as an alternative to seeking professional medical advice and assistance. Rather, it is meant to provide temporary pain relief in the event that immediate medical assistance is not available.


Apply one or two drops of clove oil to a clean cotton swab.
Dab the swab against your gum where the tooth was extracted.
Repeat as necessary to help relieve pain and inflammation.

, One common method of treating a dry socket is by flushing the socket. This removes any external debris, such as food or dirt, and may help reduce the chances of infection. This can be done by a dentist or oral surgeon, or at home with the right equipment.Use a clean, plastic syringe with a curved tip.
Fill the syringe with clean water or clean salt water, or use a prescription rinse if your doctor has given you one. Or, you can even use an alcohol-free diluted mouthwash.
Flush the socket from multiple angles starting on the third day after the extraction. Be sure that any visible debris is completely removed.
Continue to flush after every meal and before bed until the wound begins to heal and debris no longer pools in the socket., The oral surgeon or dentist who performed your tooth extraction may pack the wound with medicated dressings. The medication applied to these dressings can help relieve pain and prevent infection. You will most likely have to change the dressings every day, but your oral surgeon will determine the frequency and duration of medicated dressing applications., This has been shown to reduce the incidence of developing a dry socket. Having the wound sutured by your oral surgeon may also prevent dry socket., This should be done immediately before and after surgery for best results.Unscrew the cap and pour mouthwash into the cap. Dilute it with water so that it is 50% water and 50% mouthwash.
Gently swish the mouthwash around in your mouth moving your tongue from one cheek to another. You may wish to concentrate your swishing efforts around the affected area.
Spit out the mouthwash into the sink.
Rinse your mouth out with water immediately afterward if the sting of mouthwash becomes too intense.

, This is especially important during the first 24 hours after surgery. Gradually move from soft foods to semi-soft foods as your wound heals, but it's generally best to avoid hard, chewy, crunchy, and spicy foods, as these are most prone to pooling in the socket and causing irritation or infection., If you're recovering from oral surgery, avoid smoking for at least 48 hours after the procedure. If you use chewing tobacco, avoid using it for at least one week after the procedure. Use of tobacco products may increase irritation, prolong the healing process, and leave wounds more susceptible to infection."

Get plenty of rest.,
Drink lots of fluids.,
Take an over-the-counter pain reliever to reduce throat pain and soreness.,
Relieve your sore throat with a salt water gargle.,
Avoid strenuous activity.,
Try not to pass the virus to others.",How to Treat Mono2," Simply sleep and relax as much as possible. Bed rest is the main treatment for mono, and as you will be fatigued it feels like the natural thing to do. Resting is especially important in the first two weeks. Due to the fatigue it causes, people with mono should stay home from school and put other regular activities on hold. This doesn't mean you can't be occasionally social, however. Spending time with friends and family can be a good way to keep spirits up during what is otherwise a lousy and frustrating time—just avoid exertion and be prepared to rest when they go home. Avoid physical contact with them, especially any involving saliva.

, Water and fruit juices are best—aim for several liters a day at least. These will help lower the fever, lessen your sore throat and stave off dehydration.

, If you can take the pain medication with food. Acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or ibuprofen (such as Advil or Motrin IB) are both fine.


Taking aspirin when feverish can put children and teens at risk for Reyes' Syndrome. It is almost nonexistent in adults., Mix 1/2 teaspoon of table salt with 8 ounces of warm water. You can do this several times a day.

, During mono your spleen may become enlarged, and strenuous exercise, especially heavy lifting contact sports, puts you at risk of rupturing your spleen. A burst spleen can be extremely dangerous, so go to the hospital immediately if you have mono and experience a sharp, sudden pain in the left side of your upper abdomen.

, Since symptoms don't manifest until the virus has been in your system for weeks, you may have already infected some people, but do your best to spare your friends and family the misery you are going through. Don't share food, drink, table wear or cosmetics with anyone. Try not to cough or sneeze on other people. Don't kiss anyone and avoid sexual contact.

Antibiotics do not work against mono.,
Get treatment for secondary infections.,
Ask your doctor to prescribe corticosteroids if your pain is severe.,
Seek emergency surgery if your spleen ruptures.",How to Treat Mono3," Antibiotics help your body destroy bacterial infections, but mono is caused by a virus. It is also not usually treated with antivirals., Your body will be weak and more susceptible to invasion from bacteria. Mono sometimes comes with strep or infections of the sinus or tonsils. Watch out for these and go to your doctor for antibiotics if you suspect you are getting a secondary infection., These can relieve some symptoms, such as severe swelling of your throat and tonsils. They don't do anything to treat the virus itself, however., If you experience a sharp, sudden pain in the left side of your upper abdomen, especially during physical activity, you should get to a hospital immediately."

Visit your dentist to have the abscess examined and drained.,
Get a root canal.,
Have the tooth pulled.,
Take all antibiotics that are prescribed by your doctor.,
Remember that a tooth abscess is a serious, life-threatening condition.",How to Treat a Tooth Abscess2," The dentist will most likely try to drain the abscess first by making a small incision, ideally after administering anesthesia around the painful area, and allowing the pus to flow out. Your dentist will then investigate further to determine what other treatment may be needed.


Keep in mind that in some cases, anesthesia is not needed because patients may not feel any pain at all. Sometimes some of the pus has already come out through a small hole in the gum called a dental fistula.

, Your dentist may recommend a root canal, performed in either her office, or by a specialist. During a root canal, a dentist will drill into the tooth and remove the diseased pulp, completely sterilize the entire canal of the tooth, and then fill and seal the tooth's inner chambers and cap the tooth using a filling, onlay or even a crown when there is not enough dental substance. Teeth that have undergone this procedure can, with proper care, remain intact for the rest of your life., In some cases, a root canal is not possible or feasible, and you will need to have the tooth pulled instead. A simple tooth extraction only takes a few minutes. The dentist will first numb the area with a local anesthetic, and then cut away any gum tissue that surrounds the tooth. She will then use forceps to grasp the tooth and rock it back and forth to loosen it, before finally pulling it out.Be sure to care for your tooth socket properly after an abscess. Your dentist will give you detailed after-care instructions, and it important you follow them all. These include: using gauze to control the blood loss in the first day, letting a blood clot form in the tooth socket, and keeping your mouth clean while the socket heals.Call your dentist immediately if you have problems, such as bleeding that won't stop, or if the pain does not subside after several days, or comes back.

, Antibiotics are a critical part of the treatment for an abscess, and are necessary to ensure that the infection is completely gone and does not come back.They can also help to prevent severe pain, such as from a dry socket.

, It is important get it treated properly. If you do not have dental insurance, try to find a free or reduced-cost dental clinic near you, and remember that any dentist should be able to simply pull your tooth for under $100.If the abscess is visible, meaning that you can see and touch a bump on your gums next to one of your teeth, then your dentist will not be able to pull the tooth out right away. You will need to take antibiotics for at least two days first to reduce the risk of bacteremia.
Don't hesitate to go to the emergency room right away if you develop signs of major infection. They may not be able to fix your tooth, but the hospital is obligated to treat the infection, even if you don't have insurance.

Swab alum powder on the sore.Alum powder may also help heal a canker sore.,
Apply 1% gentian violet.",How to Treat a Mouth Ulcer1," De-glycyrrhizinated licorice (DGL) wafers may help heal a canker sore. DGL comes in wafer form, so you will need to allow a DGL wafer to dissolve over the mouth ulcer.Ask your doctor first if you are taking any medications. Licorice interacts with some medicines, such as birth control pills, corticosteroids, ace-inhibitors, digoxin, laxatives, and insulin.De-glycyrrhizinated licorice shouldn't have these interactions but if you are taking any of these medications try to only use it for a few days at most.;
, Zinc may help boost your immune system, which can help to prevent cold sores. The recommended daily dose for zinc is 10 mg/day for adult men and women. For children, make sure that you consult a pediatrician first., Lysine is an amino acid, which essential for your body’s tissue healing and building activities. Lysine may even help prevent cold sore outbreaks because it blocks another amino acid (arginine) that tends to promote viral growth.


Make sure that you read and follow the manufacturer’s instructions for use.
The usual dosage is 500-1000 mg per day taken on an empty stomach.
The safe limit for lysine is less than 3000 mg a day, so do not take any more than the recommended amount.

, Slippery elm powder may help mouth ulcers by lubricating and coating the mouth ulcer with a thick, gel-like layer, similar to how it is used to treat sore throats.To use slippery elm, take a cotton swab and dip the tip into a cup of water and then dip it into the slippery elm powder. Use the cotton swab to apply the powder to the mouth ulcer.


Leave the slippery elm powder on for one to two minutes, then swish with some water to get the slippery elm powder out of your mouth. Spit out the water after you swish.

, The magnesium hydroxide in the milk of magnesia can dry out canker sores and speed healing. You can find milk of magnesia in the most drug stores.


To use milk of magnesia, pour about one teaspoon of milk of magnesia into a spoon. Then, take a clean cotton swab and soak it in the milk of magnesia.
Dab your mouth ulcer and let the solution sit for 5-10 seconds with your mouth open. Repeat this process seven to eight times a day (about every two hours).

,


To make a baking soda paste, mix together about one tablespoon of baking soda with a few drops of water until it forms a thick paste.
Then, use a cotton swab to dab the paste onto the sore and let the paste sit for 5-10 seconds while keeping your mouth open.
Repeat this process seven to eight times per day.7

, Alum is used in baking and cooking, so you can find alum powder in the baking section of your grocery store.


To use alum, pour out a small amount of alum onto a spoon.
Then, take a cotton swab and dip the tip into some water and then dip it into the alum.
Apply the alum directly onto your canker sore and leave it on for about one to two minutes.
The alum may burn a bit, so make sure that you have a glass of water nearby to rinse out your mouth.

, Gentian violet can also help to heal sores inside your mouth. Use a cotton swab to apply a small amount of gentian violet to sores. Leave the solution on the sores for a few minutes and then rinse out your mouth. Do not swallow the gentian violet solution.You do not need a prescription for gentian violet, but you should ask your doctor before using it.
Gentian violet is available online, in health food stores, and in well-stocked grocery stores.

Choose a toothbrush.,
Choose toothpaste.,
Use healthy tooth-brushing techniques.,
Start with a dry brush.,
Rinse and repeat with toothpaste.,
Learn flossing techniques.,
Consider mouthwash.",How to Stop Gum Recession1," Choose a toothbrush with soft bristles to avoid injuring your gums. In most studies, other features of the toothbrush beside the do not make a major difference. Some studies and dentists recommend electric toothbrushes for certain types of patients, but an ordinary toothbrush is fine for most people.A manual toothbrush provides good protection against bacteria and a complete clean of teeth surfaces if it's used properly.


Round-tipped bristles may provide more protection for sensitive gums.;
, Pick a toothpaste with fluoride, which helps fight the bacteria that cause gum recession. If the label lists the RDA, a measurement of abrasiveness, pick a toothbrush with a low value. An RDA below 70 is considered gentle, but you'll wear down less of your teeth the lower you go.


Many labels do not display the RDA. Either look up the product's RDA online, or just stay away from whitening toothpastes, which tend to be the most abrasive.
Some studies suggest that toothpaste made from hydrogen peroxide and baking soda may damage your teeth if you use them daily and frequently.Also, toothpastes that have salt in them are abrasive for your enamel.

, Harsh brushing can do more harm than good. Place your toothbrush at a 45º angle against the gum line, pressing only hard enough to touch the tips against your teeth, not the bristle sides. Brush with small, vertical motions followed by circular strokes, not side-to-side strokes making sure you brush the entire surface of each tooth.Bacteria can live on the tongue as well. Brush it for 30 seconds, or use a special tongue scraper., Research suggests that starting with a dry brush will lead to much healthier gums if the tip of the brush has been disinfected prior to using it. Otherwise, bacteria stuck in the bristles can harm your gums. Start on the inside lower teeth and brush until all your teeth feel clean., After dry brushing, rinse the brush and add a pea-sized dollop of toothpaste. Use the same technique to brush your teeth a second time.


Most dentists recommend you brush your teeth twice a day.

, Research shows that most people do not benefit from self-flossing, but do benefit if flossed by a dental professional.In other words, proper technique is everything. Floss once a day with the following method:Cut off a 45 cm (18 inch) section of floss and wind it around your middle fingers.
Hold a 2.5 to 5cm (1 to 2 inch) section between your forefingers and your thumbs.
Gently guide the floss between your teeth, rubbing up and down.
Bring the floss beneath the gumline, curving it to press against the tooth, not the gums. Keep moving until you feel resistance. Remember to floss two tooth surfaces at a time. This step is essential for removing the plaque that causes gum recession.

, You may want to ask your dentist for advice first, as the wrong mouthwash can cause more harm than good. Mouth wash containing Listerine, the prescription-only Chlorhexidine mouthwash, or (to a lesser extent) fluoride will remove some of the plaque that leads to gum recession.However, the high alcohol content in most mouthwash can cause dry mouth, burning sensations, or even mouth ulcers, which may cause intense pain and you may not want to brush your teeth or eat for a while. Stained teeth and altered taste sensations are common as well when you overuse chlorhexidine mouthwash.To take most mouthwashes, swish liquid in mouth for thirty seconds and spit out. Do not rinse, eat, or smoke for thirty minutes afterward, for maximum effect.

See your dentist.,
Take over-the-counter medication.,
Try numbing gels.",How to Stop Cavity Pain1," One way to get rid of cavity pain is to go to the dentist. Your dentist will do an exam and get x-rays of your teeth to see where any cavities or other tooth or gum problems are. Then, your dentist will suggest the best course of treatment for your cavity.The most common treatment for cavities is a filling. If the tooth is infected or abscessed, your dentist may prescribe antibiotics first to clear up any infection, which is important to avoid any further complications.;
, If your tooth or gum aches because of a cavity, taking over-the-counter pain relievers may help reduce the pain. You can take ibuprofen (Advil), acetaminophen (Tylenol), naproxen (Aleve), or aspirin.Follow the dosage instructions on the label.
Make sure not to let aspirin dissolve on the tooth or gum. This may harm your mouth and teeth., You can try numbing gels around the area of the cavity to help stop the pain temporarily. Numbing gels contain benzocaine. You should spread the gel on your gums with either your finger or a cotton swab. Make sure you don’t swallow the gel. Spit out the gel left in your mouth.Read and follow the instructions on the box or tube to know the amount of gel to apply and how often you should apply the gel.
Keep in mind that if your saliva flow increases after you have applied the gel, that is absolutely normal. Your tongue may also go numb for a while, so you may want to avoid talking for a while or you may bite your tongue accidentally.

Eat B12 rich foods.,
Eat more folic acids.,
Add some iron-rich foods to your meals.,
Add some zinc to your diet.",How to Treat Canker Sores (Home Remedies)2," B12 deficiency can lead to damaged nerve and blood cells, which are needed to repair the membrane tissue on the inside of your mouth. If your diet lacks an adequate B12 source, you may experience canker sores. Eat seafood like sardines, salmon, tuna, cod, scallops, and shrimp. Beef and lamb are good sources of B12. You can also get your daily dose of B12 from yogurt., Our bodies need folic acid to make DNA and other genetic material, including the lining of your mouth. Beans, in general, and lentils are a strong source of folates. Dark, leafy green vegetables like turnip greens, spinach, and asparagus can be added to most meals to give you that much needed folic acid boost., Iron is responsible for the maintenance of many of our body’s functions. Most importantly, iron helps our bodies create healthy oxygen carrying red blood cells, which are needed to repair damaged tissues. Seafood, beef, turkey, chicken, ham, lentils, beans, and spinach are all great sources of iron., Zinc is a nutrient that people need to stay healthy. It is found throughout the body and aids cellular regeneration. Without zinc, you’ll have problems healing wounds, clotting, and fighting off even the weakest of infections. Pumpkin, sesame, lentils, and cashews are tremendous sources of zinc."

Leave it alone.,
Deal with your braces.,
Avoid oral care products with sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS).,
Stay away from foods with a lot of harsh acids.,
Skip “pointy” foods.,
Give up your tobacco products.",How to Treat Canker Sores (Home Remedies)3," You are probably hyper aware of your canker sore. Every time you open your mouth, your teeth brush past your open wound, irritating it further and sending waves of pain throughout your body. Do your best to avoid further irritating your canker sore. Chew your food on the other side of your mouth, far away from your sore. Do your best to keep your tongue away from it. Don’t pick at it. Don’t squeeze it. Just leave it alone and let your body heal.

, If you have braces, you probably get canker sores on occasion. The pointing metal of your orthodontia can rip through the lining of your cheek in one fell swoop. You'll want to talk to your orthodontist about this issue, but there is a home remedy you can try. Melt 1 tbsp of beeswax and mix it with 2 tsp of coconut oil. After it has cooled, take a small clump of it and press it against troublesome parts of your braces. Don't put too much, but just enough to stop that jagged edge from hurting you further., Many dentists encourage their patients to avoid toothpastes and mouth washes with this harsh organic compound. It is often used in cleaning products. Tom’s of Maine and Burt’s Bees don't use sodium lauryl sulfate in their products.

, Orange juice, for example, contains a lot of vitamin C, which is normally good for your health, but it also has a lot of citric acid, which will further irritate your canker sore causing it to heal more slowly.Avoid tomatoes and tomato juice. Pass on peppers too.

, This might seem silly, but many canker sores are the result of foods with sharp edges like chips, bread crusts, biscotti, pretzels, popcorn, and anything else that could cause further damage to the inside lining of your mouth.

, Chewing tobacco, in particular, often causes canker sores. The harsh chemicals in the tobacco irritate the skin, so it only makes sense to give up tobacco when you are suffering from a nasty canker sore. Cigarettes have the same effect too."

Consult a physician.,
Report the facts to your physician.,
Follow your doctor's advice.",How to Treat Canker Sores (Home Remedies)4," Do so if your canker sore does not go away after 4 days or if you have experienced chronic canker sores. Call your doctor if your canker sore is larger than a dime. There are many chronic causes of canker sores that you and your physician will be able to discuss. Vitamin deficiency is often a cause of chronic canker sores, but depression, hormonal imbalance, and immune disorders like Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, and a rare condition called Bechet’s disease can also cause ulcers too.SLE is an autoimmune disease where there is oral involvement in about 50% of cases. These oral ulcers look like irregularly shaped raised white plaques.Treatment for these lesions include topical or intralesional glucocorticoids. Behcet's disease is another rare disease that leads to mouth ulcers. It is a neutrophilic inflammatory disorder with recurrent oral and genital ulcers, Recurrent ulcers along with lesions in the genital, eye, or skin are required for the diagnosis. The mucocutaneous manifestations of Behcet’s disease can be treated with colchicine.
Inflammatory bowel disease is also known to be associated with mouth ulcers, particularly aphthous stomatitis. This form of mouth ulcers is the most common cause of mouth ulcers. Risk factors for mouth ulcers include family history, trauma, hormonal factors, food or drug hypersensitivity, immunodeficiencies, and emotional distress. Treatment for oral ulcers involve triamcinolone in an over the counter treatment called Orabase.
There are no tests for canker sores. Doctors can tell just by looking at it, if it is a form of cold sore or if it is a canker sore. Canker sores are shallow crater-like spots on the mucus tissue of the mouth. They are immediately recognizable by their round shape, reddish edge, and general whitish/grayish color.

, Be sure to note the number and longevity of your canker sores. They’ll be able to determine if you have a chronic condition. If you’ve had a couple in a week or so, your doctor will likely tell you to focus on your eating habits and environment. If you’ve had a couple constantly for months, then your doctor will probably run a spectrum of blood and urine tests to check for a myriad of conditions including vitamin deficiency., Normally, your doctor will simply ask you to monitor your canker sores and to use many at-home or over-the-counter remedies. In the most extreme cases, your doctor may prescribe certain oral steroids that will reduce inflammation and the pain.In even more extreme cases, your doctor may choose to cauterize the wound. There are two cauterizing chemicals that your doctor may use. The first is Debacterol. It is a topical solution chemically designed to cauterize your canker sore and to reduce the healing time to about a week. The second is silver nitrate. Like debacterol, silver nitrate will chemically cauterize the wound, but it hasn’t been shown to speed the healing process."

Bleeding gums can be a symptom of other medical issues having nothing to do with your dental hygiene. If you suspect your bleeding gums are related to something other than poor brushing and flossing habits, see your doctor to discuss ways to address the problem. Bleeding gums can be related to the following conditions:


Hormonal changes.
Diabetes.
Heart disease.
Clotting disorders.
Cancers, like Leukemia.
AIDS.
Scurvy.
Blood thinning medications.
Genetic factors/genetic syndromes.
Contraceptive pills.;
, Gum disease, which is caused by the buildup of plaque on the gums and teeth, is very common among adults over the age of 35. It starts with gingivitis, which is the inflammation and swelling of the gums that leads to bleeding and pain. Left untreated, gingivitis can turn into the more severe periodontitis, which causes the gums and oral bones to weaken and can lead to tooth loss. This process may be slow lasting several years, or fast if aggressive bacteria are involved and the periodontitis has a rapid and progressive evolution.


Gum disease is also related to other severe medical conditions like heart disease, stroke, and kidney disease because of constantly storing bacteria that can easily enter the bloodstream.

, The best way to fight gum disease is to get a head start by going to the dentist for a deep cleaning. Your dentist will help you figure out why your gums are bleeding. Your dentist can demonstrate the proper way to brush and floss, clean away your built-up plaque, and let you know whether you need to be treated for periodontitis.


Regular trips to the dentist - at least once every six months - are an important way to combat gum disease. It's not possible to brush and floss away every little bit of plaque before it turns into hard tartar on your teeth, unless the brush used is accurate in allowing small up/down movements, and once it becomes tartar you can't remove it yourself. Your dentist has the right tools to get rid of the tartar that's leading to bleeding gums.
Using x-rays, the dentist can show you whether dangerous tartar has formed underneath the gums. This type of tartar is difficult to remove just with regular dental hygiene. You may need surgery, but this will save your teeth for a long time.
Seek medical attention soon if you notice the following symptoms in addition to gum bleeding:Pockets formed between your teeth and gums.
Loose teeth.
A change in the way your teeth fit together.
Receding gums leaving sensitive teeth and dark triangles between teeth.
Swollen, red and tender gums or even abscess of the gums where pus is visible.
Gums that bleed a lot when you brush your teeth.



, If you're in the camp that thinks that the harder you brush, the cleaner your teeth will get, your brushing habits might be the culprit here. Gums are composed of soft, fragile tissue that doesn't need to be scrubbed hard to get clean. Choose a brush with soft, blunt bristles - never get the kind labeled ""medium"" or ""hard."" Brush twice a day using the right technique - a soft, circular motion on all sides of the teeth and gums along with vertical strokes, which include brushing the gums to stimulate the blood flow for better protection.


Consider getting an electric toothbrush. Electric toothbrushes are gentle on your teeth and very effective at reaching to the back to remove plaque. Choose a brush that has been approved by the American Dental Association (ADA).
If there's one particular part of your mouth that feels sensitive, or seems to bleed more often, spend more time gently brushing that area. Gently massage the spot with your toothbrush for 3 minutes. This will help remove the plaque affecting the area.

, Flossing once a day is absolutely essential for stopping gums from bleeding. There's no other way to get to the bits of food and plaque building up between your teeth and underneath the gingival margin called the sulcus. But there's a right way and a wrong way to floss, and doing it correctly can make all the difference when it comes to stopping gums from bleeding.


Don't snap the floss violently between your teeth. This doesn't get them cleaner; it just hurts your fragile gums.
Gently pull the floss between your teeth and swipe your gums. Clean the front of your teeth by holding the floss in a U-shape at the top of each tooth and gently swiping downward. Go as far back as you can and floss both surfaces of the papilla, meaning that you need to floss the tooth in front and the tooth behind each time.

, Many people find that using a gum irrigation device, called a water pik, helps to alleviate bleeding gums by gently cleaning them more thoroughly. Gum irrigation devices attach to your sink's plumbing and should be used after brushing to thoroughly cleanse the gums.


There is also an electric device which sprays water similar to a shower through a small tip called oral irrigator. The advantage is that you can add mouthwash for increased antibacterial protection.

, Alcohol-based mouthwashes can dry out the gums and cause more irritation and bleeding. It's better to use a non-alcoholic, peroxide-based mouthwash. You can also make your own mouthwash by simply rinsing with saltwater.

, If your gums don't stop bleeding and it doesn't seem as though good hygiene is making a difference, your dentist may recommend a treatment designed to get rid of the plaque and allow your gums to recover. Here are the options:



Scaling and root planing. The dentist administers local anesthetic and scrapes away the tartar as well as smoothing rough spots. This is usually done when there is tartar buildup under the gum line and there is an incipient stage of periodontitis.

Flap surgery and pocket reduction. If you have advanced gum disease, your dentist may decide that surgery is the best option. Flap surgery reduces the space between the gum and the tooth so that plaque can't form underneath so easily. This helps the bone to recover and eliminates anaerobic bacteria which is the main cause of periodontitis. Flap surgery has a better long term result than any other type of treatment.

Grafts of tissue or bones. If periodontitis has cause your gums to recede and your bones to deteriorate, tissue and bone can be grafted from other parts of the mouth to the affected area. Your periodontist may also choose to graft artificial bone which can be either hydroxyapatite or bovine bone.

, Gums, like the rest of your body's tissues, are affected by the vitamins and nutrients you take in. If you eat loads of sugar and flour-based items and not a lot of fruits, veggies and nutritionally dense food, your gums will suffer for it. For improved oral health, try the following:Cut back on sugar. Eating a lot of sugar causes tartar to build up fast - faster than you can brush or floss it away. Cutting back should help your gums heal quickly.
Eat fruits and vegetables high in vitamin C, like kale, mangoes, broccoli and grapefruit.
Eat high-calcium foods like spinach and dairy products.

, Smoking is very detrimental to oral health. The toxins in cigarettes and other tobacco produces can lead to gum inflammation and disease. In fact, smokers are six times more likely to develop serious gum disease than nonsmokers.


Smoking inhibits blood circulation in the gums, causing the gums to be much more prone to getting diseased because the blood has plenty of factors to fight against bacteria and reducing the circulation also reduces protection.
Smoking actually lowers the success rate of gum disease treatments.

, Drinking at least 8 glasses of water throughout the day can help keep your gums and mouth healthy. Drinking water rinses bacteria from your teeth and helps prevent the buildup of plaque. Replace your sugary drinks, coffee and tea with water as much as you can.

, There are several things that can make you more likely to wind up with dry socket after having a tooth removed. Be honest with your dentist if they ask about the following risk factors:An infection around the extracted tooth. If the gums or the extracted tooth were infected when the extraction took place, your dentist was likely aware of it; however, if the infection was in the past and you were treated by another dentist, your doctor might not have been aware.
Smoking. The act of sucking on a cigarette can loosen a blood clot. Tobacco may also make the wound heal more slowly.
Birth control pills. Birth control pills that cause you to have high estrogen levels can inhibit healing.
Corticosteroids. In particular, prednisone may make you vulnerable to dry socket, as it creates a powerful anti-inflammatory effect which slows the healing.

, Clenching your jaw or grinding your teeth can cause receding gums.If you grind your teeth at night, a doctor can recommend a device to wear to stop this. Reducing stress or meditating may help, although this has not been thoroughly studied. Hypnosis therapy may be effective for some people.Constant headaches in the morning that continue throughout the day, earaches, and facial muscle soreness are all signs that you might grind your teeth in your sleep.

, Certain medications increase the chance of unhealthy gums. These include steroids, oral contraceptives, some anti-epilepsy drugs, some cancer therapies, drugs used after organ transplant, and some drugs used to treat migraines or blood pressure.Bring up your concerns with your doctor. Depending on your condition and the medications available, he may recommend a treatment that's less harmful on your gums.

, Diabetes can lead to higher glucose levels in your saliva, which encourages bacterial growth on gums slowing blood flow to the gums.

Look for signs of infection.,
Visit the dentist.,
Ask for a cleaning.,
Learn about more advanced treatments.",How to Stop Gum Recession3," If you've noticed gum recession, you most likely have periodontitis. In this condition, plaque and bacteria gather between your teeth and your gums, wearing away at the gum and bone.Loose teeth, teeth that are sensitive to cold or heat, permanent bad breath, teeth that look bigger creating an unaesthetic smile and dark triangles between teeth, or pain while chewing are all signs that this infection has been around for a while.A dentist visit is recommended for any receding gums, and as soon as you can if you have these advanced symptoms.


Sometimes the gums recede rapidly, even if no other signs are present. This happens more often in puberty and young adulthood.Visit a dentist right away and ask whether ""aggressive periodontitis"" is a possibility. Antibiotic treatment 24 hours before the regular cleaning may be effective to reduce the amount of bacteria., Most dentists recommend a visit at least once a year. It's a good idea to visit twice a year or more if you have receding gums. Schedule an additional visit if you notice a new symptom, such as white sores in your mouth, or teeth becoming sensitive to cold.


People with diabetes, eating disorders, HIV, or cardiovascular diseases may need more regular checkups.Ask your dentist and doctor for advice.

, Gum recession and gum disease are very common problems. Your dentist most likely has a great deal of experience and training in the subject. She will most likely start by cleaning your teeth with special tools:


At a regular cleaning session, the dentist will brush away plaque and polish your teeth to a smooth surface. This is called ""scaling and root planing.""If you have receding gums caused by disease, the dentist will probably do the same thing lower down on your teeth: a deep cleaning. Depending on how much the gums have receded, this might take two to four appointments. This can make your mouth sore, sensitive to hot and cold, and bloody. If it causes worse pain, stop your dentist and ask for a numbing medication., More serious recession may require more serious treatment. Your dentist will let you know if these are a good idea, but here's a description to make them less mysterious:


A pocket depth reduction cleans teeth down below the level of the gums, in ""pockets"" of air left by thinning gums. The gum is then secured back onto your teeth to hopefully slow or stop recession and in some cases bone grafts may be required to stabilize the tooth. Depending on your mouth, this may feel the same as deep cleaning, or require very minor local surgery to get access to the gums.If the recession is severe, the dentist can perform a gum graft, cutting skin from the roof of your mouth or elsewhere on your gum, and attaching it over the exposed teeth. Most patients remain awake but numbed, but if you have extreme dental fear you can be put unconscious. Most pain and swelling ends within a day, but for a week or two you should avoid alcohol and tobacco, rinse with mouthwash, and be careful while chewing."

Visit your dentist.,
Get a professional cleaning.,
Take antibiotics, if recommended by your dentist.,
Consider further treatment if the infection remains or gum disease develops.,
Maintain excellent oral hygiene.",How to Soothe Red and Inflamed Gums3," He or she will assess the state of your gums, looking for soft, swollen, or red gums and visible plaque or tarter at the base of your teeth.In addition, your dentist may perform x-rays, in order to assess whether the disease has spread into the bone surrounding the teeth.

, If you already have gingivitis, the dentist will perform a scaling and polishing treatment. In this procedure, calculus deposits and plaque (tartar) are removed from the surface of the teeth. It is recommended that you visit the dentist every six months for a routine scaling and polishing. Because you are having such extreme symptoms, the hygiene appointment will most likely take more than one appointment.



Scaling: Your dentist uses ultrasonic or manual scalers to remove calculus deposits and plaque from your teeth. These calculus deposits are mineralized and cannot be removed with normal brushing. To tell if you have calculus deposits, run your tongue over the back surface of your teeth — calculus deposits will feel rough. Professional removal of plaque greatly improves periodontal health.Polishing: After the calculus deposits have been removed the dentist will polish your teeth. To do this, the dentist or dental hygienist will use a polishing paste and a rubber brush. Polishing pastes contain fluoride to help strengthen your teeth and prevent tooth decay, and abrasives like siliceous minerals to keep the surface of your teeth smooth and shiny. The smooth surface finish will prevent bacteria from sticking to your teeth and gums., After your teeth have been cleaned, your dentist may recommend antibiotics if the infection is serious enough. These can be taken via a prescription mouthwash, topical gels, or in pill form., Your dentist will make suggestions for further treatment. If your gingivitis has developed into gum disease, and it has moved deep into your teeth, you may need to consider surgical options. Options include flap surgery, bone grafts, and guided tissue regeneration.Tooth extraction is also a possibility, since gum disease will lead to bone disease and bone is what anchors the teeth.

, The best way to further prevent inflamed gums is to maintain excellent oral hygiene. This gets rid of bacteria inside your mouth and also prevents other dental problems.


Make sure that your toothbrushing technique is effective in removing plaque and remember to see your dentist every six months for a routine checkup and cleaning.
Drink plenty of water after eating. This can wash away food particles and the potential for gum-damaging bacteria."
"
Brush your teeth at least twice a day.Studies show that brushing can prevent gingivitis.,
Floss before brushing.,
Use saline rinses.,
Quit smoking.Those that smoke are more likely to get gum disease, as smoking is very hard on the gums and bone, causing bone loss, which subsequently is more difficult to keep clean.",How to Soothe Red and Inflamed Gums4," Effective brushing should not only reach in between teeth to remove plaque, but also massage the gums to stimulate micro-circulation in that area.


The best technique for brushing your teeth is the modified Bass Method.Orient your brush in such a way that its head is tilted at a 45-degree angle towards the gum line. This allows the bristles to clean 1 mm below the gum line. Use small, vibratory, circular strokes to remove plaque. After about 20 strokes, do a sweeping motion towards the biting surface of your teeth. For the biting surfaces, do a back and forth brushing stroke. Repeat these steps for all of your teeth.

, Flossing helps to remove plaque along the margins of your gums. This saves the gums from getting irritated by bacteria present in plaque.Floss first, since flossing brings the plaque stuck between the teeth out, and then you brush it away.


Get an elbow length piece of dental floss and wrap each end around your middle fingers. Leave at least an inch of floss between your fingers to work with.
With the help of your index finger, gently slide the floss in between your teeth, starting at the back. Allow the floss to hug the surface of your tooth and gently slide down to the gum line. Then, drag the floss against the surface of your tooth.
Do not force the floss in between your teeth as this could damage your gums and cause bleeding. Repeat the same steps between all of your teeth.

, Dissolve 9 teaspoons of salt in three cups of warm water. Rinse for 30 seconds, then spit out. Do this twice a day. Rinsing with salt water is an effective way to reduce the bacteria in your mouth. The bacteria present in plaque causes irritation of your gums.


Salt rinses create a diffusion gradient inside the mouth. This means that it causes the bacteria to become dehydrated and die.

, The habit can give you a variety of gum problems, including sensitive gums, bleeding gums, or painful sores on the gums.

Take a supplement to prevent recurrence.",How to Remove a Mouth Ulcer3," Most small canker sores heal on their own in a week or two. You may need medical help if you have multiple ulcers, very large ulcers, your pain is severe, your sores do not heal after three weeks or they spread, or you develop a fever.See your doctor or your dentist – there are many medications and treatments that can help.Your doctor or dentist can help you make sure your problem is actually a mouth ulcer, and not a tooth abscess or a rare form of oral cancer.

, You can get some pain medications over-the-counter, but others require a prescription. It’s best to ask your healthcare provider which medication is best for you to use. There are numerous pastes, creams, liquids, and gels on the market that can ease the pain and speed healing of mouth ulcers. Use a product containing one of the following ingredients:Fluocinonide (Lidex, Vanos)
Benzocaine (Anbesol, Kank-A, Zilactin-B, Orabase)
Hydrogen peroxide (Orajel Antiseptic Mouth Sore Rinse, Peroxyl)

, If you have multiple ulcers, a mouth rinse may be easier than applying gel to each individual sore. Ask your doctor or dentist about getting a mouth rinse containing dexamethasone or lidocaine. These can both ease pain, and dexamethasone can also reduce inflammation., You may need oral medication if your ulcers don’t heal with other treatments. Talk to your doctor about your options, and let them know about your health history and any medications you take. Some medicines for other ailments can be used to treat stubborn mouth ulcers, such as sucralfate (Carafate) and colchicine.Your doctor may prescribe oral corticosteroids if you have severe ulcers that won’t heal. These can have many side effects and are usually a last resort. Alert your doctor if you're pregnant or breastfeeding or if you have an autoimmune disease; you might be better suited to another treatment.

, Your doctor may cauterize your ulcers with a chemical or instrument. This destroys the damaged tissue, and may relieve pain and speed healing. Ask your doctor or dentist if this option is right for you., If you’re low in any nutrients, your mouth ulcers may return. Talk to your doctor about whether you should take a supplement for folate, vitamin B-12, vitamin B-6, zinc, or any vitamins. This may help prevent recurring sores.


Your doctor can check if you’re deficient in any nutrients by taking a blood sample.

Learn to rinse the socket.,
Ask the doctor about medicated dressings.,
Discuss pain medications.",How to Relieve Dry Socket2," The doctor will probably rinse the socket for you when you are in the office. This may help alleviate pain by removing pieces of food or debris that could be irritating it or causing an infection. The doctor will likely explain how to continue flushing it yourself at home:You will probably receive a plastic syringe to use when rinsing the socket. Depending upon your situation, the doctor may tell you to use the syringe to flush the socket with water, salt water, or a special rinse.
Continue rinsing the socket until it has healed enough that food and debris do not get stuck in it. Meanwhile, you should continue with good oral hygiene, brushing at least two times a day.

, The doctor may put medicated dressings like padding into the wound. This may reduce your pain within a few hours. Depending upon your situation, your doctor may:Ask you to schedule appointments to return for new dressings
Teach you to change them yourself and give you a schedule of how often to do it

, The pain of dry socket is usually too severe to be handled by over-the-counter medications. Your dentist will probably need to provide you with prescription strength medications.Provide your doctor with a list of all other medications you take. This includes prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, herbal remedies and dietary supplements. It is important the dentist know what else you take so they can prescribe you something that won’t interact with anything else you are taking.

Reduce swelling with an ice pack.,
Apply warmth after the first two days.,
Stay hydrated.,
Do not smoke or use tobacco.,
Follow your dentist’s instructions for caring for the wound.,
Treat an infection with antibiotics.",How to Relieve Dry Socket3," This can supplement the medications and reduce your pain. Cold packs are particularly effective in the first two days after the extraction. Apply the ice pack, wrapped in a thin towel, to the outside of your face.Do not put the ice directly on your skin as this may damage it. Apply the ice for approximately 10 minutes before giving your skin a chance to warm up.
If you do not have an ice pack prepared, you can use a package of frozen peas or corn wrapped in a towel.

, This will help increase the circulation and may reduce your pain. Ask your dentist what they recommend, but possibilities may include:Purchasing warming patches in your local drug store. They are available over-the-counter and are typically applied to the skin over the painful area. Read and follow the manufacturer’s instructions.
Applying a hot water bottle that is wrapped in a towel. Do not apply the heat directly to your skin because this increases your risk of burning yourself.

, Even if it hurts, it is still important that you drink enough water to prevent dehydration. Being properly hydrated will help you heal quickly and combat the nausea that may be a side effect of some pain medications. Just make sure fluids are room temperature — too hot or too cold can cause complications in the healing process. Monitor yourself for signs of dehydration such as:Thirst
Headaches
Nausea or vomiting
Dry skin
Dizziness
Infrequent urination
Passing cloudy or dark urine

, Tobacco may slow the healing process and make you more prone to an infection. In addition, the suction produced when you inhale while smoking can irritate the wound, allowing nicotine and other dangerous substances to reach directly into the extraction site.If you know that you will not be able to resist the craving, ask your doctor about trying a nicotine patch or nicotine replacement therapy.
These treatments may also help you begin the process of quitting.

, This may include rinsing your mouth and brushing carefully.Your dentist may tell you to rinse with salt water to help the wound heal. If your dentist does not provide you with a special solution to rinse with, ask what concentration the salt solution should be when you make it at home. Ask your doctor how often you should rinse.
Be careful when brushing around the socket.
Do not drink from a straw until it has healed. The suction may irritate the wound.

, If your socket has become infected, you may receive a prescription for antibiotics. Always take the entire course of antibiotics, even after your symptoms are gone. This is important to prevent antibiotic resistant strains from evolving. Seek medical attention immediately if you develop any of the following signs of an infection:Increasing pain or swelling
Worsening breath or a bad taste in your mouth
Fever

Identify the cause of your swollen gums.,
Gently brush using swirling, circular motions, but avoid sideways action.,
Floss between your teeth once a day.,
Rinse out your mouth with a saltwater solution.,
Use warm and cold compresses.,
Avoid gum irritants.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Try gently massaging your gums.,
Apply some clove oil.",How to Reduce Gum Swelling1," Gums can become swollen for a variety of reasons, though in many cases the condition can be a sign of gum disease. It is important that you identify the cause of the swelling, so that you can pursue the correct course of action — either caring for your gums at home, or making an appointment to see a dentist. Some common causes include:



Incorrect brushing or flossing techniques. In many cases, swollen gums are the result of poor oral hygiene, where plaque is allowed to build up between the teeth and at the gum line. To overcome this, you will need to start brushing teeth thoroughly and flossing regularly to remove excess plaque. In addition, many people who do floss between their teeth do it too roughly, which can also cause swelling.

Gingivitis and periodontitis. If good oral hygiene is not maintained, gum diseases such as gingivitis and periodontitis can easily develop. Gingivitis is the less severe form, and can be reversed if caught early. Periodontitis, on the other hand, is more serious and can lead to tooth loss. If gums look red, shiny and swollen, then you have gingivitis. The next stage is gum recession and bone loss, which defines periodontitis. If you suspect you might have either of these gum diseases, you should consult a dentist.

Mouth ulcers. Mouth ulcers which form on the gums can lead to pain and swelling. You can usually identify mouth ulcers, also known as canker sores, by their appearance; they will have a whitish center and red edges. Multiple mouth ulcers can appear at once, but they are usually treatable and non-contagious.

Chemotherapy. One of the many unfortunate side effects of chemotherapy is painful, swollen and bleeding gums. It can also cause the growth of painful ulcers and sores on the gums due to a weakened immune system. Although these symptoms can be relieved, they will not stop while chemotherapy treatment continues.

Tobacco. Smoking cigarettes and using other tobacco products commonly contributes to painful, swollen gums. In fact, people who use tobacco products are far more likely to develop gum disease than non-tobacco users. As a result, the first step in relieving swollen gums is quitting smoking.

Hormones. Swollen gums may be the result of an upsurge in the release of hormones which increase blood flow to the gums. These hormones include those which are produced during puberty, menstruation, pregnancy and menopause. Certain birth control pill may also release these hormones.;
, Make sure you brush the top chewing surfaces, fronts and backs of teeth (next to the tongue) — mostly up the bottom teeth and down top ones. As mentioned above, swollen gums can often be the result of built-up plaque on the teeth. The best-case scenario is to remove plaque and avoid gum disease, as you easily rectify the problem with gentle, yet thorough brushing and flossing. You should aim to brush your teeth at least twice a day, morning and evening, and following meals, if possible.


Use a soft nylon-bristle toothbrush. This will effectively clean teeth without causing further irritation. Avoid toothbrushes with medium or hard bristles, as these can cause gums to swell further and can even erode and scratch tooth enamel.
No, brushing harder does not mean brushing better. Gums are made of delicate tissue, so brushing too hard will do them more harm than good. Avoid brushing in a vigorous back-and-forth motion which does not follow the grooves between teeth.
A bad brushing technique that uses increased force is as dangerous as not brushing at all. Many patients develop root exposure and increased sensitivity after brushing too hard.
Choose a gum-protecting toothpaste which is designed to help prevent gingivitis. Most major toothpaste brands produce a gingivitis-fighting version.

, Flossing daily removes the plaque a toothbrush cannot reach, but avoid flossing more than this, as it may irritate gums further.


Flossing is neglected by many people, but even those who do floss may be aggravating their swollen gums by doing it too roughly. Avoid ""snapping"" the floss in between your teeth, as this can damage fragile gum tissue. Instead try to slide the floss carefully between teeth, following the curve of each tooth as you go., Gargling a saltwater solution is the oldest trick in the book when it comes to reducing swollen gums, but it is still one of the most effective. The salt works as an antibacterial agent, ridding the mouth of contaminants and soothing inflamed gums.


Gargle and swish: Make your own saltwater solution, dissolving a teaspoon of regular table salt in a cup of warm water. Swish it all around the mouth, between teeth; so that it reaches the gums. Do not swallow the salty water — use it as a mouthwash.
The saltwater solution can also be gargled to ease a sore throat, and used to clean new piercings and disinfect wounds.
You may have luck gargling with hot water, as well. Just be careful not to burn your mouth.

, Warm and cold compresses can be used to provide easy and immediate relief to sore and swollen gums. Warm compresses are best for relieving pain, while cold compresses will effectively reduce swelling. Hold the compresses against your face rather than against the gums themselves, as this is less awkward and prevents the gums from becoming further irritated by sudden changes in temperature.



To make a hot compress: Soak a clean washcloth in warm (not hot) water, wring out the excess moisture, then hold it against your face until the pain begins to subside.

To make a cold compress: Wrap a couple of ice cubes in a small, clean cloth or a paper towel. Alternatively, you can use a bag of frozen vegetables (like frozen peas) or a special cold pack that has been stored in the freezer. Hold the compress against your face for no more than 15 minutes.

, While your gums are sore and swollen, it is important that you avoid any substances that are going to exacerbate the swelling, such as tobacco products and alcohol. In addition, harsh mouthwashes — which you may be using to disinfect your mouth — can actually aggravate swollen gums, so you should also try taking a break from them for a while.


Always dilute the mouthwash, adding half a cup of water to half a cup of mouthwash. You can use it two weeks in a row and then take a break for a week before you repeat the treatment.

, Drinking lots of water will help to flush food residue and bacteria from your mouth, limiting the development of more plaque. In addition, drinking water will stimulate the production of saliva, which naturally helps to kill bacteria., A gentle gum massage can help to ease pain and reduce inflammation by increasing blood circulation in the gums. Use a gentle, circular motion to massage the the swollen gums for about one minute. Remember to wash your hands before doing this and ensure that your fingernails are clean and clipped short. This will help to prevent the spread of bacteria.


Try buying a gum stimulator if you find it difficult to use your fingers.

, Clove oil is one natural treatment for swollen gums that has been proven effective in decreasing pain and reducing inflammation. Simply apply a little clove oil directly to the swollen gums three times a day using a q-tip. Alternatively, you can place a few drops of the clove oil into a cup of water and swish it around your mouth. Clove oil can be found in most drug stores and health food stores."
"
Brush your teeth two to three times per day.,
Remember to floss daily.,
Ensure that your diet is varied and rich in vitamin C, calcium and folic acid.,
Never gargle with vinegar or lemon juice.,
Get enough sleep and avoid stress.,
Eliminate tobacco.,
Visit your dentist for a teeth cleaning and examination.",How to Reduce Gum Swelling2," Brushing your teeth removes plaque from your mouth, which helps fight against gum disease and tooth decay. In fact, nearly all oral health problems can be prevented with consistent and thorough dental hygiene. You should brush your teeth at least once in the morning and once in the evening, and after meals if possible.


If you are unsure about the correct brushing technique, you should ask your dentist for a quick lesson during your next check-up, they will be happy to oblige.

, Flossing removes the built-up plaque and bacteria from the crevices between teeth, and removing this build-up may prevent your gums from swelling in the first place.


Floss gently, to avoid irritating delicate gum tissue. Always use a clean section of floss when you switch teeth, to prevent spreading bacteria from one part of the mouth to another.
If you find dental floss awkward to use, look for a packet of dental picks at the drugstore — these are small wooden or plastic sticks which can be inserted between the teeth to achieve the same effects as flossing.

, Poor nutrition can lead to gum inflammation (among other issues). In particular, it is important that you get enough vitamin C, calcium and folic acid in your diet. This is due to the fact that vitamin C and folic acid actively contribute to healthy gums and prevent gingivitis, while it has been proven that people who are deficient in calcium are much more likely to develop gum diseases. Take a daily multi-vitamin, and eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables.The top food sources of vitamin C include papaya, bell peppers, strawberries, broccoli, pineapple, Brussels sprouts, kiwifruits, oranges, cantaloupe and kale.
The best sources of calcium include dairy products such as milk, cheese and yogurt, along with sardines, tofu, salmon, soy milk, cereals and collard greens.
Foods with high levels of Folic acid include dark, leafy greens, broccoli, asparagus, peas, beans, lentils, celery, avocado and citrus fruits.

, As acids, vinegar and lemon juice can erode the enamel, which is essential to protect teeth. Rinse your mouth with water.

, Exhaustion may lead to puffiness across your face and in your gums, so try to get seven to nine hours of sleep each night. You should also avoid stress as much as possible, as stress causes the body to release a chemical known as cortisol, which has been linked with inflammation of the gums and other parts of the body.You can reduce stress by exercising regularly. Exercise releases happy hormones which are guaranteed to put you in a good mood. In addition, exercise will tire you out, helping you to get a better sleep at night. It's win-win!
You can also reduce stress and promote relaxation by taking some personal time each day to go for a walk, read a book, or take a bath. You should also avoid over-stimulating yourself before bed, so turn off the television and computer at least an hour before bed.

, As mentioned before, tobacco can be very irritating on gums and people who smoke or use other tobacco products are at increased risk of developing gum disease. If possible, you should try to quit smoking, or at the very least cut back on your tobacco use.

, Swollen gums are often the manifestation of a more severe dental problem like periodontitis caused by plaque, germs and tooth decay, so if your gums are consistently swollen, you should make an appointment with the dentist. Your dentist will be able to tell exactly what's going on in your mouth and recommend the appropriate treatment. Even if your teeth and gums seem completely healthy, it is good practice to make an appointment with your dentist or dental hygienist at least twice a year."

Brush your teeth regularly.,
Floss your teeth at least once per day.,
Gargle with mouthwash without alcohol.,
Remove tonsil stones using a cotton swab.",How to Prevent Tonsil Stones1," Failure to maintain good oral hygiene is a primary cause of tonsil stones. Brushing your teeth in the morning, before bedtime, and after every meal is the foundation of healthy oral hygiene and first step in preventing tonsil stones. This will help eliminate food particles and bacteria that can collect in your tonsils’ nooks and crannies.Remember to brush your tongue as well, since it can harbor easy to miss bacteria, mucus, and food residue.;
, Flossing daily can help prevent tonsil stones by eliminating tartar and plaque buildup. Tonsil stones are similar in composition and structure to the biofilm that forms between your teeth, and both can cause prolonged bad breath.So, if you’re trying to prevent tonsil stones in order to deal with bad breath, it’s important to eliminate that same bio-matter where it forms elsewhere in your mouth.

, Mouthwashes that contain alcohol can lead to dry mouth, which increases the risk for bacteria buildup and tonsil stones. Go with a brand that is alcohol free, and use it at least once a day. Alternatively, gargle with a salt and warm water rinse.Gargling with saltwater can also help ease any discomfort caused by tonsillitis, or infection of the tonsils, which can accompany tonsil stones., If you notice tonsil stones forming, remove them in order to keep from becoming sources of further discomfort, bad breath, or infection. Wet both ends of a cotton swab, and gently massage your tonsils to free up the stones. Gargle afterwards to remove any leftover particles.If you have a low-pressure oral water irrigator, you can use it weekly to wash away any particles that might get caught in your tonsils’ folds.

Brush thoroughly and use proper technique.,
Consider upgrading to an electronic toothbrush.,
Floss daily.,
Rinse with mouthwash regularly.,
Consider using an interdental brush or irrigator.",How to Prevent Gingivitis1," You should brush your teeth at least twice a day, including last thing before going to sleep. For optimal oral health, brush a half hour to an hour after each meal to let saliva remineralize your teeth surfaces. Use circular and vertical motions, covering front and back sides of your teeth for a minimum of two minutes.Make sure to get to the back, hard to reach teeth. These are especially at risk for plaque buildup since they’re primarily used for chewing food and are hard for you to reach with a toothbrush. After brushing, also use floss or an interdental toothbrush to clean the areas in between your teeth.
Don’t consume any food or beverages other than water after you brush before bed.
Make sure to brush using toothpaste that contains fluoride.
Always use a soft-bristled brush to reduce the risk of tooth erosion.;
, If it’s an affordable option, you might want to invest in an electronic brush. They can be effective at removing plaque and reaching into the spaces between your teeth. Plaque growing between teeth is the major cause of gingivitis and other gum diseases.Keep in mind that having an electronic toothbrush is not always the best option. You will still need to use a manual toothbrush to stimulate your gums. If you use good technique with a manual toothbrush, then an electronic toothbrush may not even be necessary.
While high-end electronic toothbrushes can be expensive, you can find more affordable options at your local drugstore.
Whether your brush is mechanical or manual, replace it or the headpiece every three months.

, Many people are pretty good about brushing their teeth, but aren’t so great about getting in between teeth where toothbrushes can’t reach. You should floss your teeth daily, preferably before brushing. Flossing before brushing helps to loosen particles of food and plaque that you can then brush away. Flossing before brushing also allows your teeth to absorb more protective fluoride from your toothpaste.Wrap the ends of a strand of floss 18 to 24 inches long around your middle fingers.
Guide the floss with your thumbs and index fingers, gently sliding it in between each tooth.
Don't snap or yank the strand down to your gums in a rough or aggressive way. Rather, be delicate as you follow the contours of each tooth down to the gum line.
If you rarely or never floss, then keep in mind that your gums may bleed when you floss them for the first time. However, this bleeding will decrease after flossing regularly for a few days or weeks.

, After flossing and brushing, gargle with an anti-microbial or anti-septic mouthwash to rinse any remaining particles and disinfect your mouth.An anti-microbial mouthwash is slightly less harsh, killing bacteria that cause plaque buildup and stopping bad breath. Anti-septic mouthwashes contain more alcohol and kill more microscopic organisms, but can leave your mouth feeling drier because of its higher alcohol content.Dry mouth can actually make bad breath worse, and the higher alcohol content can cause irritation of the mucosa, which can cause a burning sensation.
If you're sensitive or prone to experience dry mouth or irritation, go with a mouthwash that has a lower alcohol content, or none at all.

, Interdental brushes and picks are available at drug- or convenience stores, and are designed to reach in between teeth to loosen up plaque. A water irrigator uses a stream of water to rinse away particles that can get stuck in between teeth or hard to clean areas.Both are helpful in preventing gingivitis, especially if you have sensitivity, braces, or other dental hardware that make flossing difficult. However, they can't replace a cleaning at your dentist’s office where they can remove calculus (a hard deposit of mineralized plaque) from your teeth.

Watch for cavities and fractures.,
Pay attention to your gums.",How to Identify a Tooth Abscess," A toothache is one of the most common symptoms of an abscess. It often occurs as pus produced by bacteria that reached your pulp compresses the nerves in your teeth. You may notice a throbbing pain around the tooth or a shooting or gnawing pain in that area. Biting might be painful. Your tooth pain could cause sleeplessness.The pain may be localized around the tooth, but it can also radiate to the ears, jaws, and cheeks. You may not be able to tell exactly where the pain is coming from. You might also feel irritated after spending a night in pain and struggling to sleep.
The pain may be accompanied by a sense that your tooth is moving.The entire area around the tooth may look red and swollen.
If you have a severe toothache that goes away, do not assume the abscess is gone. It is more likely that the abscess has killed the pulp and the infection remains. The pain may go for a while, especially if you have taken painkillers or an anti-inflammatory medication, but the infection will form an abscess again in no time.;
, An abscess can make chewing painful. Abscesses also can make your teeth sensitive to hot and cold temperatures. If these symptoms last, seek treatment.A pericoronitis abscess is one that can be located near the lower wisdom teeth. This type of abscess can cause your masseter muscles to block (also known as trismus), making it almost impossible to open or close your mouth.

, As an infection grows, it can cause swelling and pain inside your mouth. Your gums may appear red and swollen and feel tender. This symptom is particularly prevalent with periodontal abscesses.Your gum also might swell over the impacted tooth. This could resemble a pimple., If your abscess has ruptured, you will be able to smell or taste the pus.The taste will be bitter but never swallow it.Rinse with chlorhexidine mouthwash or even salt water to get rid of the taste. See your doctor immediately.

, As an abscess worsens, you might suffer a fever. You also could have trouble opening your mouth or swallowing.Swollen glands or a swollen upper or lower jaw can appear. Feeling generally sick is common.If these symptoms appear, see your dentist immediately.

, If you have noticed the above symptoms, see a dentist. He or she will tap your tooth to see if it is sensitive. You likely will receive an x-ray. Then your dentist can know for sure whether you have an abscess.An abscess is a serious problem. You should visit the dentist as soon as possible. A dentist can identify the source of the abscess, prescribe painkillers and antibiotics, and treat the abscess itself (i.e. through draining, root canal, or tooth extraction)., Brush your teeth twice daily. Also, try to floss once daily. If you neglect your teeth, you have a higher risk of developing tooth abscesses., If you constantly eat foods high in sugar (e.g. candy, chocolate), you can increase your risk for cavities. Cavities can lead eventually to abscesses.Some sugary foods are fine but eat them in moderation. If possible, brush afterwards.

, If you have an untreated cavity or a tooth fracture that reaches the dental pulp (inner part of your tooth), you risk developing an abscess. This happens when bacteria reaches your dental pulp, which is the inside of your tooth.See a dentist as soon as possible, and watch for any symptoms.


Cavities and trauma typically lead to a “periapical abscess.”, An injury to the gums can cause an abscess. Gum disease causes the space between the tooth and the gum to widen, which allows bacteria to enter. This bacteria can cause an abscess, even if the teeth are healthy and cavity-free. If you have any issues with your gums, watch for symptoms of an abscess.


Gum injuries and gum disease typically lead to a particular kind of infection known as a “gingival abscess” (or “gum abscess”). If the infection extends to the gum pockets, and the draining of pus is blocked by the swallowed gum, it is then called a “periodontal abscess.”"
"
Monitor any toothache that you feel.,
Pay attention to dental sensitivity.,
Watch for pain while eating.",How to Know if You Have an Infected Tooth1," An infected tooth can cause mild to severe pain in that area, depending on how infected the tooth is. The pain is generally continuous and sharp.Some dentists describe it as a shooting, throbbing, or gnawing type of pain. This pain will radiate upwards and downwards along the side of your face to places like your ear, jaw or head.Your dentist will tap your teeth with a dental probe. If you have an abscess, you will feel pain when the infected tooth is tapped — what the Merck Manual describes as “exquisite” sensitivity.— or when you bite down.
Keep in mind that if your infection is severe, you will most likely be unable to pinpoint the exact tooth causing the pain because the whole area around the tooth will also feel painful. Your dentist will need to take x-rays to identify which tooth is infected.
If the infection destroys the pulp at the root of the tooth — the ""heart"" of the tooth — the pain may stop because your tooth has died; however, this does not mean that the infection will stop. It will continue to spread and destroy other tissue and bone.;
, Some amount of sensitivity to hot and cold is normal in teeth. This is caused by small holes in the enamel called “caries” and often doesn’t require special treatment;however, an infected tooth becomes very sensitive to hot and cold substances. For instance, you will most likely experience severe pain if you eat a hot bowl of soup — a shooting pain that lingers after you have stopped eating.Aside from hot and cold, you might also experience pain when you eat sweet products, as the sugar can irritate the infected tooth and create pain.All of these repeated sensations may affect the pulp and inflame the entire system of vessels and nerves. In most cases this damage is irreversible and you will need to have a root canal.

, Chewing may also be painful when you have an abscessed tooth, particularly with solid foods. Biting or chewing applies pressure to your tooth and jaw and can cause pain. This pain may linger even after you stop eating.Keep in mind that there can be other causes of pain in the teeth or jaw while chewing. It does not always mean that you have a tooth infection. For example, sometimes people internalize stress and clench their jaw muscles, which can lead to very similar kinds of pain. This is a “Temporomandibular joint and muscle disorder.”Some people also grind or clench their teeth when they sleep, which is known as bruxism.
Sinus or ear infections may also cause discomfort like a toothache, but these usually feature a headache. One symptom of heart disease, as well, is tooth and jaw pain. No matter what it turns out to be, you should take the pain seriously and see a dentist."
"
Know that cavities are holes in your teeth.,
Remember that a cavity is permanent damage.,
Manage underlying causes.",How to Know if You Have a Cavity1," These can be visible, but they may not be. These holes in your teeth are caused by tooth decay. Untreated, they can cause a great deal as pain as well as damage to your teeth, bones, gums, and even make you very ill. If they become infected, you will need to seek medical attention to prevent abscesses and the spread of infection., While there are ways to treat cavities, there is not a way to restore the natural tooth substance. A dentist can drill out the damaged areas and fill them with a safe material. You won't get that part of your tooth back., Poor oral hygiene, poor diet, and bad habits such as smoking can all contribute to tooth decay. By limiting or eliminating these problems, you can help to reduce tooth decay. This will help to prevent cavities, as well as promote good oral health overall."
"
Drink plenty of water.,
Eat a healthy, balanced diet.,
Improve your nasal health.",How to Prevent Tonsil Stones2," Ensure you drink the recommended amount of water, which is about 13 cups per day for men and 9 cups for women.Drink plenty of fluids throughout the day in order to help rinse away bacteria and prevent dry mouth. Both can contribute to the formation of tonsil stones.


Swap out sodas, sports drinks, energy drinks, and fruit juices for water, since sugar can increase bacteria buildup.
Alcohol dehydrates and causes dry mouth, so limit your alcohol consumption and be sure to brush well after to drinking, especially if you have recurring tonsil stones.

, Consider limiting your sugar and dairy intake. Consuming too many sugary foods increases tartar, plaque, and bacteria buildup. Dairy products also promote oral bacterial growth, so make sure to give your teeth a good brush after drinking milk or consuming other dairy.

, Nasal allergies, head colds, and post-nasal drips can cause mucus to accumulate in the back of your throat. Mucus increases your exposure to oral bacteria, and contributes to the development of tonsil stones. If you frequently experience problems with nasal allergies, try reducing your exposure to pollen by closing windows and spending more time indoors during allergy season, and keep the air moist in your home using a humidifier."
"
Visit your dentist at least once per year.,
Visit an allergist or your doctor about persistent nasal problems.,
Consult with your healthcare provider about undergoing tonsillectomy.",How to Prevent Tonsil Stones3," A routine checkup and cleaning from your dentist is a key part of good oral hygiene. Professionally cleaning your teeth and gums, removing tartar and plaque buildup, and treating periodontal or gum disease will help cut down the risk of tonsil stones. Further, you can check in with your dentist if stones are a recurring problem and at-home options haven’t worked.Depending on your oral health, you may need to visit your dentist more frequently than every 12 months. They may recommend coming twice a year or more.

, If you have difficulty managing allergies on your own or frequently get sick, work with your healthcare provider. Your physician may prescribe medications that can help you better manage problems with mucus, nasal allergies, and frequent infections.You can also get an allergy test in order to determine what specific allergens to avoid.

, Some tonsils are more prone to developing stones due to their shape and position. If stones and tonsillitis are recurring problems that interfere with daily life, you might have to consider tonsillectomy, or the surgical removal of your tonsils. Your physician or dentist can perform an examination and determine whether tonsillectomy will help prevent the development of tonsil stones based on the status of your oral health.It is believed that tonsils are part of the immune system since they are made up of special cells that prevent and fight infections. It is believed by some that removing them may impair your immune system, though research does not support this."
"
Limit sugary or acidic food and beverages.,
Stop using tobacco products.,
Maintain your overall health.",How to Prevent Gingivitis2," It’s not necessarily the amount of sugary or acidic items you consume that’s a cause for concern. Rather, you should limit the frequency, or how often you consume them. Exposing your teeth to items like sticky candies, soda, fruit juices, or alcohol weakens them for up to an hour. You’ll want to limit the number of times a day your teeth come into contact with them.Eat some raw fruits, vegetables or other alkaline products to reduce the acidic environment created by sugar.
Limit consumption of high sugar or acidic food and drinks to meal times.
Wait to brush your teeth up to an hour after eating, since they’re slightly weakened after a meal.

, Smoking irritates gums and encourages plaque buildup. Both of these contribute to bad oral health and gum disease exposing the gums to germs and reducing the flow of saliva. Chewing tobacco similarly increases the risk of periodontal, or gum, diseases like gingivitis. If you use tobacco, ask your doctor or dentist for resources to help you quit., There is evidence that gum diseases are somehow connected to other health problems, such as diabetes and heart disease. There’s only evidence of correlation, that there’s some relationship between diseases, but nothing that proves one causes the other. Still, the correlation shows that eating a well-balanced diet, exercising, maintaining proper oral hygiene, and getting recommended amounts of sleep are all related.People concerned with overall health are often more likely to take better care of their teeth and gums.

See a dentist for regular checkups and cleanings.,
Know if you’re at a higher risk for gum diseases and tooth decay.,
Review brushing and flossing techniques with your dentist.,
Make a dentist appointment if you suspect gingivitis.",How to Prevent Gingivitis3," You should see a dentist every six months to a year for best oral health. A dentist can remove plaque and tarter from parts of your teeth and gums you’re likely to miss. Since these are the main causes of gum diseases, regular dentist appointments are key to preventing gingivitis.Your dentist will also polish your teeth in a professional way to help prevent bacteria and plaque from taking hold.

, Some people are at a higher risk for gum diseases. High risk factors include braces, dentures or partial dentures, misaligned teeth, or other oral features that give plaque a foothold or create crevices that are hard to clean. If you fall into any of these categories, you might need to see your dentist for more frequent professional cleanings.Pregnant women have more sensitive gums due to hormonal changes and immune system variations and are at higher risk of developing gingivitis.Using a water irrigator can be especially helpful if you have braces or other dental work that’s hard to clean using a brush or floss.

, When you go to the dentist’s office, show them how you brush and floss your teeth. Your dentist or dental hygienist can give you pointers and correct any improper techniques. They can also use a special dye to make plaque visible. Once you have an idea of where and how plaque grows, you’ll be better prepared to keep it in control and prevent gum diseases., When brushing and flossing, look for symptoms of gingivitis. Mild inflammation of the gums, red or swollen gums, gums that bleed easily, are all signs of gingivitis. If you notice any of these, see a dentist as soon as you can."

Look for swelling or discharge of pus.,
Note any tooth discoloration.,
Check for swollen neck glands.,
Beware of fever.",How to Know if You Have an Infected Tooth2," Check to see if the gums around your tooth have become red, swollen, and sensitive. You may notice a gum boil, a pimple-like formation on the gum near the infected tooth and up to the root. You may also be able to see white pus in the sore or around the tooth — the pus is actually what causes the pain because it puts pressure on your tooth and gums. When the pus begins to drain, your pain will subside some.Bad breath or a foul taste in your mouth is another give away. This is directly related to the build-up of pus. If your tooth is severely infected, pus may begin to drain from the tooth or from a gum-boil into your mouth. It may happen suddenly, in a rupture of the abscess, and it will taste metallic or sour. It will also smell bad. Avoid swallowing the pus., An infected tooth can change in color from a yellow to a dark brown or grey color. This change is caused by the death of the pulp inside of your tooth, namely a “bruising” from dying blood cells.The dead pulp will emit toxic products, like anything that decays, that will reach up to the surface of your tooth through the porous passageways in your tooth., A tooth infection may well spread to adjoining areas of the body, especially if you have let it go untreated. For example, the infection can affect your jaw, sinuses, or the lymph glands under your jaw or in your neck. These latter may swell, feel tender, or be too painful to touch.While any tooth abscess is serious and needs treatment, please seek medical attention immediately if you have an infection that spreads. Because it is close to vital organs — notably your brain — such an infection can easily become life-threatening., Your body can react to an infection by raising your internal body temperature, causing you to run a fever. Normal body temperature can range from 97 to 99°F (36.1 to 37.2°C). A fever is usually a reading over 100.4°F (38°C).Along with fever, you may also develop chills, headache, or a feeling of nausea. You may feel weak and become dehydrated, so be sure to drink water.
Seek medical attention if your fever continues to rise or does not respond to medication, or if you run a temperature of over 103°F (39.4°C) for several days."

Know that cavities may or may not have clear symptoms.,
Note pain.,
Look at your teeth.",How to Know if You Have a Cavity2," There are not always obvious external signs that someone has a cavity.Because of this, a dentist may be the first person to notice. Because cavities can lead to further damage, it is import to see a dentist regularly to prevent cavities from going unnoticed.


Go for a dental check up every six months and allow your dentist to see any changes. Some patients may have a mineralization defect of the enamel which allows cavities to form faster.

, This could be a sign you have a cavity. Toothaches; tooth sensitivity; mild to sharp pain when eating or drinking something sweet, hot, or cold; pain when you bite down — all these may be a the sign of a cavity.If you are experiencing these things consistently, you should seek an oral health care professional.

, Visible holes or pits in your teeth, brown, black or white staining on any surface of a tooth can all be indications of a cavity;however, because everyone's mouth is different, it can be difficult to know. A dentist and other oral doctors are the people who are properly qualified to diagnose the problem and identify the stage of cavity development. If you think you see a cavity, you should get it checked out.

"
"
Find a dentist.,
Tell your dentist about the problem area.,
Get your teeth probed.,
Have an x-ray taken.",How to Know if You Have a Cavity3," Talk to people you trust or go online to find a good dentist. Referrals from friends or families will ensure you can trust your experience. Because you are not likely to be qualified to determine if you indeed have a cavity, you will need a dentist to do this. Make sure you get it checked out so as to avoid more damage to your teeth.

, This will help them to focus on those spots. If the cause of your worry or discomfort is not a cavity, the dentist may still be able to help. Try to be as specific as you can be and explain when and how you feel the pain. Let your dentist know if your feel sharp pain while they are examining your teeth.

, This physical probing of your teeth will enable the dentist to tell if you have a cavity. They will poke and prod in different locations to test the strength and damage at any spot. Make sure your dentist does a thorough examination on any tooth that gives you problems. This may reveal cavities or other issues., When cavities form between your teeth, it is not always easy to tell they are there. In these situations, a dentist cannot probe with a dental tool. They will not fit between your teeth. In this case, a dentist can take an x-ray to reveal the presence of any cavities.If you feel that you have a cavity, you may wish to have your dentist take an x-ray to find out the extent of the damage.

Apply first-aid to an injury.,
Gargle with salt water.,
Apply a cold compress.,
Try oil pulling.,
Chew a piece of gum.,
Quit smoking.",How to Home Treat a Toothache or Any Minor Mouth Infection1," Injuries to the jaw can result in the loss or damage of teeth, which may lead to severe toothache. If you or someone you know has experienced an injury such as a fractured or dislocated jaw, you should call 911 or seek medical care immediately. Temporarily bandaging the jaw around the top of the head or holding it gently in place with your hands until you get medical care is recommended. Do not attempt to correct the position of the jaw yourself. Signs of a broken or dislocated jaw after sustaining injury include:Jaw tenderness or pain, worse with biting or chewing
Loose or damaged teeth
Teeth that do not line up properly
Facial swelling or bruising
Difficulty moving the mouth or jaw
Emergency symptoms (e.g., difficulty breathing or heavy bleeding from the mouth);
, The salt helps to reduce swelling and inflammation and also fight off infection-causing bacteria. Dissolve one teaspoon of salt in one cup of warm water. Rinse your mouth repeatedly and swish the salty water around your mouth for a few minutes.The pain from your toothache may instantly subside or take a few minutes to reduce itself.

, If your toothache is caused by injury to the teeth or jaw, or if you experience inflammation in your gums, apply an ice pack or a cool water bottle to the outside of your cheek for 5 to 10 minutes. If you do not have an ice pack, you can also wet a cloth in cold water, strain the water and hold it up to your cheek to help reduce inflammation and pain.Apply the ice pack or cold compress only on the outer side of your mouth; do not put it on the tooth or pain will increase.
If you experience bleeding gums, rinse your mouth with warm water before applying a cold compress.
If bleeding persists from the gums or teeth, immediately see your dentist or healthcare provider.
Although a cold compress helps reduce inflammation, consuming cold foods or beverages can increase tooth pain and sensitivity, and therefore should be avoided until the toothache goes away.

, Oil pulling involves swishing around oil in your mouth to remove harmful germs and bacteria. At least one study has shown it can reduce the amount of some bacteria found in your mouth.It may reduce the likelihood of infection and may ease (though not resolve) tooth pain caused by bacteria.


Take a tablespoon of oil and swish it in your mouth (like you would a mouthwash) for one minute to experience the benefits. If you can, try to swish the oil longer for 15 to 20 minutes. Do this procedure on an empty stomach to ensure that the oil absorbs and detoxifies as much bacteria as possible. After you're done swishing, spit the oil out (in the trash, not in a sink or anywhere you could clog the plumbing) and wash out your mouth with lukewarm water.
If you have gum disease, be aware that the oil will not penetrate deep enough to cure the infection. You need to see a dentist or periodontist.
Oil pulling should not replace your regular brushing and flossing.
Coconut oil is the most popular because it has a pleasing taste and contains antioxidants and vitamins, like vitamin E. Sesame oil and olive oil are good alternatives as well.

, Studies show that chewing sugar-free gum for 20 minutes a day following meals can help prevent tooth decay, which leads to toothaches. Chewing gum neutralizes acids produced by bacteria, strengthens tooth enamel and jaw muscles, and provides disease-fighting substances throughout the mouth. Sugary gum should be avoided as it increases plaque-causing bacteria and may cause cavities.Don’t let chewing gum replace brushing and flossing, as they are the most important steps of your oral care routine.

, Cigarettes and chewing tobacco are harmful to your oral health as they can cause and aggravate gum disease, oral cancer, and slow healing after a tooth extraction or surgery or during a toothache. They can also reduce your sense of taste and smell, weaken tooth enamel and stain teeth.


Smoking is also responsible for lung, heart and various other health problems. Talk to your doctor to make a treatment plan that can help you quit smoking.

Maintain a good oral care regimen.,
Conduct oral self-examinations to check for any pre-cancer indicators.,
Visit your dentist regularly to get a professional opinion.",How to Prevent Mouth Cancer1," Maintaining a good oral care routine helps to reduce the risk of mouth cancer by preventing infections and other oral diseases. Brushing your teeth, flossing, and rinsing with mouthwash all contribute to an effective oral care routine.


Repeated and long-term gum disease, poor oral hygiene, and missing teeth can lead to infections that put your mouth under high risk of cancer.
Make sure you don’t have ill-fitting dentures or sharp, broken teeth that can cause repeated mouth irritation and increase your risk of mouth cancer.

If you feel like your dentures get dislodged every time you speak or chew, it means that they do not fit well and have to be relined or replaced.
Denture adhesives containing zinc can be toxic to the cells lining the mouth, and should be avoided.

;
, Irritation of tissues inside your mouth caused by dental trauma is one of the factors possibly associated with mouth cancer. You can check inside your own mouth using a hand mirror to look for any abnormalities that could be indicators of pre-cancer or cancer. Catching cancer early is one of the best ways to ensure you can treat it before real damage occurs.


Check all the areas of your mouth, such as your gums, tongue (back and sides), lips, the insides of your cheeks, the roof of your mouth, and under your tongue.
If you see any color changes, like white, red, or grey patches, you should visit your dentist for a check-up, as it may indicate a pre cancerous condition.
Also, check for lumps, bumps, painful areas in your mouth.
If you have an ulcer that is not healing, or if you have repeated ulcers in the same area, then visit your dentist immediately to get your mouth examined.
Conducting a self-examination at least once a month for a few minutes is a good precaution to take against mouth cancer.

, Even better than giving yourself a self-examination, is allowing a dental professional to examine the state of your mouth. Dentists have been trained extensively in many varieties of mouth disease. Your dentist will be able to quickly and confidently assess the state of your oral health, and warn you if mouth cancer has developed or could develop.


It is important to visit your dentist every 6 months for a complete oral checkup.
You can also ask for an oral-cancer screening test if you are under high risk for cancer (for example, due to regular tobacco use).
Your dentist will check the entire mouth and he/she will identify the precancerous changes in your mouth at early stage.
These dental check ups are really important to reduce cancer risks, especially in tobacco and alcohol users.
If pre-cancerous growths (Leukoplakia or Erythroplakia) are identified, your dentist or oral surgeon will remove the abnormal growth areas.
If you have Erythroplakia or Leukoplakia, your doctors will provide you with medication to lower the risk of cancer. This is called “chemoprevention”.

Some drugs tested for chemoprevention are (NSAIDs) – Sulindac and Celecoxib).
Extracts of black raspberries, a protein from soybean has also been tested for chemoprevention.

Rinse your mouth with a salt water solution.,
Apply Milk of Magnesia.,
Limit your intake of acidic or spicy foods.,
Numb the sore naturally.,
Take care when brushing your teeth.",How to Home Treat a Toothache or Any Minor Mouth Infection2," Dissolve one teaspoon of salt water in 1/2 cup of warm water and swish around your mouth for a minute.You can also use baking soda for a similar effect. Dissolve the same amount of baking soda as you would salt in a cup of warm water. Yet another option would be to mix a 1/2 teaspoon with a few drops of water to make a paste that you then apply directly to the sore for pain relief. All of these methods can be used as often as you need.
Note that the salt water rinse may sting when you do it.

, Milk of Magnesia is a liquid suspension of magnesium hydroxide and can help reduce the pain of your canker sore and speed up the healing process. Apply a small amount (enough to cover the sore) of milk of magnesia on your canker sore a few times a day.Alternatively, apply the milk of magnesia after applying a half hydrogen peroxide and half water solution directly to the sore. Hydrogen peroxide works as an antiseptic and can reduce the amount of bacteria in your mouth.

, Citrus fruits, tomatoes, coffee, chilies, hot sauce, and anything else abrasive can exacerbate the pain of your canker sore., Eating or drinking something very cold is a great way to numb your mouth and provide temporary relief. Smoothies, ice cream, and milkshakes are all good options.You can also directly apply ice to your canker sores by allowing ice chips/cubes to slowly dissolve over the sores. Just be careful not to choke.

, Make sure to use a soft brush that won't irritate your canker sore as well as toothpaste that doesn't foam, such as Biotene or Sensodyne ProNamel.Take your time and go gently over your teeth to avoid aggravating of your canker.

Use a tartar-control toothpaste.,
Observe proper oral hygiene.,
Avoid drugs and smoking.",How to Home Treat a Toothache or Any Minor Mouth Infection3," If your gums are slightly swollen and red or feel tender to the touch, try using a tartar-control toothpaste with fluoride in it. Tartar is hardened plaque on your teeth that can get into the gum line and cause gum disease.You should also use a mouthwash with fluoride and antimicrobial agents, which can help to reduce tiny lesions on the teeth (which increase the likelihood of tooth decay) and fight the bacteria in plaque that causes gum damage.

, Always brush after meals and snacks and floss every evening before bed. Mild gum disease is reversible with proper oral hygiene, so it's key that you make a concerted effort in this regard if you want to avoid developing the more severe periodontitis. If you're not sure if you're doing a thorough enough job of brushing your teeth, ask your dentist or dental hygienist for a lesson. Make sure as well to get regular checkups and teeth cleanings.If for whatever reason, you can't brush your teeth after you've eaten, try chewing a stick of sugar-free gum or using a toothpick to clean out any remaining food particles.
Another good option is to rinse your mouth out with warm salt water. Mix one teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water and then swish it around mouth. Don't swallow the solution; spit it out once you're done rinsing.

, Illegal drugs, like methamphetamines, can cause problems with your gums if you use them for a prolonged period of time. In addition, smoking tobacco is significantly associated with gum problems and reduces your body's ability to fight gum infections and slows the healing process."

Picking the right toothbrush.,
Brush your teeth twice a day.,
Use an appropriate toothpaste.,
Choose the right floss.,
Floss your teeth regularly.,
Use a mouthwash.,
Visit your dentist regularly.",How to Home Treat a Toothache or Any Minor Mouth Infection4," Following a proper oral care routine helps prevent toothaches by removing bacteria and plaque that cause damage and decay to your teeth. Both manual and electric powered toothbrushes can effectively clean teeth. People who have difficulty using a manual toothbrush may find electrical toothbrushes easier to use. Your dentist can help you decide which type is best suited to your needs.A soft bristled toothbrush is best for people with sensitive teeth and gums.
Make sure to replace your toothbrush every three to four months.
Do not share your toothbrush with anyone as this can spread germs and disease-causing bacteria into your mouth.
Wash your toothbrush before and after every use to keep bacteria from accumulating on the bristles.

, Brushing your teeth is the most important part of your dental care routine. For a healthy mouth and smile, experts recommend that you brush your teeth twice a day for two with a soft-bristled toothbrush. The proper brushing technique is to:Place your toothbrush at a 45 degree angle to the gums.
Gently move the brush back and forth in short, tooth-wide strokes. Brush the outer surfaces, inner surfaces and chewing surfaces of the teeth.
To clean the inside surfaces of the front teeth, tilt the brush vertically and make several up-and-down strokes.
Brush your tongue to remove bacteria and keep your breath fresh.

, If you suspect that your toothache may be due to tooth sensitivity, try using a toothpaste specifically designed for sensitive teeth, such as the brand Sensodyne.Use this toothpaste in place of your other and see if you notice a difference after a week or so of use. Alternatively, you could rub a small amount of the toothpaste directly on the aching or sensitive area with your finger two to three times daily.

, Flossing is one the most important steps in your dental care routine besides brushing. Originally, floss was made from silk fibers which are quite expensive. Nowadays, commercial floss is made from synthetic nylon or plastic filaments and is often treated with flavoring agents, such as mint or lemon, artificial sweeteners and sugar alcohols, such as xylitol and mannitol, to make flossing more pleasant. They may also be waxed with beeswax or plant-based wax for ease of use, however there is no difference in the effectiveness of waxed or unwaxed floss.


Organic flosses made from silk are still available online and in certain drugstores for people who want to avoid artificial sweeteners, plastic filaments or fluoride, but these may cost more than regular floss. Both organic and vegan flosses are packaged in plastic containers by requirement of the FDA (Food and Drug Administration).
Never use string or any other fabric to floss your teeth, as you can severely damage your teeth and gum tissue. Only dental flosses that are approved by the ADA (American Dental Association) have been tested for safety and effectiveness.

, Flossing at least once a day helps remove plaque and food debris from between your teeth which can cause tooth pain. Children should start flossing as soon as they have two or more teeth. However, since most children younger than 10 or 11 years are not able to floss properly, they should be supervised by an adult. Keep in mind that flossing may cause some discomfort at first but should not be painful either. If you floss too hard, you can damage the tissue between your teeth. With daily flossing and brushing, the discomfort should ease within a week or two. If your pain persists, talk to your dentist. The proper steps to flossing your teeth are:Using about 18 inches of floss, wrap the majority of it around one your middle fingers.
Wrap the little bit of floss left around the same finger on your other hand. This is basically setting up that finger to wind up the used floss as it becomes dirty. Wind the remaining floss around the same finger of the opposite hand. This finger will take up the floss as it becomes dirty.
While holding the string of floss between your thumbs and forefingers, use a gentle motion to push the floss between your teeth. Rather than push it straight up into the gum, try moving it back and forth as you inch your way up between the teeth (like a see-saw motion).
Once the floss is at the gum line, curve it against a tooth so it reaches all sides of the tooth's gum line. Then bring the floss into the space between the gum and the tooth and start moving the floss away from the gum in and up-and-down-motion (again think of a see-saw but this way going vertically, rather than horizontally).
Repeat with the rest of your teeth. Throw the used floss away as it no longer has any use.

, For your daily oral care routine, swish 1 fluid ounce of mouthwash in your mouth after brushing and having meals for two to three minutes, then spit out. Ask your dentist or hygienist to recommend the mouthwash that is best suited to your individual needs.A cup of lukewarm, distilled water (meaning water that has been boiled) is an effective homemade mouthwash for people with sensitive teeth and gums to help kill bacteria and wash away food debris.
To avoid alcohol, which can increase tooth and gum sensitivity, read ingredient labels carefully as many over-the-counter mouth rinses contain high amounts of alcohol and use it as the main ingredient.
When buying from a store, check the ingredient list to avoid sodium lauryl sulfate, an artificial detergent that can cause sensitivity, tooth pain and mouth ulcers. Instead, choose a mouthwash with a natural emulsifier like vegetable oils, sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), or sodium chloride (salt). Plant extracts such as peppermint, sage, cinnamon and lemon can also help freshen your breath.

, There is no single recommendation about how often you should visit your dentist. Some people only need to visit once or twice a year for a standard checkup and cleaning while others may be encouraged to visit more frequently.Though many people don't like to go to the dentist and in fact 100 million Americans don't even visit a dentist every year, routine dental examinations can help prevent most dental problems and diseases.

Ask your doctor about medication.,
Get a dental X-ray.,
Check for signs of gingivitis.,
Get medical care for severe tooth pain.",How to Home Treat a Toothache or Any Minor Mouth Infection5," An over-the-counter pain killer such as aspirin, ibuprofen or antiseptic gel can be used to help numb toothaches caused by injury, decay or abscesses. It may take up to half an hour or more for the beneficial effects to be noticed. However, you should ask your doctor about potential side-effects that may be associated with the medication or any interactions it may have with herbs, foods or other medicines you may be using.Do not take painkillers on an empty stomach as this can cause stomach acid reflux.
Avoid placing aspirin or another painkiller directly against your gum as it can damage gum tissue.
Follow the manufacturer's guidelines and do not exceed the stated doses for each (usually one tablet every four hours).
Ask your dentist or doctor if your medicine contains benzocaine. Benzocaine has been linked to a rare and serious condition called methemoglobinemia, which decreases the amount of oxygen carried by the blood. If absolutely necessary, use benzocaine only as prescribed. Never use more than the recommended dose and avoid giving it to children and people with a heart or lung condition., If you frequently experience toothaches or bleeding gums, an X-ray can help your dentist understand the cause better. A dental X-ray can help your dentist detect any signs of damage or disease in your teeth that may not be visible during a regular check-up.


If you are a new patient in a dental office, your dentist may recommend getting an X-ray to determine the current status of your oral health.
Additional X-rays may be needed every few years to help your dentist detect any cavities, analyze your gum health or evaluate the growth and development of your teeth.
Tell your dentist if you are pregnant so that you can use a special apron that protects you and your child from any radiation exposure.

, Gingivitis is a form of periodontal disease, which can cause inflammation and infection of gums and tooth sockets, along with tooth decay and toothaches. It is a result of long-term plaque deposits on your teeth caused by poor dental hygiene, misaligned teeth, and ill-fitting or unclean mouth appliances, such as braces.Pregnancy, uncontrolled diabetes, and the use of certain medications may increase your risk of gingivitis.
Symptoms of gingivitis include bleeding gums (such as blood on toothbrush even when gently brushing teeth), bright red or red-purple appearance to gums, gums that are tender when touched but otherwise painless, mouth sores, swollen gums, plaque and tartar that can been seen at the base of the teeth.
If you suspect gingivitis, schedule a checkup with your dentist as soon as possible.

, See your dentist immediately if you experience any of the following with a toothache:Trouble breathing or swallowing
Fever
Pain that persists for a day or two
Signs and symptoms of infection, such as swelling, pain when you close or open your mouth, red gums, or a foul-tasting discharge.
A sinus or ear infection can also be felt as pain in the teeth. Discharge from the ears or nose may be signs of an infection.

Protect yourself from excessive sun exposure.,
Eat cancer-preventing foods and avoid foods that are linked to cancer.,
Stop using tobacco products to lower your risk of cancer.,
Limit your alcohol intake to avoid damage to mouth tissues.,
Avoid contracting human papilloma virus (HPV).",How to Prevent Mouth Cancer2," Exposure to the sun's ultraviolet rays increases the risk of various kinds of cancer, including cancer of the lips. Avoiding excessive sun can lower your risk of lip cancer, a cancer that can spread to other parts of the mouth.


If you want to spend time in the sun, be sure to use broad-spectrum lip balm and sunscreen.
Avoid going out in the sun during peak hours, usually between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.
The lower lips are more commonly affected than the upper lips, due to their higher degree of exposure to the sun.
Consider using a broad hat, which provides shade to your face and lips.

, The foods in your daily diet play an important role in fighting cancer-causing agents in your body. Incorporate plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables in your diet, while avoiding preservatives and processed foods. This type of diet will minimize your chances of developing mouth cancer.


Include lots of dark green leafy vegetables, beans, berries, tomatoes, garlic, cabbage, broccoli, soy, green tea, citrus fruits, fish, poultry, and olive oil in your diet.
Eat at least 2½ cups of vegetable and fruits daily.
Choose whole grain breads and pastas over the white versions of these foods.
It is better to prepare foods by baking, boiling, or steaming, rather than grilling and deep-frying.

Residue and char from grilling can be carcinogenic.


Do not add artificial food flavors, instead add natural spices and curry powder for flavor.
Try to avoid red meat and processed meats.

, Tobacco is one of the leading causes of mouth cancer. Tobacco products, including all forms of smoking and chewing tobacco, bring the cells in your mouth in contact with cancer causing chemicals. Abstaining from tobacco will cut down sharply on the amount of carcinogens that your mouth is exposed to.


There is a variety of cancer causing chemicals in most tobacco products, such as: stearic acid, nicotine, ammonia, butane, toluene and methane.
If you are not currently using tobacco, then continue your abstinence for a healthy mouth.
Avoid social and recreational situations where you will be exposed to or reminded of smoking.
When you stop using tobacco, the risk for mouth cancer also decreases as your cells repair themselves.
In order to quit, seek the help of trained advisers or support groups.
Keep quitting aides, such as nicotine gum and patches, in mind to help you quit.

, If you enjoy drinking alcohol, drink only a moderate quantity. Although alcohol's cancerous properties are not fully understood, it has been linked to a variety of cancers.


Limit yourself to two drinks for a man and one drink for a woman, per drinking session.
Hard liquors and beer are especially noted for increasing your risk of mouth cancer.
Excessive alcohol use irritates the cells in your mouth and elevates the risk of cancer.
Alcohol and smoking work in synergy because their toxins inflict repeated damage to cells inside the mouth.

, Human papilloma virus can increase the risk of mouth cancer. It is commonly transmitted through kissing, sharing drinks, and some kinds of sexual activity. Many people carry the virus with them unknowingly, so try to avoid contracting HPV by taking extra precautions when choosing sexual partners.


HPV is common in smokers, because the smoke damages the cells lining the mouth and weakens the immune system.
HPV vaccination may reduce the risk of contracting this infection but is not completely effective.

This vaccination is only effective if you receive it before getting infected with HPV.
Therefore, getting vaccinated early in life may reduce the risk of HPV infection.

See your physician if canker sores are a recurring problem for you.,
Get treated for any underlying conditions.,
Ask your doctor about silver nitrate.,
Talk to your doctor about Debacterol.,
Ask your dentist about getting some dental wax to minimize irritation.,
See if viscous lidocaine is an option.",How to Relieve Canker Sore Pain1," If you have had canker sores more than once in the last six months, you should see your physician. If your child has a canker sore, talk to your physician before using any home remedies. Most home remedies are considered safe for children over two years of age, but it is always best to speak to your physician first. You should also see your physician if you have:A large canker sore
A fever associated with the canker sore
Difficulty swallowing
Sores that are spreading
Sores that last more than three weeks
Sores that are still painful after using home remedies;
, Canker sores may be the result of an underlying condition, which will also require treatment. For example, if you have Crohn’s disease and have recurrent canker sores, then you would need to have treatment for the Crohn’s disease as well as for the canker sore.


Other conditions that can lead to canker sores include celiac disease and Behcet's disease.Canker sores are not contagious, but make eating and chewing more difficult.

, Treatment with silver nitrate solution, which will cauterize the canker sore, can relieve the pain of a canker sore within a few hours. Silver nitrate should only be applied by trained medical personnel, because it needs to be applied directly to the sore. Silver nitrate can leave a “burnt” taste in your mouth. It may also cause skin irritation, staining of the skin, and chemical burns.Silver nitrate hasn’t been shown to speed healing, but has helped out with the resulting pain.

, Another medication that can be used for canker sore pain is Debacterol. This medication can produce rapid relief from canker sore pain. This medicine should also be applied by a trained doctor or dentist.Debacterol is available by prescription only.
Similar to silver nitrate, Debacterol chemically cauterizes the canker sore. It can speed up healing to about a week., Some dental work, such as braces, may irritate a canker sore. If you have dental work that may be irritating the canker sore, ask your dentist for some dental wax to cover the dental work and minimize the irritation., Viscous lidocaine can be applied directly to the canker sore for pain relief. Lidocaine is an anesthetic, which means that it will numb the pain. Keep in mind that lidocaine should not be swallowed or used more than four times per day."

Use herbs to help prevent cavities.",How to Heal Dental Cavities Naturally," If you have or suspect you have a cavity (e.g., you are experiencing toothache, tooth sensitivity, pain when eating or drinking, or stains), you should see a dental professional right away. The dental profession has a number of efficient ways to stop tooth decay and support the health of your teeth. Fillings are the most common form of treatment and involves removing the decayed part of the tooth and ""filling"" the region with composite resin, porcelain or other materials.Evidence in favor of natural treatments is extremely limited and dated. In fact, the one study that does suggest that a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, meat, milk, and vitamin D dates back to 1932!It's best to get the care you need as soon as possible. The earlier you get the cavity treated by a dental professional, the better the chances of preventing the progression of the cavity. Moreover, if a cavity is treated before you even experience any pain, you likely won't need more advanced - and costlier - treatments, like a root canal.;
, Instead, get plenty of sunshine (though you can't wear sunscreen to metabolize vitamin D so limit your time to a maximum of 15-30 minutes a session). During the winter months, when sun exposure may be less available to you, you can also take vitamin D supplements., Vitamin K2 is a naturally occurring compound similar to vitamin K that is integral in the development of facial bones, including the teeth. As it is generally lacking in modern diets, making a concerted effort to increase your intake may help heal your cavities naturally. Vitamin K2 is typically found in fermented foods and animal products such as:Animal (especially crab and lobster) innards
Skate liver oil
Bone marrow

, Some studies suggest that cavities occur in part due to a lack of fatty vitamins (vitamins A, D, and K) in modern diets.The fact that this fish oil is fermented, rather than distilled, means that it is still chock-full of vitamins D and A, both integral to the remineralization of your teeth.


If you can't get or don't want to try fermented cod liver oil, you can add more vitamin A to your diet by eating large amounts of chicken liver or goat cheese, or drinking whole milk. Keep in mind that it will take 2 ounces of liver, 17 ounces of goat cheese, and two gallons of milk to equal just one teaspoon of fermented cod liver oil.Likewise, you can add more vitamin D to your diet by eating large amounts of salmon, eggs, and again, drinking whole milk. To equal the amount of vitamin D in one teaspoon of fermented cod liver oil, you'll need to eat 18 ounces of salmon, 5 dozen eggs, and 21 gallons (79.5 L) of whole milk., Calcium helps strengthen teeth, so increase your calcium servings. The easiest way to do that is to consume more dairy products, like milk, cheese, and yogurt. Calcium can help remineralize your teeth.If you can, try eating cheese. Cheese helps stimulate saliva which in turn restores minerals to the teeth and washes away remaining food particles.

, You can buy fluoride-free toothpastes that can also help remineralize the teeth and make them stronger. Note that these toothpastes may be more expensive than your usual brand.You can also make your own mineralizing toothpaste if you want to save some money. combine four tablespoons of coconut oil, two tablespoons of baking soda, one tablespoon of xylitol (or 1/8 teaspoon of stevia), 20 drops of peppermint oil and 20 drops of trace minerals or calcium/magnesium powder., When you have a cavity, bacteria and acid will stain your tooth. Variation in color indicates the extent of the damage; a darker color means a larger cavity. When you are working to heal a cavity, check back and see if you notice a change in tooth color.


In addition, consider the sensation of pain. If the pain seems to be changing from a long-lasting, throbbing pain to a more incidental pain or sensitivity to hot and cold foods, the cavity may be improving. However, if the pain intensifies, you should consult your dentists for treatment.
Note any food impaction. When a tooth fractures, food can get stuck inside the cavity. This creates a wedging effect and causes discomfort and sensitivity. In addition, it can greatly impair the healing process.
Watch for fractures. Depending on the size of your original cavity, your cavity-filled tooth may be significantly weaker than a normal, healthy one. If you are opting not to get dental treatment, be especially aware of this.

, You should brush your teeth at least twice a day. Ideally, you should brush your teeth 30 minutes after eating and after drinking anything other than water. Keep the toothbrush at a 45 degree angle to your gums and gently move the toothbrush back and forth in short strokes. Make sure you brush the inner, outer and chewing surfaces of the teeth.


Don’t forget to brush your tongue as the tongue can also carry bacteria and food particles.Use a soft toothbrush. Your teeth can be damaged by brushing too hard or using toothbrushes with hard bristles. You should replace your toothbrush every three to four months.
Leave the toothpaste in your mouth without rinsing. Spit out the extra foam, but don’t rinse your mouth out with water. You want to give the minerals in the toothpaste some time to be absorbed onto your teeth.
If your teeth are sensitive, use a toothpaste for sensitive teeth--these can help reduce gum inflammation as well., Using about 18 inches of floss, wind most of the floss around the middle finger of one hand and the rest around the middle finger of the other hand. Hold on to the floss firmly between your thumb and your forefinger. Gently guide the floss between ALL your teeth using a gently back and forth motion. Be sure to curve the floss around the bottom of each tooth. Once the floss is between the teeth, use an up-and-down motion (gently!) to rub each side of each tooth. When you are done with one tooth, unwind more floss and move on to the next tooth.If you're uncertain about the proper flossing technique, you can watch a video produced by the American Dental Association.

, Fluoride in toothpaste and dental rinses replaces the calcium component in hydroxyapatite with fluorapatite, a substance that is resistant to demineralization by acids and therefore helps prevent cavities.Fluoride in toothpaste helps strengthens the enamel. Fluoride can also help the process of preventing cavities because it is anti-microbial, killing off the oral bacteria that is the underlying cause or cavities.Although some have expressed concern about the use of fluoride, the 2007 National Research Council report indicated that fluoride is an essential mineral and is healthy and necessary for tooth and bone structure.
You can also use a special toothpaste meant to rebuild enamel, such as Squigle Enamel Saver toothpaste (with fluoride). Note that you can use fluoride-free toothpastes, but it does appear that they may put you at higher risk for cavities., Make sure you see a dentist and get your teeth professionally cleaned by a dental hygienist at least every six months. However, there is no one-size-fits-all in terms of how frequently you should go to the dentist. For example, if you have deep grooves between your teeth, your dentist may even want you to come in for a cleaning and inspection every four months.Follow your dentist's guidelines on how to properly care for your teeth and their particular structure and makeup.

, Snacking throughout the day or sipping drinks here and there mean your teeth are constantly at risk. Each time you eat or drink something (other than water), your mouth bacteria creates acids that work to break down your tooth enamel.If you must snack, make a healthy choice like cheese, yogurt, or a piece of fruit. Avoid snack foods that are unfriendly to your teeth sugar such as chips or sweets.

, Cavity-causing bacteria need food (namely, carbohydrates and sugar) to survive. They then turn that food into acid, which weakens the teeth. Limit your intake of carbs and sugar so that the bacteria do not have anything to feed on. This means trying to avoid all processed and prepackaged food, such as cookies, cakes, chips, crackers, etc.You should also avoid soda and any other sweetened drinks because these foods tend to contain a lot of added sugar. In addition, sodas are very acidic and can damage the enamel on your teeth.If still want to enjoy something sweet, try using honey, which is anti-bacterial. You could also use stevia, which is an herb that is 200 times sweeter than sugar.
To satisfy your urge to eat grains, try fermented grains, like real sourdough bread, and only in moderation.When you do indulge in carbohydrates or sugar, be sure to brush your teeth afterwards to clean them off debris which can stick to your teeth and hasten the development of decay.

, Most fruit contain another type of sugar that is not as popular with bacteria so enjoy that apple, pear, peach or any other fruit. In addition, fresh fruits, along with vegetables, can increase saliva flow and help wash away food debris on you teeth.Try to moderate the amounts of citrus fruits you eat as these are quite acidic and can break down tooth enamel over time. Eat them as part of a meal (and not by themselves) and always rinse your mouth out with water afterwards to wash away the food particles., Chewing stimulates the production of saliva, which is naturally anti-bacterial and helps to wash away the food particles that stick to the teeth. Saliva contains calcium and phosphate and can help neutralize the acids in food and destroy some bacteria.


Sour foods tend to increase saliva production, but sour foods are also acidic, so chew, chew and chew some more to increase the amount of saliva you make., There are some who recommend that you minimize foods that contain phytic acid (such as beans and legumes) on the basis of the idea that phytic acid prevents the absorption of minerals. There is essentially no scientific basis for this and it appears to be an anecdotal myth. Phytic acid does bind minerals, but those minerals are released by cooking, by soaking beans and legumes in water prior to cooking and in the acidic environment of the stomach. In other words, you do not need to try to limit these foods in order to prevent cavities., If you are taking a multivitamin, make sure it includes minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. Remember, calcium and magnesium (and especially calcium, the main mineral in your teeth) are important for strong teeth.In general a mineral supplement should contain:


Enough calcium that you get at least 1000 mg every day. (Men older than 71 and women older than 51 should get 1200 mg every day).
Enough magnesium so that you get about 300-400 mg every day. Children have different needs (for children from birth to 3 years, 40-80 mg/day; for kids between 3-6 yrs, 120 mg/day; for kids up to 10 years, 170 mg/day) For children, use children’s vitamins.

, These include fatty fish (like salmon, mackerel and tuna), soymilk, coconut milk, cow’s milk, eggs, and yogurt. Another way to get vitamin D is through sun exposure or a supplement that you can buy at any health food store or pharmacy.Adults and children should get about 600 IU (International Units) of vitamin D every day. Adults over 70 years should get 800 IU every day.

, Water—particularly fluoridated water— is considered by some as best drink for tooth health. The general recommendation is about eight glasses of tap water a day. Most public water systems have added fluoride to help prevent tooth decay. Drinking water helps you stay hydrated so you can keep producing enough saliva. In addition, water helps wash down loose food debris.There is a lot of controversy around fluoridated water. It is unclear how great an effect fluoridated water has on dental health, and some have concerns about potential side effects of drinking fluoride and prolonged exposure., Anti-bacterial herbs can be used to help control the bacteria in your mouth and prevent their growth. Some of the most effective antibacterial herbs include clove, thyme, goldenseal, oregon grape root, and oregano. You can make concentrated teas using any of these herbs or dilute them to use as a mouthwash.To make tea: Boil water and pour into a covered bowl. Use two teaspoons of dried herb for every two cups of water. Gently stir the herbs and cover the bowl. Let the water cool completely and then pour the concentrated tea into a jar with a lid through a sieve (to catch the dried herb) and refrigerate. You can use these for up to two weeks after refrigeration.

To make mouthwash: When you want an antibacterial mouthwash, get a glass and add equal parts of concentrated tea and water. Use this as a rinse. Keep it in your mouth for one to two minutes and do not rinse with water for about five minutes.

Try ""oil pulling."",
Try taking thyme.,
Swish with apple cider vinegar.,
Try eating more garlic.,
Use a bit of tea tree oil.",How to Get Rid of Thrush1," Oil pulling rests on the yet-untested theory that oils literally pulls toxins out of your system.Although results haven't been conclusive, many people use oil pulling to fight the Candida fungus and to provide temporary relief. Here's how to do it. The process is quite simple.


Brush your teeth beforehand. Oil pull on an empty stomach if at all possible.
Take one tablespoon of oil and swill it around in your mouth for 5 to 10 minutes. Make sure it coats every possible part of your mouth — under you tongue, in your gums, the roof of your mouth.
After 5 to 10 minutes, spit the oil out and rinse with saltwater.
You can do this twice per day for five days. Try doing it once after you wake up in the morning and again before bed.
Use coconut oil for best results, although olive oil works too. Coconut oil is rumored to be particularly effective in fighting fungi.;
, The herb thyme is also supposed to be an effective aid in getting rid of oral thrush, although science has yet to substantiate it.In Europe, thyme is used to treat upper respiratory conditions and thrush. Try sprinkling a moderate amount of thyme on any dish that will take it! You could even make a tincture out of it.

, Take a little bit of apple cider vinegar, dilute it with about a half part of distilled water, and swish it in your mouth for several minutes.Another option is to mix one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar in a full 8 ounces of water and drink before every meal. The vinegar is supposed to fight off intestinal yeast overgrowth that sometimes contributes to oral thrush.
Some people find this method impossible because of the strong taste associated with the vinegar. You might also experience stomach gurgling when you start the treatment, so don’t start this treatment right before a meeting or another situation where you may feel embarrassed.

, Garlic, replete with several different sulphur-containing compounds such as allicin, alliin, alliinase and S-allylcysteine, is reputed to help fight a broad range of fungi, including thrush. Fresh garlic works better than garlic pills, so try to find a way to get more of it into your diet.


For best results, try taking 4 to 5 crushed cloves of garlic per day. If you're worried about chaotic garlic breath, try drinking 3 to 4 cups of garlic tea daily.

, Tee tree oil is renowned for its anti-fungal (and anti-bacterial) properties.It's a common home remedy for everything from acne to athlete's foot. But it's also used for thrush. Dilute one or two drops into a tablespoon of distilled water, insert Q-tip, and dab onto sores inside the mouth.Rinse mouth afterwards with saltwater.

Apply a warm compress.,
Do not attempt to drain the abscess by force.,
Clean up.,
Monitor the abscess as it does drain.,
Know when to contact your doctor.,
Provide all necessary information.,
Take any prescribed antibiotics.,
Get the abscess professionally drained.,
Drain internal abscesses with a long needle.,
Discuss surgery, when necessary.,
Care for the wound.,
Follow up with your doctor.",How to Get Rid of an Abscess," Soak a clean washcloth in warm water, then hold the warm washcloth over the abscess for roughly 30 minutes. Repeat this procedure four times daily.This should only be done on abscesses smaller than 1/2 inch (1 cm) across. Larger abscesses need to be cared for by a doctor.
The warmth can speed your body's natural healing process and encourage the abscess to drain on its own. Hold the compress over the abscess lightly, though, and do not apply much pressure.
Thoroughly clean the washcloth in between treatments and do not allow anyone else to use it. Following both actions can help prevent the infection from spreading. You should also wash your hands each time you apply the compress.;
, Never try to ""pop"" an abscess by applying pressure. On a similar note, you should not try to pierce and drain the abscess by yourself, either.


Pressing down on the abscess could force the infection and attached debris further into the body. The infection could spread, but even if it doesn't, it will still be harder to care for once it sinks into deeper tissues.
If you attempt to pierce the abscess with a needle or similar instrument, you could accidentally injure a nearby blood vessel. You may also cause the infection to spread further, making it more difficult to treat.

, You need to be especially mindful of keeping things clean while caring for an abscess. Your hands should always be clean when you touch the abscess, and any washcloths or other materials used during your treatment should also be cleaned thoroughly.


Note that recurring infections may require more thorough, full-body cleansing with a special antiseptic soap. Your doctor may also prescribe an antibiotic cream for the inside of your nose. Taking these steps may prevent re-infection by the same bacteria, thereby preventing future abscesses.

, When an abscess opens and drains on its own, you'll need to keep an eye on its progress. Most of the pus and debris should drain within two to three days, and it should heal completely within 10 to 14 days.


Keep the area very clean. Cover it with bandages throughout the day, but uncover it for at least 30 to 60 minutes each day so that it can air out. Doing so may prevent the infection from worsening or spreading.
It will usually be very easy for the infection to worsen during this stage, so you should be ready to call the doctor if the abscess becomes more painful or otherwise worsens.

, Sometimes, you may need professional medical care to get rid of an abscess. Call your doctor if the abscess worsens or doesn't go away with basic home treatment.


If the abscess is larger than 1/2 inch (1 cm) across, you'll need your doctor's help. You should also seek medical help if the abscess is located in a sensitive area, like the rectal or groin area, or if it continues to grow and becomes more painful.
Abscesses that continue to worsen may spread their infection and require medical treatment. Call your doctor if you have a fever of 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit (38.6 degrees Celsius) or if red streaks start developing away from the abscess.
Visit the emergency room if you have a fever of 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.8 degrees Celsius) or higher, or if red streaks start developing around the abscess and lymph nodes begin swelling in response. Facial abscesses larger than 1/2 inch (1 cm) across may also need emergency treatment.

, When you visit the doctor, he or she will ask you for specific information related to the development and status of the abscess.


You'll need to know how long the abscess has been present and whether or not any injury occurred that may have caused it.
Tell the doctor about any allergies you have or medications you're currently on.
Describe your current symptoms to the doctor. Most notably, let the doctor know if you had a fever while at home.

, Many abscesses will not clear with the use of antibiotics alone, but in some cases, your doctor may still recommend this type of treatment for persistent or notably large abscesses.Since antibiotics are usually prescribed before any specific bacteria has been identified, you'll usually be given a ""broad spectrum"" variety that can kill many different kinds of common bacteria.
If your doctor collects a sample of pus from the abscess, it can be analyzed, and a specific type of bacteria can usually be identified. At that point, your doctor may give you a more concentrated, specific antibiotic.

, In many instances, your doctor will choose to open and drain the abscess. Draining an abscess is only safe when done by a medical professional.


Your doctor will likely numb the area with general local anesthesia during the procedure. When dealing with notably large abscesses, your doctor may also give you a sedative.
The area will be cleaned with antiseptic solution and sterile linens or towels will be placed around it. Once everything is prepared, the doctor will carefully cut into the abscess and drain out any pus and other debris.
After draining the abscess, your doctor will likely insert sterile gauze or similar packing into the freshly drained cavity to keep it open for a few days. This gauze will then be covered with a bandage.

, When a small abscess develops beneath the skin, your doctor may need to drain it by inserting a long, fine needle through the skin and into the abscess itself.


After you're given local or general anesthetic, the surgeon will locate the exact position of the abscess with an ultrasound scan or computerized tomography (CT) scan. He or she will then pierce the abscess with a fine needle.
The wound will usually be opened slightly so that a small drainage catheter can be inserted. This catheter will collect the pus and debris as they drain. In most cases, it will need to be left in place for approximately one week.
You'll usually go home on the same day as the initial procedure, but in some cases, you may need to stay in the hospital for a few days.

, When an abscess inside the body is too large or too deep to reach with a needle, your doctor might recommend surgery. You may need to remain in the hospital for a few days after the surgery, too.The exact method of surgery will vary depending on your specific circumstances, but typically, you'll be given an anesthetic and the surgeon will make a larger, deeper incision in the skin to access the abscess.
The incision usually allows the surgeon to wash all pus and debris out of the abscess during the procedure itself, so very little, if any, should remain after the surgery is complete.
Recover can still take several days, though, and you may need to remain in the hospital so that doctors and nurses can monitor your progress.

, Regardless of how your doctor drained the abscess, he or she will likely give you instructions on how to care for the wound once you go home. Follow these instructions thoroughly.


You'll probably feel relief immediately after the procedure ends, but if you still feel pain, your doctor may give you pain medication to take over the next few days.
Antibiotics are rarely prescribed when an abscess is drained, but if your doctor does prescribe an antibiotic, take the medication until it runs out.
You'll likely need to soak, wash, and bandage the wound for seven to ten days after the initial drainage procedure.
Note that any pain or discomfort caused by the abscess should lessen a little each day. Likewise, any heavy to moderate drainage should only last for about two days, and the wound should heal completely within 10 to 14 days when cared for properly.

, Depending on the circumstances, your doctor may or may not schedule a follow-up appointment with you after draining the abscess.


When scheduled, this appointment will usually take place a few days after the initial procedure. During the appointment, your doctor will likely remove the packing inserted into the drained cavity and check on the wound's progress.
If no follow-up appointment has been made, your doctor should tell you how to safely remove the packing material at home.
You should contact your doctor about any fever, redness, swelling, or increased pain. Do so immediately and regardless of whether or not you scheduled a follow-up appointment.

Try an over-the-counter pain reliever.,
Look into baby teething gels.,
Try a hydrogen Peroxide Rinse.,
Dissolve a deglycyrrhizinated licorice tablet in your mouth.",How to Relieve Canker Sore Pain2," Try taking an over-the-counter pain reliever such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen to help you deal with pain from canker sores. Read and follow the dosage instructions and do not take more than the recommended amount.If you are still in pain after taking one of these pain relievers, then call your physician.

, Baby teething gels can be used for pain relief as well. These gels contain benzocaine and are available in most drug stores. Examples of products that contain benzocaine include Anbesol, Kank-A, Orabase, and Zilactin-B. Read the instructions and use the product as directed. Keep in mind that there is a rare blood disorder (methemoglobinemia) that has been associated with using benzocaine, so don’t use more than the recommended amount., Hydrogen peroxide is an antiseptic that can relieve minor mouth irritation like a canker sore. To prepare, dilute peroxide in a 1:2 solution with water. You can use the cap of the hydrogen peroxide bottle to measure this out. Swish, don’t swallow, the solution for about a minute. Repeat if necessary.


Added benefits of peroxide treatment is that it encourages gum health and slowly whitens teeth., Deglycyrrhizinated licorice or DGL tablets may provide some relief from canker sore pain and help to heal the tissue as well. Place one of these tablets in your mouth and allow it to dissolve right next to the canker sore. Make sure to read and follow the manufacturer’s instructions for use."

Apply ice to canker sores.,
Use a saltwater rinse.,
Hold a steeped herbal tea bag on the sore.,
Make an herbal paste or salve.,
Apply honey directly onto the sore.,
Consider using essential oils.,
Practice good oral hygiene.,
Steer clear of foods and beverages that may irritate your canker sore.",How to Relieve Canker Sore Pain3," Ice can be an effective, easy way to relieve the pain of a canker sore. To use ice on a canker sore, take an ice cube or ice chip and let it melt onto the sore. Repeat as needed. The cold will numb the area and provide some relief from the pain., You can rinse your mouth with saltwater to help ease the pain of a canker sore. To use a saltwater rinse, mix ½- 1 teaspoon of sea salt (or table salt) with ¼ cup of warm water. The salt will dissolve better in warm water. Swish the solution in your mouth and use about three times per day., A steeped herbal tea bag may also provide some temporary relief of pain from a canker sore. To use a steeped tea bag, let an herbal tea bag soak in warm water for about five minutes. You do not need to fill the cup all the way. You just need to use enough water to soak the tea bag. Then, remove the bag from the water and place the tea bag directly onto the canker sore. Leave the tea bag in place for at least 10-15 minutes. Repeat this four to five times per day. Try using one of the following herbs:Licorice root
Goldenseal root
Sage leaves
Chamomile
Peppermint
Cloves

, If you don’t have the tea bags and prefer to use dry herbs, take ½-1 teaspoon of any of dried herbs and mix with 1 – 2 tablespoons of coconut oil. Use just enough to make a thick paste. Apply the paste directly onto the canker sore. Repeat this process four to five times per day. If you swallow some, don’t worry. These herbs are safe for ingestion. Try using one of the following herbs:Licorice root
Goldenseal root
Sage leaves
Chamomile
Peppermint
Cloves

, Honey is soothing and has anti-inflammatory and antibiotic properties. If available, raw, organic honey is best. Apply a small amount of honey directly to the sore and allow it to dissolve. Repeat four to five times per day., Essential oils can be mixed with coconut oil and the resulting mixture can be placed directly on the canker sore. Mix two to four drops of essential oil with 10 – 15 drops of coconut oil. Apply the mixture to the canker sore using a cotton ball or a q-tip. Repeat this process four to five times per day. You can use more than one type of essential oil, just keep the total number of drops under four. Choose from the following essential oils to make your mixture:Peppermint
Clove
Sage
Eucalyptus

, Make sure that you brush your teeth twice a day and try and floss each day. Make sure that you brush all tooth surfaces and use a gentle up and down stroke when brushing. Use a soft toothbrush that will not irritate your gums or mucous membranes. Finally, avoid toothpastes and mouthwashes that contain sodium lauryl sulfate, which may cause canker sores., There are a number of foods that may make a canker sore hurt more and increase the time that it takes to heal as well. Some things that you should avoid include:Spicy foods such as hot sauces, barbecue sauces, and peppery sauces
Very hot liquids
Anything you think you might have a sensitivity to, including gluten-containing products (anything with wheat in it), dairy, chocolate, coffee, strawberries, eggs, nuts, and cheese
Acidic foods like citrus fruit and juices, tomatoes, and tomato sauces
Oral products containing sodium lauryl sulfate

Take preventative measures to keep oral thrush from returning.,
Refrain from using mouthwash, breath sprays or breath mints.,
Visit your dentist at least twice a year.,
Cut down on your sugar and starch intake.,
Quit smoking.",How to Get Rid of Thrush2," After you get rid of thrush, it is important to do what you can to prevent it from coming back. This includes:


Brushing your teeth 2 to 3 times a day.
Replacing your toothbrush often, especially during a thrush outbreak.
Being sure to floss your teeth once a day.

, These products tend to upset the normal microorganism balance in your mouth. Remember that your body contains a host of good microorganisms that effectively serve to fight ""bad"" ones. Harming these may pave the way for the bad ones to take over.


Instead, you can use a saline solution to rinse your mouth. You can create a saline solution by stirring half a spoon of salt into a glass of warm water.

, It is important to see your dentist at least twice per year, and more often if you wear dentures or have diabetes or a weak immune system. A dentist may be able to spot a thrush outbreak, or possible outbreak, sooner than you will, leading to quicker treatment.

, Candida fungus thrives on sugar. To stop it from thriving, you should cut down on the amount of starches you eat. This includes beer, bread, soda, alcohol, most cereals and wine. These foods feed the fungus and can prolong the Candida infection.

, Smokers are more likely to develop oral thrush than non-smokers. If you smoke, then do what you can to quit. Talk to your doctor for information abut medications and other options to help you quit smoking.

Visit your dentist or your family doctor.,
Begin treatment as soon as possible.,
Rinse your mouth with a warm saltwater solution.,

Use amphotericin B when other medications don't work or are no longer effective.",How to Get Rid of Thrush3," If you think you have thrush, then it is important t see your dentist or family doctor for an evaluation and diagnosis. If a medical professional determines that you have oral thrush, he will start your treatment immediately. Healthy adults and children can get rid of thrush more easily than others.

, Treatment for thrush in healthy patients generally starts with acidophilus tablets.A medical professional may also suggest eating plain unsweetened yogurt.


Acidophilus and plain yogurt will not destroy fungus, but they will reduce the infection and help restore a normal balance of bacterial flora in your body. Acidophilus and yogurts are both probiotics.

, Saltwater temporarily creates an inhospitable environment for the thrush fungus to live in.


Add 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 ml) of table salt to 1 cup (237 ml) warm water. Stir well before rinsing.

, Your doctor can prescribe an anti-fungal medication if symptoms persist or if you have a weak immune system.


You will generally take an anti-fungal medication for a period of 10 to 14 days. This medication is available in tablets, lozenges and liquid forms.
Make certain you take this medication as directed and in its entirety.
Antibiotics may also produce thrush especially in women or in patients who have experienced thrush in the past. In this case, your doctor may ask you to take an anti-fungal medication along with antibiotics

, Candida fungus often becomes resistant to anti-fungal medications, especially in people with HIV and other illnesses that cause weak immune systems. Talk to your doctor about amphotericin B if nothing seems to be working.

Wait for your period.,
Use the laced-tampon strategy.,
Try to avoid using latex condoms, spermicidal creams, and lubricants.",How to Get Rid of Thrush4," Vaginal thrush is actually just a yeast infection. While you can't dictate when you go on your period, menstruation will change the pH of the vagina, rendering it less hospitable for the Candida fungus.

, Lace your tampon with a little something, although probably not during your period. Here are some suggestions for what to lace your tampon with in order to combat vaginal thrush:


Dip it in unsweetened yogurt. Apply the tampon immediately, before it expands. Guard especially against leakage.
Dip it in diluted tea tree oil. Apply the tampon immediately, before it expands. Guard especially against leakage.

, In fact, in addition to avoiding these, try to avoid sex during a yeast infection. Yeast infections can be transmitted back and forth during sex, creating a vicious cycle and prolonging the infection.

Plaque is the media where the harmful bacteria thrive and form colonies. These bacteria produce acids which not only damage the tooth enamel but also affect the gums.


Plaque is a transparent layer and hence sometimes goes unnoticed.
Regular flossing can help to remove the film from below your gum line.
Hardened plaque is called ""tartar"" and can only be removed with professional cleaning.;
, Gum disease not only affects the gums, but can cause your teeth to decay or to loosen, requiring removal. Gingivitis is the early stage of gum disease, while periodontitis is the more serious condition affecting the bones of the jaw through a complex process that leads to several clinical forms. For example, severe periodontitis can be mutilating for patients who lose their teeth in just two years


Gingivitis can only be fully diagnosed by an expert, as the symptoms may be mild.
Periodontitis needs quick medical attention because, if it's not treated early, it can lead to tooth loss.

, This is the primary indicator of periodontal disease, and should not be ignored. Lack of pain during bleeding may cause many sufferers to delay treatment that might have prevented more severe problems. Periodontitis is well known to affect healthy teeth, such as in cases where decay is rare and pain is absent, making patients avoid going to the dentist.

, Gums that are swollen, spongy, or red or purple in color are irritated and may be showing the signs of gum disease.


Healthy gums are pale pink, not dusky red or purple.Gums that protrude or bulge around your teeth can be a sign of gum disease.Teeth that have more root exposed or seem ""longer"" may be a result of your gums receding as a result of bone loss, which is a sign of gum disease. This means that periodontitis is present.

, Pain is less common in the early stages, but as your gums recede, you may experience greater sensitivity to changes in temperature because the roots of your teeth are exposed.


If your bite feels different, then your teeth might not be fitting together in the same way as they get loose, which may be an indicator of gum disease.
Pay attention to new spaces between your teeth, which not only affect your eating or aesthetic look, but may indicate a loosening of your teeth.

, Bad breath (halitosis) and a consistent unpleasant taste in your mouth may be a sign of gum disease. If you feel comfortable, ask a friend or family member to take a whiff; otherwise, use your best judgment.

, Only your dentist can make the final diagnosis of gingivitis or periodontitis, and the sooner you visit his or her office, the more likely you are to successfully treat your gum disease.

, Your dentist is an expert on oral health, so he or she will ask you a number of questions about your oral hygiene habits and lifestyle. Bring a list of concerns that you have, along with any notes you've made about your gums' appearance and any pain you've experienced.


Bring a list of questions about gum disease, your symptoms, risk factors, and treatment options.Be ready to discuss any family history of gum disease or oral health problems.

, Your dentist will inspect your gums, paying attention to the shape and color of the gums on both sides of your teeth. He or she may test for easy bleeding of the gums, Then, he or she will then use a tiny periodontal probe to test for pockets between the gum and teeth greater than 3mm-5mm, which may demonstrate disease.This process is usually painless, although advanced root exposure may lead to more sensitive teeth and gums.Your dentist may also test your tooth movement, as loose teeth may indicate loss of bone support.
You may also need to have X-Rays of your teeth and jaw to evaluate any bone loss.

, Once your dentist has diagnosed your gum disease, you should work together to decide the best treatment options for your situation. Early stage gingivitis might only require non-surgical options, while more advanced periodontitis may need more invasive treatments.For earlier stages your dentist may recommend scaling and root planing. Scaling is a deep cleaning of tartar and bacteria from below the gum line, while root planing smoothes the rough surfaces of the root that may trap bacteria.
Topical or systemic antibiotics may also be recommended for less advanced gum disease.
Surgical approaches include flap surgery, gum grafts, bone grafts, and guided tissue regeneration to heal the damage and prevent future recurrences of disease.
Another option is enamel matrix derivative application. The periodontist will apply a special gel to the root of a diseased tooth that will stimulate bone and tissue growth, which will improve the gum attachment to your teeth.

, If you're uncomfortable with the plan that you and your dentist have created, or if you think your dentist may be pushing you to treatments that you don't think you need, then ask your primary care provider for the name of another dentist. The answer may be the same, but you'll feel better having heard the information from another source., Plan to come back to your dentist, after your treatments, more regularly than before your diagnosis. Patients with gum disease should have cleanings every 3 months to prevent further problems and adopt a complete cleaning procedure at home using helpful products such as mouthwash, floss, and an oral irrigator.Consider restorative procedures to improve the appearance of damaged teeth and gums, such as crown lengthening or dental implants.
Continue to practice good dental hygiene at home.

, Removing food particles from your teeth, gums, and tongue will lower the chances for an overgrowth of bacteria in your mouth. This bacteria can lead to gum disease as it becomes trapped between your teeth and gums.Choose a toothbrush with a soft head so that you can clean more thoroughly without irritating your gums. Medium or hard bristles can expose more of your teeth below the gum line and bacteria may become trapped, causing inflammation.If possible, brush after every meal and snack. If not, rinse your mouth with water after every meal to reduce bacteria by up to 30%.Replace your toothbrush every 1-4 months, as worn bristles aren't as effective at removing plaque and can become a home for bacteria.Electric toothbrushes may be more effective a cleaning away plaque and tartar., Fluoride strengthens teeth and helps to remineralize your tooth enamel, which can help protect your teeth from decay. After you eat, when your mouth is more acidic, fluoride curbs the growth of acid-loving bacteria, which is a primary cause of gum disease.Triclosan, another common ingredient in toothpaste, has anti-bacterial properties and may reduce the effects of gingivitis.
Metal salts, such as zinc and stannous, may have reduce gingivitis in a small degree.
You can also brush two times a week with an herbal toothpaste that contains sage, clay, and aloe.

, Flossing helps you to clean the between your teeth and just below your gum line where food particles and plaque can collect and cause bacteria to grow. Flossing and then brushing helps you to fully remove bacteria and food particles.Slide the floss between your teeth and move it gently in a horizontal direction to clean gums. Then, curve the floss around each tooth and slide it up and down to remove plaque.
Standard wooden or plastic toothpicks are not effective for dental hygiene and worse, they can even hurt your gums if used with pressure.

, A diet that is nutritious and balanced, including fruits and vegetables high in Vitamin C supports your oral health.Drink plenty of water throughout the day to rinse away plaque and to increase saliva, which inhibits infections.
Malnutrition is a risk factor for periodontal disease.

, Smoking is not only a risk factor for gum disease, it's also damaging to your oral health in general, causing your gums to recede and your teeth to deteriorate. The more cigarettes you smoke, the higher your risk of gum disease.Pipes and cigars bear the same risks for gum disease.
Chewing tobacco can cause your gums to recede, allowing room for bacteria to grow and cause periodontitis and tooth loss., A number of health conditions are risk factors for gum disease or can cause it to worsen if your oral health is not monitored. If you have any underlying or chronic illness, pay particularly close attention to your oral health.


Sufferers of autoimmune disorders, such as HIV and AIDS, are at a higher risk for gum disease.
Diabetes (both type 1 and 2) is a significant risk factor for gum disease. Diabetes changes to blood vessels and increases some inflammatory chemicals, which increases your chances of developing periodontitis.
Pregnancy and other female hormone changes can raise the risk of gum disease, especially if you already have diabetes.
Medication used to treat epilepsy, heart disease (calcium antagonists), or after organ transplants (cyclosporine) can also cause gum disease

, Early detection of symptoms helps in quick recovery of the problem. The symptoms of these diseases are sometimes very evident, but not always. This is where medical intervention may be needed.


Visit your dentist every six months to one year, or more often if you're a smoker, have diabetes, have dry mouth, or are elderly.
Plan to have a Comprehensive Periodontal Examination (CPE) every year to monitor any significant changes to your oral health., Some risk factors are preventable, such as smoking, while others are beyond your control, such as genetics and your age. If you're over 35, you're at a higher risk for gum disease.


Make sure you provide a full dental history to your dentist so that he or she can have a more accurate picture of your genetic predisposition to gum disease.
Stress can add to the risk for gum disease, due to the hormones psychological stress can cause your body to produce., Spaces between your dental work can provide a breeding ground for bacteria and room for plaque to become trapped. Ask your dentist to check your dental work for fit on regular basis.Also, make sure that you can floss properly between interproximal filings. These are the filings between two adjacent teeth.

Visit the dentist regularly.",How to Get Rid of a Gum Boil," If you have chronic gum boils, or gum boils that are cosmetically embarrassing, you may want to consider getting them surgically removed. This can greatly increase the chance of the boil not returning again. You’ll need to speak with a gum specialist, such as a periodontist, about this option to see what they recommend.Your dentist or gum specialist may recommend simply draining the boil instead of surgically removing it, depending on the location of the boil and how complicated it would be to remove it. In this case they will give you antibiotics to take for at least five days after draining.;
, Many gum boils are caused by active gum disease or some other kind of periodontal disease that leads to periodontal abscesses. If this is the case for you, it may be important to get a deep cleaning from your dentist in order to remove any active bacteria from the inside of your mouth that could be contributing to the gum boil.If this seems to help, you’ll want to be sure to continue with regular visits for cleanings to help keep your oral bacteria levels down and to maintain your overall oral health.
Consider gum surgery if your periodontist decides it is the best way to prevent future infections or gum boils

, Some gum boils are caused by dental abscesses. In these cases, root canal therapy would be required to remove the bacteria and decayed enamel from the area. Once the root canal is performed, a crown or filling is inserted and sealed to protect the tooth and the mouth from further infection.Root canals can be quite expensive and require multiple visits to perform, so make sure you look into the cost before you agree to the surgery.

, This will help reduce swelling and dry up or draw out any infection that might be present in the gum boil. Fill half a tumbler or glass with lukewarm water and add half a teaspoon of standard table salt. Mix until the salt is dissolved. It doesn't matter if some remains in the bottom of the glass. Use the saltwater as you would your usual mouthwash, but be careful to keep a special emphasis on the infected site when you're rinsing. Do not swallow the saltwater.Continue washing with the salt washes once or twice a day for a week to help heal the boil. This will reduce chances of it coming back. At the same time, be sure to maintain a good dental hygiene routine.
This method is recommended by oral health professionals and is clinically proven to be effective, but is not a replacement for a visit to your dentist.

, Applying essential oils topically to a gum boil can help reduce the levels of bacteria present and improve the overall tissue health. Combined, these factors can lead to the dissipation of a gum boil without needing to seek professional help. Simply add a few drops of the essential oil to a glass of water and rinse your mouth thoroughly.Some good essential oils to choose are spearmint or peppermint oils.
Be sure not to swallow the essential oil mixture.
Remember that this is a recommended home remedy and has not been proven effective with scientific evidence.

, Consuming raw onions can be a very effective home remedy for treating gum boils. Onions contain relatively high levels of sulfur, which can help heat up and dry up existing boils in your mouth.This is a home remedy and may be less effective than other solutions that have been verified by medical professionals.
If you don’t like the taste of raw onions, try eating them on other things — like in salads or on sandwiches where the flavor is masked.
Don’t cook the onions as this can reduce the amount of sulfur present in the vegetable.

, Brushing your teeth regularly (at least twice a day) is probably the single most important thing you can do to prevent gum boils and to contribute positively to your general oral health. Brushing helps reduce bacteria and germs that are present in your mouth, as well as removing plaque and food particles.Use a toothbrush with soft bristles and talk your dentist about proper brushing technique.

, Flossing is one of the best ways to help reduce plaque and bacteria buildup in your mouth. Since overall oral health is crucial for preventing gum boils, it is very important to floss regularly — especially if you have trouble with chronic or recurring gum boils.Most dentists recommend that you floss twice daily.

, Since bacterial buildup is one of the main causes of gum boils, it is important to do everything possible to minimize the amount of bad bacteria in your mouth. A good way to do this is to incorporate an antibacterial mouth rinse into your daily oral care regimen. Use it after flossing and before going to bed.


When choosing your mouthwash, the brand doesn’t really matter. Just make sure that the packaging indicates the product is antibacterial and look for the American Dental Association seal to ensure you’re purchasing a quality product., The best way to prevent gum boils is to maintain proper and consistent oral care. This includes regular visits to the dentist for cleanings and checkups. Your dentist or dental hygienist can help remove any plaque buildup and they can also let you know if they see any problems or recommend any specific courses of action.Your dentist can also probably spot signs of tooth decay or other periodontal problems much earlier than you can, so this will help you spot symptoms or causes of gum boils early on.
Regular dental visits should occur twice a year (once every six months).

A white tongue that doesn’t go away after several weeks;
, Generally neither condition is serious.Geographic tongue occurs when you have smooth lesions that look like areas where the bumps on your tongue are worn away.
Foods with strong tastes (spicy, acidic, salty) may cause you pain.

, Oral thrush is a yeast infection which is a common cause of white tongue. People often get it after taking antibiotics and it is easily treated.You may also have a burning feeling in your tongue and the skin at the corner of your mouth may crack and be painful.
Oral thrush can be effectively treated with antifungal medications including rinses (like nystatin) or pills. Be sure to take the entire course of medication as prescribed.
Taking probiotic supplements or eating probiotic yogurt may help restore the balance of bacteria in your mouth.
Use spices with antifungal properties. These include garlic, oregano,cinnamon, sage, and cloves.
Avoid yeasty food items like dairy, other than yogurt, alcohol, and sugar. Eat a healthy diet with plenty of nuts, whole grains and foods rich in vitamin C.

, Most cases of white tongue are harmless and go away on their own. However, if you think you might have something more serious, see a doctor. The possible causes are too diverse to be able to accurately diagnose yourself.Leukoplakia is a condition where white patches on the tongue are the result of an overproduction of cells and proteins. It usually isn’t dangerous, but should be checked by a doctor to make sure it isn’t cancerous.
Oral lichen planus is an immune condition and may be accompanied by pain or a burning sensation.

Know the symptoms of gingivitis.,
Understand how plaque causes problems.,
Know the non-surgical dental options.,
Know the surgical dental options.,
Help yourself.,
Use oral irrigation.",How to Get Rid of Gingivitis1," Gingivitis can progress through its early stages with few visible symptoms. When gingivitis worsens and advances into full-blown periodontitis, the symptoms are usually:


Bleeding from the gums after brushing teeth, or even spontaneously
Gums that are tender, swollen and redder than usual
Persistent bad breath (halitosis)
Receding gum lines (this will make your teeth look bigger)
Deep pockets filled with pus between teeth and gums, causing loose teeth;
, Food trapped under the gums combines with bacteria to create plaque, a “toxic stew” that irritates the gums and makes them bleed. Bleeding is your body's way of trying to clear out the toxic material from your gums.


This colorless film of sticky material containing food particles, bacteria, and saliva attaches itself to the tooth above and below the gum line, encouraging advanced gum disease and tooth decay. Then plaque, the “toxic stew,” hardens into tartar (calculus) in just 24 hours. By then the damage is done — only a dentist can remove tartar. Each day this “contaminated crust” grows and inflames the gums, as it is a non-stop source of bacteria.
For this reason, you need to remove plaque every day, no matter what, to avoid advanced gum disease. But brushing alone does not remove the plaque.

, Most treatments for gum disease involve the dentist, although keeping the disease at bay in at least half of the problem. If you have mild gingivitis, consider these non-surgical treatments:


Professional cleaning. Your dentist may recommend that you get your teeth and gums professionally cleaned twice a year you are prone to gingivitis. The dentist administering the cleaning will remove both plaque and tartar above and below the gum line.
Scaling and root planing. Like professional cleaning, this method is administered under a local anesthetic. The patient's plaque and tartar is scraped away (scaling) and rough spots are smoothed away (planing). This procedure is usually done if the dentist determines that plaque and tartar underneath the gum line needs to be removed.

, Advanced gum disease or periodontitis may need to be attacked with dental surgery. These surgeries include:


Flap surgery and pocket reduction. This surgery reduces the space between the gum and the tooth by lifting the gum flaps up, removing plaque and tartar, and placing the gums snugly against the tooth again. This procedure will stop the bone recession and can even stabilize the loosening teeth.
Soft tissue grafts. Tissue, taken mostly from the roof of the mouth is grafted onto the gums in order to reinforce receding gums or fill in places where gums are thin. This can help reduce sensitivity and can also improve the appearance of your teeth.
Bone grafts/surgery. Bone grafts give your old, diseased bone a new platform on which to regrow itself, adding stability to teeth. Bone grafts can either be your own bone, donated bone, or synthetic bone. Bone surgery involves smoothing out holes and craters in existing bone, usually after flap surgery. Bone surgery makes it more difficult for bacteria to lodge themselves in the bone, causing further deterioration.
Tissue regeneration. If the bone supporting your teeth has been completely eroded by gum disease, this procedure will help support both bone and tissue regeneration by surgically installing a piece of mesh-like fabric between the bone and gum tissue. This procedure is usually done in tandem with flap surgery.

, Regardless of what happens in the dental chair, it’s what happens in your bathroom that determines the success or failure of your gum disease treatment.


Note that most home remedies such as salves and creams merely treat the inflammation symptoms and don’t remove the bits of food or the plaque build up that ultimately leads to gingivitis and periodontitis.
Reversing and preventing gum disease is all about daily plaque control. That means, in most cases, stopping the plaque in your mouth is really in your own hands. Brushing every day is a good start, but it is not enough.

, It is an effective gum disease treatment that dental professionals recommend for daily plaque control. An oral irrigator is attached to a water source such as a sink tap or shower head. They flood the mouth and gum pockets with a jet of water under pressure to flush offending food particles and bacteria from below the gum line.


Research at the UNMC College of Dentistry indicates “that when combined with brushing, oral irrigation is an effective alternative to brushing and flossing for reducing bleeding, gingival inflammation, and plaque removal.”You can buy an oral irrigator, like a WaterPik, which creates enough pressure to eliminate any bacteria left in between teeth or underneath the gum line. You can add some mouthwash to the water reservoir for enhanced protection against plaque. There are many different types of oral irrigators with different features. Most are compact enough to sit on your sink or bathroom counter.
Fairly new on the market are irrigators that attach to your showerhead or your sink faucet.
Irrigating is a pleasant experience you will want to repeat every day (some people may find flossing to be uncomfortable). And it takes only 15 seconds.

Brush your teeth twice a day.,
Brush the right way.,
Floss once a day.,
Floss the right way.,
Use mouthwash.,
Drink more water.",How to Cure Gingivitis1," Gingivitis is caused by the buildup of plaque, an invisible sticky film of bacteria that forms on your teeth after eating sugars and starches. When the plaque sits on your teeth long enough, it hardens into tartar, because the minerals in the saliva stick to the plaque and form a rocky deposit. These substances irritate the gingiva, the part of the gum at the base of your teeth, and produce bone resorption, exposing the root of your teeth. You can prevent plaque from building up by brushing it away at least twice a day, and brushing regularly is the first step to curing existing gingivitis.Use a soft-bristled toothbrush, and replace it every 2-3 months. It is possible that electric toothbrushes are more effective at removing plaque and tartar, so you could consider using one instead of a regular toothbrush.Don't go to bed without brushing your teeth. Particles from the food you ate during the day are sure to stick to your teeth, and letting plaque form on your teeth and sit there overnight will irritate your gums even more.Brushing before going to bed is the most important activity that keeps your teeth healthy and reduces bacteria in your mouth.;
, Spend at least 2-3 minutes brushing your teeth. Focus especially on the parts of your gums that are irritated, since that's where the bacteria has built up. Brush in a circular motion, which removes plaque better than brushing from side to side.Don't let irritation, pain or bleeding stop you from brushing your teeth. Neglecting them will only make things worse. If you brush using the proper technique at least twice a day, the gingivitis should start clearing up in a week or so.

, Brushing doesn't reach the area of your gums between your teeth, which is one of the easiest spots for bacteria to start collecting. To cure gingivitis, it's necessary to floss every day. Use a waxed piece of floss or handled ""flossers"" to get the job done., Make sure you use the proper flossing technique. Pull the floss up to your gum, then use a scraping motion to remove the bacteria from the area before pulling the floss back out. Use different parts of the floss for each gap in your teeth.Your gums may bleed excessively if it has been awhile since you've flossed. Keep flossing every day, and within a week or two they will heal and stop bleeding every time.

, Antiseptic mouthwash removes bacteria from the tiny crevices that can't be reached with a toothbrush or floss. Choose a sugar-free mouthwash and rinse for at least thirty seconds at least once a day, after brushing and flossing. Gargling the mouthwash can help clear bacteria out of the back of your mouth and throat.

, Drinking water frequently throughout the day gives your teeth a rinse and helps prevent the buildup of plaque. Try to get 8 glasses of water a day for the best results. Staying hydrated helps saliva generate a protective coating for your teeth.


Carry a water bottle with you during the day and refill it often to make sure you're getting enough water.
Replace sugary drinks, coffee, tea, and alcohol with water as often as possible.
The drinking water in most cities and townships in the U.S. is fluoridated, which helps strengthen tooth enamel. Avoid drinking bottled water to ensure you are getting plenty of fluoride.
However, you should check with the local authorities and see exactly how much fluoride is in the water. Too much fluoride can be toxic and can even cause cancer.

Avoid dehydration.,
Quit smoking.,
Reduce your alcohol consumption.,
Improve your oral hygiene.",How to Get Rid of White Tongue2," Dehydration and dry mouth can cause white tongue. By staying hydrated, you can guard against it.


The amount of water you need per day will vary with your body weight, activity levels, and the climate you live it. Be sure to drink regularly. Once you feel thirsty, you are already dehydrated.
Monitor yourself for other signs of dehydration such as infrequent urination, dark urine, exhaustion, or headaches.

, Smoking can contribute to the inflammation of the bumps on your tongue, making it easier for debris and dead cells to get trapped between them. This creates an excellent environment for bacteria to grow in.


The smoke also contains chemicals which are unhealthy for the tissues in your mouth.

, Excessive drinking can also cause the bumps on your tongue to become inflamed.


Drinking alcohol also makes you prone to dehydration, another cause of white tongue.

, This will help reduce the amount of bacteria in your mouth.


Brush your teeth and tongue promptly after every meal.
Brush your teeth and tongue before going to bed.
Use an antiseptic mouthwash daily.

Brush your tongue with your toothbrush.,
Scrape your tongue gently with a tongue scraper.,
Wash your mouth out thoroughly with water.,
Disinfect your mouth with a strong antiseptic mouthwash or salt solution.,
Scrub your tongue with a natural remedy.",How to Get Rid of White Tongue3," This will loosen the dead cells, bacteria, and debris that is stuck between the bumps and ridges of your tongue.


You can do this with or without toothpaste, but using toothpaste will have the added benefit of making your breath smell better.
Don’t scrub so hard that you irritate your tongue. It shouldn’t hurt!

, Some toothbrushes also have tongue scrapers on the back of them.


Thoroughly, but gently, scrape from back to front. Don’t reach so far back that you gag yourself.
If it hurts, you are pressing too hard. You don’t want to cause any open wounds which would make you vulnerable to infection.

, This will rinse out the debris, bacteria, and dead cells.


Because dry mouth can also cause white tongue, this may also help it go away.

, Though they often don’t taste good, they will kill some of the bacteria that is growing.


To make a saltwater solution, dissolve 1/4 –1/2 teaspoons salt in a cup of warm water.For the best results, hold the mouthwash or salt solution in your mouth and swish it around for two minutes. The strong ones may burn slightly.
Tip your head back and gargle for approximately one minute. Then spit out the mixture without swallowing it. This will help kill bacteria that may be too deep in your throat for you to reach by scraping or brushing your tongue.
You can get a prescription-strength mouthwash from your dentist if necessary.

, Though not scientifically tested, anecdotal evidence suggests that they might help.


Make a paste of lemon juice and turmeric and scrub it onto your tongue with a toothbrush. The turmeric has antibacterial properties and the lemon juice will help dissolve dead skin and kill bacteria.
Try a paste of baking soda and lemon juice and rub it onto your tongue. The baking soda will help exfoliate your tongue.

Know the limitations of home remedies.,
Try oral probiotics.,
Try ubiquinone.,
Try a peroxide oral rinse.,
Use corsodyl spray.,
Try Gengigel gel.",How to Get Rid of Gingivitis2," Many home remedies rely on anecdotal evidence, meaning someone's personal experience, and not scientific evidence. Be aware that many home remedies have no scientific backing that they are effective in treating gingivitis. This is why it is important to still visit your dentist and only combine home remedies with dentist-recommended advice. Do not use home remedies solely as a substitute for dental treatment.

, Oral probiotics contain ""good"" bacteria that assist in restoring the natural balance of bacteria in the mouth after use of oral antiseptics found in mouthwashes and toothpastes.


Some oral probiotics (such as ProDentis) contain a bacteria called Lactobacillus reuteri, which is naturally found in breast milk and saliva. This bacteria is recommended especially during non-surgical therapy while maintaining other gingivitis treatments.Ask your doctor for a brand recommendation.

, Ubiquinone, also known as Coenzyme Q10, may help convert fats and sugars into energy. In addition to being used to treat diabetes and congestive heart failure, ubiquinone may be used to treat gum disease.The FDA, however, has not cleared ubiquinone as medically-appropriate to treat any disease, so ubiquinone should not be used solely to treat gum disease.

, An oral rinse that contains hydrogen peroxide, such as Colgate Peroxyl, is an antiseptic and antibacterial that may help treat infection and relieve inflammation when it comes in contact with an enzyme in the mouth.


Use this rinse no more than twice a week for three weeks in a row as it can cause tooth sensitivity.

, Corsodyl spray is a powerful spray that contains chlorhexidine gluconate, which has antibacterial and antiplaque properties.Corsodyl spray may be used to treat any pain or discomfort associated with mouth ulcers, inflammation and infections of the mouth.


Corsodyl spray can be used when brushing the teeth becomes difficult and/or painful, such as after surgery. Be sure to keep spray out of ears and eyes.

, This gel contains hyaluronic acid, which is naturally found in the body and may be used to heal certain wounds and stimulate the production of new tissue.For best results, apply at night before going to sleep.

Use oral irrigators.,
Avoid eating sweets.,
Brush after meals.,
Eliminate acidic foods and drinks.",How to Cure Gingivitis2," Dental professionals recommend oral irrigation as a great way to really clean teeth and gums. Brushing and flossing will not get under the gums where the bacteria have set up housekeeping. Oral irrigators get what tooth brushes and floss don’t, so plaque and tartar never come back.


Oral irrigators flood the mouth with a jet of water under pressure to flush offending food particles and bacteria from the mouth.
They can remove any debris leftover after brushing. They also give you a good gum massage, which improves blood circulation and prevents inflammation.
Oral irrigators, such as Oral Breeze or WaterPik can now be found that attach to your shower-head or your bathroom sink faucet and are very easy to use.
Oral irrigators should never be used as a replacement for flossing.

, If your diet is heavy on sweet sodas, candy, and other sources of sugar, try cutting back on these foods to decrease the buildup of plaque on your teeth. Even fruit juices have enough sugar to cause plaque to grow, and starchy foods like pizza create the same problem.When you do eat or drink sugar, follow it with a glass of water. Swish the water around in your mouth before swallowing to clean off the sugar.

, Consider brushing your teeth after a sugar or starch heavy meal, even if it means brushing three times a day instead of two. Carry a toothbrush in your car, office or bag so you can use it each time you feel a film start to form on your teeth. Be aware that brushing your teeth immediately after meals can potentially help to erode the natural enamel on your teeth, so make sure you only do this after eating meals that will contribute to bacteria buildup., There are some foods that have high acid contents. These acids wear away the enamel of your teeth and promote the growth of bacteria, putting you at higher risk of forming gingivitis. Some foods and drinks that are high in acid are:Citrus juices and fruits
Alcohol with a high phosphorus content
Certain types of meats, like corned beef or turkey
Some cheeses, like parmesan, are also high in acid content

See your dentist for regular cleanings.,
See your dentist for gingivitis.,
Follow your dentist’s regimen.,
Return for checkups.,
Stop smoking.",How to Cure Gingivitis3," Once plaque has hardened into tartar, it's almost impossible to remove just by brushing or flossing. Get a cleaning every six months at the dentist to make sure all traces of plaque get regularly removed. As long as plaque remains on your teeth, your gums may stay inflamed with gingivitis., If you see your dentist while you have gingivitis, he or she will do a thorough cleaning and recommend an effective hygiene plan for you to follow at home. Since gingivitis clears up with proper hygiene, no drugs or other treatments are administered., As stated above, dentists will be able to prescribe a daily hygiene routine to keep your gingivitis from coming back. It is critical that you practice the dentist’s recommendations routinely in order to keep a clean, healthy mouth between dental visits.In some cases, a dental fitting in your mouth, such as a cap or a permanent retainer, may be preventing you from cleaning your teeth and gums effectively. Talk to your dentist about tools you can use to clean your mouth and prevent gingivitis.

, With dental care, it is critical that keep a consistent routine and pattern to ward off bacteria and plaque that cause gingivitis. Make sure you schedule and keep all appointments with the dentists, even if just for routine checkups. A quick cleaning or brief examination of your teeth and gums can help to stop problems before they even start., Smoking increases your risk of gum disease, including gingivitis. As with so many other health related issues that are exacerbated by smoking, if you want to take serious steps to correct the problem, you need to quit smoking first.If possible, cut back on smoking or eliminate it entirely.


Other tobacco products like dip and chew are equally harmful to your gums. Quit chewing tobacco as soon as possible to cure gingivitis and other mouth ailments.When you do smoke or chew, brush your teeth immediately afterward to help prevent gingivitis from coming back.

Brush your teeth at least twice a day.,
Floss after you eat.,
Use mouthwash.,
Schedule regular teeth cleanings.",How to Avoid Gum Disease Problems1," One major way you can avoid a buildup of plaque on your teeth is brushing your teeth twice a day, once in the morning and once before bed. You may also brush your teeth after meals to make sure there are no food particles stuck in your teeth. Use a toothbrush with a soft bristle head and toothpaste that contains fluoride.When you brush, move the toothbrush backwards and forwards in short, circular motions. Sweep the toothbrush into the divots between your gums and your teeth at a 45 degree angle.
Try to brush every tooth in your mouth, especially teeth in the back of your mouth. You may work your way across the top and then the bottom row of teeth to ensure you brush each one. Brush your gums vertically to stimulate the blood circulation, which prevents swelling and bleeding gums.
Consider investing in an electric toothbrush, as they often work better than manual toothbrushes. Look for an electric toothbrush that has oscillating and rotating features. Make sure you use the electric toothbrush correctly to avoid causing gum recession.;
, Flossing after meals can help to remove food particles and other bacteria that can cause gum disease. Try to get in the habit of flossing after you eat and after you brush your teeth. You can also floss before brushing your teeth or rinsing with mouthwash. You may also carry floss with you in your bag so you can floss right after you eat or when you are not at home.Floss by holding a long piece of floss between your two pointer fingers. Then, angle the floss to get between each tooth in your mouth. You may start at your top row of teeth and then finish by flossing your bottom row of teeth.
Change the floss if you see plaque on it and expect a bit of gum bleeding when you are flossing.
Make sure you floss your back teeth so there are no food particles remaining in your mouth.

, You can keep your teeth clean by gargling with mouthwash every time you brush or floss. Swishing your mouth with mouthwash can help to remove any food particles or bacteria that you missed while flossing or brushing.Look for mouthwash that does not contain alcohol or any other additives. Go for a mouthwash that advertises plaque removal.
You can get brighter teeth if you brush your teeth while holding half of a cup of mouthwash in your mouth. Use the mouthwash as a toothpaste and brush your teeth gently, especially the visible part of your teeth.

, You should try to get yearly teeth cleanings so you are at a lower risk of developing gum disease. Set up a schedule with your dentist so you have a teeth cleaning every year and can get any dental issues checked out. This will ensure your teeth remain healthy and you are aware of any dental issues before they become more serious."

Avoid sharing items that come into contact with saliva.,
Exercise caution around people with mono.,
Stay healthy to lessen chances of contracting mono.,
Exercise extra caution if you are susceptible to disease.",How to Avoid Mononucleosis1," Since mono is most commonly spread through saliva, sharing things that commonly come into contact with mouths and saliva is a risky behavior, particularly when someone has beginning symptoms.


Avoid things like inhalers, drinks, straws, food, and cigarettes in particular. Anything that touches another person's saliva or mouth and then comes into contact with yours, puts you at risk of contracting the disease.;
, Because EBV is not airborne, family members and roommates of those who have the virus are only at a slightly increased risk of contracting it themselves. However, sharing close quarters with someone infected does increase your chances of contracting the virus, especially while their coughing and sneezing symptoms are acute.This may go without saying, but if your significant other or partner has contracted mono, avoid kissing them or other actions that involve the swapping of saliva. Also, just because they are feeling better, this does not mean they are no longer contagious. They may need follow up tests until you know whether they're actually over the disease, even if they're asymptomatic.
If you have had mono before in the past, you won't have to worry as much because most people are able to build an immunity after having it.

, Although people of all ages can get mono, it is most common among people ages 15 to 19 years old. If you are in an environment like a college where mono is commonly spread, take extra precautions to stay healthy and keep your immune system strong.Eat a balanced diet, including more foods high in antioxidants. Good sources of antioxidants include green leafy vegetables, tomatoes, blueberries and cherries.
Engage in daily aerobic or weight bearing exercise.
Get eight hours of sleep each night to avoid being over tired and rundown.

, People with compromised immune systems; particularly elderly, young children, or those with immune compromising diseases like HIV are much more susceptible to contracting mono. If you fit any of these criteria, exercise extra caution to avoid contracting mono.


Wash hands frequently. Although mono is a virus, and thus cannot be killed by anti-bacterial soap, using good hygiene habits can be effective to lessen germs lingering on your hands and other shared utensils. Cleaning products with bleach can also kill bacteria and viruses on surfaces.

, Suck on an ice cube or ice pop if you have pain and/or burning sensation on your tongue. The cold will help to numb any feelings of pain, reduce swelling, and make your tongue feel more comfortable.


Sucking on an ice cube can be especially soothing if you’ve bitten or burned your tongue.The melting liquid will also help you stay hydrated and prevent your tongue from drying out, which can make pain from a bitten or burnt tongue worse.

, A warm rinse with salt water will clean your tongue and may help relieve the pain of a sore tongue. You can rinse every couple of hours until your pain and discomfort ease.Add one tablespoon of salt to a glass of warm water and stir to dissolve. Swish a mouthful around 30 seconds, concentrating on the sore area of the tongue. Spit out the water when you're done.

, When suffering from a sore tongue, it's a good idea to avoid consuming anything that may make the pain worse, such as spicy or acidic foods or tobacco. Although this won't speed up the healing process, it will likely make you more comfortable.


Eat soft, soothing and even cooling foods that won't aggravate your tongue as you eat, such as smoothies, porridge and soft fruits like bananas. Yogurt and ice cream are also good options because they are cooling and soothing.

Avoid caffeine or alcohol, which can irritate your tongue., If you are experiencing a sore tongue and home remedies don’t help, consult your doctor. He/She will help identify the cause of your pain and the right kind of treatment for you.A sore tongue can have many causes including fungal, viral, or bacterial infections of the mouth, nutritional deficiencies, ill-fitting dentures, teeth grinding or over brushing your tongue, allergies, stress, or anxiety.A sore tongue may also be the result of burning mouth syndrome.You may not notice any physical changes to your tongue or mouth with a medical condition.Or, you may experience common signs of irritation or infection, such as the white plaque coating the tongue in oral thrush, bumps, ulcers, or a burning sensation., If you’re experiencing a sore tongue or the symptoms of burning tongue syndrome, your doctor may order tests to determine the cause of your pain. Tests often can’t determine the cause of a sore tongue, but your doctor will help develop the best treatment plan for you.


Your doctor may use different diagnostic tools to determine the cause of your sore tongue. These include blood tests, oral cultures, a biopsy, allergy tests, and stomach acid tests. She may also give you a psychological questionnaire to rule out whether your sore tongue is related to anxiety, depression or stress.Your doctor may also tell you to discontinue certain medications to rule them out as a cause of your sore tongue., Depending on the outcome of your tests, your doctor may prescribe medication to help alleviate the condition causing your sore tongue. If the tests can’t find a cause, she may also prescribe medication or home treatments to relieve the pain and discomfort.Three medications commonly prescribed for a sore tongue are amitriptyline, amisulpride, and olanzapine. These drugs work by blocking the action of gamma-butyric acid, which may be responsible for the pain or burning sensation in the tongue.Your doctor may also advise that you take an over the counter pain reliever to help relieve the discomfort of sore tongue, especially if you are having trouble sleeping.Popular over-the-counter painkillers include acetaminophen, ibuprofen and aspirin.
Follow your doctor’s orders for taking pain relievers or the instructions on the packaging., Throat lozenges or sprays that contain mild analgesics can help soothe a sore tongue. You can purchase throat lozenges and sprays at any drug store or their online sites.


Use throat lozenges or sprays every two to three hours, or according to the package or your doctor’s directions.Make sure to suck on the throat lozenge until it has completely dissolved. Don't try to chew it or swallow it whole, which may numb your throat and make it difficult to swallow.

, Capsaicin cream is a topical analgesic that can help relieve pain. You can apply capsaicin cream to your tongue three or four times a day.The cream will initially increase the pain sensations on the tongue, but these will subside quickly.Be aware that the prolonged use of capsaicin cream can damage fibers in the tongue tissue, leading to a permanent loss of sensation., Use an antiseptic mouthwash such as benzydamine or chlorhexidine to treat infections of your tongue or mouth. They may also help relieve pain and swelling on the tongue.Benzydamine relieves pain by blocking prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are chemicals that are produced when there is pain from inflammation.Pour 15 mls of benzydamine into a cup and then swish it around your mouth for 15 to 20 seconds before spitting it out.

Check your mouth for other injuries.,
Wash your hands and face with soap and water.,
Ice it.,
Apply antimicrobial ointment and a bandage if skin is broken.,
Raise your head and rest.,
Take an anti-inflammatory pain medication.,
Seek medical attention.",How to Treat a Fat Lip1," Check your tongue and inner cheeks for further injury that may require a doctor. If your teeth are loose or damaged, seek emergency dental care right away.;
, Before you begin the treatment, make sure the affected area and your hands are clean. This is especially important if the skin is broken and there is a wound.


Use soap and warm water. Pat try the fat lip and avoid rubbing to reduce pain and further damage.

, As soon as you begin to feel the swelling, apply a cold compress over the lip. Swelling results from a buildup of fluid. You can reduce this by applying a cold compress; this slows down circulation, which in turn reduces swelling, inflammation and pain.Wrap ice cubes in a washcloth or paper towel. You can also use a bag of frozen peas or a cold spoon.
Press the cold compress gently over the swollen area for about 10 minutes.
Take a break for another 10 minutes, and repeat until the swelling goes down or until you no longer feel pain or discomfort
Caution: Do not apply ice directly to the lip. This can result in soreness or mild frostbite. Make sure the ice or icepack is wrapped in a cloth or paper towel.

, If the injury damaged your skin and caused a wound, you may want to use antimicrobial cream to reduce the chance of infection before applying a bandage.The cold compress should have stopped the bleeding, but if the wound continues to bleed apply pressure with a towel for 10 minutes.
You can treat minor, superficial bleeding at home, but seek medical attention if you have deep cuts, severe bleeding, and/or bleeding that does not stop after 10 minutes
After the bleeding has stopped, apply antimicrobial ointment lightly to the affected area.
Caution: If itching or a skin rash develops, stop using the ointment.
Cover the wound with a bandage.

, Keeping your head raised above the heart allows the fluid to drain from the facial tissues. Sit in a comfortable chair with your head resting to the back of the chair.If you prefer to lie down, elevate your head “above the heart” with additional pillows.

Avoid starchy foods and sugary foods.,
Do not smoke or use tobacco products.,
Reduce your stress level.",How to Avoid Gum Disease Problems2," You can adjust your diet to help prevent the development of gum disease. Start by cutting out starchy foods, such as deep fried foods, and foods high in sugar, such as candy or prepackaged food products. These types of foods increase the amount of plaque on your teeth, which can lead to issues like gum disease.You should try to maintain a diet that is high nutrients and vitamins, such as vitamin A and vitamin C. Eat fresh fruits and vegetables on a regular basis to maintain a healthy diet and a healthy set of teeth.
Try to switch to whole grain bread instead of white bread, which is usually more processed.

, Smoking or using tobacco products like chewing tobacco can lead to gum disease and dental issues. Try to cut back on smoking cigarettes or chewing tobacco so you are at a lower risk of gum disease.Keep in mind smoking and using tobacco products can also lead to an increased risk of oral cancer.

, High stress and anxiety can lead to teeth grinding and other dental habits that can reduce the health of your teeth, such as periodontitis which is now a common problem. Try to reduce your stress level so you are at a lower risk of developing dental issues. You may try doing self-care to relax or take up a relaxing activity like yoga or deep breathing exercises.You can also reduce your stress level by taking time in your day to go for a walk alone through an outdoor space you like or do a hobby that you enjoy. Spending time with family and friends can also be a way to reduce your stress levels.

Talk to your dentist.,
Get a deep cleaning done on your teeth.,
Take medication.,
Consider surgical intervention.",How to Avoid Gum Disease Problems3," If you suspect you may have gum disease, you should speak to your dentist right away. During your appointment, you should ask your dentist about your gum health and share your dental hygiene habits with your dentist. Your dentist will perform a physical exam of your teeth to confirm that you have gum disease.The dentist may also take an x-ray of your teeth to see if there is any bone loss.
You may be referred to a periodontist to get a more in depth diagnosis. Periodontists are trained to diagnose and treat gum disease.

, One of the most common treatments for gum disease is doing a deep cleaning on your teeth. This treatment can help to control the infection and remove plaque that is causing the infection. The periodontist will perform the deep cleaning in their office with the assistance of a dental hygienist.During a deep cleaning, the periodontist removes plaque on your teeth by using scaling and root planing. Scaling means scraping off the tartar above and below your gum line. Root planing means getting rid of rough spots and infiltrated cement on your tooth root where germs and bacteria tend to gather.

, Your dentist or periodontist may suggest certain medications that you can take along with a deep cleaning. Your dentist may prescribe antimicrobial mouth rinse to help control bacteria that may be causing gum disease. You may also get an antibiotic gel or oral antibiotics for short term treatment of bacteria in your mouth that may lead to gum disease or make your condition worse.Talk to your periodontist about taking medications and always follow the recommended dosage.

, If your gum disease problem is severe, your dentist may recommend surgery. You may also need to consider surgery if your teeth, gums, and teeth support are still inflamed and infected despite the use of deep cleaning and medication. Your dentist may recommend flap surgery or bone and tissue grafts to address your gum disease.During flap surgery, your dentist will remove tartar deposits attached to your root and alveolar bone. Your dentist will lift back your gums and remove the tartar leaving a smooth surface. Then, the gums are sewn back in place so the tissue fits snugly around your tooth again.
During bone and tissue grafts, your dentist may use a natural or synthetic bone to replace bone loss in your mouth. Tissue grafts may be used to restore the natural aspect if there is any tissue loss in your mouth due to gum disease.

Recognize symptoms early.,
Get tested if you suspect you may have contracted mono.,
Take precautions if you have mono symptoms.",How to Avoid Mononucleosis2," Even if you do your best to avoid mono, you still may catch it. Recognizing symptoms early can help curb how long the illness lingers. Some common symptoms of mono include:


fatigue
sore throat
fever
swollen lymph nodes
swollen tonsils.

, If you have symptoms of mono, the only way to find out for sure is to get tested and confirm the presence of the virus in your blood stream. There are two main tests for mono:Mono spot test (heterophile antibody test). This is a test that screens for antibodies that form during certain infections. A blood sample is looked at under a microscope and if heterophile antibodies are in the sample, the blood will clump. This usually indicates mono.
EBV antibody test. This too, is a blood test that will show antibodies present against EBV. They can use a variety of methods to look at the specific types of antibodies to determine whether you were infected recently or a while ago.
Mono tests may not be accurate in the first days or week of infection. Your body needs time to build up the antibodies to the infection. By two weeks, they are usually accurate.

, If you get back a test showing you have mono, your doctor may have medications for you to begin taking. Antibiotics are not effective, but in some cases, steroids can be used to help fight tertiary symptoms. But it may also help to take your own precautions.Get plenty of rest, maybe even bed rest if the illness is bad enough.
Gargle with salt water or use throat lozenges for a sore throat.
Take acetaminophen or ibuprofen to reduce fever and relieve a sore throat and headaches.
Avoid contact sports and heavy lifting.
Drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration.

Take care of your teeth.",How to Treat a Broken Tooth," If you crack your tooth severely enough, you'll probably feel significant pain right after the injury. If you experience this, examine the tooth that hurts and see if there is a piece missing. If so, you've indeed cracked a tooth.Also keep in mind that you may still have a shard of tooth in your mouth. This can cut you if swallowed, so try to spit it out if it's still in your mouth. Save the shard if you have it.;
, If your crack is less severe, you may not feel immediate pain. Instead, you'll probably experience a more dull pain that comes and goes. Often your tooth will hurt when you're chewing or when you eat very hot or cold foods. If you experience this kind of pain, it would be a good idea to investigate further., If you suspect that you may have cracked a tooth, a visible inspection should help confirm your suspicions. Look for a visible crack or missing section of your tooth.You might also be able to feel the cracked tooth if you can't see far enough into your mouth. Try carefully rubbing your tongue around your teeth. If you encounter a rough or pointy section, this would indicate a crack.

, If you have trouble finding the crack, you can also look at your gums. The gum line around a cracked tooth may swell and turn red. Look for this symptom to help locate your cracked tooth., Whether you know for sure you cracked your tooth, or are just having pain and can't locate it, visit your dentist as soon as possible. Cracked teeth are treatable, but it is important to visit the dentist as soon as possible to prevent further damage. In the meantime, there are a number of steps you can take to protect your mouth and alleviate your pain., Sometimes the dentist is able to reattach the portion of tooth that broke off, so you should save it if you can. Take the shard and put it in a container with milk or saliva to keep it from rotting. Then bring it with you when you visit the dentist.You should never try to reattach the portion of tooth yourself. Not only will this not work without proper equipment, but you'll cause severe pain for yourself if you poke an exposed nerve.

, Your mouth is full of bacteria, and any injuries can get infected easily. To help stave off infection, rinse your mouth with a salt water solution when you know you've broken a tooth.Mix 1 tsp of salt into 1 cup of warm water.
Swish the mixture around your mouth for 30 to 60 seconds.Concentrate on the injured area.
Be sure not to swallow any of the mixture.
Repeat this rinse after meals.

, If you've damaged your tooth badly, the pain can be severe. You can treat it with OTC pain relievers until you go to the dentist and get it fixed.Ibuprofen products like Motrin and Advil are usually preferred over acetaminophen because ibuprofen also reduces swelling in addition to treating pain. But if ibuprofen isn't available, take an acetaminophen product like Tylenol., Sometimes a chip in the tooth will produce a jagged edge that could cut your tongue or gums. To prevent damage to your mouth, cover the edge with dental wax. You an purchase this in the oral care aisle of most pharmacies.Alternatively, you could also cover the edge with a piece of sugar-free chewing gum.

, It's possible that you won't be able to see your dentist for several days after you crack your tooth. In this case, you'll have to eat before your appointment. Take the following measures to reduce pain and prevent further damage when eating.Stick with soft foods. The cracked tooth is weakened and susceptible to further damage. Hard foods could make the crack worse and cause pain. Opt for soft foods like pudding, soup, and oatmeal until your doctor performs the necessary work.
Don't eat anything especially hot or cold. The cracked tooth will be sensitive to extreme temperatures, and very cold or hot foods can cause pain. Serve food at room temperature to avoid any problems.
Try to eat on the unaffected side of your mouth. Any chewing can cause pain and further damage, so if possible you should avoid chewing with the cracked tooth.

, If the crack or chip in your tooth was slight, the dentist might opt to contour it. This involves shaving down and polishing the crack to make it smoother and unable to cause any cuts or abrasions. This is a simple fix that should involve minimal pain and only one visit to the dentist., If the crack has left an opening in your tooth, then your dentist will probably choose to fill it in like a cavity. This involves using a filling material -- usually silver amalgam or plastic -- to fix the crack in the tooth. The filling will prevent anything from getting stuck in the hole and will keep it from getting bigger., If the crack is large enough, the dentist may have to use a crown to repair the tooth. These are usually made of metal or ceramic, and designed to mimic the appearance and strength of a tooth., If the tooth has been badly damaged and the nerve or pulp is exposed, the dentist may have to perform a root canal to save the tooth. The dentist will thoroughly clean and disinfect the inside of the tooth to prevent infection and hopefully this can prevent extraction of the tooth.If you have a root canal, the dentist may also place a crown on the tooth afterwards to protect it.

, If the tooth has been severely damaged, it may have to be extracted. This is usually done when the crack in the tooth extends below the gum line and can't be reached for repair. To relieve your pain and prevent a severe infection, the best option here is to remove the tooth completely.When you have a tooth extracted, ask your dentist what your options are for replacing the extracted tooth.

, Many people have a habit of chewing on hard objects like ice and pens. While teeth are very strong, this activity gradually grinds down the teeth. Sustained chewing of hard objects can weaken your teeth to the point that they crack. Avoid this problem by breaking your habit of chewing hard objects., Grinding is when you continuously press your teeth together, usually when sleeping. Over time, this will weaken your enamel and make your teeth susceptible to cracking.Since grinding often occurs when we sleep, it's not an easy habit to break. There are specially designed mouth guards you can wear that will protect your teeth while you sleep and prevent grinding. Talk to your dentist about one of these devices if grinding is a problem for you.

, Teeth are very often broken and knocked out while playing sports. If you play a contact sport, like football, or a sport where a hard object could hit you in the face, like baseball, you should wear a mouthguard to avoid any damage to your teeth.See this guide from the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry for a breakdown of different kinds of mouth guards.
If you have trouble finding the right mouthguard for you, ask your dentist for a recommendation.

, Poor oral hygiene will weaken teeth and make them more susceptible to damage. Luckily, you have control over your own oral health. You can protect yourself from tooth decay and broken teeth by keeping your mouth clean and sticking to regular appointments with your dentist.Read Brush Your Teeth for a full breakdown of proper brushing technique.
Remember to Floss after brushing to rid your teeth of any trapped plaque and food particles.
Visit your dentist regularly, usually every 6 months, for a thorough cleaning and inspection.

"
Set up a brushing schedule.,
Use a soft bristled toothbrush.,
Use a pea sized amount of toothpaste.,
Brush all surfaces of your teeth.,
Rinse your mouth with water or mouthwash.,
Floss your teeth at least once a day.,
Start to floss by breaking off an 18 inch piece of dental floss.,
Guide the floss between your teeth using a gentle rubbing motion.,
Curve the floss into a C shape when you reach the gums.,
Try using floss picks, dental picks or wooden plaque removers if you find using floss difficult.,
Avoid sugary candies, sweets, starches, and refined carbohydrates.,
Drink fruit juices and carbonated soft drinks sparingly.,
Limit consumption of acidic foods.,
Drink tap water and green/black teas.,
Eat plenty of fiber rich vegetables and fruits.,
Eat dairy products such as milk, cheese, and yogurt.,
Chew sugarless gum.,
Use products formulated for dry mouth.,
Talk to a doctor if you have frequent heartburn, acid reflux, or an eating disorder.,
See your dentist and dental hygienist for regular cleanings and checkups.,
Ask your dentist about sealants.,
Talk to your dentist about fluoride treatments.",How to Avoid Tooth Decay," Ideally you should brush your teeth after every meal, but you should try to do so at least twice a day: once after breakfast and once before bed. Make this part of your routine each morning and before bed.
If you incorporate tooth brushing into your regular routine it will be easy to remember to do it.
Proper tooth brushing only takes a few minutes, so even very busy people can find the time.;
, The size and shape depend on your mouth size, but most dentists recommend electric toothbrushes that have a round shape. The size and shape of the brush should allow you to reach all areas of your mouth and all surfaces of your teeth.
Replace your toothbrush every three to four months.
If your toothbrush is becoming frayed, it may be necessary to replace it sooner. A frayed toothbrush will not be very effective in cleaning your teeth.

, Make sure you are using a fluoride toothpaste approved by the American Dental Association. Fluoride helps to strengthen tooth enamel and prevent tooth decay.Small children can't have as much fluoride as adults. Talk to your dentist about an appropriate amount of fluoride toothpaste to use on your child's toothbrush. You will want your child to get the cavity fighting benefits of fluoride without getting too much of it.

, You will want to place your brush at a 45 degree angle to your teeth and gums as you brush. Don't apply too much pressure, or you could damage your gums. If you're bearing down with the brush or notice that your brushes fray quickly, you are likely using too much pressure.Start by brushing the front surfaces of all of your teeth.
Use small side to side strokes.
After you have brushed the front surface of all of your teeth, move on to the chewing surface and the backs of your teeth.
To clean the inside surface of your front teeth, tip the brush vertically and use several up and down strokes.
Make sure to brush along the gum line as well.
You should also brush your tongue to remove bacteria and improve your breath.

, Mouthwash can be used to help prevent tooth decay and cavities, reduce plaque buildup, and reduce your likelihood of diseases such as gingivitis. Look for a mouthwash containing fluoride to help prevent or reduce tooth decay.Mouthwashes that have the American Dental Association Seal of Acceptance have been tested for safety and effectiveness, so always choose a product that has this seal.Mouthwash cannot be used in place of regular brushing and flossing. If you find you cannot brush your teeth after a meal, it is a good idea to rinse with mouthwash to kill bacteria and prevent plaque.
Mouthwashes that contain alcohol may dry out your mouth, which could actually promote further bacterial growth. Look for a fluoridated, alcohol-free mouthwash.

, Additionally, you should floss after eating a meal or snack that can easily get caught in your teeth such as popcorn or corn on the cob. Even if you brush regularly, it is imperative to floss as well.
Flossing will remove food particles from between your teeth and under the gums.
These are areas where a toothbrush cannot reach.
If you do not floss, food particles and sugars caught between your teeth will attract bacteria and promote plaque buildup and can cause cavities.

, You want a long string so you can wrap the dirty part of it around your finger as you clean between your teeth. Wind most of the floss around one of your middle fingers.
Wind the tail of the other end around the middle finger of your opposite hand.
This finger will be where you wrap used and dirty dental floss as you go through your mouth.

, Never snap a piece of dental floss against the gum line.Hold the floss firmly between your thumb and forefinger.
Rub the dental floss back and forth as you slide it between your teeth.
Pause when you get to the gum line.

, Hold it against one tooth. Gently slide the floss into the space between the gum and tooth.
Hold the floss tightly against the tooth.
Gently rub the floss along the side of the tooth away from the gums using up and down motions.
Repeat this method on the rest of your teeth.
Don't forget space behind your last tooth in the back of your mouth.

, These methods can help to remove plaque and food between your teeth without the difficulty of measuring out a piece of floss and maneuvering it between your teeth.A water pick helps to remove plaque and food from between your teeth and gums by using a stream of water to clean these areas.
Floss picks are small plastic devices with a tiny bit of floss attached. You can use these to floss your teeth in much the same way as you would using string floss.
If you are having trouble flossing, talk to your dentist about what options are available. You may just need to try a different type of floss (unwaxed vs. waxed etc.).

, Foods that are high in sugars promote plaque buildup because bacteria is attracted to sugars. If you do eat sweets, try to eat ones that don't stay in your mouth for too long. Candies such as lollipops, hard candy, and caramels tend to stay in your mouth for long periods as you suck on them.
Snacks like cookies, cakes, and pastries also contain lots of sugar and can cause tooth decay.
Foods such as bread, chips, pasta and crackers contain starches and refined carbohydrates that are sugars. If you do eat them, try to eat these foods only at mealtimes rather than as a snack between meals.
If you do eat sweets and refined carbs, try to brush your teeth with a fluoride toothpaste afterwards.

, Carbonated soft drinks are very high in sugar.Fruit juices often contain hidden added sugar, especially if they are called ""fruit juice drinks"" or ""fruit juice cocktails."" Avoid these.


Carbonated soft drinks are also very acidic. Acids in drinks and food can break down enamel and increase the risk of tooth decay.
While fruit juices are healthy in moderation, they contain a lot more concentrated sugar than whole fruit without the added benefit of fiber. Drink only 100% fruit juice with no added sugar. Research suggests that 100% fruit juice is unlikely to cause tooth decay.If you drink these items, make sure to do so with a straw to minimize contact with your teeth.

, Acids from foods can erode enamel just as much as acids from soft drinks.Acidic foods include citrus such as lemons and limes.
Tomatoes, pickles, honey and wine are also acidic foods that can cause damage to your enamel.
While it's ok to eat these types of foods, try to keep them in your mouth for as short a time as possible.

, Tap water is fortified with fluoride in most countries. Anything you make with tap water that is fluoridated will help to strengthen your enamel.


Water can help to wash away food particles.
Green and black teas contain properties that prevent plaque buildup. These teas can also help to reduce inflammation and prevent gum disease.
Be sure not to sweeten your teas with sugar.

, These will stimulate saliva flow. Saliva is a natural defense against cavities as it prevents bacteria and plaque from sticking to your teeth.
About 20 minutes after eating, saliva can begin to neutralize the acids that attack your enamel.
Crisp fruits and vegetables such as carrots, apples, and celery are recommended.

, These contain several essential nutrients for healthy teeth. Calcium, phosphates, and vitamin D in dairy are very important for healthy teeth as your teeth are primarily made up of calcium.
Calcium will not only help to strengthen your teeth, but can also stick to them and prevent acid from damaging your enamel.
If you are lactose intolerant, there are many calcium and vitamin enriched foods available such as soy products.

, Chewing this after meals and snacks can help to promote saliva production to rinse off bacteria and plaque from your teeth. Chewing gum is especially helpful if you have persistent dry mouth (xerostomia).The sweetener xylitol has been shown to prevent decay.
Studies have shown that xylitol can inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria in your mouth.
Chewing gum that contains sugar can actually increase your chances of getting a cavity, so make sure your gum is sugar free.

, Dry mouth (xerostomia) is not a disease, but it is an uncomfortable condition that can be caused by a variety of factors, including using certain prescription medications or having a medical disorder. Chronic dry mouth can promote tooth decay because your mouth does not produce enough saliva to wash away food and debris, and thus bacteria are more likely to thrive.There are several mouth rinses, both over-the-counter and prescription, that can help relieve dry mouth. Look for a mouthwash that specifies that it is for dry mouth when purchasing.
Sucking on lozenges, cough drops, or hard candies can help your mouth produce saliva. Make sure these are sugar-free.
You can also find a saliva substitute if necessary. These work much like eye drops do for dry eyes, to temporarily moisturize the mucous membranes in your mouth.
Your doctor may also prescribe certain drugs if your condition is very bad. The two most common are pilocarpine (Salagen) and cevimeline (Evoxac).

, Heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can promote tooth decay because stomach acids wash back up into your mouth in this condition, weakening your teeth. If you have frequent heartburn (also known as acid reflux), talk to your doctor about treatment options so you can avoid damaging your tooth enamel.Eating disorders also promote tooth decay. Bulimia nervosa and purging-type anorexia usually involve forced vomiting, which bring stomach acids up and over the teeth, causing damage. Eating disorders may also interfere with your body's natural production of saliva.

, Most healthy people will need to see their dental health care provider twice a year. When you see your dentist, you should get a dental cleaning. Your dentist or hygienist will use dental instruments to remove plaque and tartar from your teeth.
They will then polish them with a special toothpaste.
Most dentists will recommend dental X-rays at least once a year. This can help your dentist see if you have any problems inside your teeth.
Your dentist will check each tooth for cavities as well as examine your gums for signs of gum disease.

, These are plastic preventive sealant coverings for your teeth. These seal off the crevices on your teeth where food gets stuck.


Sealants protect the enamel against acid and plaque and are recommended for both children and adults.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that school age children should have dental sealants, as they can reduce tooth decay in children by over 70%.These sealants can last up to 10 years before they will need to be replaced.
Your dentist will need to check them regularly at 6 month checkups to make sure they are intact.

, If you don't drink tap water or use fluoride toothpaste, you may need fluoride treatments. Fluoride treatments are typically done in the office during your dental cleaning.
Your dentist will fill up trays with a fluoride gel or paste. These will need to sit in your mouth and on your teeth for several minutes.
These treatments can help to strengthen your enamel.

Identify your symptoms.,
Visit your dentist.,
Start using toothpaste for sensitive teeth.,
Find fluoride products.,
Consider dental procedures.",How to Treat Weak Tooth Enamel1," The loss of enamel can be a symptom or cause of many different mouth diseases. It might be related to gum disease, enamel hypoplasia, fluorosis, cavities, or cracked teeth. Before you visit your dentist, you should make a list of all of your mouth related problems so that they can more accurately diagnose your problem. You might note:


Sensitivity to hot or cold foods.
Bleeding gums after brushing.
Tooth pain, which can spread to the surrounding area of the tooth and affect other teeth.
Teeth becoming more jagged or uneven in appearance.;
, Your dentist will be able to tell you how eroded the enamel is, and they will be able to suggest the best course of treatment for you. They can also provide you with recommendations for toothpaste and mouthwash.Professional cleanings at the dentist twice a year can help prevent further enamel decay.

, Many people have increased sensitivity in their teeth due to weakening enamel. Desensitizing toothpaste uses a chemical that blocks sensation from reaching your teeth by creating micronic stops over dentinal tubules, thus allowing you to eat without pain or discomfort.Many brands offer desensitizing toothpaste. These will typically be marked on the box as “for sensitive teeth.”


Some toothpastes are marked as being able to strengthen tooth enamel. These brands can increase your teeth’s resistance to acid, which may help reduce further decay.Look for toothpaste that contains calcium phosphate (sometimes known as hydroxyapatite). This is the main mineral in enamel, and it may be able to help strengthen your teeth.These products can also contain the ingredient CPP or ACP, which is really active on the enamel surface and helps to provide good recoverage.
Your dentist may write you a prescription for a stronger toothpaste. If you are worried about weakening enamel, you may try asking for a prescription., You can use fluoride toothpastes and mouthwashes to prevent cavities.Fluoride products are marked either on the box or in the list of ingredients on the toothpaste or mouthwash.


One treatment that your dentist may recommend is an application of fluoride gel. Your dentist will apply this during the visit.Your dentist may prescribe you fluoride supplements. These can be taken as a pill or lozenge. They are typically given to children at high risk of tooth decay and must only be taken under the surveillance of an adult and by following the doctor's indications., You should be aware of what kinds of treatments are necessary for more advanced enamel decay. Your dentist will usually let you know if these are necessary.Crowns or fillings: if you have chipped a tooth or if your teeth have lost their normal shape due to enamel decay, your dentist may recommend a crown, veneers, an inlay, or a filling. These can protect your teeth by forming an artificial shield around them.

Root canal: this removes infected pulp from the root or nerve of the tooth. This will heal any infection which can affect the tip of the root and the surrounding bone caused by weakened enamel.

Tooth removal: if enamel has weakened significantly, you may need to have your tooth removed. This will prevent further infection in your mouth.

Don't always expect symptoms.,
Look out for gum or jaw pain.,
Watch for redness and swelling.,
Be on the alert for an infection.,
Check your front teeth for crookedness.,
Chronic pain and swelling is not normal.,
Massage your gums with your finger or some ice.,
Take over-the-counter (OTC) anti-inflammatories or painkillers.,
Use antiseptic mouthwash.",How to Tell if Your Wisdom Teeth Are Coming in," If wisdom teeth fully erupt (come in) through the gums straight, well-spaced and positioned properly in relation to other teeth, then they often cause no pain or inflammation and don't need to be removed.It's only when they partially erupt, lack enough space, grow crooked and/or get infected that they become problematic and noticeable.


Wisdom teeth don't fully erupt in everyone. Sometimes they remain completely hidden within the gums and bone, or they may only partially erupt.
The American Dental Association recommends that people between 16–19 years old get their wisdom teeth evaluated by a dentist.The longer your wisdom teeth stay in your mouth after the age of 18, the more developed the roots become, making them more difficult to remove if they are problematic.;
, Even wisdom teeth that erupt normally through your gums can cause mild symptoms. Look for mild pain, a feeling of pressure, or dull throbbing in the gums near the opening of your throat or in the nearby jaw bone.Erupting teeth can irritate the sensitive tissues that make up your gums (called gingiva). The pain will be more severe if the wisdom teeth are crowded and grow crookedly — they can cut into delicate gum tissues. Pain is subjective — mild pain for some, might be intolerable for others. The point is, some pain can be entirely normal for erupting wisdom teeth, so give it some time (at least a few days) before seeing your dentist.


Eruption of wisdom teeth is not continuous, so every three to five months you may experience the same pain for a few days. The wisdom tooth eruption influences the bone position of the other teeth so you may find that your teeth begin to shift.
If the wisdom teeth are not able to erupt normally, they may become trapped or impacted within your jawbone. This increases the risk of infection (see below).
The pain from erupting wisdom teeth can get worse at night if you have a habit of clenching your jaw and/or grinding your molars.
Chewing gum may also aggravate the pain caused by wisdom teeth.

, Wisdom teeth can also trigger redness and swelling (inflammation) in the gingiva.You may be able to feel the swollen gums with your tongue. They make it more difficult or uncomfortable to chew food while inflamed. Take a small penlight and shine it into your mouth while looking in a mirror. Wisdom teeth are the very last teeth (most posterior) in each row. Look for the top of the teeth (cusps or crown) poking through the gums and see if the tissue looks redder or swollen (called gingivitis) than other areas. The swelling usually goes away after a week or so.


While looking in your mouth, you might see some blood around the protruding wisdom tooth, or your saliva may be tinged red. This is relatively uncommon, but not rare. Other causes of blood can include gum disease, canker sores or mouth trauma.
You might see a ""gum flap"" over your erupting wisdom tooth, which is known as a pericoronal flap. This is normal and doesn't usually cause any problems.
While your rear gum tissue (gingiva) is swollen, it might be difficult to open your mouth.You may need to drink fluids through a straw for a few days.
You may also find it difficult to swallow. Your dentist may prescribe some anti-inflammatory medication for you to take for a few days.
Lower wisdom teeth are close to your tonsils, which may swell, giving you the feeling of getting a cold or sore throat.

, Partially erupted (also called impacted) wisdom teeth, as well as ones that grow crooked, greatly increase the risk of an infection. Impacted and crooked wisdom teeth can create little pockets of space underneath the pericoronal flap where bacteria collect and flourish. Common signs of an infected wisdom tooth include: considerable gum swelling, severe pain, mild fever, swollen lymph nodes in your neck and along the edge of your jaw, pus around the inflamed tissue, bad breath and an unpleasant taste in your mouth.The type of pain associated with an infected wisdom tooth is often a constant dull ache combined with infrequent sharp and shooting pains.
Pus is a grayish-white color and made from white blood cells of the immune system. These specialized cells rush to the infection site to kill bacteria, then they die and form pus.
Bad breath can also be caused by trapped and rotting food underneath pericoronal flaps.

, Even if your wisdom teeth grow in crooked and become impacted within your jaw bone, they may not cause pain and other noticeable symptoms; however, with some time (even just a few weeks), they often start to crowd other teeth and push them out of alignment.This ""domino effect"" can eventually affect your teeth that are visible when you smile, making them twisted or crooked looking. If you think your front teeth are suddenly getting crooked or twisted, compare your current smile to older photographs.


If your wisdom teeth are pushing others too far out of place, your dentist may recommend you have them removed.
Once wisdom teeth are removed (extracted), other crooked teeth can slowly become realigned again naturally after a few weeks or months.

, Although some short-term tolerable pain and inflammation is normal with erupting wisdom teeth, chronic (long-term) pain and swelling is not. Wisdom teeth that fully grow in above the gum line don't usually cause much pain or swelling beyond a few weeks. Severe pain and inflammation that lasts for more than a few weeks is more common with impacted wisdom teeth that remain in the jaw bone.Impacted wisdom teeth that lead to severe and/or chronic symptoms should be removed.


People with small jaws and mouths are much more likely to have impacted wisdom teeth that cause significant pain and swelling.
Although impacted wisdom teeth might not directly cause symptoms, they can promote decay in other teeth or surrounding gum tissue that can lead to long-term pain.
Deciding when to go to the dentist depends on your pain tolerance and ability to be patient. As a general rule, if the pain keeps you from getting sleep (without medication) for more than three to five days, then it's best to get your teeth checked out.

, Gently massaging a clean (sanitized) finger back and forth or in small circles over your tender gums can provide temporary relief. Be careful not to rub too hard because you could disrupt or damage the pericoronal flap and trigger more irritation, swelling and/or bleeding. If you can tolerate it, use a small ice cube to combat inflammation and dull the pain. The ice will feel shockingly cold initially, but the tissue around the erupting wisdom tooth should get numb within five or so minutes. You can use ice three to five times daily or as needed to deal with tenderness.


Make sure to trim your fingernails and sanitize your finger with alcohol wipes in order to prevent transferring bacteria onto your gums. You can make an infected wisdom tooth worse if you don't practice good hygiene.
Ask your dentist if he can recommend a desensitizing cream or ointment that you can massage into your inflamed gums.
Using cold compresses and sucking on frozen treats (Popsicle, sorbet or ice cream) may also help soothe tender gums., Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) is a good anti-inflammatory that can combat pain and swelling associated with a symptomatic wisdom tooth. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is a good painkiller and a strong antipyretic, which means it can fight a fever, but it doesn't impact inflammation.The maximum daily dosage of ibuprofen and acetaminophen for adults is about 3,000 mg, but always read the directions that come with medications.


Taking too much ibuprofen (or taking it for too long) can irritate and damage the stomach and kidneys, so take the medication with food.
Taking too much acetaminophen is toxic and damaging to the liver. Alcohol should never be combined with acetaminophen., Using an antiseptic or antibacterial mouthwash can help treat or prevent infections and pain in the gums and teeth.Mouthwashes with chlorhexidine, for example, can help to both relieve swelling and pain, and keep your mouth free of infection. Ask your dentist or pharmacist for OTC recommendations. Whichever brand you choose, hold it in your mouth for at least 30 seconds and try to swish it around the back of your mouth where the erupting wisdom teeth are.


Swishing around the pericoronal flaps may also help remove any trapped food, plaque or debris.
Make a natural and inexpensive antiseptic mouthwash by adding a half-teaspoon of table salt or sea salt to a cup of warm water.Gargle for 30 seconds, then spit and repeat three to five times daily or as needed.
Gargling with diluted vinegar, fresh lemon juice, diluted hydrogen peroxide or with a few drops of iodine in water are all effective for combating infections in your mouth.
Wormwood tea is also a great adjuvant that helps gums fight with the inflammatory process.

Ask about laser treatment options.,
Look into dental implants.",How to Treat Periodontal Disease," Your dentists will examine your teeth and gums, take x-rays, and assess the extent of your gum disease by measuring the depth of periodontal pocket. She will then have you schedule a deep cleaning and give you instructions on oral hygiene and home care leading up to that appointment. It is very important that you follow these instructions carefully.


Your dentist may also refer you to a periodontist, a dental specialist who has received three additional years of training in treating and managing the effects of gum disease.;
, During deep cleaning, tartar is removed through scaling and root planing. Scaling removes tartar above and below the gum line where aggressive bacteria forms by scraping and ultrasonics. Root planing removes bacteria on the tooth root and may be done by laser.This sterilizes the area covered, but it is hard to control a laser during these types of procedures.


It is common to be nervous about the deep cleaning, but remember that it is an ’’extremely’’ important first step to treating a serious condition, and most people find it is quite tolerable. Many dentists offer anesthesia options for the deep cleaning, ranging from topical numbing gel, to numbing injections, nitrous oxide, and in some cases full sedation. If you are nervous, let your doctor know ahead of time, and speak up during the appointment if you experience pain or discomfort., Your dentist or periodontist may determine that antibiotics are necessary to treat your periodontal disease. After root planing, he may insert antibiotic chips in the gum pockets that will slowly dissolve and release medication to kill bacteria in a small area without influencing your entire body.He may also prescribe one or more of the following: oral antibiotics, a prescription antibiotic mouthwash, or a topical antibiotic gel to apply to your gums daily. Be sure to fill these prescriptions right away and use them as directed., After your deep cleaning, you will need to see your dentist more frequently so that she can measure the periodontal disease pockets and ensure that they are healing. If the disease is not improving sufficiently, she will then make recommendations for further treatment.


Your first follow-up will probably be scheduled for 1 month after your deep-cleaning, with additional check-ups every three months after that, until the disease has subsided., Begin with an 18 inch piece of floss. Wrap it around your two middle fingers leaving a gap of 1 to 2 inches in between. Then slide the floss between two teeth, and wiggle it up and down and back and forth, several times. Keep in mind that plaque and food can get stuck under the gum line, so this is what you want to target with the floss. Be sure to wrap the floss around each tooth, and floss all the way to your gums, extending as far as you can without causing discomfort. Then repeat the process on the next tooth, moving to a new section of the floss, as it becomes soiled or frayed. Make sure that once you have placed the floss between two teeth you are flossing two surfaces. Once you have this down, the entire process should only take two or three minutes per day.If you are unsure about your flossing technique, be sure to ask your dentist or hygienist for tips when you are in for your exam.

, Be sure to brush for at least two minutes per session, and pay special attention to cleaning the gum line. Any toothbrush will do, but electric toothbrushes are especially effective. Also be sure to use a toothpaste containing fluoride.


Since periodontal disease is a bacterial infection, some dentists also recommend a toothpaste that contains the antibacterial ingredient triclosan, such as Colgate Total)., If possible, acquire a dental irrigator such as a Water Pik, Hydro Floss, or similar tool, and use it twice per day. Although these devices might seem expensive, they are very good at fighting periodontal disease, and are a fraction of the cost of even a single dental cleaning.Dental irrigators last up to several years and they are great for gum massage, getting rid of plaque, or cleaning around dental implants

, This helps to reduce bacteria in your mouth and prevent further infection. If your dentist recommended a prescription mouthwash, use that, otherwise an over-the-counter brand will work fine. Just be sure to read the label and choose using a germ-fighting formula like Listerine or Crest Advanced.


You can also put mouthwash into a dental irrigator’s reservoir and then clean all around your mouth with higher pressure.
Be aware some prescription antibiotic rinses used for a prolonged period of time (more than two weeks) can cause tooth staining that can be removed during your next cleaning.

, Your dentist or periodontist may prescribe you antibiotic gel to apply to your gums twice daily after brushing, flossing, and irrigation. This gel kills bacteria, and will help get your periodontal infection under control., Taken by mouth, these antibiotics can help kill the periodontal infection and also prevent the forming of new bacterial colonies, especially after a surgical intervention. Make sure to take these antibiotics as prescribed.

, In severe cases, periodontal disease must be addressed with surgery. The most basic surgical option is called flap surgery, in which your dentist or periodontist will make an incision in your gums, lifting them back to clean and remove the tartar, infected bone, and necrotic cementum underneath. The flap is then sutured back into place, up against your teeth.


By creating a flap, oxygen can destroy a large number of aggressive anaerobic bacteria, which are almost impossible to eliminate even with deep scaling or cleaning.

, In severe cases, you may require gum transplants from palate, or synthetic membrane transplant called AlloDerm, to replace damaged gum tissue, and/or bone transplant or regeneration surgery to replace bone tissue that has been lost. These treatments are aimed at preventing as much tooth loss as possible, and to stop the advancement of periodontitis, which can have mutilating results., Recent studies have shown that laser surgery may be as effective as surgery at resolving periodontal disease in certain cases. Ask your dentist or periodontist if this might be an option for you, but be aware that this is a new field that is developing rapidly, and that many insurances may not yet cover this kind of treatment., In some cases, one or more of your teeth may be lost to periodontal disease. In these cases, you can have the teeth replaced with high-quality dental implants. Speak with your dentist or periodontist to determine if dental implants are right for you regarding your medical history or any other health issues.

Stay away from acidic foods and drinks.,
Eat remineralizing foods.,
Reduce your sugar consumption.,

Chew sugarless gum.",How to Treat Weak Tooth Enamel2," Acid can soften and wear away enamel on your teeth.If you drink or eat certain foods often, this can permanently weaken your enamel. Stay away from acidic foods and drinks such as: Citrus fruits such as limes and oranges
Lemonade
Beer
Soda
Coffee
Wine
Fruit juice (particularly cranberry, orange, and apple), Remineralization is the process in which minerals such as calcium and phosphorus start to rebuild in your enamel, helping restore the strength of your teeth.While remineralization cannot completely restore your enamel, it can help guard it against further decay and create an alkaline local environment. These foods also tend to encourage saliva production, which can help counteract the negative effects of acid. You can try eating:


CheeseMilkMeats
Nuts, Bacteria in your mouth feeds on sugar, which can cause cavities. By reducing your sugar intake, you can encourage the remineralization of your teeth, helping to strengthen your enamel.You can cut down on sugar by:


Replacing soda with water
Eating porridge or oatmeal instead of breakfast cerealEating fresh fruit instead of juice, smoothies, or fruit canned with syrupReading the nutritional labels on prepackaged food to see how much sugar there is per serving.

, Calcium is one of the primary minerals found in tooth enamel. Occasionally, your body may take calcium from your teeth to supplement other areas of the body that need it.You can get calcium from:


Dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt
Broccoli
Kale
Soy products
Sardines
Salmon
Supplements, Gum can help encourage the production of saliva in your mouth. Saliva neutralizes acid that can harm your teeth. Sugarless gum, particularly gum that contains xylitol, can be chewed between meals to help reduce decay.While normal gum can also produce saliva, the sugar may encourage bacteria growth, leading to cavities.

Brush and floss your teeth twice a day.,
Avoid biting tough surfaces.,
Quit smoking.,
Avoid grinding your teeth.,
Brush your teeth after vomiting.",How to Treat Weak Tooth Enamel3," You should brush your teeth once in the morning and once at night. Use a fluoride or desensitizing toothpaste and a brush with medium to soft bristles.You should floss your teeth at least once a day, especially before going to bed. Flossing will prevent the build-up of plaque, which can cause acid to stick to your teeth.Use a mouthwash rinse after flossing.


Over-brushing or brushing too hard can cause your enamel to weaken. Gently brush your teeth. If the bristles of your toothbrush are smashing against your gums, you are brushing too hard. You should feel the bristles lightly against your gums., Chewing hard substances can cause weakened teeth to chip or fracture. If your enamel is already weak, you will want to take extra care around hard items and foods. These can include:


Hard candies
Ice
Eating utensils
Sticky candy

, Smoking can dry out your mouth. Without that saliva, your teeth are vulnerable to acid erosion caused by the constant bacteria living in your mouth. Quitting smoking can help your mouth begin to produce saliva again. It can also improve your breath and overall dental health., Tooth grinding can wear down the enamel.If you know that you grind your teeth while sleeping, you should ask your dentist for a mouth guard that will protect your teeth. Stress management and behavioral therapy may also help., The acid in vomit can have a severe impact on your teeth. If you are sick, you should remember to always brush your teeth after you have vomited. Rinse out with water or mouthwash to flush it all out."

Stick to soft foods.,
Take over-the-counter pain medications.,
Use dental products designed to relieve pain.,
Try barrier products.",How to Take Away the Pain of New or Tightened Braces," If your braces are bothering you, try cold drinks. Ice cold water and cold juices or soft drinks can help ease the pain of your teeth and gums. Cold liquids can cause a numbing sensation in the mouth, resulting in a reduction of inflammation and pain., As cold drinks can provide pain relief, you could try cold foods to see if they have a similar effect. Try drinking chilled smoothies or eating ice cream or frozen yogurt. You can also refrigerate fruit, veggies, and other healthy foods so they're cool when you eat them. Cold fruits, like chilled strawberries, may have some effect on strengthening the gums.Do not, however, bite into any frozen foods, and avoid using your front teeth. Doing so may cause cracks in your enamel, which can be difficult to repair and increase sensitivity.

, Icing sore areas can decrease inflammation, lessening pain. Applying an ice pack to the outside of your mouth may reduce pain. Remember, do not apply a store bought ice pack directly to bare skin. Wrap it in a towel or cloth before use to avoid frostbite and other complications., A salt water rinse is an easy home remedy that help ease pain for some. It's quick and easy to use.


Mix about a half a teaspoon of salt into a glass of warm water. Mix until the salt is dissolved.Rinse your mouth with the solution for about 30 seconds and then spit it out into a sink.You can also rinse with chamomile tea, green tea, or ginger tea, which may have an anti-inflammatory effect. Rinse twice a day: for one minute in the morning and two minutes before going to bed.

, Teeth tend to be very sensitive after braces are tightened or adjusted. Softer foods can help reduce pain and irritation.


Go for foods that do not require much movement of the teeth. Things like mashed potatoes, smoothies, puddings, soft fruits, and soups are good options.Try to avoid spicy foods and hot drinks as these can cause gum irritation., Simple over-the-counter pain medications may reduce swelling, inflammation, and pain associated with new braces. Try using pain killers and see if you notice an effect.


Ibuprofen can help reduce pain and swelling associated with new braces. Take the medication as recommended on the bottle. Avoid alcohol when taking pain medications.If you're on any existing prescription medication, it is important to talk to a pharmacist to make sure over-the-counter meds will not interact poorly with whatever medication you're taking.

, Ask your orthodontist about special gels and medicines designed to reduce pain. There are many dental products that can ease the transition into new or tightened braces.


Several rinses and gels have medications in them that help ease pain. Follow all instructions when taking these medications. Ask your dentist if you have any questions about the medications.
Bite wafers are products shaped to fit your teeth. You bite down on these products for a set period of time, which encourages an increase in blood circulation that results in less pain. Chewing gum can also help reduce pain., Barrier products are designed to provide some separation between your braces, teeth, and gums. This can help prevent irritation that causes pain and soreness.


Dental wax is one of the most common and easy to use barrier products. Your dentist will give you a container of wax and you simply break off a piece and rub it on the areas that are sore. Make sure you take dental wax off before brushing your teeth as dental wax can get stuck in your toothbrush.There are also barrier products that are somewhat similar to whitening strips, known as comfort strips. You place a strip over your teeth and it forms a protective barrier between your braces, teeth, and gums. Ask your dentist about using comfort strips when you get your braces put in place."
"
Use numbing gels.,
Try over-the-counter pain medication.,
Avoid overusing medications.",How to Stop Wisdom Tooth Pain1," If your teeth are giving you issues, you can use numbing gels on your gums. These gels, which contain benzocaine, should be applied directly to your gums to help numb your toothache. Don't swallow the gel if possible, but spit the excess out instead.


10 % lidocaine spray is another option, but be careful not to spay it down your throat when you apply.
Make sure you follow the instructions on the tube to know how much to apply and how often.;
, When you tooth aches, you can take over-the-counter pain medication to help. These medications include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil), acetaminophen (Tylenol), and naproxen (Aleve).


Make sure to follow the instructions for dosage on the label., If you are in a lot of pain, be careful not to overuse either the gels or pain medications. Using too much gel with benzocaine can cause a rare but serious issue called methemoglobinemia, which is a deadly illness in which the oxygen levels your blood can carry are decreased.


Too many pain medications can also cause other problems, such as stomach issues and ulcers.
Never use benzocaine on anyone under two years of age."

Wear the retainer as instructed by your orthodontist.,
Remove your retainer before eating.,
Switch your retainer for a protective mouthguard during sports.,
Store your retainer properly.",How to Take Care of Your Retainer1," Depending on the condition your teeth are in, you may be instructed to wear your retainer at all times, except during times when the retainer might be damaged.If you've been wearing your retainer for a while, your orthodontist might allow you to switch to a part-time basis.Always follow the instructions your orthodontist gives you, and ask him/her if you have any questions.


Retainers generally need to be worn until your jawbone and gums stabilize around your teeth, which should now be aligned, and the roots of your teeth have reached the desired position.This takes time, and the exact length of time will need to be determined by your orthodontist.
Orthodontists will generally have patients wear their retainers full time (24 hours a day) for the same length of time that the patient wore braces.
After wearing the retainer full time for an initial period of time, your orthodontist may allow you to switch to only wearing it at night.;
, Eating food with a removable retainer in your mouth can damage the retainer and will almost certainly cause food to get stuck in your hardware. You should always take your retainer out before eating, and make sure you store it properly inside your retainer case., Any time there's a risk of your retainer being damaged or lost, you should take it out of your mouth. Make sure you store it safely in its case once it's out of your mouth, and be careful so you do not misplace your case or retainer.Wearing a protective mouthguard during sports is important, whether you wear a retainer or not.
You will not be able to properly fit a protective mouth guard over your retainer, and physical contact (even through the mouth guard) could damage your retainer and seriously injure your mouth.
If possible, avoid contact sports while receiving orthodontic treatment. Your entire bone structure is weaken during this time and any force can have a negative impact and may cause irreversible damage.
Some orthodontists recommend taking your retainer out when you go swimming. If the retainer somehow slips out of your mouth, it could easily be lost in the water., Any time you take your retainer out of your mouth, whether for eating, sports, or cleaning your gear, you should always store it properly. This will help ensure that your retainer is not lost or damaged.Never leave your retainer wrapped in a napkin, tissue, or paper towel. This can be easily mistaken for trash and thrown away by accident.
Always carry your retainer case with you wherever you go if you're wearing the retainer full time. Store your retainer in the case any time you need to remove it.
Do not leave your retainer in direct sunlight, including a parked car, as the heat may melt or warp the plastic.Never leave a retainer near a stove or heater for the same reasons.Avoid leaving your retainer lying around outside the case, even at home. It could get lost, or (if you have pets) your dog will likely try to chew on it — they are attracted to the smell of the retainer."

Feel where the wire has come loose.,
Find a small, dull object to push it back into place.,
Use the object to push the wire into place.,
Make sure the wire no longer rubs against your cheek.",How to Temporarily Fix a Loose Wire on Your Braces1," Wires can come loose over time, or due to chewy food. Make sure the bracket itself is still attached to your tooth. Also, make sure that the wire has not come completely out of the bracket.If the wire has come out of the bracket attempt to slide it back into place. You may need someone else to help you with this.
If the bracket has come off of your tooth as well, call your orthodontist to have it put back on.;
, Many things can be used for this purpose. You can use a pencil eraser, the back of a spoon, or a cotton swab. If you don’t have any of these on hand, look for another small, dull object to do the job.Make sure whatever object you use is clean. You never want to put something dirty into your mouth.
Cotton swabs are clean right out of the package.
You can wash your spoon with dish soap as you normally would.

, Gently slide the object into your mouth. You may need to look in a mirror to see what you’re doing. Press the wire back into place so that it sits close to your teeth once more.If you can’t see what you’re doing in the mirror, you can ask a friend or family member for help.
Be gentle as you push — the wire can slip out and pierce your cheek or gums. You don’t want to hurt yourself or knock another wire out of place.

, With your tongue, feel the area where the wire came loose. It should feel similarly to how it did before coming loose. If you have any discomfort or if the wire is scraping your cheek, you should try another method or book an appointment with your orthodontist."

Use a soft toothbrush.,
Massage your gums.,
Use an ice pack.,
Treat with salt water.,
Use apple cider vinegar.,
Try fresh salves.,
Use essential oils.,
Treat pain with a teabag.,
Try chilled food.,
Make an asafetida paste.",How to Stop Wisdom Tooth Pain2," When you are suffering from tooth pain, brushing your teeth may hurt; however, you should always brush your teeth twice a day. If you are experiencing issues with pain, get a soft toothbrush. This will be gentler on your gums.


You can go back to your normal toothbrush strength after your wisdom tooth pain goes away., If your teeth are coming through, your gums may hurt. To help your teeth along, try massaging the gums around where the teeth are breaking through. This will help alleviate the pain and ease the teeth through your gums.


When massaging your gums, gently rub the top of the erupting tooth with a clean finger. You can also wrap your finger into a sterile gauze and start the massage after you have rinsed with a chlorhexidine mouthwash.
Also get as much of the sides of the tooth area.
Don’t massage them too hard. This can hurt your gums.
Repeat three to four times a day., If you are experiencing pain, try holding an ice cube or some crushed ice on the tooth. This will only work if the tooth is not sensitive to cold. You can also wrap the ice in a cloth or latex casing, such as a small balloon or finger of a latex glove, and place that on your tooth instead.


If both of these are too cold, use an ice pack on the side of your face to help ease the pain in your mouth. The cold will travel through your skin and help the pain. Just make sure you wrap the ice pack in a towel or t-shirt to avoid frostbite., Salt is a great substance to help heal skin. To make a gargle, stir ½ teaspoon of sea salt into four ounces of warm water until it dissolves. Pour part of the mixture into your mouth without swallowing. Move the solution in your mouth over to where the painful tooth is. Hold it in your mouth for 30 to 60 seconds. Don't swish forcefully.


Spit the mixture out. Repeat it two to three times, or until the water is gone.
Once you’re done, rinse your mouth out with warm water.
You can do this three to four times a day while you are in pain., Mix ¼ cup of warm water and apple cider vinegar. Hold the solution in your mouth over the painful tooth for 30 to 60 seconds. Spit it out and repeat two to three times. Rinse with warm water. You can do this three to four times a day, but do not swallow the water-vinegar mixture.Stop using the mixture if you find it irritating.

, There are some fresh ingredients that you use to help with tooth pain. Cut a small piece of garlic, onion, or ginger. Place it in your mouth, directly over your painful tooth. Once it is there, gently bite down on the piece to release the juice.


The juice will help numb and calm your gums., Essential oils can help with your tooth pain. Use these on your fingers, then massage them into your gums with your fingers. You can also make a mouth rinse with a few drops of essential oils and a few ounces of water. Never swallow essential oils. They can be toxic. Good essential oils for tooth pain include:


Tea tree
CloveSage and aloe
Cinnamon
Goldenseal oil
PeppermintYou can also use warm olive oil and warm vanilla extract

, Tea has properties that can help with your pain. To make a tea compress, soak an herbal tea bag in warm water. Once the tea is steeped, put the tea bag over the tooth. Keep it in place for five minutes. Repeat this process two to three times a day while you're in pain. Good teas to use are:


Echinacea tea
Goldenseal tea
Black tea
Sage tea
Green tea, One way to help with pain is to use chilled pieces of food. You can put chilled pieces of cucumber or raw potato on your tooth. You can also use a frozen piece of fruit, such as banana, apple, guava, pineapple, or mango.


This won't work well for you if your tooth is sensitive to cold. Try the chilled cucumber or potatoes first because they will be less cold than the frozen fruit., Asafetida is a plant used in Indian cooking and traditional medicine.Visit an international or Indian grocery store to find this, which typically comes as a powdered or a lump of resin. To make the paste, mix ¼ teaspoon of the powder with enough fresh lemon juice to make a paste. Once it is mixed fully, apply the paste on your wisdom tooth and around the gum. Leave it on your gum for five minutes.


Rinse your mouth out with water to remove the paste from your mouth.
Repeat the application of the paste two to three times a day.
The paste will taste bitter and have an unpleasant odor, but it is gently combated by the lemon juice."

Learn about wisdom teeth.,
Know the causes of the pain.,
See your dentist.",How to Stop Wisdom Tooth Pain3," Wisdom teeth are the last permanent teeth to come in, with two on top and two on bottom. They generally show up between the ages of 17 and 25. Not every person get wisdom teeth and not all eruptions of wisdom teeth cause pain., There are situations that do make wisdom teeth cause pain. This can happen if they grow in at an angle.

Brush your retainer.,
Soak your retainer to keep it clean.,
Take steps to avoid letting your retainer dry out.",How to Take Care of Your Retainer2," You can and should brush your retainer every day, just as you brush your teeth. In fact, when you brush your teeth might be the ideal time to also brush your retainer. This will help keep your retainer clean and your breath smelling fresh.Remove your retainer from your mouth.
Rinse it under cool water from the faucet.
Add a pea-sized drop of toothpaste to your toothbrush and gently scrub away the built-up plaque and tartar.
Rinse the retainer thoroughly, then either pop it back in your mouth, let it soak, or place it in your case.

, In addition to brushing your retainer, it's generally a good idea to soak your retainer in some type of safe cleaner.Many orthodontists recommend using mouthwash or denture-cleaning tablets for soaking retainers; however, some orthodontists advise against these cleaning agents, as they contain chemicals like persulfate and alcohol that can damage your retainer and cause problems in your mouth.A safe alternative to harsh cleaning agents is to use baking soda. Simply mix two teaspoons into a small bowl of fresh, cool water and soak your retainer in that mixture.Avoid using vinegar, as it can corrode your wires and affect the plastic.You should also avoid bleach, as it may get absorbed in the porous plastic of your retainer.

, You may not realize it, but your retainer can dry out very easily. It's made to exist in your mouth, which is a consistently wet environment. Whenever you're not wearing it, your retainer should be soaking in water so that the plastic does not become damaged and dried out.Use a small bowl or cup full of water to soak your retainer when you're not wearing it.
Distilled water works best, as there will not be any harsh chemicals or pH imbalances to damage your retainer.
Always use cool or room-temperature water. Hot water can damage the plastic on your retainer, and should always be avoided.

Follow your orthodontist's recommendations.,
Avoid foods that might damage your retainer.,
Use floss threaders to floss around your teeth and retainer.,
Brush your teeth around the fixed retainer.",How to Take Care of Your Retainer3," Unlike a removable retainer, a permanent/fixed retainer cannot be taken out; however, you should carefully follow any instructions your orthodontist gives you for cleaning and caring for your fixed retainer. You will most likely receive special cleaning instructions, as well as details on what foods you can and can't eat.Most fixed retainers are worn full time for approximately five years;however, some may be kept on for life, depending on your teeth and your orthodontist's recommendations.Follow any instructions your orthodontist gives you, and let him know about any issues you may be having.

, Because fixed retainers are bonded to your teeth, there are certain food restrictions you'll need to follow in order to avoid damaging your retainer. These restrictions are generally the same as those applied to braces.Avoid hard/crunchy foods, as these may cause your retainer to break.Do not eat caramel, hard candy, or gum. These foods can get stuck to your wires and cause damage.
Cut down on sweets and soda in general, as sugary foods/drinks can increase the chances of tooth decay.
Try to avoid or reduce your consumption of high-acidity foods/drinks, including citrus and soda.

, You will need to floss your teeth with floss threaders to properly get between the teeth and above/below the retainer wire.A floss threader is essentially a stiff thread made of nylon with a small loop at the end. You'll use this threader to feed regular dental floss between your teeth and around your wires.Start with approximately 18 inches of regular waxed dental floss.
Slip one end of the dental floss through the floss threader and pull it until the threader is roughly in the middle of the floss.
Hold the threader up close against your teeth in the spot you're about to floss. Aim the threader slightly downward for your bottom teeth and slightly upward for your top teeth.
Reach into your mouth and carefully pull the threader through, then use the floss strand to floss like normal around your gums and under your retainer wire.
Take good care when cleaning in between teeth and try not to use hard toothpicks, as you may damage the fixed retainer.

, Brushing your teeth with a fixed retainer can be a bit tricky, since you can't just take the retainer out to brush like you can with a removable retainer; however, it's very similar to brushing your teeth with braces, which you may already have experience with.Use a soft-bristle toothbrush so you don't damage the hardware. Make sure you brush for a full two minutes, using up and down motions, just like you normally would.
Brush the backs and chewing surfaces of teeth as normal. While brushing the fronts of teeth, carefully brush along the gums, then above/below the retainer wire.
Rinse your mouth out thoroughly. Check your teeth in the mirror to make sure you didn't miss any food debris or plaque, and if you see anything remaining, start the process over again.
You can also use a proxabrush, which is shaped like a Christmas tree. These brushes are made for brushing between and around braces and retainer wires, which may make it easier to keep your teeth clean.Don't be too aggressive with these brushes, as you may cause the fixed retainer to bend or come off.

Create a small ball of dental wax.,
Dry your brace and the wire.,
Push the wax ball onto the wire.",How to Temporarily Fix a Loose Wire on Your Braces2," Dental or “relief” wax should be available from your orthodontist, or at your local drug store. Roll the wax into a ball that is about the size of a popcorn kernel or a pea. The wax should be easy to mold with your hands.If you can’t find dental wax at the store, and your orthodontist is unavailable, you can order it online.

, Use a paper towel to dry the brace and the wire. The wax will not stick well if the wire is very wet. Try to keep your mouth dry while you apply the wax by breathing through your mouth and not swallowing., Once the wax is on the wire, smooth it down over the end of the wire all the way to the bracket. This should make the end of the wire soft enough that it no longer irritates your cheeks or gums.The wax may fall out at some point. You can replace the wax as often as necessary until your orthodontist can fix the wire permanently.
Dental wax isn’t toxic or dangerous, so don’t worry if you accidentally swallow it.

Find a pair of small wire cutters.,
Sterilize the wire cutters with alcohol.,
Place your finger on the wire you plan to cut.,
Ask for help if you don’t feel comfortable.",How to Temporarily Fix a Loose Wire on Your Braces3," Braces wires can be very easy to cut. You won’t need anything very large. Choose a pair of wire cutters that can fit comfortably inside your mouth.Distal end wire cutters are best, since they will grip the cut piece of wire. This helps avoid the possibility of you swallowing part of the wire.
If you don’t have wire cutters handy you may be able to use nail clippers.

, Anything you put in your mouth should always be clean. Wipe the wire cutters down with rubbing alcohol before putting them into your mouth. You should also sterilize nail clippers if using those.Let the alcohol dry or evaporate before inserting the wire cutters into your mouth.
Use the wire cutters soon after cleaning them. If they lie around for a long time, they may be exposed to bacteria.

, This helps prevent the clipped part of the wire from flying into the back of your throat. You want to avoid swallowing the wire at all costs. Swallowing the wire can be painful and sometimes dangerous., It may be difficult to see and cut the wire by yourself. If there’s any chance you won’t be able to do the job neatly and without hurting yourself, ask a friend or family member for help.Avoid shaking the wire too hard or pushing with pressure on the back teeth while trying to cut the wire, as you can detach any of the brackets.
You can try looking in the mirror under a bright light. Not all wires will be visible or easily accessible to you.

To eat apples, carrots, and other healthy hard foods, cut them into small pieces before eating.;
, Foods like gummy bears, peanut butter, caramel, and dried fruit can all cause issues for braces. They are likely to get stuck in the braces, and you might break the braces trying to get the food out., Foods and drinks such as cake, candy, ice cream, pie, and soda don't do your teeth any favors. The bacteria that form plaque love sugar.Make sure you brush and floss after you eat foods or drink beverages high in sugar.

Eating sugary foods is especially a problem when you're wearing braces because plaque can build up in more places than normal, such as around the brackets."

Rubik's cube
Worry stone
Handheld games
Deck of cards

, Placing sticky notes in places that are part of your normal routine will keep you aware of your problem and, hopefully, help you remember not to touch your braces.

, Aversion therapy is where you train yourself out of a habit with a negative stimulus, like snapping a rubber band lightly on your wrist whenever you reach for your braces., This technique is often used for people who struggle with nail biting, but it might help you keep your hands out of your mouth if you wear a bad tasting nail polish. Other options to coat your fingers:


Lemon juice
Chili oil (use sparingly)
Hand sanitizer

Know that it won't hurt.,
Reward yourself for your bravery.",How to Stay Calm Before You Get Braces," Humans are naturally scared of what they don't know about. Since you don't know what will happen when you are getting braces, you are scared of it. When you go to get braces, you will first get x-rays of your teeth. Then, the orthodontist will take a metal stick with a hook at the end and take out your spacers/separators. Third, your orthodontist will take a metal circle and put it on your molar with a metal stick. Your orthodontist will keep on telling you to bite down on the metal circle until it is fitted around your molar, so your wires and brackets can be attached to it. If the circles fit well, then the orthodontist will take them out, if they don't he/she will keep trying until the appropriate size is found. Then your orthodontist will take a cement like substance and glue it to your teeth. After that, your orthodontist, will take the same metal stick with a hook at the end and glue brackets to your teeth. After all your brackets are on, then the orthodontist will put the wire in the brackets in your mouth. After your wires are put in, your brackets sort of snap and they will then tell you to pick a color, mostly they let you pick up to three colors and they will put in colors. Lastly, the orthodontist will give you your equipment and teach you how to use them.;
, They will talk to you and calm you down. Also, they will probably be a lot more gentle with you when they are putting the braces in since they know you are scared.

, They will tell you all about how to take care of braces. They will also probably tell you about when they first got braces.

, If your orthodontist says it won't hurt, your parents say it won't hurt, your friends say it won't hurt, and even this article says it won't hurt, then it won't' hurt. So quit worrying about it, why would people with braces walk around totally calm and happy if it did hurt? However, after about one or two days, it does start to hurt a little. Your mouth will be getting used to having the braces in. After that, it will get better.

, After you get braces, celebrate! Get yourself a yummy snack or desert. Just make sure your allowed to eat it now that you have braces.

Exercise your smile.,
Develop a more natural smile.,
Increase your flexibility and control.",How to Smile With Braces1," The best way to grow comfortable with smiling while wearing braces is to practice. Your facial expressions rely on a series of muscles in your face, so ""exercising"" your smile in front of a mirror can help you find a smile range that you're comfortable with.


Stretch the corners of your mouth outward, keeping your lips closed. Hold that pose for 10 seconds, then release it.Repeat the first stretch, but part your lips just enough to expose the line where your top row of teeth meet the bottom row of teeth. Hold that pose for 10 seconds, then release it.Stretch the corners of your mouth even farther outward until your lips part enough to expose roughly half of your teeth. Hold that pose for 10 seconds, then release it.Stretch the corners of your mouth as wide as you can, exposing all of your teeth. Hold that pose for 10 seconds, then release it.Practice these stretches in front of a mirror until you find a smile you're comfortable with, and continue to exercise your facial muscles until you have total control over your smile.;
, Once you've started exercising your facial muscles, the next step is to develop a more natural, comfortable-looking smile that won't look forced. One way to do this is to tone additional facial muscles.


Purse your lips, making them as big as possible while pulling in your cheeks.While keeping your lips pursed, try to simultaneously stretch the corners of your mouth outward, into a smile.Hold that pose just long enough that your facial muscles begin to feel fatigued. Then release it.Do not practice this exercise more than once a day, as excessive stretching may cause muscle strain. Over time, this stretch should help your smile look more natural and more radiant., Once you've practiced stretching and toning your facial muscles, you may want to work on gaining further control of your smile. One way to do this is by working other facial muscles while practicing your smile.Stretch the corners of your mouth outward as far as possible while keeping your lips closed.While holding that pose, try to wiggle your nose until you feel your cheek muscles begin to strain.Hold that pose for five seconds, then release. Repeat this exercise up to 10 times daily to develop a greater command over your facial muscles."

Food is easily trapped in braces, which can lead to tooth decay and could even damage your braces. Therefore, you should brush every time you eat., Before brushing, take off the interarch rubber bands. These bands usually connect the top of the mouth to the bottom, and you shouldn't confuse them with the small ligature bands (the colorful ones) that connect your teeth together. You need to remove them so you can get in and around them to brush your braces and teeth.If you have the clear, removable braces, you can just take them out and brush normally.

Remember, you should brush for two minutes each time.After you're done, be sure to rinse.
Be gentle when brushing because you can break wires if you're too rough. Clear ceramic brackets are also susceptible to breaking.Brush invisible braces separately. Just use a bit of toothpaste to brush them, and then rinse them off., Flossing with braces is a bit more difficult because the wires get in the way of the floss. However, a floss threader can help. You pull about five inches of floss through the loop of the threader, then pull the threader in where you can't get the floss (above the wire). Make it go between your teeth, then take the floss out of the threader to floss your teeth.A water flosser may also help.

, One way to practice smiling with your eyes is to look at photographs of other people exhibiting Duchenne smiles, then try to perform the same expression. You can easily find pictures online by searching for ""Duchenne smile"", and researchers have found that viewing a photograph of a Duchenne smile makes it easier to replicate that smile on command.


Practice in front of a mirror or camera.
Continue looking at Duchenne smiles and then practicing your own until you're able to smile with your eyes on command.

, Research suggests that some people are capable of achieving a Duchenne smile while imagining (or ""roleplaying"") certain events that were causes of happiness. Imagining or remembering a fun occasion with friends, greeting a friend, and receiving a good grade were all scenarios that caused some people to express a Duchenne smile.

, Some research connects laughter with a Duchenne smile. If you're having trouble replicating the Duchenne smile on command, you may want to try forcing a brief instance of laughter to form a Duchenne smile.

Buy dental floss with a threader.,
Brush your teeth.,
Use an antiseptic mouthwash.,
Limit hard foods.,
Avoid chewy and crunchy foods.,
Cut out candy and sweets.",How to Smile With Braces4," Some people with braces may feel uncomfortable smiling out of fear that there is something stuck between their teeth or braces. Flossing and taking special care of your teeth and braces can help remove that fear, giving you a confident, clean smile. It's important to floss, but some people with braces may find it difficult to work around the wires and brackets. Most makers of dental floss now offer floss with a stiff, straight end, called a threader, which can make it drastically easier to floss between your braces and gums.Look for floss threaders at your local pharmacy or grocery store.
If you cannot find pieces of floss with their own threaders, you can also buy a threader that can be used with ordinary dental floss to accomplish the same task. For this type of threader, use about 12 inches of dental floss to ensure that you can adequately feed the floss through your teeth.Work the floss in a c-shape. As you floss, try to form a c-shape against each tooth. Then work the floss up and down, scraping the sides of your teeth from every angle. This will help maximize the area covered by the dental floss.Floss after every meal to help keep a clean, bright smile., It's important to brush at least twice a day, but many dentists recommend patients with braces brush after every meal.In addition to your usual brushing routine, it's important to remember to brush around each and every part of your braces.Consider using an interproximal brush. It's a special brush built for people with braces that can easily slip underneath the wire of the braces., Mouthwash can be used at home or on the go, especially after meals. Mouthwash helps mask bad breath and may help kill or remove harmful bacteria that cause unpleasant odors.Use the cap of the mouthwash bottle to pour out a ""serving"" of mouthwash.
Pour the mouthwash into your mouth, but do not swallow.
Rinse vigorously, focusing on each quadrant of your mouth.If at all possible, try to avoid rinsing with water immediately after rinsing with mouthwash. Mouthwash will continue to kill bacteria in your mouth after you've finished rinsing with it, and rinsing with water too soon after you've used mouthwash may disrupt this process., Not only can hard foods lead to chipping or cracking of your teeth, but they're also prone to getting stuck underneath or between your braces. For this reason, it may be helpful to cut or break hard foods into smaller pieces before chewing., Foods like popcorn, hard candies, and licorice can easily get stuck in your braces, and could even cause damage to your braces.Stick with softer foods, including fruits and vegetables, to ensure your smile is in good shape., Sugary foods are known to cause acidic deposits in teeth, and can lead to bad breath, decalcification of teeth, and even tooth decay.Hard candy can also damage your braces.Try to avoid candy and sweets as much as possible to have a healthy, fuller smile.

Stock up on painkillers.,
Use an ice pack.,

Your doctor will tell you which ones are best for you and when to take them to reduce your pain.It will be much easier on your sensitive teeth.


Never take more than the recommended dose. Overuse of ibuprofen and aspirin can damage your stomach lining and cause severe pain and bleeding ulcers.

, Press an ice pack against your cheek until the swelling goes down. Icing will also temporarily numb your gums and relieve some of the pain.


If you don't have an ice pack, use a bag of frozen peas. Wrap the bag in a paper or cloth towel and gently press it on your cheek for up to 15 minutes. You can do this two or three times a day.

, Over-the-counter oral anesthetics like Anbesol or Orajel will numb any painful areas in your mouth, and keep them from hurting for a few hours. Put a small amount on a Q-Tip and rub it on your gums around sore teeth, or on any sores in your mouth. These medications taste pretty terrible, but it's a good way to get rid of the pain so you can sleep at night., Keep ice water handy at all times, and remember to drink it. You can also hold it in your mouth for a few minutes and swish it gently. The cold temperature helps numb the feeling of the metal rings on the sides of your tongue. Keeping yourself properly hydrated will also help speed the healing process.

Be realistic about the pain.",How to Relax Yourself Before Getting Braces," Go ahead and pig out, you’ll probably drool later on from all the foods you can’t have. Chew some bubblegum, eat the pizza crusts, enjoy some daffy taffy and caramel, and drink all the pop you can.


Treat yourself to sticky foods or hard foods. You won't be able to eat these while wearing braces.
Watch yourself. Don't overeat on these foods. Even though you may have to say goodbye to these foods for a few years, always make sure you are healthy.
Study up on foods that will damage your brace brackets. Also, your orthodontist will probably give you a list of foods to avoid.;
, If the toothpaste you like is of the tooth-whitening variety, you may not be able to use it with braces (you might have yellow patches when you take them off). So make the most of it now.


Take a test-brush. After you have brushed the way you normally do, take a test brush to get used to brushing with braces. Do the same for flossing.

, You may be a brace face for the next few years, so take as many pictures as you can, and enjoy yourself.

, Notice exactly what is wrong with your teeth that you are getting corrected. Is your vampire tooth all up there? Do you feel like a squirrel with your front teeth up front like that? Think about how soon, that will be gone, and you will have a perfect smile!

, Having braces tightened can make your teeth sore for the next few days, so think about all the ice cream, milkshakes and good soup you’ll eat! If your school or workplace has a mandatory cafeteria, only being able to eat soft foods will give you an excuse to bring your own lunch.

, If it really hurts, you can always take some pain medication, or tell your orthodontist that what he or she is doing is making you uncomfortable! Think of how everything will be okay, because it will be.

, If that is sweatpants and an XXL sweater, then go for it! Avoid makeup so you can rub your eyes and always bring a chapstick to your next appointment. Having a box set up with everything you will need on that day visiting the orthodontist can ease your peace of mind.

, If you think about it, the “smile makers” they use to open your mouth look kind of funny! Have a good laugh at your future self, dressed in an uncoordinated way and totally freaking out over completely nothing.

, Go outside or stay inside, make a craft, do anything! You can also hang out with a friend who makes you laugh.

, Also, being friendly towards him or her will have your orthodontist being more friendly towards you. You can ask him or her to explain how the whole process will work if that’s what it requires. Just make sure to not take up too much of your orthodontist's time, though, as he or she has other patients to attend to. Ask him or her for how long he or she studied, if he/she likes his job, and so on, it will help your peace of mind.

, Whether it’s altering your breathing, going for a stretch or just taking a walk, there are many methods to reduce stress. Try meditation, counting backwards from 50 and back again, singing nursery rhymes, carrying a stress ball, going to kick a punching bag, and even sleeping. All these will help calm them nerves.

, If you have an impatient nervousness towards the day you have braces, make time go faster by having fun. Or, you can even do something you completely despise, if that’s what it takes to take your mind off things.

, It means recording or videotaping yourself on a daily to weekly to monthly basis and tell the camera everything. Relying on an electronic device to tamper down your nervousness is a good idea. You can edit the video later and watch it when you do have braces, and respond to your past self. Were you hilarious, dead right, or were you obsessing over nothing at all? You’ll see!

, Take some pictures of a close-up of your mouth, print them out and glue them on a poster. Do this every month (or week) when you have braces, and finally, the final result when you have them off! Starting a project can be a great way to stop the stress.

, If you’re nervous, there is a reason. In this case, it’s brace-related. See whether you can relate to any of the next steps, then read how to stop feeling so nervous about each issue.

, If you’re nervous about looking nerdy, think about how that will open you up to a whole new society! If you love video games, and braces make you feel more connected to the online world, than be happy about it! If that worries you, realize that so many people who don’t necessarily game have braces, and that’s just a stereotype. Accessorize your braces by dyeing your hair to match them, and rock it! If people tell you you look nerdy, then prove them wrong. If you like the nerdy look, then good for you!

, If you’re nervous about braces looking bad on you, you can always consider alternatives. If you are a teenager or older, invisalign may be available. It is sort of like a plastic mold you place over your teeth, and it looks nearly invisible, although it is more expensive.


You can always consider clear ceramic braces, which are also a bit more costly, and a clear wire, so only people who look at you from up close will notice a thing.
And you should know that braces look awesome on anyone if you believe you look good. If you try to hide your smile, that will make people think you are very self-conscious, and they will pay more attention to what you are trying to hide. Smile and be proud! People who talk about you behind your back are not worthy of your friendship.

, If you’re worried about being alone in the braces community in your environment, go chat online with people who have braces! Metal in your mouth should not make you feel alone, but original. You are the only one in your neighborhood with braces. Be proud!

, If you’re nervous about not being able to eat the stuff you normally do, realize that most of the no-no foods list are bad for your health and make you gain weight more. You will eat healthier without realizing it, and think of the consequences if you eat those foods to help make you feel better.


Taffy can get stuck in your braces and make you look like a slime monster. Chewing on hard things will take some brackets off, therefore having you visit the orthodontist more frequently.
Soda will emphasize the white patches where your brackets used to be even more, and it’s full of sugar, so you pretty much are cutting yourself off from all the unhealthy stuff! If you are worried about friends chewing gum or eating popcorn in front of you, there are always alternatives!
Usually, sugar free gum can be chewed while braces are on, and brands like Pirate’s Booty popcorn do not have the seeds in them, therefore you can have!
And caramel; think of it as melted sugar (which it pretty much is) when others eat it in front of you, and think of holes in their teeth when they eat too much. Suddenly, you are glad you are restricted from those things.

, If you’re nervous about the future pain you might endure, know that actually getting your braces on for the first time does not hurt. The glue they put on your teeth may taste bad, but it’s harmless! The only pain you will feel is the soreness of your teeth after your wires get tightened, and that’s just because of the tension in your teeth. Enjoy cold foods while this happens, such as ice cream, or suck on ice (don’t chew) and carry an ice pack. The pain, if any, is extremely bearable, and you can always consider over-the-counter painkillers.

Take good care of your braces.",How to Prepare on the Day You Get Braces," This holds especially true if the thought of getting braces makes you feel afraid, nervous, or reluctant. Braces will help to straighten your teeth and improve your smile. No matter what, this will raise your confidence. Also remember that lots of people have or have had braces—you’re not alone.;
, Although metal wire braces are probably the most traditional and widespread type of braces, there are other options. Sometimes you can choose which type of braces to get.


Clear teeth aligners are an alternative.These are made of a transparent plastic material that are made to fit your specific teeth. A sequence of different sets are applied to gradually shift your teeth into position. Aligners can be easily removed so that you can eat and drink normally and no one will even notice you are wearing them.
Lingual braces, which fit on the inside surface of your teeth, are another option. However, keep in mind that these braces are more expensive since they are made of gold.
Each of these types of braces has advantages and disadvantages, and not every type is right for every person. Talk to your orthodontist if you have questions about the different types.

, If you are getting metal wire braces, you may get to choose the color of their brackets and/or rubber bands.This can be fun, and a way to personalize your braces. For instance, you could:


Choose your favorite color
See if you can use more than one color
Choose a seasonal color(s) (like black and orange for Halloween!)
Choose the color(s) of a school or sports team

, The process of getting metal braces is fairly quick. The orthodontist will glue small brackets to your teeth, and then insert wires to connect the brackets. You might feel a little pressure on your teeth as these parts are put on, and your mouth might feel a little sore for a few days, but this should go away quickly.Talk to your orthodontist if you have questions about how it will feel.


You can also ask people who have already had braces about their experiences. This may provide some answers to your questions and it may also help you to feel motivated about getting braces because you can see other people’s end results.

, In the first few days after your braces are put on, you will want to eat only soft foods. During the time that you have to wear braces, you will have to avoid hard, crunchy, chewy, and sugary foods and drinks. Enjoy some of these before getting your braces, if you want, since it might be a while before you can have them again.

, You might have to wait a while at the orthodontist's office. Having something to keep you interested and busy while you wait will put your mind at ease, and help to pass the time.

, Because of the pressure on your teeth and the adjustment time needed, you will want to stick to soft foods for the first few days after getting braces. .Try things like smoothies, mashed potatoes, ice cream, yogurt, etc.

, The wax designed for braces can coat the wires so that they don’t irritate your mouth. You can ask your orthodontist for some, but you might also want to get extra for the first few days and afterwards.This wax is sold under various product names, like ""orthodontic wax"" ""braces wax,"" ""wax for braces,"" or ""dental wax."" It is widely available at pharmacies.
It’s always a good idea to have a supply of wax with you. That way, if one of the wires accidentally breaks, you can coat it with wax to keep it from poking you until your orthodontist can fix it.
Braces can also cause soreness from rubbing on the inside surface of your cheeks or lips in the first days of wearing them, so covering them with wax may be helpful.

, An over-the-counter pain reliever can ease any discomfort your braces cause in the first few days. Make sure you have a supply before the braces are put on, just in case you need it., You will have to see a dentist for assessment before ever getting braces, so ask ahead of time if you have questions about what is involved. If you still have questions on the day the braces are put in, or haven’t had a chance to ask them, talk with your orthodontist before starting the procedure. If you have any questions at any step of the way while your braces are being put in, ask.

, Having a sense of what is going to happen as the braces are put on can ease your mind. Traditional wire braces are applied in several steps:


First, bands will be placed on your back molars. At this point, you might start to feel some pressure on your teeth.Next, a bracket made of metal or ceramic will be attached to each of your teeth.These brackets will be used to support the wires of the braces. Glue will be used to adhere the brackets to your teeth—it might not taste good, but it is harmless.You might get to choose the color of these brackets.After that, the orthodontist will place wires in the tops and bottoms of the brackets. These wires help to gradually move your teeth into position during the time that you wear the braces. The wires will be cut so that they don’t poke the inside of your mouth.Next, small rubber bands will be inserted to keep the wires in the brackets. You might get to choose the color of these bands.If you are getting clear teeth aligners, these will be fitted to your particular teeth, and can be removed to eat. They look similar to the custom made whitening trays used for the home whitening treatment. You’ll have to get a new set of aligners every two weeks., At first, you will be very conscious of the fact that you are wearing braces. As time goes on, you will get more used to it. Still, you should know that in the first few days:


You might feel a dull pain because of the pressure on your teeth.This pain is caused by the metal wire pulling on the brackets. You can take an over-the-counter pain reliever to ease this.This discomfort will go away.
You will have to remember to eat only soft foods at first., Since your braces might make your mouth sore at first, you will probably want to take it easy for a while. Aside from taking pain relievers to avoid soreness, you might want to avoid talking too much and other activities that might cause discomfort.


If you play a wind instrument (brass or reed), you will still be able to with braces. However, there will probably be an adjustment period needed to get used to the feeling of playing your instrument with braces.You also might want to avoid playing your instrument for the first few days after your braces are put in.

, Living with braces can mean some long-term adjustments. Knowing about this ahead of time will make the whole process easier.


You will have to avoid hard, chewy, crunchy, and tough foods, as well as sugary foods and drinks while you have braces. Ask your orthodontist about specific recommendations regarding what is ok to eat, and what is not.You might be asked to wear headgear. Headgear is a rigid wire that hooks onto the bands of your braces and around your head. It helps to either move your teeth into position, or keep them there. Usually, you are only asked to wear headgear at night, if at all.Your braces will have to be adjusted periodically, according to a schedule your orthodontist develops. Your teeth will move gradually into position, and your orthodontist will have to adjust the braces as they do.Most people wear braces between one and three years.After your braces come off, your orthodontist might ask you to wear a retainer for a while. This is a rigid piece of material that fits behind your teeth., Just as you would normally need to take care of your teeth, you will have to regularly brush and rinse your teeth and braces.Ask your orthodontist for any special tips for keeping your braces and teeth clean.


Food particles can get caught in your braces. Be extra sure to brush well around all the parts of the braces (especially after meals) to avoid plaque buildup and tooth decay. You will need to spend extra time brushing every bracket going from the back of your mouth to the front. Make sure you brush every tooth thoroughly and use dental tools to get between your teeth, such as an interdental brush, floss, and an oral irrigator.
Rinsing with mouthwash will also help to keep your teeth and braces clean. Your dentist might also ask you to use a fluoride rinse for extra protection.
You will need to floss using a special flexible plastic “threader” that can get around the parts of the braces. These are widely available at pharmacies."

This is a big moment! There is no fixed time, but your orthodontist will tell you in advance of your visit. If you are unsure you can call and ask.


Once you know when your braces will be removed you can read a few stories of other people's experiences.You can also find videos of the procedure online.
Remember everyone's experience is likely to be a bit different.;
, Although your orthodontist might have told that you will be getting your braces removed in your next visit, there is a chance that when you arrive they will tell you the removal has to be postponed. Your orthodontist has given you their best estimate, but it's not foolproof.


It's possible that your teeth may have moved around unexpectedly between trips to the orthodontist.
Or, they may have not moved enough and require a little more time with the braces.Even a week or two can make a huge difference in the end result.
If this happens, don't get too dispirited. They will come off, it's just a waiting game.

, Throughout the whole period you have been wearing braces you should have maintained a high level of dental hygiene. How your teeth look without braces will depend on how well you have looked after them.If you have done a bad job you may find yellow tartar marks on your teeth called ""white scars"".Don't let your dental hygiene slack off when you see the end is in sight.

, It can be nice to take a few photos of yourself in your last days with braces. You can use these as a ""before"" picture and compare it to the new you after you have had your braces removed. Getting braces is a big deal, and so is getting them taken off, so you should document this transition in your life.

, There is no fixed amount of time it will take to have your braces removed. One thing you can be sure of though, is that it will be much quicker than when you had them attached.Expect to be in there for around an hour for all the braces to be taken off and all the follow-up work to be done.Just removing the braces could take only a few minutes.After the braces are off there is more work to be done by the orthodontist.

, To remove your braces your orthodontist will use special pliers to gently squeeze each individual bracket. This will separate the bracket from the tooth. Most often the bracket will come off in one piece, and they will repeat this for your whole mouth. Some ceramic brackets are designed to break apart as they are taken off your tooth.If you hear some cracking noises or other odd sounds, just know that this is absolutely normal. Don’t worry if you hear anything like this.
If you have bands across individual teeth, the dentist will remove these with pliers.You will feel some pressure when the brackets or bands are removed but little or no pain., After the braces are off, there will be some left over residue of the glue or cement on your teeth. Your orthodontist will get to work scraping this off with a special instrument. Typically, this cleaning shouldn't take more than around five minutes depending on how much glue you have on your teeth.Depending on your teeth, you may feel a little sensitivity during this process.
You'll be desperate to see your new teeth, but be patient!

, After your braces have come off and your teeth have been cleaned from the excess glue, your orthodontist will most likely begin to make a mold for your retainer. Almost all people who have had their braces removed need to wear a retainer afterwards.In some cases retainers can be fixed, meaning that your orthodontist will bond a metal or fiberglass wire behind your front teeth.
The orthodontist may make the mold for your post-braces retainer around a week before the day you get them removed.Or they might do it week after.

, Don't be surprised when your orthodontist begins to measure you up for your retainer. It is important to have a retainer to hold your teeth in their new positions, and often an orthodontist will recommend wearing a retainer for years after your braces come off.But the time varies from person to person.You will need to take good care of your retainer.

The retainer might feel awkward in your mouth, and you may find it hard to speak, or discover that you are speaking with a lisp.The best way to deal with this is to speak and sing a lot so that you get used to the retainer.
Do this, and your lisp should disappear in a few days.If you find you have some excess drool or saliva don't worry, this is part of the adaptation and should go in a few days.Make sure you use your retainer according to your orthodontist's indications. After a while, you will only have to use it during the night.

, Don't dive straight into all the chewy food you couldn't eat with braces. Allow your teeth some time to adapt and heal. Talk to your orthodontist about how to care for your teeth after the braces have come off. The more closely you follow the orthodontist's guidance the better off your teeth will be, and the sooner you will be able to get rid of the retainer as well.The newly exposed enamel with be extra sensitive and dry, so wait at least a month before any whitening or bleaching treatments.Speak to your dentist about a safe way to whiten any stains on your teeth left from the braces.There are many ways to whiten your teeth including some home remedies that do not use chemicals.

Go for gum lifting.",How to Straighten Your Teeth Without Braces," Crowding and inward overlapping of the teeth is caused by gentle, regular inward pressure on the teeth. One of the most common causes of this is sleeping on your stomach, which also places a lot of weight on your face and causes a significant amount of inward pressure on your teeth. This pressure is worsened if you put your arm or something firm under your head while sleeping on your stomach and face. Even if it is your preferred sleeping position, try to sleep on your back or side in order to prevent slowly repositioning the teeth inward., With many people working or studying at a desk for long periods of time throughout the day, this issue is a common result of poor posture. When you slump forward at your desk and rest your face in your hand, this causes a lot of persistent pressure on one side of the jaw. This pressure can slowly push the teeth inward, resulting in crooked teeth on one side of the face.To help avoid this, try to realign your posture by making sure you are sitting flat on your bottom instead of rolled back towards the lower spine. Aligning your lower body will help position your upper body better to avoid neck fatigue and needing to rest your face in your hands.

, In addition to constant inward pressure causing crooked teeth, you can also cause crooked teeth by putting outward pressure on the mouth. This is most common in children who suck their thumbs excessively; however, many teens and adults are also guilty of habits that cause outward pressure. Using straws, chewing on pens, and blowing bubbles with gum all use a similar pressure to thumb sucking and can cause outwardly crooked teeth. Try to break any habits that put outward pressure on the teeth.If you can’t stop using straws, then at least be sure to position the straw toward the back of the mouth and not resting against your teeth.

, While it is normal for baby teeth to fall out and make way for permanent teeth, losing permanent teeth as an adult can cause issues, including crooked teeth. Adults may lose teeth due to extractions, dental problems, injury, or permanent teeth never descending after the baby teeth fall out. The gap that is left from the missing tooth puts more pressure on the existing teeth due to an unequal force distribution when chewing takes place. This can cause them to shift and become crooked. Closing the gap with braces, dental bridges, dental implants, or partial dentures will disallow the existing teeth to shift and become crooked.Movement of teeth into existing gaps is also the result of a natural process called ""mesialization"" which means that teeth have the tendency to come forward.

, While some research shows that allowing your wisdom teeth to come into the mouth rather than having them removed does not cause other teeth to become crowded, this is not a universal truth for all mouths. If your wisdom teeth erupt in a different position than they should or your teeth are already crowded, wisdom teeth can quickly cause significant repositioning of teeth.Regular trips to the visit and x-rays of the mouth and jaw will reveal early on the likelihood of this happening to you, and you should get your wisdom teeth removed when your dentist says to. Putting this off will only result in pain (including infections and difficulty chewing) and the possibility of crooked teeth.

, It is important to pinpoint what you would like to change about the appearance of your teeth first so that you articulate your goals to an orthodontist. Some treatment options can only address certain dental issues, so having a clear picture of what you want your teeth to look like afterward is key.

, Dentists and orthodontists are different: in addition to dentistry, orthodontists are also training in the complex development of teeth and facial form. It is important to meet with an orthodontist to determine a treatment plan, not a dentist. It is also important that they are board-certified because it ensures that they are licensed with the highest level of comprehensive treatment and training.In complex cases, an orthodontist may require the help of an oral surgeon or maxillofacial surgeon in order to establish a full treatment plan.

, You may have done some research on your own, but the only person who can tell you exactly what your options are when it comes to dental appliances is your orthodontist. Sometimes braces are the only option for your dental needs. If they’re not, discussing the other treatments with them and listening to their advice is essential. Some helpful questions to ask include:What is involved in the proposed treatment plan, and what are some consequences if I choose to not move forward with one of these options now?
How do you determine the cost of treatment and what billing options are available? Also, what insurance plans do you accept?
What kind of post-treatment follow up is expected for this treatment option?
Do you provide patient references or any before-and-after pictures of your work?

, It is recommended that you get two to three opinions before moving forward with a given treatment plan, especially if it’s recommended that you get teeth extracted or if your case is a complicated one. Many orthodontists push braces even when there are other available options, but experts agree that there is usually no “one right way.” Meeting with a few orthodontists will help you find one you are comfortable with and can afford.

, Once you have chosen an orthodontist you trust, a post-consultation appointment will be scheduled. During this appointment the orthodontist will take a mold of your mouth and you will also have panoramic x-rays taken of your face and jawline. Using the mold and x-rays, the orthodontist will be able to determine exactly what needs to be done to fix your smile and can explain the details of various treatment options.Using this information, you can then consider your options and choose the best treatment for you.

, Clear aligners are a series of tight-fitting, custom-made retainers that slip over the teeth and slowly realign them. Because children’s mouths are still growing and developing, clear aligners are best for teens or adults whose mouths are no longer shifting. This treatment option is also typically used for patients with issues like mild to moderate crowding or spacing issues, and not for the treatment of severe underbites, overbites, or more complex problems. Treatment with clear aligners typically takes 10 – 24 months, and costs $5,000 – $8,000 depending on the length of treatment. Some other considerations include:One advantage is that clear aligners can be taken out, which makes it easier to clean them and maintain oral hygiene.
Another advantage is that the clear aligner is less obvious than traditional braces. If you are concerned with the appearance of traditional braces, this is a good option.
Clear aligners require patients to be extremely compliant with wearing them. Not wearing them enough will result in a longer treatment period.

, Lingual braces are similar to traditional braces except that they are placed on the back of the teeth. They use the same system of wires to gradually tighten and straighten the teeth, and are typically worn for anywhere from six to 24 months, depending on the complexity of treatment. This treatment option is best for people ages 10 and up who have moderate to extreme spacing issues. Like clear aligners, it is a great option for people who want a discreet option, because lingual braces are hard to see. They are much more expensive than traditional braces though, costing about $6,000 – $13,000 depending on the complexity and length of treatment. Also keep in mind:


One reason they are so expensive is because the material used is gold, which adapts perfectly to the inner shape of your teeth.
They can initially be rather uncomfortable and it will take some time to adjust to them. Many people experience irritation from contact between the brackets and the tongue.
Nonpermanent speech impediments and lisping is very common with lingual braces.

, Also known as a rapid maxillary expansion appliance or an orthodontic expander, palatal expanders are used to widen the upper jaw so that the upper and lower teeth fit together better. It consists of a screw attached to the teeth with bands, and when you turn the screw with a key the upper jaw is widened. This widening helps with overcrowding by creating space for the teeth to move naturally into their correct positions. It works best in children and teenagers younger than 15 years old because the bones of the upper jaw are still pliable. Palatal expanders tend to cost around $1,000 – $3,000, depending on the length of treatment. Keep in mind:Once the expansion is complete, the expander remains in the mouth for about three months to stabilize the teeth and palate (which has a weakened bone structure after expansion) before being removed.
Palatal expanders require frequent visits to the orthodontist, who uses a special key to expand the palate in increments.
Palatal expansion can be very painful at times and can sometimes cause nonpermanent speech impediments and mouth irritation.

, Retainers can be fixed or removable, and they are made for the upper or lower arches of the mouth to brace and straighten teeth. Typically retainers are used to maintain the position of your teeth after treatment with braces or clear aligners; however, retainers are also used sometimes to correct minor misalignments for patients of all ages.Retainers typically cost $500 – $2,500 depending on the complexity and length of treatment.
Fixed retainers are adhered to the back of the teeth so they are discreet.
Removable retainers are easy to clean in order maintain oral hygiene.

, Also known as porcelain veneers or lumineers, dental veneers are porcelain caps that are placed on top of your existing teeth. They are ideal for patients who have gaps between teeth, fractured teeth, crowded teeth, or discoloration. The orthodontist removes a thin layer of tooth enamel, and then affixes specially selected veneers to your teeth using light-sensitive resin. The procedure can usually be done in one sitting, so the results are immediate.


Veneers are very expensive, typically costing about $500 – $1,300 per tooth.
This option is rarely done for anyone other than adults, as the shape of the face often determines the appropriate veneer size, and children and teens are still growing.

, Also known as tooth reshaping, dental contouring is done by sanding away areas of tooth enamel or using tooth-colored resin to fix the shape of teeth. This is typically only for adult-age patients, as this option is a permanent contouring of teeth, which might not be appropriate for growing teens and children. Since this is considered a fine filing, dental contouring is only used to shorten teeth or to correct slightly crooked, chipped, or cracked teeth.Dental contouring is done in one procedure and typically costs about $50 – $500 per tooth depending on the amount of work needed.
Also keep in mind that contouring with composite resin is not as long lasting and may require re-contouring.

, This device helps in straightening teeth by correcting your jaw imperfections. The appliance has a metal extension which is attached to the molars develops the lower jaw in a forward direction which helps in correcting the bite. This allows the lower and upper jaw to meet which is needed to straighten your teeth.


You have to wear this appliance for one year to allow the lower jaw to shift into the correct position.
These appliances are not discrete and take time to give better results.

, Another appliance used to straighten teeth. This appliance places pressure against the upper teeth and jaw that helps in moving the jaw and teeth into position.


You have to wear the headgear daily for a specified number of hours for improved results.

, In this treatment, a tooth-colored resin material is used that is shaped and applied to your teeth using adhesives. It gives the appearance of straighter teeth.


This treatment is meant for minor or temporary correction of teeth defect.
It is also prone to staining.

, This treatment can drastically improve your smile. It raises and sculpts your gum line to showcase your teeth. If you do not have enough teeth, too much bare gum or asymmetry in the gum line, you can consider gum lifting.


This treatment is not suitable for everyone.
The cost can range from $300 to $600 per tooth for a simple procedure.

Cutting the tongue can be a painful and frightening experience, so help whoever is injured to relax. Keeping both yourself and the injured calm will help as you treat the injury.;
, Before touching or helping anyone with a cut, you should wash your hands to reduce the chances of infection. You may also want to use medical gloves when aiding the victim, as blood can carry diseases., By sitting up straight and tipping the mouth and head forward, blood can flow out of the mouth, rather than down the throat. Swallowing blood can cause vomiting, and sitting up with the head tilted forward will help prevent this., A cut to the tongue will likely produce a lot of bleeding, however, it is the depth and size of the injury you will examine. If the cut itself is shallow, you can proceed with home treatment.If the wound is deep or longer than ½ an inch, your should seek medical attention.
If something has punctured your tongue, it may require professional care.
If you suspect foreign material has become lodged in the wound, you need to see a doctor.

, Use gauze or a clean cloth to apply steady pressure to the injury for about fifteen minutes. This will help stop the flow of blood. If you notice blood has soaked through the cloth or gauze, apply more, without removing the original piece., Wrap an ice cube in a clean, thin, cloth. This will be held against the wounded area to reduce blood flow and prevent pain and swelling.Hold the ice bundle directly on the wound for no more than three minutes at a time.
This can be done up to ten times a day.
You may also simply suck on an ice cube or hold one in your mouth.To make the application of ice more enjoyable, you can try using a popsicle.
Apply ice only on the first day of the injury.
Make sure both your hands and the cloth are clean.

, The day after the injury is sustained, you should begin rinsing your mouth with a warm salt water solution. This can be done up to six times a day.Rinsing your mouth helps keep the wound clean.

, If your teeth have not been injured as well, you may continue regular dental hygiene, such as brushing your teeth. Make sure there were no injuries to your teeth before continuing any brushing or flossing.Do not brush or floss injured or broken teeth.
If you have also suffered a dental injury, see a dentist as soon as you can., As the injury heals, you should monitor its progress. Look for any signs that it may not be healing correctly or if another issue is arising. Seek medical attention if you notice any of the following signs:If blood flow doesn't stop after ten minutes.
If you develop a fever.
If the wound is excessively painful.
If you notice pus coming from the wound.

, Chances are that a cut tongue will be sore and sensitive. For a few days after the tongue is cut, you may want to change what foods your eating. This can help reduce discomfort and prevent possibly injuring your tongue further.Avoid eating foods that are hard. Opt for soft foods instead.
Try to avoid foods that are extremely hot or cold.

, Most cuts to the tongue should heal without trouble. After first aid and general care has been given, the final step is to simply wait for the injury to heal. Exactly how long the time it takes to heal will depend on how severe the injury is.

Treat the TMJ.",How to Stop Tooth Nerve Pain1," When you have tooth nerve pain, you may want to try some over-the-counter pain medication. You can try aspirin, ibuprofen (like Advil), acetaminophen (like Tylenol), and naproxen (like Aleve).Make sure to follow the instructions and dosage guidelines on the label.;
, Tooth nerve pain commonly involves inflammation around the base of the tooth in the pulp of the tooth. While this inflammation can often be treated, there are some red flags that should alert you to get professional dental care. These include:Worsening or any pain with chewing
Sensitivity to temperature lasting longer than 15 seconds after the cold or hot source has been removed
Bleeding or discharge from around a tooth or gums
Swelling around a tooth or swelling of the jaw or cheek
Fever
Injury or trauma to the area especially if the tooth is broken or loosened

, You can use use many at home treatments for tooth nerve pain. However, if these approaches do not provide relief within one to two days, call your dentist for professional treatment. Your condition may be severe and require medical treatment.If you develop any signs of pain, bad breath, difficulty swallowing, jaw, gum or mouth swelling, or fever, call your dentist right away, as you may need emergency medical attention.

, When you go to the dentist, your dentist will do an exam. At first, the dentist will perform a complete exam and possibly take x-rays to look for new cavities, cracked or broken tooth enamel, or broken teeth. They will also check old fillings and remove those that are loose or broken.Your dentist will also check your gums for any signs of inflammation, bleeding, or a need for a deep cleaning. Your dentist will also check for any abscesses, impacted wisdom teeth, and any signs of bruxism, clenching or grinding of the teeth usually done while you sleep. If none of these seem to be a problem, your dentist will check your sinuses as well as your TMJ.
If you have any cracked, broken, or impacted teeth, bonding or tooth extraction might be needed if the tooth cannot be saved. If an abscess is causing your tooth pain, it may be necessary to perform a root canal, after your dentist removes the infection through a small cut in your gum and you go through a course of antibiotics.
In a root canal, a hole is drilled into the tooth and the infection is physically removed. The area within the tooth is then cleaned and the tooth is repaired with a filling.

, Gum disease may be the cause of the tooth pain. It is important to treat gum disease early. Gum disease can precede more serious dental diseases, chronic diseases, and even other more general problems. It is important to deal with gum disease as soon as possible.In deep cleaning, most often the first step in treating gum disease, the areas beneath the gums are cleaned with dental tools, removing bacteria and plaque, as well as hard pieces of calculus and necrotic cement, which are the main source of gum swelling.
You will also likely be given some extra training in brushing and flossing your teeth, as well as given a remineralization solution to use as directed.

, TMJ may also lead to tooth pain. If this is the cause of your tooth pain, there are a number of treatment approaches that may be taken:


Anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen can be taken for the pain.
Sometimes, anti-depressants and/or muscle relaxing agents are prescribed for TMJ. These are often used as a short-term approach to TMJ.
Mouth guards can be used to treat TMJ, especially if you are grinding or clenching your teeth.
Physical therapy exercises can be done to strengthen the jaw.
Counseling may be considered to reduce stress and to teach various relaxation techniques.
Surgery may be needed in severe cases of tooth pain due to TMJ.
TMJ TENS aims for muscular relaxation after applying electrical stimulation on the main muscles that cause grinding problems.
Botox injections can be surprisingly helpful, as long as they are given by specialists.

You can also try listening to a funny book on tape. Pick something that's funny or soothing to you. However, make sure you can still hear the orthodontist over what you're listening to., Some dental offices have installed screens above the patient's chair. When you stare up at the ceiling, you'll have something to distract you from what's going on in your mouth. Call around to various dentists to see which ones offer that amenity., Most dentists and orthodontists are adapt at chattering away at their patients. Many use this technique with kids and young adults, so look for a family orthodontist if you are wanting someone who can distract you while you're having your teeth worked on., Pick something you love to do, such as going to the movies. Tell yourself that when the orthodontist is done, you will take yourself to the movie.

Let nature take its course.,
Expect a little blood .,
Apply clean, damp cotton gauze for fifteen minutes.,
Keep your child’s head elevated, with her face tilted slightly down.,
Don’t keep rinsing the child’s mouth out.,
Contact your child’s dentist if active bleeding continues beyond fifteen minutes.",How to Stop the Bleeding After You Pull out a Loose Tooth1," When a removed baby tooth does cause more than a minor amount of bleeding, that is usually a sign that it was removed unnecessarily early. Allowing the tooth to loosen naturally to the point where it falls out with only the slightest intervention is almost always the recommended and most painless (and bloodless) method.Instead of grabbing the floss and yanking the tooth out like your father may have done, encourage your child to wiggle the tooth free by himself. The tongue is the best tool for the job, and a gentle rocking motion will typically do the trick eventually.
If you need to help your child with the task, pinch the tooth between your thumb and first finger with a cotton gauze pad covering the tooth and rock back and forth gently. If the tooth offers any resistance, it is not ready for removal.
If concerned about a loose tooth that won’t seem to fall out, consult your child’s dentist.;
, Some baby teeth will fall out without any bleeding, but a small amount is normal. Remember that a few drops of blood mixed with mouth saliva can give the appearance of significant bleeding, so prepare your child (and don’t overreact yourself) if you see some evidence of blood in her mouth.


A quick rinse and spit with cool water immediately after the tooth is removed can help clear the mouth of blood, but don’t continue with any rinsing after that. You want to help a clot form, not wash it away.

, If the bleeding is minor, as is usually the case with a loose baby tooth, no intervention is likely necessary. If, however, there is still bleeding after about a minute or so, use gauze to staunch the blood flow and facilitate clotting.


Wad up one or a few clean gauze pads that you have dampened with clean water, which will help prevent blood from sticking to it. Have your child bite down on the pad and keep biting down for fifteen minutes.Instruct your child not to release pressure on the pad or move it around. Have him bite down and keep biting down. It may not be an easy sell for you, but remind your kid of the reward to come from the Tooth Fairy.
You may have to hold the gauze in place for a small child, especially if you are concerned he may swallow the pad.
Check after fifteen minutes. If the bleeding has not stopped, place a new gauze pad as before and contact your child’s dentist., If you need to use gauze to stop the bleeding, keeping the head elevated utilizes gravity to limit blood flow to the area, while tilting the head forward prevents blood (or the gauze pad) from going into the throat.Swallowing blood can cause nausea. This is also why you should tilt your head forward when you have a nosebleed.

, Using lukewarm, salted water as a rinse is a commonly-claimed remedy to stop bleeding from a lost tooth. However, if done while the clot is forming or newly formed, it is likely to dissolve or dislodge the clot and restart the bleeding.


Don’t use hydrogen peroxide or alcohol-based rinses either. These can also dissolve or dislodge clots.Hot drinks and foods can also restart bleeding, so skip the soup until the next day. Drinking cold water is the best way to hydrate after a lost tooth for kids and adults.
You can begin rinsing with tepid water and salt (about one teaspoon per cup of water) the day after the tooth removal to help keep the area clean. Make sure the child can and will spit out the salt water, though., This is worth reiterating, because a lost baby tooth should not under normal circumstances cause bleeding to such a degree.Continued bleeding may be a sign that a broken-off piece of the tooth remains, that some sort of damage has occurred in the area, or that your child has a medical condition that makes excessive bleeding a problem. Play it safe and contact a professional.
That said, a little bit of oozing from the lost tooth site or a bit of pink tint to your child’s saliva does not indicate active bleeding. If blood is not pooling or dripping from the area, it is generally safe to wait it out."

Thoroughly clean your teeth.,
Use the side to side method of insertion.,
Change your aligner trays at night before bed.,
Use a mirror.,
Don’t force it.,
Try another tray size.",How to Put Invisalign Back in if You Haven't Worn Them for a Long Time1," Invisalign fits snugly to the shape of your teeth; ideally there should be no gap between your teeth and invisalign. Cleaning your teeth prior to inserting invisalign ensures that no food particle is caught in your mouth that could change the contour of the invisalign fit. It also guarantees that no bacteria is caught underneath the invisalign tray, which could erode your teeth and cause increased dental bills during your treatment., If you have not work your aligner tray in a while, your teeth might have shifted back. It might be difficult to insert the entire tray into your mouth, so try this method of inserting one side at a time.


Find the easiest point of insertion. Depending on which teeth have the most alignment problems (e.g., crowding, rotation, etc.), the tray might be easier to insert on one side of your mouth versus the other. If you know the side of your mouth (either the right side, left side, or center of the arch) that requires the most adjustment, insert the tray on the opposite side: the tray will fit the best on the side that requires the least amount of adjustment. If you are unsure, try trial and error: try inserting the tray on either side, and go with the side that causes the least amount of discomfort.The tray is quite flexible and it is not that easy to break it, so don't get scared to press the tray a little bit on your teeth.
Insert invisalign on the other side of your mouth. Once you have inserted the tray on the side of your mouth that has the least amount of discomfort, slide the tray on to the other side.

, This allows an uninterrupted period for your aligners to settle in, which makes it easier to get them in and out during the day..

, Put the aligner tray in in front of a mirror, which will allow you to visualize the prior insertion. This is especially important if you are trying to fit the tray over malpositioned teeth that may stick out in the arch., If you have difficulty inserting the aligner tray or are experiencing a lot of pain, stop trying and call your dentist: you could do damage to your teeth or to the aligner tray, or both.Invisalign should be a relatively seamless fit; a lot of difficulty or pain is a sign that something is the matter. Most likely the doctor will need to adjust the fit, or you might need to go down to another tray size, which is usually kept by your dentist., If you have not worn invisalign for a while, your teeth might have shifted back to a previous stage in treatment, or even back to the beginning before treatment began. If you have trouble inserting a specific aligner tray, try a previous tray (for example, #7 instead of #8). Continue to wear this smaller size and see your dentist as soon as possible.If it has been a long time since you have worn your aligner tray, it might be necessary to do a “refinement” – which requires getting new impressions and getting a new series of aligners, but this can be expensive."

If not, or if the pain is only minimal, take an over-the-counter pain reliever like ibuprofen or acetaminophen according to the manufacturer's instructions.Although you'll be given pain medication during the root canal, you should take the OTC pain relievers within an hour after the root canal. This will give them a chance to start working before your anesthesia wears off.;
, Ice can temporarily numb the pain from your tooth. Place an ice cube or crushed ice on the tooth (as long as it's not sensitive to cold). Keep it there until you no longer feel pain or the ice melts. Or, place an ice pack over the side of your face for 10 minutes to help minimize any swelling.Never apply an ice pack directly to your skin. Make sure it is wrapped in a cloth, like a towel or a t-shirt, to prevent frostbite.
You can also make a compress to set over the tooth. Crush ice and put it in a balloon or in the cut-off finger of a non-latex glove. Tie off the end and set the compress over the tooth.

, Relieve toothache by dissolving 1/2 teaspoon of sea salt in 4 ounces (118 mL) of warm water. Place some of this solution in your mouth and hold it over the painful tooth for 30 seconds to one minute. Spit out the solution and repeat this two to three times. Rinse out your mouth with warm water. You can do this up to three or four times a day, just don't swallow the saltwater.You can also use a vinegar solution. Mix ¼ cup of warm water and apple cider vinegar and keep it in your mouth over the painful tooth, just like the saltwater solution.
Try to avoid any alcohol consumption or even holding alcohol in your mouth, as it will produce dehydration of your mucosa and gums.

, Chill a slice of fresh ginger, cucumber, or raw potato and place it over your painful tooth. Or, you can freeze slices of banana, apple, mango, guava or pineapple and place the slices on your aching tooth. The cool fruit or vegetables can numb the pain.


You can also try cutting a piece of onion or garlic to place directly over your tooth. Bite down gently to release the juice.Just remember to use a breath mint after this home remedy.
Eating ice cream may also reduce pain, especially if you feel a pulsating pain.

, Take an herbal tea sachet or dip a clean cotton cloth in warm herbal tea.Set the cloth or sachet over your painful tooth and leave it there for five minutes. Do this two or three times a day. Use one of these teas:


Goldenseal
EchinaceaSage (which can also treat gingivitis)Green or black (which can prevent oral cancer and cavities), Take ¼ teaspoon of asafetida powder and mix it with enough fresh lemon juice to make a paste. Apply this directly onto the tooth. The lemon juice will help hide the bitter taste and unpleasant odor. Leave the paste on for five minutes before rinsing out your mouth. Repeat this two to three times a day.


Asafetida is a fennel-like plant that's usually used as a cooking spice in Indian foods. It comes as a powdered resin or as a lump of resin and can be found in Indian stores and markets.

, Some people find that moist heat can help relieve pain the day after your root canal.You can place either a small piece of cloth soaked in warm water or use a cloth soaked in an herbal tea directly on the tooth. Leave it on until the cloth is no longer warm. Repeat this three or four times a day.


You can also try baby teething gels. These contain a local anesthetic that may relieve the pain. Keep in mind that these gels aren't antimicrobial and won’t treat any infection.

, If you've tried several of these treatments, but find that you feel severe pain even a few days after your root canal, call your dentist. You should also get in touch with your dentist if you notice pressure that lasts several days following your root canal.Your dentist can prescribe pain relief medication if over-the-counter medications aren't reducing your pain.

, Brush your teeth and gums at least twice a day. Once you've brushed the teeth using a toothpaste, spit out the foam but don't rinse your mouth. This gives your teeth a chance to absorb the minerals from the toothpaste. Don't forget to brush your tongue too.Use a soft toothbrush since you can damage your teeth by brushing with hard bristles or by scrubbing too hard.

, Unwind about 18 inches (46 cm) of floss, winding most of it around the middle finger of one hand. Wind the rest around the middle finger of your other hand. Hold the floss firmly between your thumb and your forefinger. Gently guide the floss between all of your teeth using a gently back and forth motion, curving the floss around the bottom of each tooth.Try to floss as deep as possible under your gum to remove any food particles or remaining bacteria.
Don't forget to gently rub up and down the sides of each tooth once the floss is between the teeth.
An oral irrigator may be helpful to remove debris that you miss when flossing.

, Use a clean finger and gently rub gums or the top of the tooth that's breaking through the gums. Be gentle and massage your gums three or four times a day. You can also massage your gums with an anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial oil that can reduce swelling and relieve pain. Try using a few drops of:


Warm olive oil
Warm vanilla extract
Tea tree essential oilClove essential oilPeppermint essential oilCinnamon essential oilSage essential oil
Goldenseal essential oil

, You should visit your dentist and have your teeth professionally cleaned at least once a year. Get more frequent cleanings if you smoke, have heart disease, or have diabetes since these are linked to dental health.If you notice pain, bad breath, difficulty swallowing, jaw, gum or mouth swelling or fever, call your dentist right away.

, If your toothbrush bristles are fraying, it's time to replace the brush before it starts damaging your teeth. Dentists recommend replacing your toothbrush at least once every three or four months (sooner if the bristles become frayed).Store your toothbrush in a clean open place. Avoid using closed containers since this can cause bacteria to grow on the brush.

, Sometimes the nerve in your tooth might just die. Or, you have a cracked or chipped tooth that leads to tooth decay in the tissue within your tooth. These may be caused by an injury to the tooth.When your tooth is injured, inflamed, or suffers nerve death, your tooth will struggle to heal itself.


If you've had a root canal before that didn't completely clean the tissue or if you didn't get a permanent filling over the root canal, you may need another procedure.

, If you're experiencing pain, sensitivity to either hot or cold (sometimes both), tenderness, swelling, or discoloration of the tooth, talk with your dentist. These may be caused by inflamed tissue or infection within your tooth.They may also be caused by a neighboring tooth and not the tooth you suspect is causing the issue. Don’t wait more than a week to talk to your dentist.


Some people don't have any symptoms of inflammation or infection, but still need root canals.

, A dental specialist (endodontist) will clean out the inflamed or infected part of your tooth's root. A filling made of a rubbery material (gutta-percha) or a crown restores your tooth. You'll be given a local anesthetic during the root canal, so the procedure shouldn't be painful.Your tooth may feel strange or sensitive following the root canal. If you have severe pain or pressure, call your dentist.

Reassure them that the stitches are a good thing and will help them feel better.

, If you were prescribed antibiotics to help fight an infection, you must take them as directed. It is important that you finish the full course of antibiotics, even if you start to feel better or think the infection has been stopped., Your tongue will be sensitive, and ingesting certain foods or drink may worsen or aggravate the injury. If you notice any pain or discomfort while eating certain foods, stop eating them until your tongue is fully healed.You should avoid any hot food or drink if your mouth is still numb after receiving stitches.
Don't eat any hard or chewy foods.
Your health care provider may have additional dietary instructions.

, Although it may be frustrating to have stitches on your tongue, avoid pulling or chewing on them. This will only weaken the stitches and may cause them to fall out., As your injury heals, you should watch its progress to make sure it is going well. Keep an eye on your stitches, and the wound itself, and see your doctor if you notice any of the following issues:Your stitches have come loose or fallen out.
A return of blood loss that doesn't stop after you apply pressure.
Any swelling or increase in pain.
Developing a fever.
Problems breathing.

Try ice.,
Use garlic, onion, or ginger.,
Massage your gums with essential oils.,
Make a tea compress.,
Try an asafetida paste.",How to Stop Tooth Nerve Pain2," One way to help relieve tooth nerve pain is to place an ice cube or crushed ice on the tooth. You can do this as long as the tooth isn’t sensitive to cold. Alternatively, you can crush some ice and place it into a balloon or the cut-off finger of a non-latex glove to make an ice pack.Make sure to tie off one end of the balloon or glove and place the compress on the tooth.
You can also use the ice pack on your skin outside the painful tooth to provide pain relief.

, Garlic, onion, and ginger has been shown to help relieve tooth pain. Start by cutting a small piece of garlic, onion, or ginger. Place directly on your painful tooth inside your mouth. Gently bite down to release the juice.The juice from the garlic, onion, or ginger will help numb and calm your gums.

, You can massage your gums with oils to help relieve tooth nerve pain. Try a few drops of warm olive oil or some warm vanilla extract. You can also try essential oils that help with tooth pain. Put these oils on your fingers and massage them into your gums. You can also make a mouth rinse with a few drops of essential oils and a few ounces of water. Never swallow any of these oils because they can be toxic. Essential oils you can use for tooth pain include:Tea tree
Clove
Sage
Cinnamon
Goldenseal oil
Peppermint

, Tea compresses may help with your tooth nerve pain. To make a compress with a teabag, soak an herbal teabag in warm water. After the teabag has steeped in the warm water, place the teabag over the tooth. Leave the teabag there for at least five minutes. You can do this two to three times a day while you're in pain. Teas that have been shown to help with tooth pain include:Echinacea tea
Goldenseal tea
Black tea
Sage tea
Green tea

, Asafetida is a plant used in traditional medicine. This plant usually comes as a powder. To make the paste with asafetida, mix ¼ teaspoon of the powder with fresh lemon juice until it is a paste-like consistency. Once the ingredients are mixed fully, rub the paste over your tooth and gum. Leave it on for around five minutes.Rinse your mouth with water afterwards.
You can do this two to three times a day.

Take a deep breath.,
Try a visualization technique.,
Take someone with you.,
Accept your anxiety.,
Be realistic.",How to Relax While Getting New or Tightened Braces2," Before your orthodontist gets started, ask if you can have a couple of minutes alone in the room to calm yourself down. While the orthodontist is gone, take a few minutes to do some deep breathing. Deep breathing can help calm your nerves.Close your eyes. Breathe in through your nose, counting to four in your head. Hold your breath for four counts. Breathe out through your mouth, counting to four in your head again. As you breathe in and out, focus only on your breathing, trying to block everything else. Keep doing this exercise as long as you need., For this technique, keep your eyes closed. Try to imagine you are someplace peaceful. Where you pick is up to you, as it only matters if you find it peaceful. You could pick a beach or a mountaintop, for instance.Try to think about all the sensations of that place. Think about what you would hear, and how it would feel on your skin. What would smell like? Taste like? Think about what you would see, adding as many details as possible. Stay in that place as much as possible while the orthodontist is working on you., If you're really nervous, have someone you trust come with you. Just holding that person's hand while your dentist is working on your braces can calm you down.Make sure to clear it with your orthodontist first, as not every orthodontist likes to have extra people back in the exam rooms.

, If you continue to play up your anxiety, you're turning it into it's own monster. Anxiety is an emotion, just like sadness or anger. Accept that what you're feeling is okay, and that it will soon pass., Hopefully, you've talked to your orthodontist about what's going to happen. Ask yourself now what you're worried about. Is it realistic? What's the worst that could happen? Try to come up with solutions for your realistic worries and to talk yourself out of non-realistic worries. For instance, you may be in a little of pain for a while, which is a realistic worry, but your orthodontist will try to minimize it. If something seems out of the realm of possibility, tell yourself that it is not realistic, and you won't worry about it."
"
Tell the orthodontist you have anxiety.,
Discuss your specific concern.,
Ask the orthodontist to walk you through the procedure.",How to Relax While Getting New or Tightened Braces3," It's fine to confess to having a bit of anxiety about dental work. Every dentist and orthodontist has encountered it before because it is a common anxiety. If you tell your orthodontist your fears, she can take steps to help put you at ease., If you have specific concern, it's fine to visit the office beforehand to talk to the orthodontist or staff ahead of time. Bring up your specific question, and ask how the orthodontist can address it.For instance, if you have a strong gag reflex, ask how the orthodontist can help.

, If you are getting new braces, talk to your orthodontist about what's going to happen. Knowing each step can help put you at ease."

Let a dentist pull your teeth.,
Follow your dentist’s instructions for care after a pulled tooth.,
Bite down on clean, moistened cotton gauze to aid clot formation.,
Keep your head elevated, with your face tilted slightly down.,
Try a tea bag.,
Don’t rinse with salt water until the next day.,
Contact your dentist if the bleeding continues beyond the advised period.",How to Stop the Bleeding After You Pull out a Loose Tooth2," It is never worth saving a few dollars to grab some pliers and take care of that throbbing tooth yourself. You can crack or break off the afflicted and surrounding teeth, cause nerve, gum, or jaw damage, risk infection, or, yes, cause excessive bleeding.


Let a dental professional diagnose your problem and solve it properly, and perhaps even save the tooth in the process., Recommended care will vary by the type of tooth removed, the method of extraction, your medical history, and various other factors.


The following steps offer general advice for bleeding care after tooth removal; they are not a substitute for your dentist’s specific advice.

, A dentist will have you do this soon after a tooth extraction. Dentists usually instruct you to hold it in place for at least fifteen minutes and perhaps thirty or sixty minutes depending on the particulars of your extraction.Keep constant pressure on the wad of gauze, and keep it still in your mouth. You do not want to disrupt clot formation.
If the gauze becomes saturated with blood within fifteen minutes, add new gauze to the existing wad without removing the old. Again, you don’t want to disrupt clot formation.
After the initial gauze packing of 45-60 minutes, you may need to continue applying new gauze wads for three to five additional hours, or even longer. Follow your dentist’s instructions.

, As mentioned in the section on a lost baby tooth, use gravity to your advantage in reducing blood flow to your head and limiting blood drainage down your throat.Also worth repeating from the baby tooth section: Nausea is a common result of swallowing blood, so tilt you head forward a little whenever your mouth (or nose) is bleeding.

, No, don’t drink hot tea — or hot coffee, or any other hot beverage or food for the first day (or as per instructions), which can dissolve blood clots. Rather, rely on the innate pro-clotting qualities found in the black tea itself.


The tannic acid found in black tea promotes the clotting of blood, so try moistening a regular old black tea bag and bite down on it as you do the gauze pads.Hold it in place for fifteen minutes and see if the bleeding has stopped or slowed. Repeat as necessary with new bags.The tea may cause a temporary staining of your surrounding teeth and gums, but this will soon disappear.

, Avoid the claims that tepid salted water will stop mouth bleeding; it is far more likely to dissolve the clots trying to form at the tooth extraction site. Salted water will, however help keep the area clean, so it does have value.


Rinse and spit with a mixture of one cup lukewarm water and about one teaspoon of salt. Do so once or more daily, 24 hours after your tooth extraction, or as advised by your dentist.Other than possibly a quick rinse right after tooth extraction, avoid rinsing and spitting while the blood is clotting in your mouth. Peroxide and alcohol-based rinses in particular can inhibit clot formation.Your dentist may want you to limit mouth rinsing for days after the extraction to prevent dry socket, which is when a dissolved clot exposes the hole left behind after an extraction. This can cause pain or infection.

, Oozing and spotting of blood for several days after are normal and not usually cause for concern, but active bleeding may be a sign of complications from the procedure or an unrelated medical issue.


Blood that is dripping or pooling at the extraction site within 15-20 seconds of removing a gauze pad indicates active bleeding.In addition to keeping your head elevated, limiting exercise for a few days is another way to reduce the chance of continued bleeding. Exercise increases blood pressure, which in turn makes bleeding more likely."

Use“chewies”.,
Give it time.,
Consult your dentist.",How to Put Invisalign Back in if You Haven't Worn Them for a Long Time2," If your aligner is not fitting well or there are air gaps between your teeth and the tray, try biting down on chewies. Chewies are small cylindrical cushions made of a plastic-like material; when used regularly they help your aligner conform to the shape of your mouth and get rid of any gaps that might exist. Bite down on chewies a few times a day for 5-10 minutes at a time. You can obtain chewies through your orthodontist or you can order them online.You can also try doing this with cotton balls, but make sure the tray is properly fit on the correct position

, Each aligner starts out “ill-fitting” on purpose. It is designed to fit the shape of your teeth after you have finished wearing it correctly for two weeks, so when you first put it in it might feel a little snug or a little tight.If worn correctly (20-22 hours a day) the tray should sink down and settle in. By the end of the two weeks of wearing them correctly, your tray should conform perfectly to the shape of your mouth. If not, continue to wear the existing tray a few more days until you are able to see your dentist, he/she might have to do a mid-course correction., Your dentist is the best expert on the fit of your invisalign alignment trays; he/she should be your first contact in getting back on your course of treatment if you have not worn invisalign for a while. Be honest; in most cases your dentist will be able to tell if you have not worn your aligner trays as much as you claim (Invisalign Teen has a built in “lie-detector” – each aligner contains a blue indicator dot that fades over time when used as directed)."

Change your toothpaste.,
Change your toothbrush.,
Use a numbing agent if you must.,
Use a night guard.,
Take an OTC pain medication.,
Talk to your dentist about the cause of your tooth sensitivity.",How to Stop Sensitive Teeth Pain1," Try switching to a toothpaste designed to help with sensitive teeth.


Toothpaste containing arginine has been shown to be more effective than sensitive toothpastes that use potassium as the active ingredient. ;
, Make sure to use a toothbrush with soft bristles. Harder bristles can damage tooth enamel and cause gums to recede, leading to sensitive teeth. Also be careful not to press too hard when you brush - this can also damage gums and enamel.

, Gels designed to numb tooth pain are sold over the counter and can also be applied in the dentist's office or as a prescription.


However, many dentists and the Food and Drug Administration warn against using numbing agents like benzocaine, especially to treat sensitive teeth in small children. , If your sensitivity is caused by grinding, you can wear a protecting guard during the night. Your dentist can make a custom-fitted mouth guard for you. They are available over-the-counter as well, but because they are not fitted to your mouth specifically, an OTC guard may cause more harm than good.If you do notice yourself grinding your teeth during the day, position the tip of your tongue between your teeth. At night, hold a warm washcloth against your cheek, near your earlobe. These both relax your jaw.Try massaging your jaw and sticking to soft foods until the pain subsides.

, Acetaminophen and ibuprofen can help reduce the pain of sensitive teeth.


Don't use this as a long-term solution, however, as pain medications have side effects. , While numbing agents and special toothpastes may temporarily ease the pain of sensitive teeth, you won't be able to truly resolve tooth pain unless you know the underlying cause — whether it's due to dry mouth, grinding your teeth, acid reflux, acidic food and drink, etc. Consult your dentist about your tooth pain so she can help you properly diagnose the issue and choose the best treatment.


Tooth sensitivity may be cased by brushing too hard, dental decay, tooth fracture, dry mouth, diet, brushing too hard, acid reflux, gum infection, and more.
Your dentist can offer treatments such as a fluoride varnish, a fluoride tray, prescription toothpaste, and/or a mouth guard.

Work on conditioning your lips instead of picking.,
Brush your lips with a toothbrush.,
Try a sugar scrub.,
Apply an emollient lip balm.,
Repeat until your lips are free of dry skin.,
Avoid using products that dry out your lips.,
Don't lick your lips.,
Protect your lips overnight.,
Drink lots of water.,
Try a humidifier.,
Eat less salt.,
Avoid smoking.,
Protect your lips from sunburn.,
Cover your face in cold or dry weather.",How to Stop Picking Your Lips," Do you absentmindedly pick away the dead skin that builds up on your lips? When you feel a bit of skin flaking off, it's impossible to resist picking it. However, picking your lips doesn't actually make them less dry or healthier. Instead of picking the skin off, try putting that energy into making your lips healthier. The result will be supple, dry-skin-free lips that look great, rather than rough-looking lips that bleed where you pick them.If your picking habit is actually a persistent bad habit or nervous tic, it'll take more than conditioning your lips to fix the problem. See How to Break a Bad Habit for help on putting a stop to your lip picking for good.
If you're worried you can't stop on your own, see a therapist and determine whether you might have Compulsive Skin Picking disorder, which is closely linked with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and Body Dysmorphic Disorder. This is very difficult to solve on your own, so seek the help of someone who can advise you.;
, Moisten your lips with warm water, then use a clean toothbrush to gently brush them in a circular motion. This will remove the buildup of dry, dead skin that's causing your lips to be chapped and flaky. While picking your lips often removes too much skin and results in bleeding, brushing your lips removes just the top layer of dead skin, keeping the protective layer in place.


A clean loofah is another good item to use to brush your lips. Just make sure you don't use an older loofah, since these can harbor bacteria.
Do not scrub your lips too hard with the brush. It's OK if your lips are still a little rough after brushing. You may need more than one session to completely get rid of the dead skin.

, This is a great option if your lips are very chapped and sore, since it's a little gentler than using a brush. Make a simple mixture of one teaspoon of sugar and one teaspoon of honey. Spread a little on your lips and use your fingers to massage the scrub across your lips. It will remove the top layer of dead skin without damaging the layer underneath. When you're finished, rinse your lips with warm water.

, An emollient is a substance that traps moisture in your skin and protects it from getting dried out. When your lips are severely chapped or torn up, regular chap stick may not be enough to help them heal. Look for a product that contains one of the following emollients as a primary ingredient:


Shea butter
Cocoa butter
Jojoba oil
Avocado oil
Rosehip oil

, It may take more than one conditioning session to get your lips back into shape. Every few days, repeat the process of exfoliating your lips. In between sessions, wear an emollient product on your lips during the day and at night while you sleep. Don't repeat the process more than once a day, since that could cause skin irritation.

, Your average drugstore lip balm is likely to contain ingredients that actually make your lips drier over time. Keep using a good emollient balm with natural ingredients. Avoid products (including lip sticks, stains and glosses) that contain the following skin irritants:Alcohol
Fragrance
Silicones
Mineral oil
Parabens

, You might be compelled to lick your lips when they're dry, but enzymes in your saliva will cause them to dry out even more. Just as you're resisting the urge to pick, resist the urge to lick., Do you tend to wake up with dry lips? That may be the result of sleeping with your mouth open. When you breathe through your mouth all night long, your lips can dry out quickly. While it may be difficult to change your breathing habits, you can correct the problem by protecting your lips at night. Remember to apply lip balm every night before bed so you'll wake up with lips that are moisturized instead of flaky., Dry, chapped lips are often a side effect of dehydration. It's possible you aren't drinking enough water during the day. Drink every time you get thirsty, and try to switch out coffee and soda for water whenever possible. Within a few days your lips will be be softer and better moisturized.


Alcohol is notorious for causing dehydration. If you tend to wake up with chapped lips, try cutting off alcohol use a few hours before bed and drinking lots of water before you go to sleep.
Carry a reusable water bottle with you throughout the day so you'll always have fresh water available when you're thirsty.

, If your skin is naturally dry, a humidifier can be a lifesaver, especially during the winter. Humidifiers add moisture to dry air so that it's much easier on your skin. Set one up in your bedroom and see if you can tell the difference after a few days.

, Salt buildup on the lips can cause them to dry out quickly. Changing your diet so that it includes less salt might make a big difference in the texture of your lips. When you do eat salty foods, rinse your lips with warm water afterward so the salt doesn't sit on your lips.

, Smoking is tough on lips, causing dryness and irritation. If you're a smoker, there are lots of good reasons to kick the habit, and having healthy lips is one of them. Try to cut back on smoking as much as possible to save your lips from getting damaged.

, Just like the rest of your skin, the skin on your lips is susceptible to sun damage. Wear lip balm with SPF 15 or higher to protect your lips from getting burned.

, There's nothing like the cold, dry air of winter to make your lips dry and flaky. If you tend to pick your lips more in the winter than in the summer, that's why. Try pulling your scarf up over your mouth when you go outside to protect your lips from the cold.

, Studies have shown that psychological stress can contribute to periodontal disease. Reducing the stress in your life may help relieve itching gums.Avoid stressful situations whenever you can.
Exercise and gentle activities can minimize stress.

, If you are experiencing itchy gums and home remedies don’t help after seven to 10 days, schedule an appointment with your dentist. She can figure out the cause of your discomfort and find the right treatment for it.Itchy gums may be a product of fungal, viral, or bacterial infections; certain medications; nutritional deficiencies; improperly fitting dentures; teeth grinding; allergies; stress, or periodontal disease.Schedule your appointment as soon as possible. You may not notice any changes to your gums or mouth with some oral conditions.
Tell your dentist when the symptoms started, what treatments you’ve tried, and what relieves or makes symptoms worse.
Let your dentist know any medical conditions you have and medications you are taking.

, If you’re itchy gums, your dentist may check and test for gingivitis, which is a mild form of gum disease with a variety of causes.Once she’s determined a cause for your itchy gums, your dentist will develop the best treatment plan for you.Your dentist may be able to diagnose gingivitis or the cause of your itchy gums by examining your teeth, gums, and oral cavity.She’ll especially check your gums for redness, puffiness, and easy bleeding, which are symptoms of gingivitis.Your dentist may refer you to another doctor such as an internist or allergist to rule out underlying conditions., Depending on your diagnosis, your doctor may suggest or prescribe medication to relieve the itching sensation. You may also need medication or treatment to treat underlying oral or medical conditions.

, In many cases, itchy gums and gingivitis are caused by a buildup of plaque and tartar. Having your teeth deep cleaned can remove the cause of your itchy gums and promote your overall oral health.Your dentist may clean your teeth using one of the following procedures:


Scaling, which removes tartar above and below the gum line
Root planing, in which the dentist scales the root surface of the tooth, getting rid of bacteria and infected areas. This process leaves a polished surface for your gum to easily reattach...It is an easy surgical procedure performed with local anesthesia.
Lasering, which also removes tartar, but causes less pain and bleeding than scaling or root planing., If your dentist opts for planing or scaling your teeth, she may insert an antiseptic treatment into pockets in your mouth. These can further treat your condition.Your dentist may place the following in oral pockets:


Antiseptic chips with chlorhexidine. These are time-released and inserted into oral pockets after root planing.Antibiotic microspheres with minocycline. These are placed in oral pockets after scaling or planing., Your dentist may also prescribe an antibiotic such as doxycycline following a cleaning or even without one. These may treat persistent inflammation and prevent tooth decay., An antihistamine can neutralize allergens and help relieve your itching gums. If your condition is a result of allergies, take an oral antihistamine whenever you need one.Some oral antihistamines you can take are:


Chlorpheniramine is available in 2 mg and 4 mg. Take 4 mg every four to six hours and don’t exceed 24 mg per day.
Diphenhydramine is available in 25 mg and 50 mg. Take 25 mg every four to six hours and don’t exceed 300 mg per day.

, Spray or suck on an oral analgesic. Throat lozenges or sprays contain mild analgesics that may relieve your discomfort.


Use throat lozenges or sprays every two to three hours, or according to the package or your dentist's directions.Suck on the throat lozenge until it’s gone. Chewing or swallowing it whole may numb your throat and make it difficult to swallow.

, An antiseptic mouthwash with chlorhexidine can disinfect your mouth and relieve itching. Swish one around your mouth at least twice a day.Pour 15 ml of the mouthwash into a cup and then swish it around for 15 to 20 seconds before spitting it out.

, If your itchy gums are caused by severe gum disease, you may need surgery. Consider this option if your dentist diagnoses you in the later stages of periodontal disease.There are a few different procedures that may help you:


Flap surgeries, which involve detaching the gums from tooth and bone, removing plaque and suturing your gums to fit snugly around your tooth. This is performed under general anesthesia, so you will not feel anything during the surgery.
Bone and tissue grafts, which replace bone lost as a result of serious gum disease."

Wring out the excess, then hold the moist cloth over the tensed or pained portion of your jaw for 10 minutes.Perform this procedure as soon as you notice tension or pain in your jaw. You can also repeat the procedure immediately before known times of high stress to help prevent tension before it builds.
The warmth should relax the muscles in your jaw and help them loosen up. A relaxed jaw is less likely to tense up and begin clenching again.;
, Use your fingers to gently massage the affected muscles. Apply firm yet gentle pressure to the tensed portion of your jaw, then work around the entire jaw and mouth area with small, circular motions.


It's best to perform this exercise before you have the opportunity to clench your jaw, but you can also repeat it after you notice jaw tension or pain.
Massaging the affected area can release tension in the muscles of your jaw. Once the muscles have relaxed and loosened up, you'll naturally be less inclined to clench them.

, If jaw clenching has become a chronic problem, you've likely trained yourself to hold your jaw improperly at a subconscious level. Practicing proper jaw placement every few hours throughout the day can re-train your brain and muscles.


When you close your lips, a slight gap between your upper and lower teeth should still remain.
Place the tip of your tongue in between your front teeth. Hold it there for at least five minutes. During this time, your jaw muscles should relax and reset to a more natural position.
If this simple correction doesn't feel comfortable or helpful, you may need to ask your dentist to show you the best position for your jaw. Memorize the way it feels and take pictures of the way it looks. Consult those pictures later while practicing the same placement in front of a mirror.

, In particular, you should increase your intake of calcium, magnesium, and vitamin C. Having adequate amounts of these nutrients can help regulate muscle activity, including muscle activity in the jaw.


You can increase your intake of these nutrients through diet or by taking daily nutritional supplements.
If you choose to take nutritional supplements, know that you should take one part magnesium for every two parts calcium. For instance, you might take 600 mg of calcium and 300 mg of magnesium. The amount of vitamin C should be determined independently; an adequate daily dose is 90 mg daily.
Repeat your nutrient ritual daily for at least two months before determining if it has or hasn't been helpful.

, Stress can cause you to clench your jaw during daytime and nighttime hours. While stress is unavoidable, you can figure out ways of dealing with causes of stress once you identify them.


Consider keeping a journal to help track your causes of stress. Make a note of any incident that causes anxiety, even if it seems mild, and pay special attention to causes of stress that occur immediately before or during daytime incidents of jaw clenching.
Avoid any stress triggers that can be eliminated. For triggers that cannot be eliminated, balance them out with behaviors that help relax your mind. For instance, you might listen to soothing music, indulge in a warm bubble bath, meditate, or ease your mind with aromatherapy.

, Following a regular sleep pattern should improve your quality of sleep, which may reduce jaw clenching at night. Getting eight hours of good, quality sleep each night can also reduce your overall stress, and that may make it easier to quit clenching your jaw during the day, too.


Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day, regardless of your schedule. Try to schedule a full eight hours of sleep in between.
In addition to increasing the amount of sleep you get, you should also try to improve the quality of sleep. Try to completely relax your body and mind before going to bed. Avoid caffeine and alcohol, since both can alter the body's sleep cycle. Sleep at comfortable, slightly cool temperatures, and turn off all bright lights and sources of irregular noise.

, Regular exercise can relieve stress while regulating your mood and immune system. As a result, the tension causing your jaw clenching should lessen, and the muscles in your jaw should become stronger and more elastic.


You don't need to perform strenuous exercise to gain these benefits. Try walking at a slow to moderate pace for 30 minutes a day, three to five times a week. Make this a regular part of your routine for at least two months, if not permanently.

, Jaw clenching is often a multifaceted problem that involves both physical and mental factors. A qualified dentist should be able to treat the oral components of the problem, but you'll need to talk with a general physician to determine a treatment plan for any other factors.

, Both mouth guards and dental splits can keep teeth separated and protect them against the sort of damage caused by jaw clenching. While more expensive, dental splits are better than over-the-counter mouth guards.Mouth guards are generally made of hard plastic. You'll still feel pain caused by clenching the jaw, and that pain may worsen the underlying tension.
Dental splints are made from soft acrylic and fitted to the shape of your mouth. They won't stop your jaw from clenching, but they should reduce the associated pain and may prevent the tension in your jaw from worsening.
Note that both mouth guards and splints are generally reserved for nighttime treatment, but in extreme cases when daytime clenching is an issue, you can wear the equipment during daytime hours.

, If your teeth are damaged or otherwise misaligned, they may contribute to your jaw clenching problem. Consult with your dentist to determine the best way to fix the underlying issue.


Braces may help correct severely misaligned teeth. In some cases, however, your dentist may recommend strategically placed crowns to fix the problem.
If you have a damaged tooth, rebuilding that tooth can help restore the proper alignment of your teeth.

, There are different types of therapy that may help correct jaw clenching, but the most common are biofeedback and cognitive behavioral therapy.


Biofeedback is a type of physical therapy. During the procedure, the doctor will examine the way you hold and control your jaw through specialized monitoring equipment. The doctor can use the same equipment to help train and regulate muscle activity in your jaw.
Cognitive behavioral therapy treats the psychological component behind jaw clenching. By talking with a trained psychologist or counselor, you can change the way you approach stress and react to it, which may lead to decreased anxiety.

, Talk with a professional acupuncturist about regular treatments that can reduce jaw pain and tension. While there's very little scientific evidence to suggest the effectiveness of acupuncture, it stands as a popular form of alternative medicine.Similarly, you could also learn about professional acupressure treatments. Acupuncture uses strategically placed needles to control pain in the body, but acupressure applies firm pressure to strategic points, instead.

, Muscle relaxants can relax the muscles in your jaw, which should help prevent your jaw from clenching. You can ask your doctor about both oral relaxants and injected relaxants.Oral muscle relaxants must be prescribed by a doctor, and you should only take them for short periods to avoid dependency. These medications relax your entire body's immune response. They may make you drowsy, so you should take them before bedtime.
OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) treatments are injected directly into the affected area and only relax the surrounding the jaw muscles. These treatments last for prolonged periods but are usually prescribed only as a last resort.

, If you're currently taking long-term prescription medications and you didn't clench your jaw before you began treatment, ask your doctor if your jaw clenching habits could be a side effect of the medication.


If medications are causing the problem, your doctor may prescribe a different medication to help eliminate the jaw clenching.
While there are different types of medications that can cause jaw clenching, some of the most common culprits include antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).Note that alcohol, smoking, and recreational drugs can also cause jaw clenching and should be eliminated.

Make your own mouthwash.,
Apply soothing herbs.,
Use an ice pack on your cheek next to your aching tooth.",How to Stop Sensitive Teeth Pain2," Rinsing your mouth out two to four times a day with these mixtures can help soothe tooth pain.


Combine water, salt, and a small amount of lime juice. Boil together and then allow to cool. Boil 4 to 5 guava leaves in water. Cool the solution until it is warm. Add salt.
Add a few drops of olive oil to a 1/2 glass of water.

Cut down on acidic foods and drinks.,
Cut down on the amount of sugar you consume, including sugary drinks.,
Eat garlic, wheatgrass, or guava leaves.,
Stop grinding your teeth.,
Rebuild your enamel.,
Control dry mouth.,
Treat acid reflux.",How to Stop Sensitive Teeth Pain3," The acid in some food and drinks can damage tooth enamel.


Don't brush your teeth for at least 30 minutes after eating acidic food. Generally, fruits are the most acidic foods, followed by some vegetables, especially if they have been pickled. , The sugar provides ""food"" for the bacteria in your mouth, which can aggravate gum disease and tooth decay, which cause sensitivity.


Follow sugary drinks with milk or water to restore the pH balance in your mouth.Try to brush your teeth within 20 minutes of eating sugary foods.
Consider using a straw, regardless of what you are drinking, so that your teeth have less contact with the liquid. , Garlic and wheatgrass are both antibiotic and can reduce pain. Wheatgrass will help control any possible infection and fights tooth decay. Guava leaves can also relieve pain and have anti-inflammatory properties.


Some foods are also good at relieving pain when they are consumed raw, like spinach leaves or onions.

, If your jaw is often stiff or your teeth are worn down, this can be a sign that you are grinding your teeth. A dentist can prescribe a special mouth guard to prevent nighttime teeth grinding. Grinding is often caused by stress, so taking the time to de-stress can help too., Gargling or brushing your teeth with baking soda paste can help rebuild tooth enamel. For every quarter glass of water, add a quarter teaspoon of baking soda., Dry mouth can occur for many reasons, such as a side effect of medication or treatments, diseases and infections, nerve damage, dehydration, or lifestyle choices, such as smoking or chewing tobacco.Dry mouth can lead to tooth sensitivity, along with increased risk of gum disease, tooth decay, and infection.To reduce dry mouth, try the following:Talk to your doctor about switching to another medication if it is causing your dry mouth or ask if she can prescribe you Salagen, which increases saliva production.
Quit using tobacco products.
Drink lots of water and keep hydrated.
Breathe through your nose and not your mouth.

, Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or acid reflux occurs when stomach acid flows back into your esophagus and sometimes into your mouth. The acid can eat away at the enamel of your teeth, leading to sensitivity.Acid reflux may be eased by over-the-counter antacids (Maalox, TUMS, Rolaids); H-2-receptor blockers (Zantac, Pepcid AC), which reduce acid production; or proton pump inhibitors (Prilosec, Prevacid 24 HR), which are stronger than H-2-receptor blockers. If OTC treatments don't work, ask your doctor about prescription medication to treat your acid reflux. These may include stronger H-2-receptor blockers and proton pump inhibitors, or medications like Baclofen, which works on the lower esophageal sphincter, strengthening the muscle to prevent reflux.In some cases, surgery may be necessary to control acid reflux."

Purchase ozonated olive oil.,
Brush your teeth.,
Apply the oil to your gums.",How to Stimulate Gum Growth2," Ozonated olive oil is olive oil that has undergone a process that increases its ability to fight harmful bacteria and microorganisms in your mouth. This process turns olive oil from a greenish color to a white-colored gel. You can purchase ozonated olive oil from an online retailer like Amazon.Ozonated olive oil has been shown to heal gum wounds,and improve the symptoms of gum disease.Refrigerate your ozonated olive oil or keep it in away from sunlight at room temperature.
Many people have had good results with this treatment, but the only way to really halt gum recession is with medical attention from a professional. Ozone therapy is known to kill anaerobic bacteria — a very successful procedure used to fight periodontitis., Brush your teeth with a soft toothbrush and a non-fluoride toothpaste. After you are done brushing, floss each tooth to remove any plaque and debris. The olive oil is more effective when you prep your mouth before applying.


Be careful not to brush too hard before applying the oil.

, You can apply the oil to your gums using your fingers or your toothbrush. Massage your gums with the oil for 10 minutes.Once you have applied it, do not eat, rinse, or drink anything for 30 minutes.You can also brush your teeth with the oil.
Do not use ozonated olive oil if you have had a recent heart attack, are pregnant, have hyperthyroidism, are intoxicated with alcohol, or have a hemorrhage in any of your organs.Read the instructions on the container to determine how often you should apply the oil.

Put a tablespoon of oil in your mouth.,
Swish the oil around.,
Brush your teeth.",How to Stimulate Gum Growth3," Oil pulling is used to remove impurities from your mouth. Coconut oil, sunflower oil, sesame oil, or palm oil can be used. Coconut oil is the most popular, but it is solid below 75 degrees Fahrenheit (23.9 Celsius), and it can be hard to swish around a chunk of oil. Try mixing coconut oil with another one of these oils (e.g. sunflower oil, sesame oil, or palm oil) so it will be easier to swish around your mouth.Children (five to 15 years old) should only use 1 teaspoon of oil.Sesame oil is the preferred oil of choice in Indian culture. Sesame oil is high in antioxidants and is believed to strengthen teeth and gums., Swish and pull the oil between your teeth for 10 to 15 minutes. The oil will turn thin and a milky white color. The swishing motion helps activate enzymes. Do not swallow the oil because it contains bacteria.If you are unable to do 10 to 15 minutes a day, start by doing five minutes and work your way up.
It is best to oil pull first thing in the morning before you eat.

, Once you have spit out the oil, brush your teeth and rinse your mouth with water as you normally would. Oil pulling is not a substitute for regular tooth brushing and oral care. It should be used as a supplement to what you usually do.Oil pulling is as effective as commercially available mouth rinses for reducing bad breath and plaque growth and build up. Gingivitis (early gum disease) is the result of plaque buildup.If you oil pull every day, there should be an improvement in plaque buildup in 10 days.
Although the American Dental Association does not recommend oil pulling,, it has been used for centuries to take care of teeth and gums. Even if you use this technique, see a medical professional to stop your gum recession.

Know the causes of receding gums.,
Brush teeth twice a day.,
Floss daily.,
Visit a dentist regularly.,
See a specialist.",How to Stimulate Gum Growth4," There are many factors that can cause your gums to recede. Your dentist can help you identify any risk factors that you may have. Typical causes of receding gums include:Gum disease
Using a hard-bristled toothbrush or brushing too hard
Being born with naturally thin or weak gums
Smoking and using tobacco
Trauma to your gum tissue

, Use a soft-bristled toothbrush to gently brush your teeth twice a day. Your toothbrush should be at a 45 degree angle to your gums. Brush back and forth using short strokes with no pressure on the toothbrush.Then do a vertical move by simply ""pulling"" the gum toward your tooth surface with the brush. A good gum massage, along with a brushing technique that stimulates the gum growth towards the chewing surface, is the secret of preventing recession.


Be sure to brush all the different surfaces of your teeth.
Replace your toothbrush every three to four months or even earlier if bristles start spreading and losing their color.
Brush your tongue when you are finished to remove bacteria.

, Flossing daily helps remove plaque that cannot be removed by brushing alone. Take 18 inches of floss and wind it around your middle fingers. Make a “C” shape when rubbing the floss between your teeth and gum line. Be gentle and never snap the floss into your gums.You can use dental floss, a dental pick, or a pre-threaded flosser. Talk to your dentist about which tool is best for you.

, The frequency of your dentist visits depends on the health of your teeth and gums. Most adults will need to go at least once a year. Your dentist will focus on preventive care and your overall oral health., If your regular dentist feels that you need more intensive care, you should see a specialist. A specialist can perform specialized treatments and surgical procedures to increase gum growth. These treatments are expensive and invasive.


Possible treatments to fix your gums include scaling and root planning or a gum graft. Your dentist will decide what is best for you."

Figure out how wide to open your mouth.,
Think about what your eyes are doing.,
Distract the eye with other aspects of your appearance.,
Find your best angle.,
Practice your smile.",How to Smile when You Think You Have Bad Teeth1," There are all types of smiles - wide, toothy grins that show all of your teeth, more subtle smiles that put just the top row of teeth on display, mostly closed-mouth smiles that reveal just a glimmer of white, and completely closed smiles that show no teeth at all. By choosing how wide to open your mouth, you can control how the world sees your teeth.


Practice different degrees of openness to see which smile looks best on you. It's your smile, and there are no rules about how it should look! That said, try to get comfortable revealing at least a glimpse of your teeth when you smile, because it's very hard to keep your mouth closed when you smile out of happiness. Aim to smile in a way that helps you look your best while also creating a natural-looking expression of cheer.
Keep in mind that a smile is often the first impression we have of other people. Think about meeting someone for the first time: what would impression would you get if they seemed to be making an effort to keep their mouth closed instead of breaking into a full smile? It's better to reveal some teeth and have your smile look natural than to close your mouth and look as though you are hiding something. Projecting confidence is more important than projecting perfection, so open up!;
, Perhaps you've heard of smizing - the act of smiling with your eyes, not just your mouth. Engaging your eyes as part of your smile automatically helps it read as more authentic and pleasant. For those who are worried about how their teeth look, smiling with the eyes can draw attention to the top of the face and away from the mouth. Smiling with your eyes - also called a Duchenne smile - enables you to have a bright, happy smile without needing to open your mouth wide.


Try it in the mirror. First, smile without using your eyes. Do you see the jack-o-lantern effect? The smile doesn't look happy, it looks . . . a little scary and fake. Now try smiling with your whole face, especially your eyes. This type of smile looks like a true expression of happiness.
Practice squinting your eyes a bit more when you smile, to engage the top of your face. See how it balances out your mouth and enables you to close your mouth more and still achieve a happy smile.
A Duchenne smile is very difficult to fake. It happens naturally when you truly have a reason to smile. The best way to create one when you're with other people is to actually feel happy!

, Another way to draw attention away from your mouth is to create other points of interest on your face and body. Your hair, accessories, and clothes can all be used to draw the eye to some of your best features.


Try doing something different with your hair, like curling it or getting an interesting new cut.
Wear pretty earrings, a hat or another attention-grabbing accessory.
Wear sharp clothing that reflects your unique style. People won't be thinking about your teeth if you're rocking an amazing dress or leather coat.

, When you're posing for pictures, it can help to know which angle makes your face look its best. Angling your face instead of looking at the camera head-on creates depth and helps bring out the contours of your smile in a more flattering way. Look in the mirror or take a few selfies and figure out what pose looks the most like you.


When it comes time to pose for a picture, try to turn so that your best side faces the camera. However, don't contort yourself trying to get in a certain position - that will defeat the purpose!

, Like anything else in life, smiling comes more easily with a lot of practice. Try smiling in the mirror in the morning before you leave to go about your day. Practice smiling with your mouth open just so, and remember to engage your eyes. The more you do it, the more natural it will feel to smile at people or for pictures.

Have good dental hygiene.,
Whiten them a few shades.,
Consider getting braces.,
Look into veneers.,
See how far you want to go.",How to Smile when You Think You Have Bad Teeth2," You'll definitely feel more confident about your smile if your teeth are clean and presentable. Take the time to brush them every morning and night. Floss once a day as well - it makes a big difference. Go to the dentist every 6 months to get professional cleanings and reduce plaque and tartar, too. Taking good care of your teeth will show in your smile!


If you're about to be in a photograph or meet a new person, brush your teeth directly beforehand. You'll be more likely to flash a confident smile.

Mouthwash is another great way to freshen your teeth. Carry a small bottle with you to give your teeth a quick rinse when you need a confidence boost throughout the day.

, If the problem is that your teeth are a little yellow or grayish, why not whiten them a bit so you'll feel more confident? There are dozens of methods for whitening your teeth, from expensive whitening treatments to DIY home treatments. To whiten your teeth quickly, here are a few things to try:


Whitening strips. These are a little on the expensive side, but they really work. You can find them at the drugstore.
Hydrogen peroxide. This is a quick, cheap home remedy that whitens your teeth a few shades. Just mix hydrogen peroxide with water, then use it to rinse your teeth.
Brush with baking soda. Make a paste with baking soda and water and use it to brush your teeth. It will lift off stains in a jiffy. Don't do this too often, though, because it can wear away your tooth enamel.

, If you're hesitant to smile and it's really starting to affect your confidence and happiness, you might want to look into getting your teeth straightened. Make an appointment with an orthodontist and discuss your options. A set of braces or a retainer might be what it takes to straighten your teeth.


The simplest wire braces are usually the least expensive, but they're more noticeable than more expensive options.
Many orthodontists offer payment plans to help you afford braces if you can't pay everything at once.

, These are porcelain teeth affixed to your real teeth. They can be remarkably realistic and almost impossible to detect. A small amount of your tooth enamel is removed, a mold of your tooth is taken, and a veneer is made to fit perfectly over the old tooth. If your teeth are discolored, cracked, broken or misshapen, this could be a good option for you., If the problem is not so much with individual teeth, but with the structure of your jaw, there are surgical options you can pursue to correct the problem. Schedule a meeting with an oral surgeon to find out what makes the most sense for your situation. Getting oral surgery to correct your teeth can be expensive, time-consuming and painful, but the drawbacks might be worth the reward of getting a set of teeth that makes you feel happy to smile.

Wear it like a fashion statement.,
Try to forget what you look like.,
Smile joyfully.",How to Smile when You Think You Have Bad Teeth3," Is it possible your smile actually adds something special to your look? Everyone can pay to get straight white teeth, but that would get a little boring. Try to embrace your smile as a unique part of yourself that you're proud to show off. Got a gap in your teeth? A snaggle tooth? Are your teeth crooked? Try owning it instead of being embarrassed. Think like Anna Paquin, Jewel Kilcher and Hugh Grant, celebrities who have capitalized on their adorably quirky smiles, embracing what makes them unique.

, This isn't easy to do, but try to stop thinking about what you look like when you smile. If you're worried about your teeth, it's going to show in your expression, and your smile will look unnatural and won't have a positive effect. Instead of thinking about how you look when you smile, focus on what you're smiling about.


Meeting someone new? Think about how excited you are to get to know someone who could become a great friend or business colleague.
Did someone make you laugh? Let yourself heartily enjoy the joke, instead of catching yourself before you smile too big.

, Do your best not to let your negative feelings about your smile impact how you express joy. When you smile happily, the positive vibes of your attitude can totally outweigh your looks. Giving a half-smile or looking solemn a lot will actually draw more attention to what you're trying to hide. You can take steps to feel more confident about your smile, like whitening your teeth and figuring out you best angle, but ultimately, letting yourself express uninhibited joy is the best way to have an infectious smile.

Know when to see a doctor.,
Observe your stools.,
Relax.,
Eat some corn.,
Eat fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.,
Keep hydrated and close to a toilet.",How to Remove a Swallowed Tooth1," Most small swallowed items, such as teeth, will easily pass through the digestive tract along with food because they are the size of a pill and too small to cause any blockage. However, it is possible that the tooth will become stuck somewhere in the digestive system and require medical attention. Go to a doctor if:


The tooth has not passed within 7 days.
Vomiting occurs, especially with blood present.
Symptoms such as pain in the belly or chest develop, coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath.
You have blood in the stools, especially black or tarry blood.;
, It will probably take about 12 to 14 hours for the tooth to pass.However, don’t be surprised if it shows up sooner, or later, than within those parameters.

, Nothing moves through your body quickly. You need to pass it through your digestive system and the more relaxed you are, the faster it will move along through your stomach, intestines, and colon.

, Corn kernels can stay largely intact as they pass through the bowels. When you start seeing corn in your stool, you’ll know it’s time to look for the tooth., These foods can help items move along through the digestive tract. , If recommended by a doctor, you may consider using a laxative to aid in the recovery of the tooth. Make sure to take the right amount of the laxative to avoid overdosing. Overuse of laxatives can have serious effects and lead to dependency, loss of bone density, and a host of other problems causing dehydration followed by an increased heart rate and low blood pressure.When your stool is fairly loose and/or watery (because of the laxative), place a screen on the toilet to catch the tooth.

Get back your lost dentures.,
Be especially aware of your dentures.,
See a doctor for lost dentures.",How to Remove a Swallowed Tooth2," Dentures are the second most often object accidentally swallowed, second only to fish and other food-ingested bones.Swallowed dentures can present some complications that may not be present with teeth.

, Unfortunately, dentures or crowns that have come loose are less likely to be noticed by patients, and the lack of early recognition can present more serious health issues.


The nature of dental prostheses' design and the materials used can be more harmful to the digestive tract and organs, as well as being more likely than teeth to become stuck.They are made out of metal, ceramic, or plastic and none of these materials is biocompatible and they can harm the digestive tissue.
If you wear dentures, check often to be sure they are intact. Do not sleep wearing your dentures.Partial dentures have metal wires that can break after a while. Make sure that you check your dentures often to see if they are intact or otherwise you may swallow a part of them while you are eating.

, If you suspect that you’ve accidentally swallowed a denture, it’s best to see a doctor, especially if you’ve experienced any of the pain symptoms mentioned above in regards to teeth.


Often the physician will recommend waiting and watching at first, but may also order an X-ray to determine the size, shape, and location of the dental prosthesis. It’s possible that the denture will pass easily through your digestive system. If this is the case, follow the same procedures as with a tooth.
When you’ve recovered the denture, clean and disinfect it. This can be done by soaking it in a 1:10 solution of household bleach and water. "

Induce vomiting.,
Use a container.,
Use your finger to induce vomiting.,
Take an emetic.,
Drink salt water.,
Drink a mustard solution.",How to Remove a Swallowed Tooth3," Inducing vomiting is not recommended unless recommended by a doctor. Vomiting after swallowing a foreign object could cause you to aspirate (inhale) the tooth into your lungs. If given the OK by a doctor, vomiting can remove the tooth from the stomach.

, In order to retrieve the tooth, you’ll want to use a container or a sink with the drain closed. As unpleasant as it may sound, try to throw up into a colander that will catch the tooth and allow the watery content to run through, so you can avoid having to search through vomit for a tooth- which may just cause you to throw up more.

, The most common way to induce vomiting is to stick one or two fingers into the back of your throat. Tickle the far back of your throat until your gag reflex causes you to vomit.

, Ipecac syrup is an emetic remedy designed to induce vomiting. Use as directed, and mix a small amount with water. Drink it down quickly, and it should make you feel some nausea, followed by stomach contractions which will cause you to vomit.

, Be very careful; drinking too much salt water can lead to severe dehydration and even death. Mixing three teaspoons of salt into a sixteen ounce glass of warm water and drinking it down should make you vomit within twenty to thirty minutes.

, Mix a tablespoon of prepared mustard into a cup of warm water. Your stomach should react in a similar fashion to the salt water. "

, Having as much information as possible ready for the doctor will make the process easier and increase the likelihood of a favorable outcome. Have the following information ready:


How large is the tooth? Is it a molar? An incisor? Is the tooth whole or is it broken into pieces?
What home remedies have you already tried?
What symptoms are you experiencing, i.e. pain, nausea, vomiting?
Have you experienced a change in your bowel movements?
How long has it been since it happened?

Go to the dentist. Get a standard teeth cleaning. Not only will this expedite the braces installation process but it will give your dentist the chance to fill any cavities that could be in a spot where the braces will go.Find a reputable orthodontist and make an initial appointment. Your dentist can likely recommend an orthodontist; you can also look online or in the yellow pages for orthodontists in your area. Remove wisdom teeth (if necessary). In some cases, there is room in the mouth for wisdom teeth and they will not need to be removed. However, if the teeth grow in crooked or are impacted because there is a lack of space, they will need to be removed before your braces are applied. This is so that they do not interfere with the treatment or modify the final result. Your orthodontist will check for this during your initial appointment and recommend the best course of action.;
, Braces are a substantial commitment and require a number of lifestyle changes. They can also impact appearance, substantially in some cases. If you are nervous about getting braces, focus on some the benefits that will come from having had them, such as:


Straighter teeth
Better oral health
Improved self-esteem
Natural perfect smile
Correct bite with equally distributed forces

, There are multiple options available, depending on your specific diagnosis:Metal, or Traditional Braces: the most noticeable type, but these braces let you customize color of elastics more so than other types.
Ceramic or Sapphire Braces: Clear or tooth colored so as to be less noticeable. Can stain more easily if not well-cared for.
Lingual Braces: Attached to the inside of teeth, this is option is less visible, but more difficult to care for and not available for severe cases. Your tongue takes some time to adjust, so you may have some trouble with pronunciation at first. Treatment with lingual braces also usually takes longer.
Invisalign: A series of 18 to 30 clear plastic molds that are replaced every two weeks. They shape your teeth gradually and less obtrusively than other types, but are more easily lost or damaged and, also, not available for severe cases.

, Getting braces put on takes a couple of hours. Often dentists and orthodontists let you listen to your favorite music while they work. To build a playlist, think about how getting braces makes you feel (excited? worried? happy? nervous?) and build a playlist around those feelings, focusing on music that will bring you comfort, enjoyment, and reassurance, or maybe just a welcome distraction.

, A ""before picture"" will put into stark relief the transformation your braces will have on your teeth and overall oral health. Be sure to take a ""during"" and after picture as well to illustrate the change. , Know that for up to five days after getting braces, it will hurt to bite and chew, so create a meal plan of foods that are soft. Make sure that there is plenty of variety in the foods you eat so that you will not get bored of eating the same foods all the time.


Avoid going on an all liquid diet. You want to balance being kind to your teeth without missing out on nutrition.
Include dairy products such as milk, butter, yogurt, and cheese to ensure a good amount of calcium, magnesium, and potassium. These nutrients will help the bones to remineralize.
Try to incorporate cold or chilled food when possible, as this can soothe any pain associated with braces and help reduce swelling.
Get an immersion blender. Immersion blenders are perfect for making firm foods soft and pureeing soups and smoothies so they can be consumed without chewing.

, It's tricky to plan a menu of cold foods, that require minimal to no chewing, but still provide enough nutrition to keep you going through the day. Below are some suggested food and menu items, focusing on nutritious foods that are soft, do not require chewing, and are easy to prepare:


Breakfast: Yogurt and cottage cheese are good sources of low fat nutrition that are cold and won't require chewing.. If you are lactose intolerant or vegan, consider oatmeal or quinoa. Although traditionally served as hot breakfasts, both can be prepared the day before and served cold with a little soy or almond milk.
Lunch: Sticking with foods that are cold and soft, smoothies are available premade in most grocery stores or you can make one yourself. They can be made by combining a cup of greek yogurt with 1 1/2 cups of fruit or vegetable (your choice)1 cup of a complimentary fruit or vegetable juice, and 1 cup of ice.. If lactose intolerant or vegan, silken tofu can be subbed for greek yogurt in equal amounts. You can also include soy milk, soy yogurt, veggie burgers, or other soy products as protein sources.
Dinner: Soups are the perfect solution to ensuring food is soft and can be eaten without chewing. Vegetable soups particularly can ensure that you are getting a variety of key nutrients. There are even cold soups like vichyssoise or gazpacho that can be pureed to avoid chewing. If you are looking for something heartier than soup, consider pasta salads, or even tuna or chicken salad, which are all cold, and easy to chew.
Dessert and snacks: Maintaining the theme of soft, cold, and easy to chew, the following items can act as desserts or snacks while waiting for the pain of getting braces to subside: Ice cream, chilled pudding, Jello, a mashed banana or mashed pears, frozen yogurt, or sherbet.

, With braces on, it can be difficult to enjoy certain foods, like sub sandwiches, burritos, apples, corn on the cob-- basically anything that requires you to bite into food. Also consider that you'll be getting your braces adjusted multiple times yearly for the next 2-3 years and will have to revisit your soft food diet periodically. Finally, realize that there are certain foods that you should eat as rare as possible, or even avoid them completely while wearing braces:


chewy candies (gummies, caramel, taffy, etc.)
ice
nuts and popcorn
hard candy
celery and other fibrous foods, Getting braces will not be the most painful experience of your life, but it will be uncomfortable for a few days. Ease this with an over-the-counter pain reliever containing naproxen sodium, ibuprofen, or acetaminophen. Consult the pharmacist regarding dosage during the week after you get your braces or simply follow the instructions on the packaging.Make sure that you eat something before taking any pain reliever.

, Your orthodontist knows how to prepare you for life with braces and will provide you with resources like dental wax and rubber bands to help with your treatment. They may also provide you with a ""starter kit,"" containing samples of products that will help you adjust to life with braces and make the entire experience more bearable.

, Braces will require additional steps to ensure your teeth stay healthy and cavity free. Be sure to brush twice daily with a good-quality toothpaste and pay attention to what parts of your mouth are the hardest to reach. These parts will be even more difficult once you get braces, so start thinking about what would help you keep those areas clean.

, Your orthodontist can give you recommendations for products and brands that will help you keep your teeth clean while wearing braces. Below is a list of commonly suggested items:


A waterpik. Braces make it difficult for ordinary brushing to do the job. Waterpiks spray a concentrated stream of water through the tip of a wand and can be used on even the hardest to reach corners of your mouth, which can eliminate the bacteria that gets stuck between your teeth and gums. This bacteria can cause your gums to bleed.
Mouthwash. Braces make it easy for food residue to collect in and around your teeth. A rinse with mouthwash for 60 seconds can help and also ensure fresh breath and provide antibacterial protection.
Threader Floss. Ordinary floss is difficult to use with braces; however, flossing is an important part of dental hygiene. Threader floss are small plastic strands with a long loop on one end. They can be threaded through the small gaps between teeth and the loop functions the same way floss would, removing obstructions like food residue and tartar.Proxabrush or Bi-Level brush. A proxabrush is also called a ""Christmas Tree Brush"" because of its shape. It has a triangular, conical shape and can fit under the arch wire of your braces to give a thorough brushing. Or get a bi-level brush, designed with shorter bristles in the middle from brushing over your brackets.Oral Analgesic. While your mouth is adjusting to braces, it is not uncommon to experience sores on high-friction areas. There are liquid, gel, and paste types of oral analgesic; decide which one is right for your needs.

, If you play sports, be sure to wear a mouth guard. With some sports, like basketball or football, mouth guards are already standard. When you are wearing braces, however, any athletic activity-- especially those that involve throwing a ball or physical contact with other players--could result in facial injury, stitches, veneers, or resetting the braces entirely if hit in the mouth.A mouth guard that fits your needs will be available at any athletics or sporting good store.


You can also ask your dentist or orthodontist to provide you with a custom made mouth guard if the ones in the store do not fit properly because of your braces.

Get ready for your braces.,
Clean.,
Floss.,
Be patient.,
Drink lots of water.",How to Prepare for Braces a Month Before," Getting your mouth ready for a huge change is really important because its going to feel awkward anyway so preparing is always a benefit.;
, Many of you know you should clean your teeth twice a day - make sure you definitely do this, clean your teeth as soon as you get up, have breakfast clean then again if you must, and before bed. If you can use an electric toothbrush it is a lot more effective. If you can't, don't worry just don't forget the two minutes.

, If you're not used to flossing don't rush because you could cut your gums, and honestly you really don't want to cut your gums just because of your braces. Ouch!

, Make the most of the time without braces this may be difficult because you probably cannot wait to get your braces on but as soon as you do, you'll be missing your fudge!

, It's good because liquids (with no sugar) can keep your teeth healthy as they wash out bits of food.

Pay for the whole treatment up front to get a discount.,
Use a payment plan and pay over time with no interest.,
Go to a dental school for discounted costs.",How to Pay for Braces1," If you can afford the whole cost of braces up front, this may be an attractive option. Discounts for paying the whole cost at once vary from office to office, but they're normally around 3% to 7%. That's a sizable saving when you consider that braces treatment averages around $5000.If you decide to pay with this method, you'll make the payment during the visit in which the braces are put on.;
, Many find using a payment plan offered by the orthodontist's office to be a good option. It usually comes with no interest, so you save money over going through a bank, but you still can pay the cost over time. The specifics vary from office to office, but many require a 25% down payment and spread the rest of the payments over the treatment time.Treatment times vary, but usually it takes around two years.
Many orthodontists will be willing to make adjusts to the plan to fit your needs. Just ask, and they should be willing to work with you to find a plan that works

, You can often save a sizable amount of money by getting your braces treatment through a dental school. The tradeoff is that you're getting care from a resident rather than a doctor. But the residents are always supervised by experienced orthodontists, so many find this to be a good way to save money. Usually you can save about a third of the cost of normal treatment with this method."
"
Get a bank finance to pay over an extended period of time.,
Use an HSA.,
Use an FSA.,
Use insurance to help with the cost.",How to Pay for Braces2," If the payment plan offered interest-free from your orthodontist is out of your reach financial reach, you can use a third-party, such as a bank. The upside to getting a loan or a payment plan through a bank is that you can spread the cost over a greater period of time, sometimes over five to seven years. The downside is that it will come with interest, adding to the total cost.Talk to your orthodontist about third-party payment options. Many are offered through the orthodontist office itself.
Alternatively, you can contact your bank and ask about their dental financing options.

, An HSA is a Health Savings Account. They are accounts in which a certain amount of money from your paycheck goes. The HSA can be used to be for qualified medical expenses, and its primary selling point is that it's not subject to federal income tax, and unlike a FSA (flexible savings account), HSA funds roll over from year to year.In order to get an HSA, you first need a HDHP, or a High-Deductible-Health-Plan.
In order to use your HSA to pay for your braces, your orthodontist must believe that braces will help you prevent gum disease. You can't use an HSA to cover cosmetic expenses.
Contact your insurance company about whether you qualify for an FSA and how to apply.

, An FSA is a Flexible Savings Account. They can be acquired without having a a High-Deductible-Health-Plan and the expected amount of the current year's contribution is available at the beginning of the year. These are two benefits of an FSA over an HSA. An amount of your paycheck is withheld to make up the FSA. So you get to pay for the braces in full upfront at the beginning of the year, then make the payments through your FSA without interest over the year.Contact your insurance company about whether you qualify for an FSA and how to apply.

, If your work offers a dental plan, check with your benefits department to see what orthodontics are covered and the details of the discount. Often times, dental insurance will cover anywhere from 25% to 50% of the cost.If you don't have dental insurance, you can search for a policy through websites like http://www.dentalplans.com/. This option involves paying an annual fee in order to get discounts at participating orthodontists.

Ask a family member for a loan.,
Use CareCredit.,
Use a discount dental plan.,
Utilize Medicaid if applicable.,
Use a Dental Charity if you qualify.",How to Pay for Braces3," If you have grandparents or other relatives who have savings for such things, ask if they'd be willing to offer a loan. The benefit of getting a loan from a family member rather than a bank is that, being family, you'll probably get a better deal, interest-wise.

, CareCredit is a credit card that can be used for medical expenses. It allows you to pay for the expense in full and then make payments on the card over time. One of the benefits of CareCredit over normal credit cards is that they have promotional financing options, which allow you to avoid paying interest if you pay off a certain amount within the promotional time period, which is either 6, 12, 18, or 24 months, depending on the option you choose. The steps for applying for and using CareCredit include:Apply online at http://www.carecredit.com/apply/.
Check here http://www.carecredit.com/doctor-locator/ to find an orthodontist who accepts CareCredit.
Choose a financing option.
Make monthly payments.

, Joining a discount dental plan will allow you to get braces at a reduced cost. Find discount dental plans in your area using INeedDentalBenefits.com. Then you'll just have to pay around $100 a year to be on the plan. Orthodontists in your area who've signed on to the plan will then provide dental care including braces at a reduced cost., For low-income families, Medicaid can sometimes cover part of the cost of braces. Whether you or your child qualifies for Medicaid help with braces depends on your income and the state you reside in. Normally Medicaid will only apply for cases in which braces are deemed necessary for health purposes, not cosmetics.


Check with Medicaid's official website to learn if you qualify., Two of the biggest charities for dental work are Smiles Change Lives and Smiles for a Lifetime. Smiles Change Lives asks for a $600 commitment cost, and then covers the rest of the cost themselves. For both charities, you can see if you qualify, and apply for braces financing through their websites.Note, both of these charities are for children 10-18 only.

Know what a dental implant is.,
Understand that there are 5 types of dental implants.,
Know how long it will take to get the implant and to recover.",How to Research Dental Implants," The dental implant is a frame which is fixed under the jawbone so that it makes a comfortable and firm hold further on which artificial tooth can be fitted.


The common material which is used in dental implants is titanium. This is due to the reason because it is considered a very compatible material. It fuses perfectly with the jawbone and this process of fusion is called ‘osseointegration’. Basically it is composed of a titanium screw and a crown which is made to cover it.;
, Out of following five types of dental implants the last two are in use most frequently.


Root form implants
Plate form implants
Artificial bone substitute
Endosteal implants – The endosteal or in the bone implant is implanted directly into the jawbone. The part kept inside the jawbone is considered as root of the tooth. The dentist decides the height and width as per the length, width and type and also the count of teeth which has to be substituted. Generally it ends into two steps. The first step includes drilling a hole inside the bone to which root part is fixed. On this the gums are stitched from above and the patient has to wait for two-three months. This is done so that the implants can be suitably fused with bone. Then the second step comes in which a small cut is made where the implant has been put to expose it. The abutment is fixed and the crown which has been made according to size is fused. Some of the dentist also prefer it to perform in one step. They already place abutment on the gum so that there is no need for second cut.
Subperiosteal implants – These dental implants are different to endosteal as they are designed to get inserted beneath the gums. It is used when the height and width are not enough for endosteal implant. It is metal frame, placed on the gum tissue and has posts which are of metal coming out of it. With time the fusion occurs between the bone and subperiosteal implant. There are two types of surgeries. The dual surgery and the CAT scan. An impression of the bone is taken and a model is made for both while the first one requires two surgeries.

, Any dental implant generally takes 40 minutes. Its success rate is very high that is 98% to 100%. The surgery is not usually painful as anesthesia is given. However, after three-four hours one can feel a little pain but is bearable.

Press your tongue against the bottom of your mouth.,
Flatten your tongue to cover the bottom of your mouth.,
Curl the edges of your tongue independently.,
Curl the edges of your tongue together.,
Push your tongue out while holding its shape.",How to Roll Your Tongue1," You may also call this the floor of your mouth. This provides an easy to access boundary for your tongue. You will be using the inside of your mouth as a guide while you learn. You really do not need anything else. The bottom of the mouth along with the teeth and lips should provide all the necessary surfaces for the tongue taco shape.;
, Try to touch all three sides (don't worry about the back) of your mouth at the same time. Stretch your tongue so you are applying pressure to each side. You may even feel like your tongue is going under your teeth.

, Now try to move each side of your tongue independently. Keep your tongue flattened. With pressure on each side of your mouth, release one side a little and move it up that side of the mouth. For example, while keeping pressure on the left side, attempt to touch your teeth with the right side. Try touching the top of your mouth. Switch to the other side and do the same thing.

, As you learn to move each side independently you will gain more tongue dexterity. Hold your tongue down flat and move one side up. Then move the other side. You should now be holding your tongue flat while the sides are touching each side of your mouth on or above your teeth. If you look in the mirror, you will see your tongue is beginning to fold.


If you look in the mirror and your tongue doesn't appear to look flat, keep practicing flattening your tongue and moving the sides independently. What's happening is you are using muscles in the middle of your tongue to raise your tongue. These muscles should be holding your tongue to the bottom of your mouth.

, Once you open your mouth you should have the start of your tongue taco shape inside. As you push your tongue out of your mouth, keep pressure on the sides. Press the bottom of your tongue against your bottom front teeth. As your tongue exits, use your lips to hold the round shape.


You may find it easier to keep your tongue wrapped around something like a drinking straw as you push your tongue out. Keep the sides of your tongue against the sides of the straw. If you feel the bottom of your tongue pushing the straw up and away from the sides, back up and regain your tongue's shape. Keep trying until you don't need the straw at all.

Flatten your tongue to cover the bottom of your mouth.,
Make a taco with your tongue inside your mouth.,
Put the tip of your tongue against the bottom of your two front teeth.,
Lick the back of your two front teeth.,
Practice holding the middle fold without your teeth.",How to Roll Your Tongue2," Try to touch all three sides (don't worry about the back) of your mouth at the same time. Stretch your tongue so you are applying pressure to each side. You may even feel like your tongue is going under your teeth. You need to keep your tongue flat as much as possible while practicing this clover shape.

, If you are unable to make a taco shape, practice that first. You should be able to make and hold a taco shape without any support. This means if you still need your lips to hold the taco shape, you are not ready for this trick.

, The goal here is to practice moving the tip independently of the sides and middle. You will need to start by touching the tip to the bottom of the front teeth. Try to keep the sides at the top of your mouth. You may need to press the sides against the top of your mouth to keep the shape.


Touch only the tip of your tongue to the bottom of your top front teeth. If any part of your tongue is touching the bottom of your front teeth or any teeth try to pull your tongue back. Hold your tongue's tip to your front teeth while you do this. This, in and of itself, will help you differentiate the muscles in your tongue (i.e., front middle and front sides).

, Do this only with the tip of your tongue. Do this without moving the sides of your tongue. Do not let them slide back in your mouth. If they move, start over. You will know you have successfully accomplished this when your tongue folds onto itself in the middle.


This will be the hardest part and take the longest to practice and perfect. If you are going to get stuck, this is where it will happen.
If you are having trouble here you may be moving the entire front of your tongue instead of just the tip. This may be difficult to overcome. If you feel the sides of the front of your tongue moving with the tip, slow down and start over. They will need to be relaxed or they will push the sides of your tongue back into your mouth.

, Most likely the sides of your mouth are still holding the sides of your tongue steady. You may even be using your top teeth to hold the middle fold. Practice extending your tongue out of your mouth while holding the shape. With enough practice you will be able to create the fold without the help of your teeth.

Flatten your tongue in your mouth.,
Fold your tongue into the taco shape.,
Put your finger in front of your mouth.,
Push your taco shaped tongue forward against your finger.,
Hold the tip and sides of your tongue allowing the edges to the left and right of your finger to fold inward.,
Practice holding the folds until you can remove your finger.",How to Roll Your Tongue3," You want to begin by stretching your tongue as much as you can. You may try by pressing your tongue to the bottom of your mouth. You will need as much tongue as possible to make the three-leaf clover.

, If you cannot make and hold a taco shape with your tongue, do not attempt this technique. You will only frustrate yourself. The skills learned in both making a taco shape and a two-leaf clover are prerequisites for the three-leaf clover shape.

, Preferably your index finger with the fingerprint side toward your tongue. Whichever finger you use it must be strong enough to resist your tongue. You will be pressing your tongue against it to form your three-leaf clover shape. You don't have to put it on your lips but you want it close enough that you cannot stick your tongue all the way out without moving you finger.

, Don't use your mouth to hold the taco shape. Move your finger so it is close to your mouth but not in your mouth. You need room to move your tongue forward and backward as you learn this trick.


one way to position your finger is to stick your taco shaped tongue out. Put your finger beneath your tongue, point toward the ceiling. The nail of the finger should be under the tip of the tongue. Move your tongue back an let your finger come straight up. That's a good place for your finger to stay.

, During the two-leaf clover trick these muscles to the left and right of your finger relax. They should relax here too. The taco shaped tip will point upward creating the single, third leaf. This is the most difficult part. If you are going to get stuck, this is where you will get stuck.


If you can't yet do the two-leaf clover, practice that instead. The three-leaf clover trick requires much more tongue dexterity. During the two-leaf clover you will learn to manipulate the tip independently of the sides. You will need this skill to successfully form the three-leaf clover shape.

, The more practice you have rolling your tongue, the more you will not need supports. You will be able to form the three-leaf clover without assistance. Pull your finger back from your tongue while holding the shape. It may take several times but eventually you will be able to hold the shape.


You may need to take a break while practicing. You tongue muscles may become fatigued from overuse in ways they have not been used before. This may make holding the shape impossible until later.

Glue the beads in place.,
Bend the ends of the paperclip.,
Apply orthodontic wax.,
Try your braces on.",How to Make Fake Braces1," Make sure to choose a thin paper clip for this project. The thicker paper clips will not work for this method, and will also look clunky and unrealistic on your teeth. The beads that you will be using to make the brackets with will also not fit on a thicker paper clip., This shape should fit around your top teeth. After you’ve created the “U” and smoothed out any kinks in the wire, test it. Smile and pop the wire onto your top teeth, seeing how it feels. Fix any areas where it’s uncomfortable or doesn’t look natural.[[








, In other words, see how many teeth are showing when you smile naturally. You’ll need one bead for each visible tooth. The beads will look like the brackets of braces., You can find small beads at any art supply store, and choose the colors you’d like for your braces. After they’re all on the paperclip, hold it up to your mouth and smile again. Adjust the beads so that each one is centered on a tooth. Once you have them centered properly, carefully remove the brace from your mouth.







, Carefully lay the paperclip onto a paper plate or piece of paper, and make sure they haven’t moved from their measured positions. Using a non-toxic superglue, carefully glue the beads into place. Let the glue dry for about ten minutes. Once the beads are firmly in place, carefully use your finger to scratch off any excess glue.








The superglue won’t breakdown in your mouth for three to four weeks. You likely won’t be wearing the braces 24/7, so your fake braces will last even longer.

, Take a pair of pliers and bend the ends up 90 degrees into an ""L"" shape. Now bend the tip of your ""L"" back until it lies flat along the back of the ""L."" Essentially, the wire will be doubled over. Do this slowly and carefully, and be patient. It will take a couple of gentle compressions with your pliers to create this compressed bend.







, You can find orthodontic wax in most drugs stores. Break a stick of orthodontic wax in two and roll each piece between your palms to create two balls of wax. Push each end of your braces through a ball of the wax.







, Gently place the braces over your top teeth and adjust them. Gently push the orthodontic wax against your teeth so that it helps hold your braces in place, while also flattening out to look more natural. You may have to play around with your braces for a bit to get them looking perfect.Remember, only wear your fake braces for short periods of time to ensure you don't hurt your teeth or gums.

Learn how standard braces work.,
Ask your orthodontist about ceramic braces.,
Inquire about Invisalign braces.,
Find out more about lingual braces.,
Ask your orthodontist about self-ligating braces.,
Research Viazis or “FastBraces”.,
Turn your braces into a fashion statement.",How to Make Braces Look Less Noticeable1," “Standard” braces include many different parts, which, except for the elastics, are all made of metal. The various parts of standard braces are as follows:Bands - rings of metal that go around a molar at each end of your teeth reaching a total of four.
Brackets - small, square metal pieces that attach to each tooth after an entire series of measurements where even half of a millimeter can make a big difference.
Wire (round and square) - a thin, flexible wire that is attached to the bands and brackets and can be adjusted, which is the most important part that helps you to get straight teeth.
Elastics (also called ligatures) - tiny elastics are used to attach and hold the wire to the brackets and bands. However, in some cases your orthodontist may use metal ligatures.
The bands and brackets are glued to your teeth and stay in one position while you have braces. The wire and elastics are changed usually every time you go to the orthodontist for an adjustment.;
, Ceramic braces are generally the same as “standard” braces, except the brackets are made of ceramic instead of metal. Ceramic brackets are usually white or clear-ish in colour and blend into the colour of your teeth so they aren’t as noticeable, which would make the wire the only visible component of your braces. In general the brackets are designed so they do not stain, and stay the same colour for the period you wear them. Like “standard” brackets, elastics are still required to attach the wire to the brackets, but you can choose to use white or clear coloured elastics. The wire, however, is still the same metal as “standard” braces.It has been reported that the clear or white coloured elastics can stain over time, making them stand out more than the brackets. But keep in mind that these are changed every time you get an adjustment, which usually happens once a month so even if you smoke they will not be that visible.
Ceramic braces are more expensive than “standard” braces and may not be covered by some dental plans.

, Invisalign braces are clear plastics moulds of your teeth, similar in a way to mouthguards, but not as bulky. When they’re on your teeth, they are essentially invisible. They also do not require any items to be glued to your teeth, and you won’t need to use wires and elastics. You will just have to remove them when you eat and brush your teeth and then apply them again. Invisalign braces are only made by one company, but most Orthodontists do offer them. (There is a new type available that some orthodontists offer. These need to be changed monthly or even more often. They widen and fall off when the effect is complete.) Only people who have minor issues will be able to use Invisalign, as they are not designed for severe orthodontic problems. Your orthodontist will be able to tell you if your particular situation “qualifies” for Invisalign braces.Invisalign braces are quite a bit more expensive than “standard” braces and may not be covered by some dental plans.

, Lingual braces consist of the same components as “standard” braces, except the brackets are glued to the back of your teeth, instead of the front. Therefore, it’s almost impossible for anyone to see your braces when you’re smiling or talking. Only some orthodontists are trained on how to use lingual braces, so if you are interested in this option, you’ll have to find an orthodontist who offers them.Lingual braces are similar to Invisalign in terms of function because they are not applicable in more complicated cases, and the treatment usually lasts longer than standard braces.

, “Standard” braces require an elastic, or ligature, to hold the wire onto the bracket. Self-ligating brackets do not require an elastic. They’re designed in such a way that the bracket is able to securely hold the wire without help. Most self-ligating brackets are smaller than “standard” brackets and therefore do not stand out on your teeth as much. There is also a kind of self-ligating bracket that is partially made of ceramic, to also hide its appearance better.You will need to check with your orthodontist to find out if they offer self-ligating brackets, and if so, which kinds.

, Viazis braces are a little different than “standard” braces, but are made completely of metal. Brackets for Viazis braces are the shape of a triangle, instead of a square, and use only a round wire. The concept was developed by an orthodontist in Texas, and is suppose to cause the patient less discomfort and speed-up the brace-wearing process. The triangle shape of the bracket may appear smaller on your teeth, helping to make the braces stand out less than square brackets. Not all orthodontists use this method, so you would have to research potential orthodontists beforehand., You may not be happy with the fact that you have to get braces, but rather than thinking of ways to hide your braces, show them off! An orthodontist in Nebraska makes brackets that are shaped like stars, flowers, hearts, footballs, and more. They work the same way as a standard bracket, but they look much cooler. You could even combine interesting colours of elastics with the shape of your braces to make a statement."

Get the proper-sized rubber band.,
Add butterfly earring backs.,
Put the rubber band around your teeth.",How to Make Fake Braces2," You’ll need one that fits around the front of your teeth and goes around the back. The best kinds to use are the small rubber bands used for tiny braids. You can find these at drugstores and beauty supply stores., You’ll need to snap one earring back on for each tooth that is visible when you smile. Put them all onto the rubber band facing the same way. The flat part of the butterfly back will be against your tooth, with the bumps facing outwards. These will look like the brackets of braces., Be careful to stretch the band gently so that it doesn’t snap. Once the rubber band is looped around all of your upper teeth, you can adjust the butterfly backs. Slide each one until it’s centered over each tooth.The butterfly backs can cause gum irritation and scratches to your teeth, so make sure you only wear these for short spurts of time. Take your fake braces off when you’re eating and sleeping.

Rinse your mouth at least three times a day.,
Brush your teeth at least twice a day.,
Floss every day.,
Get a regular dental cleaning every six months.,
Avoid eating certain types of foods.,
Wear a mouth guard when playing sports.,
Do not smoke.,
Avoid oral piercings.",How to Make Braces Look Less Noticeable2," You don’t have to use mouthwash, unless you have it available, just water. Rinsing your teeth, at a minimum, will help dislodge any food particles that may be caught in your braces.To help you remember to do this, start a routine of rinsing your mouth every time you eat. This is important not just for looks, but also for preventing gum bleeding, which is hard to control during an orthodontic treatment.

, Braces provide a lot of little spots where food particles can get caught. If food gets stuck in these areas for too long, it can degrade your teeth, increasing the chances of decay and cavities. Ideally you should bring a toothbrush and toothpaste with you to school, work, or anywhere else you go and try to brush your teeth after every meal.When you have braces it is recommended you use a soft-bristled toothbrush, whether it’s a manual or electric toothbrush.Get a new toothbrush every three months or change it when bristles start to spread., Flossing helps remove food particles and plaque that can build up under the gum line, where your toothbrush may not reach. Removing these particles every day helps ensure your gums stay healthy while you’re wearing your braces.There are two types of floss you may use: one is the regular kind and the other type has a thicker end for flossing under dental bridges and will work perfectly between brackets. You can also get floss that is pre-threaded on a holder if you prefer.
In addition to flossing, you may want to consider an oral irrigation system. (You might be more familiar with the brand name of WaterPik.) These systems can spray jets of water into your mouth to reach spots you can’t get to with a toothbrush or floss.Since flossing is easier without the wires, ask your orthodontist if you (or them) can floss when you’re at their office for an adjustment., Keeping your teeth and gums healthy on your own is an awesome first step, but try to visit your dentist for a cleaning every six months. Not only will your dentist be able to do a more thorough cleaning of your teeth and gums, they’ll be able to show you areas you may need to pay extra attention to., When you have braces you do need to pay more attention to the types of foods you eat. One reason is that really hard foods can actually break the brackets of your braces. You should try to avoid foods such as caramel, liquorice, lollipops, gum, popcorn, taffy, nuts, and jelly beans because they will turn into a constant deposit for bacteria and transform the sugar into acids. Other types of foods, like apples and carrots, are still okay to eat, but should be cut up first and not eaten whole.Ceramic brackets are designed not to stain, but clear and white elastics can. If you’re wearing clear or white elastics, you may want to stay away from foods like coffee, red wine, purple and red coloured sodas, curry (specifically the spices turmeric and curry powder), mustard, and pasta sauce.
Keep in mind that your ligatures only stay on your braces for a short period of time, and then they’re changed. So you might want to eat foods that may stain them closer to your orthodontic appointment!

, If you do any active sport, including things like skateboarding or snowboarding, you should consider wearing a mouth guard. Mouth guards help protect your teeth from being broken or even knocked completely out.It’s even more important when you wear braces, as in addition to your teeth, you want to avoid breaking the various parts of your braces or injure your oral mucosa, which is very sensitive when in contact with the metal parts of your braces.

, Smoking can cause a lot of oral problems, whether you have braces or not. Besides bad breath, smoking can stain your teeth and tongue, dull your sense of taste and smell, cause you to heal slower after oral surgery, cause gum disease and tooth loss, and cause oral cancer. If you smoked before getting braces, this would be a great time to focus on quitting., Any type of piercing inside or around your mouth can cause long-term problems. Oral piercings can cause infections and swelling inside your mouth, can cause you to choke if something were to break, or can crack a tooth if you bite too hard.The combination of oral piercings and braces is, quite frankly, a recipe for disaster that does a lot of harm to your teeth and can cause accidents during sleeping. If you have any oral piercings before getting braces, you will need to speak to your orthodontist about them. Chances are they’ll ask you to remove them before starting your orthodontic treatment.

Practice smiling with your braces.,
Work to reduce your self-consciousness about your braces.",How to Make Braces Look Less Noticeable3," One potential way to draw attention away from your mouth, and towards another facial feature, is to make that other facial feature really stand out.

Wear earrings that are large, or colourful, or really stand out with your hair style.People will be too busy admiring your earrings to even notice you have braces.

, Certain hair styles naturally draw the eye away from certain facial features - like your mouth - and the attention somewhere else. Speak to your hair stylist about what styles will work best for you. Also consider getting your hair dyed a really awesome fashion colour. Not only are these colours extremely popular today for almost any age, but they’re sure to have someone looking at your hair and not your mouth., This is obviously not going to work for everyone, but it certain is an option for some. Beards, in general, are quite popular right now and a lot more men have grown theirs out. And depending on the beard you grow, it can make you look more distinguished and mature. And if you go for the lumberjack look, pretty much anything below your nose is hidden by hair, including your braces!, Eating, drinking, talking, environmental conditions, and other things can cause your lips to dry out and become chapped. Chapped lips tend to stand out on a person. If you have braces, you want to make sure you keep your lips healthy and moisturized into order to draw attention away from your mouth. Try carrying a good quality lip balm in your pocket or bag and applying it regularly. If possible, make sure the lip balm includes sunscreen., If you’re self-conscious about your braces standing out when you smile, practice in the mirror.This may be even more important if you are going to have your photo taken for something like a wedding, graduation, etc. There are also smile exercises you can do to help train and build the facial muscles you use to smile.Check out the article How to Smile with Braces for more great tips!

In fact, braces have actually become more popular because a perfect smile with perfect teeth has become more popular and people have also realized that beyond the aspect or high cost, braces are really important for your health in the end. Some teens are actually pressured into getting braces, instead of teased about having braces!Parents - if you’re thinking it’s time for your child to get braces, talk to them about it. Make them part of the decision. Take all their questions seriously, and allow them to ask their orthodontist any and all questions they have. The more comfortable they are that they’re making the right decision for themselves, the more likely they are to accept the whole process.Remind yourself that, chances are, not a lot of people even notice you’re wearing braces. Because you’re concerned about your braces, you are probably noticing braces on other people way more than they are noticing the braces on you.If you’ve had a bad day, maybe because someone teased you about your braces, or you weren’t able to eat your favourite food because your teeth hurt too much, talk about it. Vent your frustrations to your good friends, siblings, or even your parents. Sometimes simply saying it out loud and having someone listen will make you feel a lot better."

Embrace your braces.,
Choose a color that isn't too flashy.,
Considering asking for another style of braces.,
Don't be shy!",How to Look Great With Braces1," Having braces is awesome – not because of the way they look or how they feel, but because of the results they will give you. When you have braces, it shows other people that you care about your appearance, and that you are trying to improve it. Remember that when your treatment is done, you will have a straight smile., If you have traditional braces, think about the color bands you will choose. Avoid bright colors such as orange, green, yellow red, light blue, purple, etc. These bands are more prone to popping. Also avoid clear bands, since they tend to stain. Do use black, grey, and silver. They will show the least and they won't stain so easily.Try to experiment with different colors. You'll get to know after some time which colors look best on you.
If you're going to do two colors or more, make sure they are in the same color family (warm/cool) and that they do not clash with each other.

, If you really do not like the traditional braces that you've been given, ask your orthodontist about other types of braces. Some of your options include:


Ceramic Braces: they are the same size as the traditional ones, except they are colored to look like your teeth.Lingual Braces: they are located on the inside of the teeth so they won't be visible. Be aware that they tend to be more uncomfortable at first, and they may hurt more.Invisalign: this is not a type of braces. They are custom-made mouth guards that will align your teeth over a period of two years or more. They don't work for serious dental issues.

, Keep a smile on your face, and hold your head high. A friendly face and a positive attitude will have much more effect on your appearance than your braces ever could. Be authentically yourself – that's what really matters.Don't intentionally mumble or try to keep your mouth closed. People might get the wrong idea and think you're shy or don't want to talk to them.

Expect to have your shape taken and teeth brushed.,
Rinse out your mouth.,
Wait for the teeth to be dried.,
Be prepared for the bracket placement.,
Wear sunglasses.,
Expect the wires to be attached.,
Choose your ligatures (less formally known as ""colors"" - this is only if you are getting them).",How to Know What the Orthodontist Will Do when You Get Braces," If the orthodontist has not already done so, he or she will cover a tray with ""goo"" to put in your mouth. This is just to get an idea of your tooth shape. Once they have finished that, they will pour a little water on what looks like, feels like, and tastes like sand. The orthodontist will dip a toothbrush into the mixture and brush your teeth.;
, The orthodontist will pick up something called a spacer that keeps your mouth open and they will adjust it to fit your mouth. Usually your lips go under a little curved part, revealing the teeth. They will give you something to bite on. This keeps your tongue from getting in the way when they are putting the braces on.

, The orthodontist will blow some air onto your teeth to dry them off. If they do not dry the teeth, they cannot apply a solution to put the brackets and glue on. They will suck all the saliva out of your mouth.

, First the orthodontist will take a small brush that they dip in a little solution. They will rub this on each tooth. The orthodontist will set up the brackets and start to apply them. You must stay very still during this part. Try to calm yourself if you are shaky.

, If someone else is with you, they will ask them to look away to avoid the glare. They will attach what looks like sunglasses over your eyes, and the orthodontist will also put on some safety glasses. The orthodontist will take out a little light and shine it on the brackets to dry the glue.

, Once they have dried the glue, they will attach the wire. This is simple and does not hurt. If necessary, they will clip the end of the wire so it does not rub into the back of your mouth and cause problems.

, Once you have chosen them, the orthodontist will take a tool and stretch them over the brackets. This does not hurt, although you might feel a slight pinch. That's it! You are done! If they offer you a mirror to admire yourself, take it!

Brush after every meal.,
Use an electric toothbrush and toothpaste that contains fluoride.,
Make sure you brush for at least two minutes.,
Floss at least once a day with a floss threader.",How to Keep from Having White Spots when Your Braces Come Off1," This means even after a small late night meal or a quick snack from the vending machine. Food particles can get trapped in your braces after you eat, and the longer those particles remain trapped, the higher your risk of developing dental issues, such as a buildup of plaque. It’s important that you practice diligent and consistent dental hygiene when you have braces to prevent staining, infection, and the development of cavities., Electric toothbrushes are very effective at removing plaque from your teeth and keeping them clean.If you do not want to invest in an electric toothbrush, you should use a soft toothbrush that has round bristles.


Make sure you completely understand how to brush correctly and practice the right moves so you can avoid any future problems. Ask your orthodontist to demonstrate for you.
As well, you should make sure your toothpaste contains fluoride. In a recent study, toothpaste that contained fluoride was shown to reduce the development of white spots on teeth by 70%.Your orthodontist may also recommend a fluoride rinse that you can use once a day as part of your brushing routine., Rinse your mouth with water before you brush to loosen any food particles that are stuck in your braces. You can also use an interproximal brush, which is designed to fit under the wires of your braces, to remove plaque and food particles in your braces.Brush for at least two minutes total, taking care to brush each tooth at the gum line, as well as below and above the brackets. Start with your gum line first. Hold the toothbrush at a 45-degree angle and carefully make small circles along your gum line. Then, clean the brackets by moving the brush at a downward angle on the top of the brackets.
Finish brushing the top of your brackets by holding the brush at an upward angle from the top of the brackets and moving the brush in small circles. Rinse your mouth with water to remove the toothpaste. Then, rinse your mouth with mouthwash that does not contain any whitening products (though it should contain fluoride or chlorhexidine).
Check that your braces and mouth are well brushed by confirming your braces appear shiny. Dull looking metal on your braces means your braces and your teeth are still covered in food and/or bacteria.

, Another key element of good dental hygiene is flossing at least once a day. It can be tricky to floss when you have braces, as you should floss between your braces and under the wires of your braces. Make flossing easier by using a floss threader or an orthodontic flosser. You can buy these products at your local drug store or ask your orthodontist for a sample.Use waxed floss, rather than unwaxed floss, as it is easier to slide between your teeth and less likely to snag on your braces. The floss threader works by allowing you to attach the floss to a threader, making it easier to slide the floss under your braces and reach your teeth. This also makes it easier to handle.
Always floss well along and under your gum lines. It may take practice to master flossing with braces, but be patient and take your time.
If you have spaces between your teeth, use the interproximal brush to go between these spaces when flossing.

Visit your orthodontist if pain continues.",How to Make Your Braces Hurt Less," Try an over-the-counter NSAID painkiller such as ibuprofen. Check the label and take the recommended dosage for your age. Take them with a little food to go easier on your stomach.


Take these painkillers only when necessary, and never for more than 10 days.;
, Most braces require warmth to become stiff and pull your teeth.Cold foods or drinks will lessen the strain for temporary relief. Try smoothies, yogurt, ice cream, or applesauce. Choose options without toppings or chunks. Sucking on crushed ice can help, but avoid ice cubes, which are too hard.


If you have temperature-sensitive teeth, or a less common type of braces, this may cause a different kind of pain. Warm liquids work better for some people. Don't eat warm and cold foods at the same time, as this can damage tooth enamel.

, Your teeth should recover in a few days, but until then forgo the raw vegetables. Eat meals of soup, fish, and white rice instead. Cook vegetables until soft, and choose soft fruits or applesauce. Sticky foods such as chewing gum or taffy can easily rip off braces, and should be avoided even after the pain is gone.After the initial pain goes away, you can eat hard foods in thin slices or small pieces.

, Pieces of food can always cause braces pain, but especially when you've just got them tightened. Use a ""platypus flosser"" to avoid snagging the floss on your braces.


Flossing daily will keep your teeth clean even if you don't notice stuck food. This is especially important with braces, since plaque builds up around the brackets.

, Gently move the toothbrush in circles over your sore gums.

, Taking some time off school or work may sound fun, but you might regret it. Get outside and follow your usual routine to take your mind off the pain.

, He may recommend a gel, paste, mouthwash, or physical barrier to lessen the pain. Many of these are available over the counter at drug stores, but your orthodontist can advise you on which product will be most effective.

, If you're not sure where the injury is, run a finger or your tongue along the inside of your mouth. You should feel a sore or swollen area. Figure out which wire, bracket, or hook rubs up against this area.

, You can find dental wax at a drug store, or your orthodontist's office. Wash your hands, then roll a small piece of wax until it softens and forms a ball. Press the wax over the irritating piece of metal, then smooth it down with your finger or tongue. This works for sharp wires, brackets, or rubber band hooks.


You can leave in the wax while eating. It won't hurt you if you swallow a piece., If you don't have dental wax, a small amount of nontoxic lip balm may soothe the irritated area. Swallowing too much can give you an upset stomach, but a little in your mouth is safe. Use this only for a short time before finding some dental wax.


Some people are allergic to para-aminobenzoic acid, occasionally found in sunscreen lip balms.Call an ambulance if you feel dizzy or if your mouth swells.

, Only try this with thin, flexible wires or rubber band hooks that are poking your cheek or gums. Push them gently back against your teeth, using a clean finger or brand new pencil eraser (rubber).Do not pick at the wires between brackets, or at any wire that won't bend easily.

, An orthodontist can clip the wire short in an instant. Most will not bill you for this, and may even let you drop in without an appointment.


This is a non-emergency, so your orthodontist probably won't see you outside of normal business hours. Keep applying wax until the office opens.

, The inside of your mouth will become tougher as the braces rub against it. As long as your braces aren't sharp or cutting into your mouth, the pain should go away on its own. This may take a few days or a few weeks.


Dental wax can slow this down. Once the pain is less severe, try using thinner and thinner pieces of wax to get your mouth used to the braces.

, Inhale deeply, filling your mouth with air. Pull your lips outward with your fingers. This may temporarily relieve sore areas of your mouth.


Don't try this in areas with dust, pollen, or car exhaust.

, Mix a small spoonful of salt in a glass of warm water. Stir until the salt has dissolved. Swish this around your mouth several times, gargle, and spit it out. Repeat as often as needed during the first few days of pain. This will relieve pain from swelling, and help fight off infection.


You can use a mouthwash with antimicrobial properties instead.Use as instructed on the label. Do not swallow.

, If the pain is too severe for you to function, call your orthodontist for an emergency visit. If the pain is moderate but lasts longer than a week, schedule an appointment with your orthodontist. She may discover a problem with your braces, or switch you to a less painful treatment.

You can now apply the wax.

, All you have to do is press it onto the offending area.Put the ball of wax on your fingertip.
Touch the wax to the poking wire or bracket.
Press down gently to cover the wire. Pressure on your teeth or braces while receiving orthodontic treatment can cause some discomfort. If you feel soreness while pressing on the wire this is completely normal.

, You don't want the wax to get into your food while you eat. Discard any used wax immediately.
Replace it with new wax after eating or brushing your teeth.
Continue to use the wax until you can see your orthodontist or dentist to fix the wire.

Yes, these things may catch people's eyes – but if you are authentic in expressing yourself, the attention will not be negative.

, Try wearing an interesting hat, a pair of sunglasses, or a scarf. Wear a different style of clothes, and try a new trend. Put on a t-shirt that is different from your regular attire. Wear temporary tattoos, and use jewelry to distract from your braces.

, Put your hair into a new and exciting hairstyle – or get a bold haircut! Do your eye makeup in a colorful, catchy way.

Reduce your coffee, tea, and soda intake.,
Avoid foods high in sugar and artificial flavors or colors.",How to Keep from Having White Spots when Your Braces Come Off2," This will ensure your mouth stays moist and there is enough saliva in your mouth to keep your mouth clean and plaque free. Saliva is your mouth’s natural acid neutralizer and it will help to eliminate the acids that develop in your mouth as a result of the bacteria in your mouth. Encourage constant saliva production by drinking lots of water throughout the day.Try to stick to still water as sparkling water increases tartar deposits and lowers the pH in your mouth.

, Coffee and tea are known to stain your teeth and it can be difficult to properly remove coffee or tea from your teeth when you have braces. As well, sodas and other sugary drinks like sports drinks usually contain phosphoric acid, which can erode the enamel on your teeth and lead to a buildup of plaque, causing cavities and tooth sensitivity., Though it may be tempting to maintain a diet of soft treats, like ice cream, pudding, jello, and hot chocolate, avoid overindulging on sweets. Too much sugar can lead to the development of dental issues like plaque-building cavities, which can lead to white spots when your braces come off.Cut down on known cavity causers in your diet and try to only eat treats or sweets occasionally. Always brush your teeth well after eating foods high in sugar and artificial flavors or colors so these products do not remain on your teeth for a long period of time.

Get the subtlest braces you can.,
Keep your braces clean.,
Avoid staining your teeth and/or braces.,
Have your ligatures changed regularly.",How to Look Good in Ceramic Braces3," Fortunately, ceramic braces are already far subtler than traditional braces. There are some choices you can make, however, to make them even less obvious.


Ask your orthodontist for tooth-colored wire. This is less noticeable, and will blend better with your ceramic braces and clear ligatures.
Ask your orthodontist for self-ligating ceramic braces. This is a type of ceramic braces where the wire clips directly into the bracket, eliminating the need for stainable elastics around each bracket.

, The brackets will stain yellowish if they are not brushed correctly. This will make them much more noticeable.


Brush your teeth 2-4 times a day with non-whitening toothpaste. If you use whitening toothpaste, your teeth may have yellowish spots when your braces are removed, from where the braces prevented contact between the toothpaste and your teeth.Floss at least once a day.

, While you should avoid whitening toothpaste, you should also do what you can to keep your teeth and/or braces from yellowing. This will draw the wrong sort of attention to your mouth.

Push the floss between your teeth.,
Slide the floss up and down.,
Carefully pull the floss out.,
Repeat for each tooth until finished.",How to Floss With Braces1," When you're flossing with braces, it's important to remember that there are plenty of metal pieces and corners to catch your floss on. Because of this, you'll want to use a thin, wax-coated floss whenever you can. Unwaxed, thread-like floss is much more likely to get stuck to your braces.The amount of floss you should use can vary slightly based on the size of your mouth and your hands. Most dental resources recommend a piece about 12 – 18 inches (30 – 46 cm) long.;
, Grab the floss with one hand a few inches behind one end. Carefully thread it under or over the main wire of your braces, taking care not to get it stuck. When it's around the wire, pull it through so there's enough slack on either end to grab it.A mirror can be a big help here.


Be gentle. Do not pull on the brace wire with the floss — you're just trying to get the floss behind it, not to ""scrub"" at the wire itself.

, Grab one end of the floss in each hand. Wrap the ends around your index fingers for a tight grip. Adjust the floss so that it runs up the bottom of each index finger to the fingertip. Move one index finger inside your mouth and gently pull the floss so that it goes into the space between your teeth.


If you've flossed before, this movement should feel natural. You basically want to move the floss into the ""crease"" between the teeth, then push it down into the gap. For some of your teeth, this will probably be a tight fit — this is normal.

, Now that the floss is in between your teeth, use your fingers to slide it up and down from the gums to the point where it's difficult to keep moving it. Pull gently so that the floss rubs against the insides of both teeth. You want to ""scrub"" as much of this inner space as possible — try doing it five times against each surface.


This scrubbing motion may seem like it's not ""doing"" anything, but it is. Flossing isn't just for removing bits of food that get stuck — it's also important for removing plaque, an invisible film of bacteria that can cause decay, pain, and discoloration if it's not dealt with., Grab one end of the floss and gently pull until it comes free, taking care not to catch it on your braces. Congratulations — you've just flossed between one set of teeth!

, Go down each row of teeth and carefully thread the floss between every set of teeth all the way to your furthest-back molars. When you have ""scrubbed"" with every set of teeth on the top and bottom of your mouth, you're done.Take your time. Flossing properly when you have braces can take up to three times longer than a normal flossing session, but it's especially important to floss when you're wearing orthodontic devices because these devices can get in the way of cleaning with a brush alone.You may also experience some gum bleeding which is normal due to inflammation which occurs when braces are placed in.

Watch for dark-colored urine.,
Look out for jaundice.,
See your doctor if you notice clay-colored stool.,
Look out for flu-like symptoms.,
Know not all people have early symptoms.,
Watch for the development of chronic symptoms.,
Seek medical attention for symptoms.",How to Recognize Hepatitis C Symptoms1," Since Hepatitis C is a disease of the liver, some of its earliest and most prominent signs indicate a lack of liver function. Urine that is especially dark in color may indicate your liver is not filtering out bilirubin properly.Dark urine means colors that range from orange, amber, brown, or even cola-colored urine.
There are other things that can cause discoloration in urine such as certain vitamins in large amounts, medications, a kidney infection or even dehydration. If you notice a consistent change over the course of many days in your urine color and your medication or vitamin intake hasn't changed, make sure to get checked out by a doctor to understand the cause.;
, Jaundice is a yellowing of the skin. It is most commonly seen in parts of the body like face, fingers, and a yellowing of the whites of eyes. Much like darkly colored urine, jaundice is caused by a concentration of bilirubin, indicating that the body is not properly filtering. Since Hepatitis C is a liver disease, it can directly affect the liver's normal function of filtering bilirubin. If you notice your skin yellowing, you should quickly have your blood checked to make sure you do not have too much bilirubin in your body.Just like dark-colored urine, there are more benign explanations, such as Gilbert's Disease, an inherited condition with no associated complications.

, Clay-colored stool can indicate there is a biliary system issue, the liver being a major culprit. The liver typically releases bile salts into your stool, giving it the normal brownish color. When stool does not turn brownish and remains pale, this indicates a problem that may be affecting the release of bile.


This is particularly important if you notice this in conjunction with other symptoms, such as jaundice and/or dark colored urine.

, Although this can many times just be the flu or a common sickness, it can also be an indication that your body is in the early stages of fighting off Hepatitis C. If you notice symptoms such as mild fever, fatigue, vomiting and a loss of appetite accompanied with any indication of liver malfunction, this can be an early sign of the disease. Even if it is just an ordinary sickness, a doctor will be able to run simple tests to narrow down what's making you feel ill.


Other common symptoms include fatigue (the most common complaint), nausea, loss of appetite, muscle pain, weakness and weight loss.
Several non-liver related conditions are associated with chronic hepatitis C infection, including diabetes mellitus, autoimmune disorders and kidney disease.

, As many as 70 – 80% of those who contract the disease may be asymptomatic. This early phase, known as the acute phase of Hepatitis C, is often mild and can go unnoticed. It may just seem like a common ailment, with nothing too serious developing., Over time symptoms of Hepatitis C can become severe. The development of cirrhosis is a common progression of Hepatitis C. This is when the liver becomes so scarred and hardened by the disease it is no longer able to heal itself. The most common symptoms of cirrhosis is fluid retention in the abdominal area, jaundice, and even abnormal bleeding, particularly in the stomach or esophagus. By the time these symptoms take hold, urgent medical care is needed.Between five and 30% of patients with chronic hepatitis C go on to develop cirrhosis over a 20 – 30 year time span.
In the later stages of Hepatitis C, full on liver failure may take hold. This may also bring on mental symptoms like confusion. Sometimes a liver transplant may be needed but recurrence of the disease is common., You will want to make an appointment with a primary healthcare provider who can move forward with testing, whether you're in the early or latter stages of the disease. They may refer you to a specialist in liver disease, infectious diseases, or a specialist in stomach and intestinal problems."

Determine if you have a canker sore.,
Check for incorrect brushing and flossing.,
Look for teething.,
Determine if you have gum disease.,
Decide if you have a small gum injury.,
Determine if you have oral cancer.,
See your dentist.",How to Relieve Gum Pain1," Canker sores are ulcers in the mouth that can cause persistent pain or pain when eating. Canker sores in the mouth can cause gum pain if they are located on the gums. These mouth ulcers are easily identified. They are usually oval with red or white centers.Doctors don't know exactly what causes canker sores. They are sometimes caused by injury in the mouth or by acidic foods. They can also appear when your immune system drops and can be the first sign of a lower immunity.
Canker sores generally heal on their own in a week or two.;
, If you are brushing or flossing the wrong way, you can cause gum pain. Brushing too vigorously or flossing with too much force may cause gum irritation, pain, and bleeding.Choose soft bristle toothbrushes instead of harder ones.
Use a circular motion instead of back and forth. Back and forth brushing can irritate your gums. It also retracts your gums, exposing the root, which leads to a high tooth sensitivity.

, Gum pain may be due to teething, especially in small children. Adults may feel gum pain due to teething if a tooth has not properly broken through the gum. The appearance of wisdom teeth also can cause gum pain in adults.Impacted teeth are another reason teeth can cause gum pain. Impacted teeth are teeth that have not not fully come in. They are either just under the gum or have only come through the gum partially. They most commonly occur with wisdom teeth or upper canines., Gum disease is one of the most common causes for gum pain. Gum disease starts as gingivitis and can be treated with proper oral care. Periodontal disease is the more serious form, which can lead to the loss of teeth. Symptoms of gum disease include:Red, swollen, or painful gums
Bad breath
Unpleasant taste in the mouth
Receding gums, which make your teeth look bigger
Bleeding gums during and after brushing
Pockets between teeth and gums
Teeth that feel weak or unstable — you may be able to wiggle them with your tongue

, Sometimes, sharp objects, rough food, or hot food may cause a minor gum injury. This can lead to gum pain.These minor injuries generally heal on their own within a few days to a week.

, Oral cancer is another reason why you may experience gum pain. Oral cancer can lead to sores in the mouth that won’t heal and change in color and volume, along with pain in the mouth.Other symptoms of oral cancer include lumps in the cheek, neck, or under your jaw; difficulty swallowing or chewing; difficulty moving the jaw or tongue; numbness in the tongue and mouth; voice changes; and a persistent sore throat or feeling that something is stuck in your throat.

, If you experience any gum pain that won’t go away, sores that won’t heal, or any other abnormal symptoms, visit your dentist. Even if you believe you just have gingivitis, a dental check up once or twice a year can help reduce your risk of gum disease.


If you have any of the symptoms of oral cancer or severe gum disease, or other symptoms like a fever or signs of an infection, visit your dentist immediately.

Start early.,
Consider aligner therapy (ALT) instead of conventional edgewise braces (CEB).,
Consider accelerated orthodontic treatment if you are an adult.Because adults have more developed teeth and jaws, teeth take longer to move.,
Consult your orthodontist to discuss the pros and cons of various treatments.,
Do as your orthodontist tells you.,
Keep your mouth clean.,
Chop up solid foods.,
Don’t eat hard or sticky foods.,
Stay away from soda or other carbonated beverages.,
Don’t chew on ice cubes.,
Don’t chew on things like pens or straws.,
Break habits like biting your nails or playing with the elastics on your braces.,
Download an app.,
Consider using an electric toothbrush for 15 minutes a day.",How to Get Your Braces off Faster," Children should have their first orthodontic screening at age 7, to check for potential problems.It is best to start with braces as soon as the permanent teeth are in place, which may be as early as 10 or 11 in girls and as late as 13 or 14 in boys. The less mature the teeth, jaws, and facial muscles, the more rapidly treatment can be accomplished, meaning less time in braces., Metal, edgewise braces involve bonding stainless steel metal to your teeth to apply precise forces that move them into place. Aligners are a clear, strong plastic material fabricated to fit each person’s mouth. Like conventional metal braces, they work by exerting pressure over time. Unlike metal braces, you will go through a series of aligners, wearing each one for three weeks.Aligners are less obtrusive and studies show they reduce time in braces.Aligner braces are more expensive. Depending on your particular situation, they may reduce time in braces by only a small amount, or not at all, so consult your orthodontist before deciding which braces you will choose.Unlike metal braces, aligners can be taken out, which is great for photo ops, etc. However, they must be worn at least 20 hours a day to be effective. If you are worried about your child wearing them enough, you may want to opt for metal braces., Low laser therapy and corticotomy,as well as micro-osteoperforationhave all been shown to reduce treatment times in adults.


Low laser therapy involves directing short bursts of low-frequency light at the jaw in order to increase the production of osteoclasts, cells that demineralize bony block in the jaw, thereby speeding tooth movement. It also reduces pain.Corticotomy involves making small cuts to the bone around the tooth in order to greatly speed movement. It is often combined with alveolar grafting (grafting demineralized bone over the cuts) in a technique called Accelerated Osteogenic Orthodontics. It has been shown to reduce the time of treatment by up to one third.Micro osteoperforation is similar to corticotomy, accept that a tool is used to make much smaller perforations in the bone. This increases the production of osteoclasts, helping to demineralize hard bone and promote movement., Be wary of Acceledent – a much-promoted device, which creates micro-vibrations that are intended to speed tooth movement. It is very expensive, and recent clinical studies indicate that Acceledent does not shorten time in braces., The time required for braces to do their work varies from person to person, depending on the severity of the problem; the amount of space available on your jaw; the distance the teeth must travel; the health of your mouth; and how closely the patient follows instructions.That last bit is where you come in!

, Better dental hygiene can allow your teeth to move into the correct position more quickly., Cutting up foods like raw veggies, fruits, and crusty bread reduces pressure on your braces while eating and prevents them from being damaged., They can damage your braces and also cause tooth decay. Foods to avoid include:Popcorn
Nuts
Chips
Bubblegum
Toffee
Caramels
Cookies

, They can damage your teeth, which may mean more time in braces., Doing so can damage your braces or your teeth., It can damage your braces. Keep anything that isn’t food out of your mouth., Both activities can push your teeth out of line, increasing the amount of time you have to spend in braces., Research shows that orthodontics apps help people take better care of their teeth.Just look up “orthodontics app”.

, A recent study shows this might speed tooth movement and reduce time in braces."

Get ceramic, or ""clear,"" braces.,
Consider lingual braces.,
Wear clear aligners.",How to Hide Braces1," Although traditional braces are less bulky than they used to be, they continue to be made of metal that contrasts strongly against white teeth. Ask your orthodontic whether ceramic braces might be a feasible alternative for your orthodontic needs. Ceramic braces are made from a tooth-colored ceramic material. They are often referred to as ""clear"" braces because the ceramic provides such effective camouflage. Some ceramic braces even utilize tooth-colored wires to further minimize your braces' appearance.


Ceramic braces are not quite as strong as metal braces. This means your orthodontist will need to make more gradual adjustments and your treatment time may be lengthened.
Your orthodontist will attach wires to your ceramic brackets using clear or tooth-colored ligatures, or rubber bands. These may become slightly stained over time, reducing the ""invisible"" quality of your ceramic braces, but as they are changed each visit staining should not become a serious problem.
Ceramic braces are generally more expensive than traditional metal braces. To minimize the extra cost, consider requesting ceramic braces just in the areas of your mouth that are most visible when you smile -- your upper front teeth, for example.;
, Lingual braces, sometimes called hidden braces, are placed behind your teeth. Your orthodontist will take an impression of your teeth and then send it to a laboratory to have custom brackets manufactured. These brackets are then cemented to the back of your teeth. Lingual braces then function similarly to traditional braces, applying gentle, continuous pressure to correctly align your teeth.


Because they are completely custom-made, lingual braces are considerably more expensive than traditional braces.
Lingual braces sit along your tongue and palate, which means they can sometimes irritate these areas of your mouth. Applying wax can help eliminate this problem. Adjusting to the presence of something near your tongue can also produce a slight lisp in your speech. Over time, most wearers adjust to their lingual braces and can speak normally., Aligners, sometimes called ""invisible braces,"" are a series of clear, customized, removable appliances that are generally worn for about two weeks each, as close to 24 hours a day as possible. Each aligner incrementally shifts your teeth toward their ideal position.


Aligners, too, are more expensive than traditional braces.
Aligners are generally used only for minor corrections. Significant orthodontic work will likely require traditional braces.Consider whether you'll have sufficient self-discipline to wear your aligners properly. Aligners should only be removed to eat or to brush and floss your teeth."

Press a dampened tea bag against the cavity or sore gums and bite down gently.,
Try placing some ice cubes wrapped in a few paper towels against bleeding gums.,
Rinse the mouth 3x a day with warm salt water.

,
Try oil-pulling by swirling coconut around your mouth for up to 20 minutes.,
Placing a hot water bottle under your pillowcase is also a good way to relieve pain.

,Chewing clove or using clove oil can also numb tooth pain.,
Try crunched up paracetamol.,
See the dentist as soon as possible if the bleeding gets any worse or if the toothache lasts more than a couple of days and the pain does not seem to be improving.

",How to Relieve a Toothache and Bleeding Gums," Tea numbs an aching tooth, sores and bleeding gums.;
, This will cool and numb them, making you less able to feel them.,, Be sure to spit it into the trash afterwards as the oil can block drains and do not swallow it. Afterwards rinse your mouth with warm salt water. For pain relief try this technique with cannabis infused coconut oil.,,, You can also try dissolvable paracetamol swished around the mouth. Taking Ibuprofen or another anti-inflammatory may also help. Doctors may also give prescriptions for stronger pain killers such as codeine or tramadol, and for antibiotics.,"

Try using a floss threader.,
Thread a piece of floss into the eye of the threader.,
Use the floss as you normally would.",How to Floss With Braces2," Sick of painstakingly flossing with your bare hands? A helpful tool called a floss threader can make it easier to get the floss behind your braces. The threader looks similar to a small plastic needle, and it can be used to floss., It’s the same way you would thread a sewing needle. Insert the plastic needle under the archwire of your braces and pull the floss through., Now that it’s in position, grab the floss in your hands and floss down between the teeth. Pull the floss out and repeat with the same threader. The threader is useful for making it easier to get the floss into the correct position without scraping up your fingers.


Be careful when you apply the pressure to get in between your teeth — go gently with a back and forth movement.

Purchase a water flosser.,
Fill the reservoir with water.,
Use the water flosser.",How to Floss With Braces3," Many dentists and orthodontists today recommend a special tool called a water flosser (or ""oral irrigator"") to help with flossing. Water flossers are available online, in specialty stores, and even at dentist's office for about $50 and up (brands include WaterPik).

, There is an indicator line to show where the water should reach. Be sure to clean the reservoir regularly — you don’t want bacteria to breed.


Add also mouthwash to the water to increase the antibacterial protection and prevent gingivitis.

, This tool shoots a narrow stream of water which can be used to remove particles of food and clean between teeth, though dentists don't usually recommend them in place of flossing. They can be really helpful as a complement to flossing, flushing out some of the food that might be in particularly difficult-to-reach places. As an added benefit, water flossing can be used for gum stimulation, restoring proper health and function to gums that are inflamed or receded.

"
"
Use dental tape.,
Use a proxy brush.,
Use an orthodontic brush.",How to Floss With Braces4," If normal flossing hurts, a smooth and sometimes spongy dental tape might not. Dental tape is a special type of floss that's especially thin and wide — almost like a small ribbon. Dental tape is used in the same way as normal floss, but people who have painful teeth or gums often find it to be more comfortable., Proxy brushes are small, flexible, pointed brushes that have bristles that look similar to a pine tree. Their unique shape makes them perfect for cleaning behind braces — simply insert the brush under the wire and between the teeth, then scrub to clean. Proxy brushes aren't available everywhere, so talk to your dentist or orthodontist if you're interested in getting one.You can also use a bit of toothpaste on the proxy brush for a better cleaning.
Proxy brushes aren't intended to be used as a replacement for floss. They can't clean between the teeth as thoroughly as floss can. Instead, they're used along with floss to ensure that the area behind the braces receives enough cleaning.

, An orthodontic brush is a special type of toothbrush with V-shaped bristles. These special bristles help it clean behind braces and other orthodontic appliances, making them a big help when it comes to keeping your teeth clean.As with proxy brushes, orthodontic brushes are meant to be used with floss — not instead of it.

Have a Hepatitis C antibody test.,
Take an RNA test.,
Use genotype testing to look to test for Hepatitis C. These tests look at the actual genetic structure of Hepatitis C so that you can best understand exactly what type of the disease you have, which can affect the treatments you need to undergo.",How to Recognize Hepatitis C Symptoms2," This test screens for infection by testing for the presence of antibodies of the disease, indicating your body is trying to fight the virus. This test is useful because it can tell whether you have an active bout of the infection your body is dealing with, or whether you previously had the disease.There is recent evidence that a weak positive may set off a false positive of the test. So depending on the level of the antibodies, you may want to be retested.Most patient that contract hepatitis C develop antibodies two to six months after exposure to the virus.

, This is a test that looks at genetic material (RNA) of the virus. This is used to measure the viral load in your body. This is a very accurate test and is typically only done if the Hepatitis C antibody test is positive, unless acute infection or recent exposure is suspected.


Other types of viral load tests include: TMA (transcription mediated amplification), PCR (polymerase chain reaction), and bDNA (branched DNA), with the latter being the least sensitive., There are seven different genotypes of the Hepatitis C virus. The genotype is important because it will dictate the type and length of treatment, as well as the likelihood of a cure.

Recognize risky use of needles.,
Take note of other circumstances that may put you at risk for Hepatitis C. Although blood banks and hospitals take care to screen blood, this was not always the case.,
Avoid risky sexual behaviors.",How to Recognize Hepatitis C Symptoms3," Many of the symptoms of Hepatitis C can mimic other liver ailments; however, some may not appear at all. You can gain a better understanding of your risks by evaluating behaviors that may have increased the likelihood of you contracting the disease.


Actions that involve the transference and exchange of blood put you at risk to contract Hepatitis C, particularly if it's done carelessly. Sharing drugs or needles and being stuck with an infected needle are two particularly risky behaviors.
Using shared tattoo needles is a sometimes the cause of Hepatitis C infection, particularly in the prison population.
If you have a disease that requires the legitimate use of needles, always take the utmost care to use sanitized, new needles. Make sure to only use needles once and dispose of them properly. Never share needles, even for medication.

, Blood transfusions and organ transplants done before 1992 did not adhere to standards that screened Hepatitis C. If you received a transplant or blood transfusion before this date, you should get tested if symptoms appear.People with HIV can also have a greater chance of contracting Hepatitis C. Since their disease was likely contracted due to bodily fluid exchange — in some cases blood — the risk is higher.
Those who routinely receive long-term kidney dialysis are more susceptible than others.
Hepatitis C can be passed from women to their children during childbirth. If you are a woman and your child has symptoms of Hepatitis C, it may be a good idea for both of you to be checked. Similarly, if you later find out your mother had Hepatitis C you will want to get checked if the timeframe is possible.

, Hepatitis C can be contracted through unprotected sex with a carrier of the disease. Avoid having unprotected sex with multiple partners, particularly if you do not know whether they may carry the disease.

Use an oral gel.,
Take over-the-counter pain medicine.,
Get prescription medication.",How to Relieve Gum Pain2," Oral antiseptic gels may help relieve gum pain. Many of these gels contain a local anesthetic that can relieve the pain. You can also try baby teething gels, such as Orajel, or a gel that contains benzocaine.Use these gels sparingly and never use over the recommended dose.
Refrain from using benzocaine in young children without a doctor’s guidance.
These gels are not antimicrobial and won’t affect any infection.
Using an alcohol-free mouthwash may also soothe your gums.

, If you have gum pain, try over-the-counter pain medicine such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (like Advil).Follow your dentist's instructions with how often to take the pain medicine. If you are not under a dentist's care, read the directions of the medication carefully. Avoid taking more than the recommended dosage each day.
If you still feel pain after two to three days, contact your dentist.
Don't dissolve an aspirin or other pain reliever on the painful gum area.

, If you have serious gum problems, or an infection or abscessed tooth, your doctor may prescribe medication to help treat the pain along with the underlying condition.


Your doctor may prescribe oral antibiotics or prescription strength gels, which are a mixture of antibiotics, anti-inflammatory substances and also vitamins such as vitamin A. See your doctor to determine the best treatment.

Use ice cubes or ice packs.,
Make a mouth rinse.,
Massage your gums.,
Try a heat press.,
Remove irritants.,
Add essential oils to your gum massage.,
Try onion, garlic, or ginger.,
Make a spice paste.",How to Relieve Gum Pain3," If you are experiencing gum pain, try some ice therapy. You can place an ice cube or crushed ice on the gums as long as your teeth and gums aren’t sensitive to cold.Ice helps reduce inflammation and numbs the area to relieve pain.You can also crush some ice and place it into a balloon or the cut-off finger of a non-latex glove. Tie off one end and place the compress on the sore gums.
Cool foods can help relieve gum pain. The cold reduces swelling and can help numb the pain. Place slices of cool cucumber or raw potato on the gum to relieve the pain.You can also try to freeze slices of apples, bananas, mango, guava, grapes, or pineapple and place the slices on the sore gums.

, Making mouth rinses out of various products may help promote healing and help relieve gum pain. You can use these rinses three to four times a day.


Dissolve ½ teaspoon of sea salt in four ounces of warm water. Hold the solution in your mouth over the painful gum for 30 to 60 seconds. Spit it out and repeat two or three more times. Rinse with warm water.Make sure you do not swallow the saltwater.
A solution made with hydrogen peroxide may help swollen and sore gums. Mix equal parts of water and a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution. Swish in the mouth for 15 to 30 seconds.Do not swallow this solution.
Rinse your gums with apple cider vinegar. Mix ¼ cup of warm water and apple cider vinegar. Hold the rinse in your mouth over the painful gum for 30 to 60 seconds. Spit it out and repeat two to three more times. Rinse with warm water.You can also soak a cotton ball in apple cider vinegar and leave it on your sore gum for 10 minutes. Do not swallow the water-vinegar rinse.
Sage is a folk remedy used to treat inflammation. Boiling it into a tea and swishing it around your mouth may help reduce pain and inflammation of your gums.To make sage tea, start with a handful of fresh and washed sage leaves or one heaping teaspoon of dried sage. Add the sage to eight ounces of boiling water. Let the water cool. Allow the liquid to set around the painful gum for 20 to 30 seconds every time you gargle.
Other herbal remedies include wormwood, chamomile, and aloe. Speak with your doctor before using any natural treatments, as they can have negative interactions with other medications you may be taking or certain conditions.

, Massaging your gums may provide some relief. To massage your gums, use a clean finger and gently make a circular motion on top of the sore gum and as much at the sides as you can. Rub clockwise for 15 rotations, then counter-clockwise for an additional 15 rotations. Do not massage vigorously or press too hard.Repeat the massage at least three to four times daily.
Massaging your gums can help with sore gums from wisdom teeth. A gum massage can help erupting wisdom teeth ease through the gums while helping to relieve some of the pain.

, Heat packs rarely work for gum pain, but sometimes they do work for some people. If you find that heat may be helpful, you can make a heat press and apply it to your sore gums three to four times a day.Try using a small piece of cloth soaked with warm water. You can also soak the cloth in one of the teas listed for relief.
You can also use a warm tea bag. Soak an anti-inflammatory herbal tea bag in warm water. Place the tea bag over the gums and let it stay there for about five minutes. Repeat two to three times a day.Try using clove tea, goldenseal tea, echinacea tea, sage tea, and green or black tea., Sometimes, gum pain is caused by food pieces trapped between your teeth. To help relieve gum pain from trapped food pieces, use a piece of floss to clean near the gum and remove the trapped particle., There are a number of different oils that can provide relief for gum pain. Most of the oils listed are both anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial oils, so they can reduce swelling, inflammation, and help prevent infection. You can massage your gums up to four or five times a day with essential oils to help relieve pain and swelling. Clove oil has been found to be the most effective essential oil in relieving gum pain. You can rub it directly onto your gum.There are other essential oils that are helpful for gum pain. Try massaging your gums with the addition of a few drops of the following oils:Warm olive oil
Warm vanilla extract
Tea tree oil
Clove oil
Peppermint oil
Cinnamon oil
Sage oil
Goldenseal oil
Coconut Oil

, Garlic, ginger, and onions are anti-inflammatory agents that help reduce gum inflammation.These foods also are known to relieve pain. Using them on sore gums or making them into a paste can help reduce pain.


Cut a piece of onion or garlic and place it directly onto the tooth above the painful gums. Gently bite to release the juice. Afterwards, you may want to try a mint or two or brush your teeth.Cut a slice of fresh ginger and place it on the painful gums. You can gently bite down on the ginger as well. Be aware that the taste may be strong and spicy.

, Turmeric and asafetida are used as cooking spices in Indian foods; however, turmeric is known for its medicinal properties, such as being antimicrobial and an anti-inflammatory.It comes as a powdered resin or as a lump of resin and can be found in Indian stores and markets.


Mix one teaspoon of turmeric with ½ teaspoon of salt and ½ teaspoon of mustard oil. Rub this paste onto your gums twice a day to help with gum pain.
Take ¼ teaspoon of the powder and mix it with enough fresh lemon juice to make a paste. Apply the paste directly onto the sore gums. Leave the paste on for around five minutes. Repeat two to three times daily. Notice if your teeth develop a stain or discoloration that does not go away after brushing — you will want to stop using the paste if this occurs.
It has a bitter taste and an unpleasant odor that is masked somewhat by the lemon juice. However, you may find it useful to rinse well after using the paste.

Brush your teeth.,
Floss daily.,
Rinse your mouth.,
See your dentist regularly.,
Avoid using tobacco products.,
Get enough vitamin C and calcium.",How to Relieve Gum Pain4," Make sure to brush your teeth at least twice a day. Use a soft toothbrush. Teeth and gums can be damaged by brushing too hard or using toothbrushes with hard bristles. When brushing, use a soft, gentle back and forth stroke.In addition, using an old toothbrush can also harm your teeth. The bristles of new toothbrushes are rounded; after a few months those tips become sharp and can do more harm than good.
Also make sure that you brush your tongue.
Leave the toothpaste in your mouth without rinsing. Spit out the extra foam, but don’t rinse your mouth out with water. You want to give the minerals some time to be absorbed onto your teeth.

, Take time to floss daily. Start by pulling off about 18 inches of floss. Wind most of the floss around the middle finger of one hand and the rest around the middle finger of the other hand. Hold on to the floss firmly between your thumb and your forefinger.Gently guide the floss between all your teeth using a gentle back and forth motion. Curve the floss around the bottom of each tooth.
Once the floss is between the teeth, use a gentle up-and-down motion to rub each side of each tooth.
When you are done with one tooth, unwind more floss and move on to the next tooth.
Pay special attention to the wisdom teeth once they have erupted.

, After eating, you should consider some kind of mouth rinse. Rinsing your mouth helps to remove food and other particles. These particles can cause plaque, tooth decay, tartar, and lead to gum disease. Take a moment after eating to rinse your mouth.You can rinse with water, a mouthwash, or a homemade rinse made with things like hydrogen peroxide.

, Make sure you see a dentist regularly. Your dentist can give your teeth a professional cleaning one to two times a year. Most insurance will cover routine cleanings.


Not only does this help keep your teeth clean, but it can help your dentist spot any tooth or gum problems before they get too bad.

, The use of tobacco products increases the risk of gum disease. This includes cigarettes, cigars, and chewing tobacco. You should avoid all forms of tobacco. If you currently smoke, you should stop smoking to lower your risk of gum disease.Smoking also stains your teeth and causes bad breath., Make certain you are getting enough Vitamin C and calcium. A vitamin C deficiency can cause swollen, bleeding gums and even loosening or loss of teeth.Good food sources of Vitamin C include citrus fruits and juices, such as oranges and grapefruits, kiwi, bell peppers, papaya, strawberries, broccoli, and cantaloupe.
Good food sources of calcium are dairy products like milk, cheese, yogurt, and ice cream, sardines, calcium fortified soy milk, soy products, and leafy green vegetables.

Refrain from eating certain foods in public.,
Smile with your mouth closed.,
Change your hairstyle.,
Wear vibrant eye shadow.,
Wear matte-finish lip products.",How to Hide Braces2," Avoid overly chewy foods such as bagels or licorice. They can get stuck in your teeth, drawing attention to your mouth and causing embarrassment. Also avoid anything that is overly sticky. These foods get stuck in your teeth, which will draw attention to them. They can also cause damage to the wires and brackets of your braces.

, If you are feeling insecure about the way your teeth look in braces, teach yourself how to smile naturally with closed lips. Doing so will hide your braces from view.


Note that if smiling with your mouth closed is not a natural behavior for you, your smile may look awkward or forced. Trying too hard to hide your braces may have the opposite effect of drawing attention toward your mouth.
Practice in a mirror and determine how you look most natural and confident. A confident smile draws attention toward your personality and away from your braces, regardless of whether they're visible.

, This trick will pull attention away from your mouth and cause people to focus on other parts of your face. Try a new haircut. Cut it shorter, or switch to bangs or layers. Try a new hair color -- even a crazy one like pink, blue, or purple. If you want something less drastic, simply try out a different hairstyle, like curling your hair or wearing it in an intricate braid. If you're a guy, try experimenting with a new styling product. The attention will be on your new look and not on your braces.


Try adding hair accessories such as hats, headbands, or bows. They will call attention away from your mouth and add nice flare to your outfit.
A fresh hairstyle may also boost your self esteem, which can be helpful if you're feeling concerned about your braces.

, A fun new color such as blue, teal, or purple may draw the attention away from your mouth and toward your eyes. You can also try a smoky eye, which will highlight the intensity of your eyes. If you don't wear makeup, try wearing bright glasses or sunglasses. These also draw attention to your eyes.

, Lip gloss has a shiny, reflective quality. This will cause the metal in your braces to reflect and shine off your lips. Try a light, matte lipstick instead, one that closely matches the color of your lips. You can also forgo lipstick all together. This way, your lips will look natural and normal, keeping people's attention elsewhere on your face.Avoid bright lipstick colors such as red. These draw more attention to your mouth, which will serve to highlight your braces instead of hiding them.

Remind yourself of the benefits of braces.,
Decorate your braces.,
Use your experiences to develop your compassion toward others.",How to Hide Braces3," Braces are a comparatively short-term problem with long-term benefits. Adopting a proper perspective will help you cope with your current feelings of discomfort or embarrassment.


Visualize yourself once your braces are off, smiling with a beautiful set of teeth.
Perform a quick Web search for images of celebrities wearing braces. The list of notable figures who have worn braces is nearly endless, including Prince Harry, actress Emma Watson, and footballer  Cristiano Ronaldo.
Remember that milkshakes are only a reasonable dinner option during one stage in your life -- the years you are wearing braces!, The wires of most traditional braces are held to their brackets with bands manufactured in a wide range of colors.Adopting seasonal colors, school colors, or other festive combinations converts your braces into a fashion statement. If you're already decked out in blue and red for Homecoming, matching teeth become just one more component of your outfit.

, Feeling awkward or uncomfortable about your braces can serve as a good reminder of how important it is to look past external appearances. Your braces are a temporary inconvenience with lasting benefits. Some people cope with permanently looking ""different"" due to a birth defect, a disability, or other external qualities they cannot control. Become an advocate and you'll help both yourself and others.

For instance, make your appointment on a Thursday or Friday so that you can recover over the weekend.If you are a woman, and you are on birth control, schedule the surgery after you menstruate to help prevent dry sockets from developing.









Your menstrual cycle can affect your likelihood of postoperative nausea and vomiting.Women who take oral contraceptive pills are more likely to have postoperative nausea and vomiting on days 9-15 of their cycle.;
, Buy soft, easy-to-eat foods like applesauce, chicken soup, yogurt, canned fruit, gelatin, pudding or cottage cheese.You'll need to skip foods that require chewing or foods that are served either extremely hot or extremely cold for a while after your surgery.








Also remember that you should not drink alcohol, soda, coffee, or hot beverages the first few days after surgery., You may be in a lot of pain, so you want to make sure you have a lot of resources around to keep your mind off of your discomfort. You'll need to take it easy for a few days.







, You'll be groggy after the operation, and you'll need someone to drive you home and help you pick up your painkillers at the drugstore.







, Do not attempt to change the gauze as it will disrupt the clotting process. Once the first gauze pad has been taken off, keep the area clean and leave it alone. Do not attempt to spit blood out frequently as the pressure change in your mouth will inhibit clotting. Instead, use fresh gauze to absorb the blood.








, If your wounds are still bleeding at a steady pace after 12 hours or so, stop biting gauze and start biting moist tea bags. The tannins within tea leaves promote clotting, and for some people, the caffeine increases circulation. This process encourages the build-up of clotting platelets within the stitched area, which speeds up healing and recovery time.







, Combine 1 teaspoon of sea salt with 8 ounces of warm water. Take the liquid into your mouth, gently let it soak for a moment then let drizzle out into your sink or toilet. Do not gurgle or spit as this may dislodge the blood clot in the wound. The salt water will promote healing and decrease irritation.








Be sure to rinse extra-gently on the first day after surgery.
Use only the salt water rinse to clean your mouth for the first 24 hours after surgery. Wait until your doctor recommends to start using a toothbrush again (usually safe by the second day)., Ice may be applied to your cheeks to help prevent swelling for the first 24 hours.








After 24 to 72 hours, ice may continue to help ease the pain, but will be useless in prevention of swelling.If you don't have tools for an ice pack, use a bag of frozen vegetables.
When enough time has passed, according to the guidelines given to you by your dental surgeon, apply a heating pad to your cheeks. Your body's natural response will cause additional swelling if the ice pack is reapplied.

, Whether you're sleeping on your couch or on your bed, place 2 or more pillows beneath your head to elevate your mouth. Elevation will decrease swelling.







, You'll need your water, gauze, painkillers and antibiotics close to you so that you don't have to get up and go to the bathroom to get the things you need.







, The vacuum created within your mouth can dislodge your clots and slow down the healing process.







, Both of these activities can inhibit the healing process. You should wait at least 72 hours after surgery to use tobacco products (but longer is better).







, You can take prescribed painkillers, or you can take over-the-counter ibuprofen to prevent pain, inflammation and swelling. Skip the aspirin because it could make you bleed and slow your healing.








Make sure to take painkillers as soon as you leave the dental clinic. Take them with a small meal to prevent nausea and vomiting. You may still be numb from the anesthetic, and you may think that you don't need painkillers. However, when the anesthetic wears off, you may find yourself experiencing a high degree of discomfort.
Avoid driving or operating heavy machinery for at least 24 hours. The anesthetic along with your pain medication can make these activities hazardous.
Talk to your doctor if you experience severe nausea and vomiting. Your doctor may be able to prescribe a different pain medication that doesn't make you sick., Count on your spouse, your friends or your family to take care of you while you're recovering. Have them take your phone calls, help you with chores, bring you food and keep you comfortable while you heal.

Brush and floss your teeth.,
Suck on ice chips.,
Use teething gel to numb the area.,
Grip the tooth with sterile gauze.,
Wait to rinse out your mouth for 24 hours.,
Apply pressure to your gums until the bleeding stops.,
Place a wet teabag over your tooth socket.,
Take an over-the counter pain reliever.,
See a dentist if the tooth won’t come out.",How to Pull Out a Tooth Without Pain," The looser your tooth is when you try to pull it out, the less pain you will feel. You can use your tongue and fingers to loosen your tooth with a gentle wiggling motion. Just make sure that you do not pull or push your tooth too hard as you wiggle it or it may hurt.


Use a gentle wiggling motion throughout the day to help loosen the tooth and make it ready to come out.;
, You can also eat crunchy foods to help loosen the tooth and help it to come out without any pain. Chew on apples, carrots, celery, or other crunchy foods to help loosen up your tooth a bit more.


You may want to start with something that is not too crunchy to make sure that this does not cause you any pain. Try chewing on a peach or a piece of cheese to start and then move on to something a bit crunchier.
Try not to swallow the tooth. If you feel like the tooth has come loose as you are chewing on something, then spit the food into a napkin to check for the tooth.
If you accidentally swallow a tooth, then call your doctor or dentist. There is probably no cause to worry if a child swallows a baby tooth, but you may want to ask your dentist just to be sure., Regular brushing and flossing may also help to loosen your tooth and make it easier to pull out. Just try not to brush or floss too hard or it may be painful. Make sure that you brush and floss as usual (twice per day) to help loosen the tooth and keep your other teeth healthy as well.To floss your teeth, use about 18 inches of floss and wind most of it around the middle finger of one hand and the rest around the middle finger of the other hand. Hold the floss between your thumb and your forefinger.
Then, guide the floss between the loose tooth and its neighbor teeth with a back and forth motion. Try to curve the floss around the bottom of the loose tooth as you do so.
You can also use an up-and-down motion to rub each side of each tooth.For a better grip, use a flossing pick, which can be found in supermarkets.

, Ice can help to numb the gums attached to your tooth and help to prevent pain from pulling a tooth as well. You can also suck on ice chips after pulling out a tooth to help numb the pain.Suck on some ice chips right before you try to pull your tooth out. This should numb the area and help make pulling out the tooth pain-free.
Try sucking on some ice chips throughout the day to help relieve the pain after you have pulled out a tooth.
Do this 3-4 times per day for 10 minutes.
Make sure that you give yourself a break after sucking on ice chips for a while. Otherwise, the ice may damage your gum tissue.

, You can also numb the tooth socket with a topical anesthetic gel that contains benzocaine. This may be helpful if wiggling the tooth still causes pain.Apply a bit of teething gel to your gums before you pull the tooth to help numb the area.


Make sure that you read and follow the manufacturer’s instructions for use.
Some examples of teething gels are Orajel, Hyland’s, and Earth’s Best.

, If you think that the tooth is loose enough to come out without pain, then use a piece of sterile gauze to grip the tooth and twist it.When the tooth is ready to come out, it should be easy to twist and pull it out pain-free.


If pulling on the tooth hurts or if the tooth does not seem to budge when you apply light pressure, then continue to try to loosen the tooth a bit more. Otherwise, pulling the tooth may be quite painful.
Do back-and-forth and left-to-right movements, and twist it while pulling the tooth out. This will remove the existing tissue surrounding the tooth that keeps the gum attached.

, After you pull a tooth, a blood clot will form in the tooth socket. It is important for this clot to remain in place, so that the area will heal properly. Do not rinse your mouth out, drink from a straw, or do anything else that involves suction or vigorous rinsing.


Do not brush or floss the tooth socket or the area around it. You should still brush and floss your other teeth, but leave the tooth socket alone.
You can rinse gently after brushing and flossing, but make sure that you avoid vigorous swishing.
Avoid extreme temperatures. Eat room-temperature, soft food for the first two days after you pull out your tooth.

, Applying pressure to your gums with sterile gauze after pulling out a tooth can reduce pain and stop any bleeding that occurs. If your gums hurt or bleed a little after you pull out a tooth, then roll up a new piece of gauze and apply it to the tooth socket (gum area where the tooth was rooted).


Apply pressure to the gums until the bleeding stops.The bleeding should stop within a few minutes.

, You can also use a wet teabag to soothe your gums after pulling out a tooth. Steep a teabag in hot water for a few minutes and then take it out and squeeze out some of the excess water. Then, let the teabag cool for a few minutes and apply it to your tooth socket to combat any pain that you feel.You can use green, black, peppermint, or chamomile tea to soothe your tooth.

, If the pain is still bothering you, then you can take a pain reliever such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen.Make sure that you read and follow the manufacturer’s instructions for use.

, If the loose tooth is causing you pain or if you just can’t seem to get it out, then call your dentist for an appointment.Your dentist can pull the tooth with the help of an anesthetic so that you will not feel any pain.


In some cases, teeth may have a cyst or granuloma, which basically an infection, at the end of the root. Your dentist is the only person that can clean the socket and remove the infection, so you should consult them if you think this might be the case.

Let nature take its course.,
Monitor the tooth as it gets looser.,
Advise your child to wiggle the tooth with their tongue.,
See a dentist if the new tooth grows in an unexpected location.,
Note that there should not be much blood.,
See a dentist if the tooth is still loose but not extracted after 2 to 3 months.,
Hold gauze over the extraction site.",How to Pull Out a Tooth1," Most doctors and dentists recommend that parents not try to do anything to speed up the natural process.Teeth that are extracted too early provide less of a guide to the teeth that grow in their place, and pulling to early can also have a negative impact on the correct order of eruption, which may also influence bite and mastication (chewing). Any child will tell you that this, too, is an unnecessarily painful option.;
, Make sure that the tooth and the surrounding gum area looks healthy and is free of decay and infection. If the tooth becomes decayed, it may need to be surgically removed in a dental office.

, Not all parents choose to give their child permission to wiggle the tooth, but those who do might want to instruct their child to wiggle only with the tongue. This is for two reasons:


Wiggling with the hands can introduce bacteria and dirt into the mouth, clearing the way for infection. Children aren't exactly the cleanest creatures in the world, making this a recipe for poor dental health in addition to bad hygiene.
The tongue is generally gentler than the hand. Children run a higher risk of accidentally pulling a tooth out before it's ready when they use their fingers to pull out the tooth. Wiggling the tooth with their tongues lowers the risk because the tongue can't grip onto the tooth in the same way that two fingers can. This way, your child will get used to the idea of a tooth coming out, and the image of a tooth pulled out with their tongue makes them less scared of blood or pain.

, Permanent teeth coming in behind baby teeth, sometimes known as ""sharking"" because of the two sets of teeth, is a reversible and common condition. As long as the dentist removes the baby tooth and gives it enough room to move into its intended position in the mouth, it shouldn't be an issue.

, If the child lets the tooth come out on its own, expect to see very little blood. Children who have waited the proper amount of time for their old tooth to fall out (sometimes as much as 2 to 3 months), there should be very little blood.


If any wiggling or pulling of teeth causes excessive amounts of blood, instruct the child to stop wiggling; the tooth is most likely not yet ready to be extracted, and shouldn't be aggravated further resulting in inflammation and pain, which can also influence the development of the permanent tooth underneath.

, A dentist will be able to administer a topical painkiller and extract the tooth with the appropriate instruments.

, When the tooth comes out on its own, hold a piece of gauze over the extraction site. Tell the child to bite down lightly on the gauze. A new blood clot should start forming in the extraction site.


If the socket has lost its clot, an infection could occur. However, this is rare. This condition is called dry socket (alveolar osteitis), and is often accompanied by a foul-smelling odor.Contact your dentist if you believe the clot hasn't set appropriately.

Understand what causes teeth grinding.,
Treat your teeth.,
Treat the underlying cause of bruxism.,
Make lifestyle changes.",How to Reduce Jaw Pain1," Though teeth grinding (also known as bruxism) does not necessarily have one single cause, doctors have identified several factors that can lead to teeth grinding during the day or at night, including:


Ear painIncoming teeth in childrenUnpleasant emotions (stress, frustration, anger, anxiety)Certain personality types (hyper-competitive, hyper-aggressive)A compulsive habit, often used to focus or cope with stressful situationsMisaligned upper and lower teeth (called a malocclusion)Sleep-related complications, including sleep apneaComplications caused by certain degenerative disorders, including Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease;
, If chronic teeth grinding is causing you severe jaw pain, you may want to consult your dentist on strategies you can take to prevent grinding, or at least reduce the side effects caused by bruxism.Use a mouth guard. This is especially useful if you experience bruxism at night. Wearing a mouth guard designed to prevent bruxism can help keep your upper and lower teeth separated and reduce the pain and damage caused by grinding.Correct your tooth alignment. In extreme cases of bruxism, your doctor may recommend wearing braces to realign your upper and lower rows of teeth, or having oral surgery to reshape the contours of your teeth.Have regular dental exams. Allowing your dentist to monitor and treat your teeth-grinding habits can help reduce the frequency of bruxism and reduce jaw pain., If extreme emotions or behavioral complications are causing the bruxism that has lead to severe jaw pain, you may want to consider ways of treating the emotional or behavioral causes.


Try stress-management exercises like meditation or rigorous exercise.Try therapy to address issues like anxiety, anger, or stress.
In extreme cases, medication may be recommended. Medication is not the preferred treatment for bruxism, but certain prescriptions, such as muscle relaxers, may help ease the tension and treat the pain., If the bruxism causing your jaw pain is related to stress or anxiety, making lifestyle changes could help reduce the incidence of teeth grinding and help prevent pain in the future.Try to manage stress. Find what calms you down, whether it's listening to relaxing music, having a vigorous workout, or a calming soak in the tub. Practice your stress-relieving activity every day, especially before bed.Avoid caffeine and other stimulants. Try drinking decaffeinated coffee or tea, or for best results, drink a relaxing herbal tea in the evening. Avoid tobacco and alcohol in the evening to promote a more restful night's sleep with lower incidences of bruxism."

Try to figure out why your tooth needs pulling.,
Schedule an appointment with your doctor.,
Allow the dentist administer local anesthetic to numb the area of the tooth.,
Allow the dentist to extract the tooth.,
Watch for a blood clot to form over the extraction site.,
Take care of the extraction site.",How to Pull Out a Tooth2," Adult teeth are meant to last your lifetime if you take care of them. But if you do need to remove a tooth, it could be for a variety of reasons:


Crowded mouth. Your existing teeth haven't left enough room for your tooth that's trying to move into its proper place. A dentist may be forced to remove the tooth if this is the case.
Extracting a tooth may also be necessary to make enough room for teeth to align before applying orthodontic braces.
Tooth decay or infection. If infection of the tooth extends all the way down to the pulp, a dentist may need to administer antibiotics or even try a root canal. If a root canal does not fix the problem nor the apical resection, a dentist may need to extract the tooth.
Compromised immune system. If you are undergoing an organ transplant, chemotherapy, or heart surgery, even the threat of infection might motivate a doctor to extract a tooth.Periodontal disease. This disease is caused an infection of the tissues and bones that surround and support the teeth. If periodontal disease has infiltrated the tooth, a dentist may need to take it out.

, Do not try to extract the tooth on your own. It's far safer to let a professional dentist extract the tooth than try to be macho and do it on your own. In addition to being safer, it will also be much less painful.

, Your dentist will need to give you a shot of Novocain before extracting the tooth. This is to ensure that the area is numb and you will not feel the extraction.

, The dentist may need to remove part of the gum in order to get at the tooth. In severe cases, the dentist may also need to remove the tooth itself in pieces., A blood clot is a sign that your tooth and surrounding gum areas are healing. Hold a piece of gauze over the extraction site and bite down firmly on the gauze, not too hard but not too lightly either. This will help to stop the bleeding. A new blood clot should start forming in the extraction site.


If the socket has lost its clot, an infection could occur. This condition is called dry socket (alveolar osteitis), and is often accompanied by a foul-smelling odor.Contact your dentist if you believe the clot hasn't set appropriately.
If you want to reduce the swelling, place an icepack wrapped in a towel on the outside of the jaw near to where the tooth was removed. This should reduce the swelling and numb the pain.

, In the days following the extraction, take care to let your clot heal. To do this, try to:


Avoid spitting or rinsing forcefully. Try to avoid drinking from a straw with the first 24 hours.
After 24 hours, gargle lightly with a saltwater solution made of 1/2 teaspoon salt and 8 ounces of warm water.
Do not smoke or drink alcohol.
Eat soft foods and liquids for the first few days. Avoid hard, solid foods that take a lot of chewing to break down.
Floss and brush your teeth as usual, taking care not to floss and brush the extraction site.

Use a bit of gauze and lightly wiggle the tooth back and forth.,
Have the person bite down on an apple.,
Use floss to pull out the tooth.",How to Pull Out a Tooth3," Give the person a bit of gauze and tell them to hold the gauze over the tooth.


Gently wiggle the tooth back and forth, from side to side. The key word here is ""gentle,"" but you also need to increase the movements a little bit as you wiggle the tooth.
If lots of blood comes out, consider stopping the procedure. Lots of blood is usually a sign that the tooth isn't yet ready to come out.
Firmly but slowly lift the tooth up until the ligaments connecting the tooth to the gum are severed. If too much pain or blood exists, consider stopping the procedure.

, Biting down on an apple can be a good way to pull a tooth, especially for children. Biting down on an apple is more effective for teeth in the front than it is for teeth in the back.

, If the tooth is really loose and the apple method does not work, make a knot around the tooth using a 30 centimeter (11.8 in) long piece of dental floss. Then, pull on the floss quickly to remove the tooth with one stroke.

Understand what causes a tooth abscess.,
Treating the abscess.,
Manage the pain.",How to Reduce Jaw Pain2," An abscess is a bacterial infection at the nerve site, which is usually caused by a cavity that has gone without treatment for a prolonged period of time.Symptoms include:


Prolonged throbbing pain in the toothSensitivity to temperature fluctuations, such as hot or cold food or beveragesPain during chewing, eating, or drinkingSwelling of the face on the side of the abscessSwollen or inflamed lymph nodes around the jaw, If you believe you have a tooth abscess, it is imperative that you see a dentist immediately. Depending on how severe your abscess is, your dentist may recommend a number of options to treat the abscess and prevent the infection from spreading. All of these procedures should only be performed by a licensed, experienced dentist.


Draining the abscess may be possible. Your dentist may be able to drain the pus out at the site of the infection, using sterilized tools in a controlled medical setting. Again, do not attempt to perform any of these procedures at home.Having a root canal might be the best option. A root canal involves surgically removing the diseased tissue in your gums and draining the abscess. This allows your dentist to treat the infection while still managing to save your tooth.Your dentist may recommend extracting the infected tooth. This is usually done if the infection has rendered the tooth unsalvageable. After extracting the tooth, your dentist will then drain the abscess to treat the infection.Antibiotics may be prescribed to prevent the infection from spreading to other teeth or to your jaw. These may be prescribed in conjunction with other treatments.It's important to practice good dental hygiene to prevent future abscesses. This includes flossing every day, brushing your teeth twice daily, limiting sugary snacks, and going in for regular dental checkups., After seeing your dentist to treat the infection, there are a number of things you can do at home to help manage the pain associated with an abscessed tooth.


Mix one teaspoon of salt into an eight-ounce glass of warm water. Use this rinse after every meal and before bed to help reduce inflammation and prevent infection.Use pain relievers. Over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen and ibuprofen can be taken to reduce inflammation and manage pain.Take only the recommended dosage listed on the label, as taking too much of a pain reliever may cause liver damage and other health problems.Use a cold compress. Apply a cold compress wrapped in cloth to the affected side of your face for 20 minutes on, 20 minutes off, to manage the pain and inflammation in the jaw and mouth. Do not use a hot compress with an abscessed tooth, as heat may allow the infection to spread."

Treat osteoarthritic TMJ pain.,
Treat rheumatoid arthritis TMJ pain.,
Use medication for all forms of TMJ arthritis.",How to Reduce Jaw Pain3," Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) problems may be caused by traumatic arthritis, osteoarthritis, or rheumatoid arthritis.Osteoarthritis is most common in adults over 50 years of age. All forms of TMJ arthritis cause stiffness, pain, grating, swelling, and limited range of motion., Before you treat for TMJ arthritis, it's important to have confirmation that the problem is, in fact, arthritis. In most cases, an X-ray or cat scan can confirm TMJ arthritis based on the observed flattening and lipping of the condyle, the rounded prominence at the end of a bone.The exception to this is traumatic arthritis, which does not typically show up on an X-ray unless a pooling of fluids or a hemorrhage causes a widening of the joint, which would then be visible in an X-ray.The diagnosis of headache, such as cluster headache, migraine, temporal arteritis, and stroke, must be ruled out before a TMJ diagnosis, especially if you are having headache symptoms.

, Though arthritis cannot be cured, there are a number of treatments that can be administered to reduce jaw pain associated with arthritis.


Many doctors recommend non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to treat the symptoms of traumatic TMJ arthritis.Try sticking to a soft food diet to avoid unnecessary jaw movement. Use a warm compress. Apply the compress for 20 minutes, then remove the compress and exercising the jaw by moving it open and shut, then side to side. Try repeating this treatment three to five times daily, as needed.Try wearing a bite guard. This may give some patients relief from pain or discomfort., Though this type of arthritis can be painful, especially if the jaws have begun to move closer together, there are steps that can be taken to manage the pain and treat the symptoms.


Wear a mouth guard or bite plate. These can be worn during the day or overnight to help reduce pain and grating in patients with osteoarthritic TMJ pain.Try applying a warm compress for 20 minutes, then exercising the jaw. Move the jaw open and closed, then move the lower jaw from side to side.Stick to soft foods. Avoid anything hard or crunchy.Try an over-the-counter pain reliever, like acetaminophen or ibuprofen, to reduce pain and inflammation during particularly painful periods., The treatment for rheumatoid TMJ pain is similar to rheumatoid pain in other joints. Typical treatments may include:


Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugsJaw exercises to maintain range of motion when pain is at a minimumA cold compress may be applied to reduce pain and inflammation. Apply the cold compress to the affected side of the jaw for 20 minutes on, followed by 20 minutes off.In severe cases, some doctors may recommend surgery to prevent rheumatoid arthritis from limiting jaw function.Surgery is usually considered a last option when all other alternatives have been exhausted, due to the risk of complications associated with surgery.

, Pain relievers may be used to reduce pain and inflammation in all forms of TMJ arthritis. Consult with your doctor on a medication plan that works best for your symptoms.


Pain relievers, both over-the-counter and prescription-strength, can help manage the pain associated with TMJ arthritis.Muscle relaxants may be prescribed by your doctor for short periods of time (a few days to several weeks in length) to help manage pain and make movement easier.Sedatives may be recommended by your doctor to help you sleep at night, if TMJ pain is keeping you awake.Your doctor may recommend supervised cortisone injections to treat pain and inflammation."

These can include nuts, hard candy, hard baked goods, and larger fruits or vegetables like whole apples or uncut, raw carrots. You should also avoid chewing gum and other stretchy candy, such as taffy.

, If you sleep on your side and you're experiencing jaw pain, you may want to try sleeping on your back at night to remove pressure from your jaw. You may also want to invest in a mouth guard to keep from grinding your teeth at night, as this may contribute to jaw pain without your realizing that it is happening., Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help treat inflammation and other symptoms of jaw pain.

, Gels or mouth swabs containing Benzocaine or similar active ingredients can be found at most drug stores and provide topical pain relief to teeth and jaws., Move your jaw open and closed, then work the jaw from side to side. Gradually increase the frequency of these exercises., First try using a hot compress, but if heat does not alleviate pain or inflammation, try a cold compress.


Run a towel or wash cloth under warm-to-hot tap water. Wring out excess water.
Once the towel is at a comfortable temperature that will not burn the skin, apply it to the affected area of your jaw. Hold the hot compress on for about five to ten minutes, and repeat several times each day.
If a hot compress does not work, use a cold compress or an ice pack. Ice packs should be used for about 20 minutes on, then 20 minutes off.Make sure you wrap the cold compress in a t-shirt or other thin fabric so the cold doesn't damage your skin.
You may also want to try alternating hot and cold compresses to maximize the benefits of each. Use a hot compress for five minutes, then a cold compress for five minutes.

Care for the gums.",How to Pull out a Loose Tooth1," Before anyone tries to pull a baby tooth out, it should be moving quite a bit. That is, your child should be able to move it back and forth and side to side without much pain. Lots of movement means the tooth is about ready to come out.As noted, it's always best to let the baby tooth fall out on its own if possible.;
, Wiggling it is a great way to start getting that tooth out. Have your child wiggle it around with their tongue. They can do this movement throughout the day until the tooth falls out. Tell your child to only wiggle it as much as they can without discomfort., To speed up the loosening process, offer carrots, apples, or other crunchy foods to help loosen the tooth gradually. It might even come out on its own with the child barely noticing.
, The best way to pull out a kid's tooth is to grasp it with tissue or gauze. Try to pull the tooth out with a gentle tug. If the tooth is especially resistant or the child cries out, it's best to wait a few days. However, the tooth will often come right out.Some kids won't like you touching their teeth at all, and in that case, it's best to leave it alone. You can also let the child try to pull it out themselves.

, If the tooth is growing erratically or takes more than two to three months to come out, it's a good idea to see the dentist. Ask whether or not the tooth should be removed or left to fall out on its own.After consulting the dentist, be sure to follow their advice exactly.

, If the area is bloody after the tooth falls out, hold a cotton ball gently to the gum. You can also have the child bite on it. You may need to hold it on as long as 30 minutes, as gums take longer to clot than other parts of the body."

Your jaw also might be too small for your tooth to come in. Wisdom teeth are the most likely impacted teeth culprits and typically come in when one is 17-21 years old., An impacted tooth can cause myriad effects on your oral and overall health. If you start noticing symptoms, write them down and when they started. Bring the list to your dentist appointment. Particularly, watch out for:


Newly crooked teeth
Bad breath
Gum pain
Jawbone pain, which can radiate up to your front teeth
Red or swollen gums especially around impacted tooth area
Bad taste when biting
Hole where impacted tooth should be
Trouble opening your mouth (less common)
Swollen lymph nodes in your neck (less common)Cysts inside your mouthIncreased salivation

, If you have several of the above symptoms, visit your dentist. After asking about your symptoms, she will check your teeth.Then, she will look for swelling in your gums. Then, she will give you an x-ray to see whether your tooth is impacted.After checking the results, she can prescribe treatment.

, If your tooth is causing you pain, painkillers available from drugstores can help relieve your pain.NSAIDs like Ibuprofen or Naproxen Sodium good options because they reduce inflammation and relieve pain. Talk to your dentist about which option is right for you and how much medication you should take.

, Do not eat or drink very hot colds or foods or beverages. This can exacerbate your pain. Also avoid eating food that requires a lot of chewing (e.g. tortilla chips, broccoli). Chewing can be very painful. It can also irritate your teeth and cause bleeding.

, You can reduce your pain by creating a warm water and salt mixture. Combine one half teaspoon of salt with one cup of warm (not boiled) water. Stir the mixture.Pour ¼ cup of the solution into your mouth. Gently swish it around. Spit out the mixture into the sink when you are done.

, Pour ⅛ cup of mouthwash into a small cup. Place the liquid in your mouth. Swish the mixture for thirty seconds. Spit it out into the sink.

, If your dentist determines that your impacted tooth could later cause problems (e.g. crowding, pain, etc.) or has caused gum disease or tooth decay already, it is best to opt for removal.Oral surgeons generally perform such procedures.The surgeon will cut open your gums and take out any obstructing bone. Then he will stitch the opening together. There likely will be some pain and swelling afterwards. Ice packs and painkillers can help alleviate your pain.Earlier removal of wisdom teeth is better. If a surgeon removes these teeth before a patient is twenty years old, the teeth will not be as developed.This will make the procedure easier and hopefully less painful.
Your dentist can also be reduce swelling by injecting anti-inflammatory medication immediately after extraction.

Take deep breaths.,
Listen to music.,
Do something to occupy your time.,
Just let yourself think about it.",How to Relax Before Getting Tonsils Removed1,";
, This may sound simple, but it helps. Sitting down and taking slow, deep breaths will calm you down and clear your mind.

, If you know that listening to music calms you, then try it! Turn on classical music (or your preference), and in no time you'll be feeling better!

Wiggle the tooth.,
Ask the child if there is any pain.,
Check for bleeding.,
Ask your child if they want you to pull the tooth.,
Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.,
Make sure your child is relaxed and calm.,
Wipe the tooth two or three times with a cotton ball or gauze to avoid slippage.,
Take a piece of sterile gauze pad between your thumb and index finger.,
Grasp and pull the tooth firmly.,
Stop the bleeding.,
Rinse the mouth with salt water.",How to Pull a Loose Tooth at Home," Pulling out a tooth before it's ready can cause unnecessary pain, bleeding, and infections. Before attempting to remove a tooth, test it thoroughly by moving it around. If it wiggles easily, this indicates that the tooth may be ready to remove.First, encourage your child to wiggle the tooth with their tongue. Make sure the child can move the tooth back and forth, as well as side to side.
You or your child can also wiggle the tooth using your hands, but make sure they are thoroughly clean before doing so.
If the tooth does not easily move around, it's too early to pull it.;
, A sufficiently loose tooth is only attached by a small thread of gum tissue, and shouldn't cause any pain when it moves around. When wiggling the tooth, ask repeatedly if the child feels any pain. There may be some mild discomfort, but if moving the tooth around causes pain, it's too early to think about pulling it out.Do not worry if you see the permanent tooth appearing near the temporary one. It is absolutely normal, and as one grows the baby tooth will slowly have the root resorbed and become easily to remove.

, Like with pain, a loose tooth shouldn't bleed when you move it around. While there will be some blood when you pull the tooth, there shouldn't be any when you're testing it. While wiggling the tooth, observe and see if there is any blood. If so, it's too early to pull the tooth., Abruptly pulling out a tooth can scare your child and cause unnecessary pain if they struggle. Sometimes children will want to wait until the tooth falls out on its own. If this is the case, don't pull the tooth. If your child wants the tooth out, then you can proceed., Dirty hands should never enter your or your child's mouth. This can cause an infection or illness. To avoid complications, always start by washing your hands thoroughly.



Click here for a how-to guide from the CDC on the proper hand washing technique.
If you have a pair of sterile rubber gloves, it might be good to wear these as well to further reduce the risk of infection.

, Your child will have to hold still while you take out the tooth, so make sure they are calm before proceeding. This is a very formative time for your child, and you don't want to do something that will cause your child to associate the experience with fear, pain, or panic.Remind your child that the tooth fairy is coming — this might help keep them calm.
You can also promise a treat like ice cream after you're all done.

, Children's mouths tend to be full of saliva, so it'll be much easier for you (and easier on them) if you wipe down their tooth before you pull it.


If you don't have a cotton ball or gauze available, a tissue will work, too. Anything that will dry off the tooth so you can grip it easily, like a cloth, is fine.

, To further reduce the risk of infection, you shouldn't pull out the tooth with your bare hands. Instead, use a sterile gauze pad so you don't touch the tooth or gums with your skin., Using the gauze pad, grasp the tooth and pull. You can also add a slight twisting motion as you pull to help break the tooth away from the gum. Perform this action quickly so your child doesn't get anxious and start squirming.If the tooth is loose enough, it should pop right out with little trouble. If it doesn't come out after a firm pull, it isn't ready yet. Don't continue or you could hurt your child. Try again in a few days.
Another method is to loop a 20 cm piece of floss around the loose tooth and try to get it as high up as possible. Make the loop as firm as possible and use a quick, firm motion to pull on the ends of the floss, popping the tooth off painlessly. If your child wishes to do it themselves, that is okay, too., Even if the tooth was very loose, there will still be some bleeding. Take a fresh, sterile piece of gauze and compress the tooth socket with your forefinger and thumb. Have the child bite on the gauze piece for 10 minutes or so. This will help to control the bleeding and promote quicker wound healing., Losing a tooth will leave an open wound in your child's mouth. To prevent infection, use a salt water rinse right after you pull the tooth. It would also be helpful to use this rinse for a few days after the extraction.Dissolve 1 teaspoon of salt into a glass of warm water.
Have your child swish this mixture in their mouth for 30 seconds.
Have your child spit the salt water out. Make sure to tell them that this will make them sick if they swallow it.

Visit your dentist regularly.,
Consult a periodontist.,
Brush your teeth twice a day.,
Use proper tooth brushing techniques.,
Keep your toothbrush clean.,
Floss your teeth every day.",How to Prevent Receding Gums1," Periodontal disease is a leading cause of receding gums. See your dentist every six months for cleanings and check-ups. If you haven’t had it done, ask about fluoride treatment. Having regular professional care can help prevent diseases of your mouth and gums.Gingivitis, periodontitis, and plaque all cause inflammation in your gums, which causes gingival recession. Your dentist can help you prevent these or treat them before they get worse.
Having misaligned or crowded teeth can cause or worsen gum recession and may warrant orthodontic treatment.;
, If you have dental problems that your regular dentist can't fix, they can likely refer you to a periodontist. Periodontists specialize in preventing and treating periodontal disease, and may be better equipped to help you with gingival recession., Take the time to thoroughly brush your teeth two times per day. Brush in the morning when you wake up, and before bed. Use toothpaste that contains fluoride. Use a soft-bristled or medium-bristled toothbrush; avoid hard-bristle brushes.Consider purchasing an electric toothbrush, which may reduce plaque more than brushing with a regular toothbrush.
Be sure to brush the inside, outside, and tops (chewing surface) of your teeth. Brush your tongue, too.

, A big mistake people often make is brushing their teeth too hard. Brushing in a rigorous horizontal (back and forth) manner can cause trauma to your gums and can wear away the enamel, causing gum recession.Ask your dentist to show you the right way to brush your teeth.


Tilt the head of your toothbrush at a 45° angle towards your gum line. Use small circular vibratory strokes. Brush with gentle pressure. The bristles of your toothbrush can actually go 1 mm below your gum line to remove plaque that gets stuck there. Do about 20 strokes in one position before moving on to the other surfaces of your teeth.After doing 20 strokes, do a sweeping motion towards the biting surfaces of your teeth to move the plaque out. Do a back and forth horizontal movement to clean the biting surfaces of your teeth.

, Always rinse your toothbrush after you brush your teeth and store it upright – not lying down in a drawer or on a counter. Do not keep your toothbrush in a closed container often, because this can encourage bacteria to grow. Keep each toothbrush in your household separate.Get a new toothbrush every 3-4 months, or if the bristles get frayed.

, Flossing should go hand in hand with brushing.Flossing further removes plaque that was not reached by the bristles of your toothbrush.


For effective flossing, get an elbow-length string of floss and wrap both ends around your middle fingers. Leave an inch of floss that you can work with.
Starting from the back tooth, slide the floss very gently in between your teeth with the help of your index fingers. Do not force the thread to go down, which can cause damage to your gums.
Repeat the same procedure for all your teeth, taking care not to damage your gums. If your gums bleed when you floss, you need to be gentler.

Visit a dentist.,
Clean your hands.,
Wiggle the tooth.,
Leave it alone.,
Pull the tooth out.",How to Pull out a Loose Tooth2," If at all possible, it's best to have a dentist extract an adult tooth. Your adult teeth have longer roots, making it much more painful to remove an adult tooth. Plus, you'll likely have infection underneath that the dentist will need to deal with.You can lose a lot of blood, as well. In some cases, with the infection and the loss of blood, pulling your own tooth could be fatal.
If you can't afford a regular dentist, look for a dental school in your area, which may do it for cheaper. Also, many cities have free or cheap temporary dental clinics from time to time, which may make it affordable for you.

, Wash your hands thoroughly. That means scrubbing each finger and your palms thoroughly with soap and warm water. Put on latex (or a latex-free alternative) gloves to provide more protection against infection., Try an ancient Chinese method. You don't need any special tools, but it will be very, very painful. It should already be loose if you want this method to work. Start by grasping the tooth firmly between two fingers and wiggling the tooth back and forth as much as you can for 2 minutes., For the next 15 minutes, don't mess with the tooth at all. This waiting period gives your body a chance to build up some fluid behind the tooth. The fluid can make it easier to pull out, though it will still be difficult., Get a good grip on your tooth between two fingers. Make sure you have a solid grip on it because if it slips out of your fingers, that just means more pain as you try again. Twist or pull the tooth to get it out of your mouth."

Wash your hands thoroughly.,
Sterilize your tools.,
Separate the tooth from the ligament.,
Apply the forceps.,
Pull the tooth.,
Remove any leftover root.,
Help with the clotting process.",How to Pull out a Loose Tooth3," Scrub each finger with warm water and soap, as well as the palms. When you're done, dry your hands on a clean paper towel, and then use protective gloves, either latex or a latex-free alternative. Using gloves will help protect against infection., Any tools you are going to use need to be sterilized first. The easiest way is to boil the instruments for 20 minutes, which should kill any bacteria on them. Let the instruments cool before using them., Use an elevator. An elevator is like a small chisel that you use to cut the tooth from the ligament. Insert it all around the tooth between the gum and the tooth, applying some pressure. You need to get the chisel down to where the root is.Apply gauze if there's bleeding.
You can purchase any tools you need online.

, After using the elevator, the forceps go around a tooth to grasp it firmly. You should get the forceps as far down the tooth as you possible can, which is why you used the elevator first.. The reason you need to grasp as much of the tooth as you can is because you increase your chances of getting the whole tooth at once., If the tooth has only one root (the front teeth), pull on the tooth, applying straight upward or downward pressure. If it has two roots (molar), you'll need to wiggle it back and forth a bit with the forceps. Pull towards the cheek if possible with back teeth, as you risk damaging other teeth if you pull towards the tongue. However, you may need to pull towards the tongue for a tooth in the far back., If you didn't manage to get all of the tooth, you'll need to try again. Look to see if the socket looks clean without any tooth in it. If you see some, start again with the elevator, going around the area to loosen it. That should push it outward. If it doesn't push the piece out, grasp it again with the forceps, and lift it out., To get the gum to clot, hold gauze or a cotton ball to the area for at least 30 minutes. It takes longer for the area to clot because it stays wet rather than dry.Bite down on the gauze to help apply pressure.
Once the clot forms, protect it by not using straws, not smoking, and not spitting."

, Don't rinse your mouth for the first 24 hours. You can eat and drink lukewarm food, though not in the area where you removed the tooth. Make sure you're eating on the other side. You need to leave the hole alone as much as possible., Alcohol may seem logical since it can help you avoid the pain. However, it can keep the wound from healing properly. In addition, it can make it bleed more, which you definitely don't want., You will need to brush your teeth, but you should wait a day. When you do brush your teeth, be especially gentle around the extraction site. You don't want to pull up the clot accidentally., It can also help to rinse with saltwater after the first 24 hours, which can remove some bacteria. Dissolve a teaspoon of salt in a glass of water. Swish it around in your mouth for 20 to 30 seconds, particularly near the clot, and then spit it out."

, This is one of the most important things you'll have to get. Make it very readily available. Keep a cup or two in your bedroom so you can get to it without getting up.

, It may seem like it'll be difficult, but you need to eat. Get something warm, like soup broth or Cream of Wheat, and you should be able to eat it. If you want to wait, 1-3 days should be enough time before eating something like soup broth, and then another 1-3 days before eating oatmeal-like foods.

, When you're lying in bed, you'll want something to do. Getting some books or games can really help. Going out and buying a few books will be something you'll thank yourself for doing later. Being stuck in bed all day can be boring!

, If you are planning on going to work/school a week after the procedure, rethink it! Even if you do feel better in a week, you'll be tired. Give yourself at least 2-3 weeks to heal, and then you'll really feel well enough to go.

Stop smoking.,
Stop grinding your teeth.,
Do not get oral piercings.,
Make sure your dentures fit properly.",How to Prevent Receding Gums2," Smoking can cause a lot of general health problems. It can also cause a lot of dental problems, one of which is receding gums.Put in the effort to stop smoking now to improve your oral health – and your breath!


While you’re trying to quit, try to use nicotine substitutes such as nicotine patches.

, Grinding your teeth, or bruxism, is common – you may not even know that you do it, especially at night. This not only strains the muscles involved in chewing, but also leads to gum recession.Learn to stop grinding your teeth by trying some simple techniques:


See your dentist to get a night guard that stops you from grinding your teeth while you sleep.
Consciously try to unclench your jaw muscles during the day.
Stay away from caffeine and alcohol, especially near bedtime.
Lower your stress with meditation or a soothing bath before bed.

, Metal jewelry placed inside your mouth does not only cause problems with your teeth but also affects your gums. The barbel of tongue and lip piercings tends to hit the gum line repeatedly, and the trauma caused by this ultimately leads to gum recession.If you decide to get an oral piercing, make sure that the piercing shop observes excellent sanitary conditions.

, Gum recession can be caused by partial dentures that fit poorly.If your dentures feel loose or rub on parts of your gums, see your prosthodontist to have your dentures relined (refitted properly)."

Bring headphones and listen to an audiobook or music.,
Don’t show up too early.,
Empty your bladder and take any recommended dietary precautions.",How to Relax While Getting a Cavity Filled1," Listening to music or a funny audiobook before and while you’re getting a cavity filled can help you relax. Consider what best relaxes or distracts you, whether it’s loud, heavy music or something more calming. Make a playlist and show up to your appointment with a good set of headphones that’ll drown out any sounds from the dentist’s tools.Talk to your dentist in advance to make sure wearing headphones, especially a bulkier set, won’t interfere with their work.
Make sure that the volume is not too high so that you will still be able to hear the dentist’s instructions for you.;
, Showing up more than five or ten minutes early might make you more nervous. While it’s always good to show up on time or a little early to appointments, you don’t want to have to sit in the waiting room for a while anticipating the procedure. If you do arrive to the office too early, wait in your car or outside until a few minutes before your appointment, since waiting rooms themselves can be a source of anxiety.The sound of the drill turbine can provoke anxiety in some people, so try to avoid hearing it if possible.

, Talk to your dentist in advance about whether or not you can eat before the procedure. If you’ve already made arrangements for a general anesthetic, or a sedative that makes you unconscious, you may not be able to eat after midnight the night before.In addition, go to the bathroom before your appointment. It’s a lot easier to relax while sitting in the dentist’s chair for a while if you don’t have to use the restroom!

Avoid sweet foods and drinks between meals.,
Avoid hard foods at first.,
Keep your braces in while eating, if possible.,
Practice speaking with your braces.",How to Cope with Twin Block Braces1," The sugar in sweet foods and drinks, like candy or juice, can damage your teeth. Since you should brush after each meal, it is alright to eat sweet foods during meals. You should also avoid sticky treats, like toffee or chewing gum, which can damage the twin blocks., When you first receive your twin block braces, your mouth and jaw will be sore. This discomfort will likely last for a few days and can be aggravated by eating hard or crunchy foods. Stick to soft foods, like mashed potatoes or yogurt, until your discomfort goes away. Colder drinks, like a smoothie, may help to soothe pain.Hard or crunchy foods, like popcorn, pretzels, or chips, can break and become lodged under your block braces. You can either avoid these foods or only eat them when your block braces are taken out.

, Ideally, you will feel comfortable eating and drinking with your braces in at all times. The longer you are able to wear your braces for each day, the shorter your treatment time will be. When you just receive your twin block braces, you can take them out to eat meals. Over time, as you get more comfortable wearing the braces, try to keep them in while you eat meals.Keep them in a plastic box for safekeeping while you are eating if you need to take the braces out.

, It is fairly common to notice differences in your speech while you’re wearing twin block braces. Often, your speech patterns will go back to normal after a few weeks but you can speed up this process by practicing speaking with the braces in. You may also produce more saliva than normal, though this will stop after a few days.


Read aloud while you’re at home and practice tongue twisters to get used to forming words with your braces in. “S” sounds tend to be the most affected, so practice tongue twisters like “She sells sea shells down the sea shore.”

See a pediatric dentist.,
Consider whether or not a parent should be in the room.,
Choose words carefully and consider tone of voice.,
Consider nitrous oxide as an anesthetic.",How to Relax While Getting a Cavity Filled2," Kids are not simply smaller versions of adults, so it’s important not to take a child to an adult dentist. Not only are pediatric dentists specially trained in kids’ oral health, they are more familiar with methods that help kids relax in the dentist’s chair. They are also more likely to have a kid-friendly disposition, better word choices, and more patience with little ones’ fears.Pediatric dentists are also more experienced at calming down children and their offices are decorated in a way that is meant to create a fun place for children.

, Depending on a child’s age and personality, it may or may not be appropriate for a parent to be present during a filling. Additionally, some dentist offices prefer one or the other, so if you’re a concerned parent, consult with your pediatric dentist. If you’re more comfortable with one or the other, you can do some research and find a dentist whose practices match your preferencesIf you do stay in the room during the filling, stay in a place where the child knows you’re present but can’t see your face. They’ll respond to even subtle faces you might make and could become anxious or move around. Keep a calm, pleasant expression on your face and say reassuring things.
If you aren’t in the room, stay in the waiting room. Don’t leave to run errands in case you are needed for anything.
If you’re not in the room and are worried, the office’s staff will keep you informed about what’s going on with the procedure. Ask them for an update if you’re concerned.

, Pediatric dentists are typically very sensitive about the words and tone of voice they use with a young child, and parents should follow suit. It’s important to explain things in terms that are appropriate and make sense for the child. Speaking in a calm, controlled, and positive tone of voice is just as essential as using kid-friendly words. Try explaining that one of their teeth has a cold or is sick, and that the dentist is going to make it feel better.
Use positive reinforcement to remind a young child how great of a job they’re doing, that you’re very proud of them, and that going to the dentist is part of growing up that they should take pride in. Promising a reward after may also help, so you might remind your child of this if you are allowed to be in the room during the procedure.

, Dentists are using nitrous oxide as an anesthetic for children more frequently in recent years. There are no harmful effects or side effects associated with nitrous oxide, regardless of age.This method of sedation can be especially beneficial for children who are extremely afraid of needles or would otherwise require restraint, as it’s much safer for kids than general anesthesia."
"
Choose the right dentist.,
Ask your dentist about anesthetic and sedative options.,
Learn about fillings from your dentist and by researching.,
Have your dentist explain which kind of filling is best.,
Ask your dentist to explain the procedure and show you the tools.",How to Relax While Getting a Cavity Filled3," Do some research before going with a dentist to fill your cavity, especially if you or your child don’t already see one regularly. Look for reviews online and call offices to shop around for a dentist who’s not only highly skilled, but deeply sensitive and empathetic.Find a dentist by asking friends or family for referrals, looking online, or calling your insurance provider for a nearby dentist within your network.
Verify their qualifications by calling the office and asking about their degrees and licensing.
Some dentists hang televisions or posters from ceilings, play music, or use other means to distract patients during procedures.If the TV is 3D capable, then you can wear 3D glasses during the procedure.
If you or your child experiences significant fear of the dentist, consider calling offices and asking what distraction methods they use.

, Typically, an oral gel is first administered to the surrounding gum tissue. After a minute or so, a needle injects Novocain to numb the area completely. A sensitive dentist will time these steps so that you won’t feel anything. However, since some people don’t respond to Novocain or Mepivacaine or are severely afraid of needles, you should discuss the sedative process, cost range and coverage, and available options.General anesthetic is rarely used for fillings, but is sometimes administered in cases of severe fear or anxious of dental procedures.
You’re not able to drive after general anesthesia, so make sure to set up a ride if necessary. Also, take into account the side effects, which usually include dizziness.
Nitrous oxide, or laughing gas, is a common dental sedative. Unlike general anesthesia, you’re allowed to eat prior to being administered nitrous oxide
Oral sedatives, or sleeping pills like Halcion and Valium, are becoming more commonly administered in dental-phobic patients. If your dentist is trained to offer these medications, make sure you understand when and how much to take, and set up rides to and from the appointment., Understanding why ignoring a cavity can makes things much worse can help you relax during a filling. Fillings are important because they get rid of decay and act like a normal tooth, allowing you to continue to chew and talk. They also protect the pulp against external factors, so having it done as fast as possible can save you from expensive root canal treatments. Ignoring a cavity and not getting a tooth filled can lead to much more significant dental work, like crowns, root canals, or tooth extractions.Knowing that a filling isn’t the most intense dental procedure to fix cavities can help you face your fear and relax.
Even if a cavity does require a crown or root canal, these are tried and true procedures that will help you feel better in the long run.
Know that lots of people are afraid of the dentist, but it’s important to get your teeth taken care of in order to maintain your overall health. Ignoring a cavity can lead to infections that can make you very sick, representing a threatening danger for your overall health.

, Fillings are either composite, which are made of plastic and glass, or amalgam, which is made of silver and other metals. Amalgam fillings have been used for almost two hundred years, and while composite ones are newer, they’re becoming more and more advanced as time goes on.


Amalgam fillings are stronger, and usually the best option for kids.
Composite fillings are usually more expensive and don’t last as long, but are the same color as natural teeth.You will need to get these checked annually to ensure that the margins are intact and there is nothing getting into the area beneath them.
You might read about how amalgam fillings contain a small amount of mercury, but you shouldn’t be worried. When it’s combined with other metals, mercury isn’t harmful unless you have an allergy.
Amalgam fillings have also been around a long time, so there’s plenty of evidence to show that there are no long-term harmful effects., While some people express fear of seeing and hearing dental tools, others are more concerned about what they don’t know or see firsthand. If you typically experience a fear of the unknown or fear of not having control, consider asking your dentist to explain the procedure in detail and tell you about how each dental tool works.Do your best to know what you’re afraid of and why. Know yourself and if you’re generally more or less comfortable when you know all the details about something scary.

Be prepared for potentially embarrassing situations.,
Remember that braces aren't stigmatized.,
Stay focussed on the outcomes.",How to Cope with Twin Block Braces2," One of the most common sources of embarrassment with block braces is having food caught in the brace. You can prevent this problem by carrying a dental kit with you. This kit will help you to remove any food that's caught and keep your teeth clean. Drinking plenty of water can help to prevent food from getting caught by washing it away.Practicing speaking with your braces in can also help to prevent any potentially embarrassing speech problems.

, The fact is, most people will eventually have some sort of orthodontic treatment during their lifetime. If you're the only person you know with block braces, just remember that down the line the people who don't have braces now will likely have them in the future. You probably know other people who have braces, which can also help you stop feeling embarrassed by knowing others are going through the same thing.


Keep in mind that others aren't nearly as focussed on your braces as you are. If you're feeling self-conscious, remember that the majority of people are so wrapped up in their own lives and problems that they won't notice your braces.

, The ultimate goal of your orthodontic treatment is to have a healthy and aligned jaw. Block braces can be uncomfortable and feel burdensome, but they are a necessary part in this process. Whenever you're feeling down about your situation, or you feel embarrassed about your situation, remember that the final product is worth it.


Keep your orthodontic goal in mind by looking at before and after pictures from other people who have had block braces. Your orthodontist will have pictures of other peoples' treatments, and you can find before and after shots online.

Soak the braces in a retainer cleaning solution.",How to Cope with Twin Block Braces3," Twin blocks are an orthodontic treatment used to correct jaw alignment, especially overly protruding upper front teeth. They push the lower jaw out so the upper jaw and the lower jaw are in line. They’re usually used with kids and teens whose bones are still growing and developing. You have to wear both braces at all times, otherwise they won’t be able to adjust your jaw properly., Twin blocks should be worn every day for at least 18 hours a day.If possible, you can wear your block braces for 24 hours a day. Most people will need to take the block braces out to eat when they first receive them, or after they are adjusted.

Besides brushing your teeth each morning and night, you should brush after meals. You can use either a manual or an electric toothbrush in conjunction with fluoride toothpaste.Use floss to clean between teeth and to keep your gums healthy. You can also rinse with a non-alcoholic mouthwash. Alcohols can erode your braces, so avoid alcoholic mouthwashes.

, You will need to remove each brace when you are having a meal. After you remove the braces, rinse them under a running tap and clean it with a toothbrush.Do not use toothpaste to clean the braces, since the chemicals in toothpaste can be damaging to the brace material.


You will need to clean your teeth before you re-insert the brace so food is not trapped between the brace and your teeth.

, While brushing will help to remove larger food particles, you will need to soak your braces in a retainer cleaning solution to kill remaining bacteria. You should soak it at least once a week, but you can soak it more frequently.You can use a denture cleaner, brush it with a baking soda and water paste, or clean it with an anti-bacterial dish soap.
Be sure the rinse the braces thoroughly after soaking them.

Make or buy a dental kit.,
Alleviate pain.",How to Cope with Twin Block Braces4," Discomfort is a normal part of the twin block treatment process, but there are situations where pain could indicate that there is a problem with your braces. If a brace is ever broken or bent, call your orthodontist and schedule an appointment as soon as possible. If you are dealing with severe pain, consider talking to your doctor about pain management medications.If you ever lose one of your braces, make an appointment with your orthodontist as soon as possible., Canker sores tend to appear near the metal parts of the twin block braces where they irritate the skin. These are the most common type of mouth ulcer and it's very likely that you’ll get one at some point during your orthodontic treatment. They typically last 10 to 14 days and can be treated with over the counter remedies.Look for products that temporarily numb the area to bring some short-term relief. You can also rinse your mouth with warm salt water, which helps to ease oral irritations. Be sure not to swallow the salt water after rinsing.You can look for products at drug stores that are specifically intended for mouth ulcers, or for products that contain oral antiseptics, like carbamide peroxide, that will kill bacteria.
If you frequently get canker sores, talk to your orthodontist about whether a prescription-strength product is right for you.

, A dental kit will contain supplies that will help you clean and care for your twin block braces while you’re on the go. You can keep a dental kit in your car, purse, briefcase, or backpack. Your dental kit should include:A travel or full-size toothbrush
Travel size toothpaste
Dental wax
Dental floss or interdental picks
A small spiral dental brush. You may have to ask your orthodontist for one of these brushes.
You can find a dental kit at a large retailer or a drug store if you don’t want to make your own.

, You may experience pain or discomfort after your braces have been adjusted. With most block braces, your orthodontist will either instruct you to turn a key on the top brace or they will do it for you during an appointment. This key expands the top brace and will be adjusted as your jaw moves into the correct alignment. This can be uncomfortable, or even painful. Depending on your specific treatment, your bottom brace could be adjusted periodically.After your top or bottom brace has been adjusted, eat soft foods and avoid any hard foods.


An ice pack can help alleviate jaw pain, or you can take an over the counter pain medication.

Apply dental wax.,
Apply a local anesthetic.,
Use an oral rinse.,
Try a new toothpaste.,
Find a painkiller that works for you.",How to Deal With Brace Pain1," Ask your orthodontist for some dental wax. You can also find it at many pharmacies. This is firm, stretchy wax that you can apply to the tough, metal segments of the braces. This will reduce rubbing and friction against the sensitive parts of your mouth. Apply near painful areas.


You will want to roll the wax into a small ball, which makes it softer and easier to apply. Then rub the wax directly onto the part of the brace that is rubbing against your sore.
Before applying wax, make sure that your mouth and the braces are dry. If the area is moist the wax might not stick.
It can be particularly helpful to apply dental wax at night before going to bed. Thus, if you move your mouth a lot while asleep, the rubbing will do less damage.;
, There are some pastes that are sold over-the-counter which act as local anesthetics in the mouth. If applied directly to sores they will relieve pain for several hours. Examples include Orabase and Orajel.Anesthetics can have side effects, including itching, redness, and rash.Follow directions on box closely to avoid side effects. Do not use more than recommended and do not swallow unless expressly instructed to do so. Measure the dose precisely and apply using a cotton swab or gauze., These won’t directly relieve pain so much as they will reduce chances of infection and inflammation. If you are developing nasty open sores where the braces are rubbing against your mouth, using these can be a useful preventive measure against future pain and discomfort. Examples of these sorts of products include Listerine and Pro-Health.Untreated, bacteria can extend the life of a sore by more than a week. Using antibacterial mouthwash is the best way to shorten or even eliminate this phase of the sore.
Listerine or a chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash such as Corsodyl are the most effective mouthwashes for this sort of treatment. Dilute the mouthwash by half or one-third by adding water to the cup. Swish it in your mouth for 30 seconds, several times a day., There are some toothpastes that are designed for sensitive teeth. Brushing your teeth can be one of the most uncomfortable parts of brace pain. These pastes, together with a more gentle brushing strategy, can go a long way to making it more livable. Any store that sells toothpaste should sell these pastes and box should clearly indicate that they are for sensitive teeth.


Toothpastes that include potassium nitrate will numb the area slightly. Those with strontium chloride added a protective layer to the teeth., Your first recourse should always be a basic, over-the-counter painkiller like ibuprofen, naproxen sodium, acetaminophen, or aspirin. Find one that works for you. Consider any history of allergies or past discomfort with painkillers before deciding which one is right for you. Take as directed on the bottle.


Ask your doctor what they recommend. It is likely your orthodontist will make a recommendation even without your encouragement.
Some anti-inflammatory painkillers have been shown to slow tooth movement. While the effect will be small, you probably want to know that you’re getting the most out of your braces when you’re suffering! Tylenol (acetaminophen) was not shown to have this effect, so it should be your first choice if you have had a good history with it."

Wipe your mouth frequently.,
Eat your favorite solid foods at times of minimum discomfort.",How to Deal With a Palate Expander1," Choose foods that can give you the nourishment you need without making eating more of a headache than it already is. Choices can include yogurt, healthy shakes, ice cream, mashed vegetables like potatoes, zucchini, or yams, or mashed bananas, soup, etc.;
, Remember, the palate expander is literally separating the two halves of the upper jaw, exerting pressure on the bones of your lower face. You will most likely end up chewing with the teeth that aren't harnessed to the expander.

, Liquids will be easier to ingest than solid foods, since your tongue doesn't have to move the food around in your mouth to chew, only to swallow.

, A mouth with a palatal expander tends to produce a lot more saliva in general. Keeping a napkin or hankie ready to dab away the drool will keep things neat and dry.

, Take these opportunities when you can get them! With patience you can still enjoy pasta, sandwiches, and even pizza.

Be ready to have to learn some things over.",How to Cope With Braces As a Teenager," A majority of kids need braces. In fact, about 70% of kids get braces at some point, so you're actually in the in-crowd if you have to get them, too. If you're embarrassed, look around your school. You're sure to find other kids who are wearing braces just like you. Just knowing other people are out there can help you feel less embarrassed.One way to deal with the embarrassment of braces is to just go with it. With traditional metal braces, you can get your rubber bands in all sorts of colors, so go wild. Pick your favorite colors or show your loyalty to your school by picking your school colors. Show off your style a bit with the colors you choose.In fact, many teens wear their braces as a symbol of pride, even models and actors. You're going to have a great smile one day from your braces, so rock them!;
, If you're embarrassed by your braces, you can use makeup to pull attention away from that area. For instance, create awesome-looking eyes with a bit of eye shadow and mascara to help pull people's eyes up.Also, skip anything that's too sparkly on your lips because that will draw attention there.
You can use other things to draw attention away from your mouth. For instance, you could get a really cool, flashy haircut. You could also wear sparkly earrings, a cool headband, or interesting glasses. Anything on your head that draws attention away from your mouth will help downplay your braces.

, When you're a teen, you may be easily embarrassed. You may think everyone is looking at you and laughing behind your back. While other teens can be mean and you have a right to feel upset when they are, it's likely no one is even paying that much attention to your braces.When you get your braces on, don't be afraid to smile. Take a minute to look around. Is anyone really paying that much attention?
It's likely no one will make a big deal out of it. Most people are too wrapped up in their own issues to make a big deal about your braces.

, If you notice people really are staring at you, try cracking a joke to diffuse the situation. You call them out on their behavior without actually being mean about it, and you all can move on with your lives. Plus, you all have a good laugh, which puts everyone in a good mood.For example, you could say, ""Yeah, I got new braces. It kind of looks like a car crashed in my mouth, doesn't it? But at least I finally found a way to show my school spirit!""

, You have every right to dislike braces. They're uncomfortable and inconvenient, and you may not like the way you look. However, it's important to focus on what you can get from them, especially when you're feeling down about them. Just remember, for the temporary pain you have now, you'll have a great smile later.Every time you start getting annoyed, remind yourself of what you'll have. For instance, if you're thinking, ""It hurts so bad,"" change it to ""It hurts bad now, but for this temporary pain, I'll have a great smile forever.""
Also, consider printing out pictures of people with pretty teeth. When you're feeling bad, just look at those pictures to remind you of what you'll have.

, Ask your parents to schedule your orthodontist appointments near the end of the school day or even after. You usually have the most pain right after you have an appointment for adjustments, so it's best to be done with school. You don't want to be in pain while you're trying to pay attention.If you can't schedule near the end of the day, try to take a pain killer before going back to school, so at least you won't be in so much pain.

, One simple way to help deal with the pain is to take a painkiller. You can take the over-the-counter pain medicine of your choice, with your parent's permission, as long as it helps with the pain. Try taking one before your orthodontist appointment so it kicks in by the time you are done. Just let your dentist know that you've taken one.Some dentists say that acetaminophen is the best choice because there is some evidence that ibuprofen and naproxen sodium can make teeth move slower.
Follow the directions for the painkiller you are taking. Overdosing or taking the medications too often can have bad side effects. For example, make sure you are taking the appropriate amount of acetaminophen for your weight. As long as you are over 96 pounds, you can usually take an adult dose, such as two 325-milligram tablets., If you have canker sores, they can get worse when you have braces. Because they can be so painful, it can help to get an oral anesthetic. Dab a bit on the places that hurt to help you deal with the pain. Some products even create a light seal over the sore to make it go away faster.Oral rinses can help cut down on infection and therefore, pain. Most ADA-approved (just look for ""ADA"" on the bottle) mouthwashes work well for this, and you can use them after you brush.

, Eating ice cream or other cold foods, like sorbet, frozen yogurt, and popsicles, can all help ease the pain of eating. Try eating something cold if your braces are really bothering you. Just be sure not to chomp down on something frozen, as that could harm your braces., If your braces are rubbing in a particular area, you can use dental wax to create a barrier. It should help stop some of the pain because you place it over the metal that is hurting your mouth. If it comes loose and goes down your throat, don't worry. It's non-toxic.You take a small piece of wax and make a small ball. Use it to cover the area that's causing a problem, flattening it over the metal.

, Because the pain mostly comes after you get adjustments, talk to your orthodontist if you're in a lot of pain. Sometimes, the orthodontist can change up how he or she makes your adjustments, which may lessen your pain.If you're not sure what to say, you could try, ""I've been in a lot of pain lately with my braces. I know pain is common, but I've heard that sometimes you can change how you make adjustments to lessen pain. Is that possible with me?""

, If it's possible and your family can afford it, ask for the clear braces. They are much less noticeable than the traditional metal kind, so you won't stick out as much. Talk to your orthodontist and your family about whether this type of braces is right for you.Many people need too much adjustment for the clear braces to work. Nonetheless, if you don't need major adjustments, they may work for you.

, Sticky foods can get gummed up in your braces, causing problems. It's best to avoid these foods if possible while you have braces. Sticky foods include things like gum and caramels and basically anything that tends to stick to the roof of your mouth. Chewy foods, like bagels and licorice, can cause similar problems.You also want to avoid crunchy foods, like chips, and hard foods, like hard candy, as they can break your braces.
You also want to avoid anything you need to bite into, like apples or corn on the cob.

, Stick to softer foods, like soft dairy, grains, pasta, and meat. You can eat vegetables and fruits, but choose softer ones like well-cooked vegetables or mashed ones. Applesauce and bananas are also a good choice.Consider carrying snacks you with you so you're not caught somewhere where you can't eat anything.
Other soft foods you might try are oatmeal, ice cream, pudding, macaroni and cheese, yogurt, avocados, and ripe peaches.

, When you have braces, your mouth is going to need extra care. You may get food stuck in your teeth more often, for example, and then you'll need to rinse or brush your teeth to get rid of the food. You'll want to carry a small kit at school for that purpose.In your kit, you'll want a small travel toothbrush, travel toothpaste, dental floss, and a small cup. You may also want a small mirror to check your teeth without venturing to the bathroom.
You can also add dental wax and dental picks. Picks can help you remove the food from your teeth, and the wax can help you smooth down rough edges that are causing you pain., For instance, if you play a musical instrument, it may take you some time to adjust to playing with braces. You're going to need to find new ways to hold your mouth, though in some instances, it can even make you a better player. Ask your band director for suggestions, as he or she has probably had students with that issue before.You may also need to learn some new tricks for eating. You'll need to chew carefully, making sure to take small bites. Try biting with the side of your mouth instead of the front, as that will make it easier. Also, make sure you're cutting up anything too big, like pieces of sushi rolls.

Eat soft foods.,
Brush softly.,
Rinse with warm salt water.,
Use ice.,
Distract yourself.",How to Deal With Brace Pain2," One of the most important things to do when you first get braces is to avoid hard, crunchy foods. Avoid chips or fries, for example. For the first few days, consider not eating any solid foods and try a mostly liquid diet. It is also advisable to chew as softly as possible to reduce friction.


The bright side to your discomfort is that you now have a good excuse to eat ice cream. Ice cream is soft and because it is cold it can help reduce inflammation. Though not as exciting, soup can also be a good choice for a sore mouth., This means in part that you should use long, slow, gentle strokes when brushing your teeth. But it also helps to have the right toothbrush. A soft bristle tooth brush will make it much easier to clean your mouth without aggravating any sores. They are readily available at most stores and clearly identified on the packaging.


Brush gently from the top to the bottom of each individual tooth.It is important that you still brush multiple times a day after getting your braces and always check in the mirror for any food particles or plaque.

, Rinsing your mouth with warm salt water can help heal any wounds in your mouth and ease pain from shifting teeth. Combine warm water from the tap or a tea kettle with salt from a shaker and mix using a spoon. Use 1 teaspoon salt for each cup of water. Rinse three times daily., Put ice in your mouth for a while and suck on it. The cold will reduce swelling. The principle is similar as that of the ice cream, only less fun, but probably healthier. But be careful if you bite the ice this might result in your braces hurting more or a broken bracket!, Dealing with pain is also a question of mind over matter. If you fixate on it, it will get worse, whereas if you pretend it is not there, it will get better. One of the best ways to forget about it is to focus on something else. Find something to do that will distract you. Anything that is engaging — either because you enjoy it or it takes a lot of effort — should help take your mind of the pain."

Continue to brush and floss your teeth on a daily basis.,
Consider purchasing a Waterpik water flosser to facilitate more thorough, leisurely cleanings at home.,
Pack both a normal sized and a tiny toothbrush if you will be dining out.",How to Deal With a Palate Expander2," This is good oral hygiene that we should all be practicing regularly. Now is the time to make sure the habit sticks!

, A Waterpik focuses a tiny stream of water under pressure to clean hard to reach places in your mouth and is highly recommended for many forms of orthodontics and other dental work. Pay special attention to cleaning the central gears, screws, and edges of the expander and to places where the expander touches or covers your gum line.

, Excuse yourself from the table and use these to gently brush away any pieces of food that may be lodged in your teeth and expander.

"
"
Follow your orthodontist's instructions about how often to turn the expander.,
Locate the ""key"" provided by your orthodontist.,
Insert the key into the hole in the screw of the central gear.,
Turn the key as far as it will go.,
Remove the key carefully from your or your child's mouth.,
Follow up with your orthodontic appointments as scheduled.",How to Deal With a Palate Expander3," This could vary from once a day to two or three times per day, depending on the degree of expansion required as well as on other orthodontic procedures that need to occur during the process, such as adding braces.


Be as consistent as possible.
If you find that your schedule is likely to be interrupted, or if you foresee the need to delay turning, always check with your orthodontist first.

, This is a tool, usually a small metal rod, that is inserted into the screw at the center of the gear and provides lateral torque to force the hard palate to expand.If the key doesn't have a safety string, secure the end with a long string or length of dental floss, which will allow for easy retrieval if you drop the key in your or your child's mouth.

, In most cases you will be inserting the key into a small angled hole facing the back of your upper teeth (i.e. the key will be pointing out of your mouth).


If you are performing this on yourself, do this in front of a mirror in a well lit room.
If you are performing this on a child or young person, have them lay down and open their mouth as wide as possible to prevent gagging in case you accidentally touch their uvula. Make sure you have enough light to see clearly - use a flashlight if needed.

, After inserting the key, and making sure not to hit the skin at the roof of the mouth, slowly and with consistent pressure turn the screw as far as it can go, towards the back of the throat.

, Clean it and put it in a safe place.

, Most orthodontists will have you come in one a week to gauge progress and address any concerns.


Keep a list of concerns as they occur for convenience.

Rubber bands are applied in different ways depending on the structure of your mouth and what issue your orthodontist is trying to correct. You should ask them first about any questions you have regarding your rubber bands. If you are confused about any instructions after leaving the office, call your orthodontist., Rubber bands are usually attached to the hooks on braces. Learn the different parts of braces before attempting to use rubber bands.


Braces have brackets, triangular structures that are positioned on the front midsection of your teeth. Brackets are attached by archwire, small metal bands between brackets.If you need rubber bands, small hooks or buttons will be strategically placed at various parts of your braces. This is where you'll attach your rubber bands. The number of hooks or buttons you have, and where they are found, depends on the position of your rubber bands., Vertical elastics are one of the most common forms of rubber bands for braces. They're used to occlude crooked teeth together.


With vertical elastics, there will be a total of six hooks. Two hooks will be between your upper canine teeth, which are the pointier teeth found in the corners of your mouth. There will be four hooks in your lower mouth, two between your lower canine teeth on either side of your mouth, and two others on either side near your molars. Molars are the bigger teeth towards the back of your mouth.
You will use two rubber bands. On either side of your mouth, wrap the rubber band around the upper hook and lower hooks to form a triangular shape., Cross elastics are another common configuration of braces. They are used to correct an overbite.


You will only use one rubber band in cross elastics. On the left or right side of your face, there will be a button towards your top molars on the side of your teeth facing your tongue. There will be another button on your bottom molars on the side of your teeth facing away from the tongue.
Connect a rubber band between these two buttons, starting with the top button., Class 2 and 3 elastics are a variation on cross elastics that are used to correct different issues.


Class 2 elastics are also used to correct overbites. Your orthodontist might prescribe them over cross elastics depending on your type of overbite. On your upper canine teeth, there will be a hook on the side of your teeth facing away from your tongue. There will be another hook on your lower teeth attached to your first molar. This will also be on the side of the tooth facing away from the tongue. Attach a rubber band from the first hook to the second hook.An overbite has usually another negative part called over jet, which means that there is a space between your lower and upper teeth when you close your mouth. Class 2 elastics are used to correct also the over jet.
Class 3 elastics are used to correct an underbite. There will be a hook on your lower canine teeth, on the side of the teeth facing the tongue. There will be another hook on your upper teeth on your first molar, on the side facing the tongue. Wrap a rubber band around these two hooks., Front box elastics are used to correct an open bite. That is, when you are unable to fully close your mouth.


There will be four hooks, two on top and two on the bottom, found towards your front teeth on the incisors. The incisors are the sharper teeth found directly next to the front teeth.Connect the rubber band between all four hooks, forming a box shape., Many people dislike having to wear rubber bands on their teeth; however, your dentist prescribed you rubber bands for a reason. Understand why rubber bands are sometimes necessary.


Braces themselves adjust the alignment of teeth to straighten them out. Rubber bands do the work of pulling the jaw forward or backwards in order to line up your teeth correctly so they fit together when you bite down.Rubber bands play an important role in adjusting the muscular reflex of biting in the right position, so wearing them is really important, even if it feels awkward in the beginning.
If you have an extensive overbite or underbite, you will probably be prescribed elastics. You should wear them as your dentist instructs and only take them out to brush your teeth.It is also important to check if you have placed your rubber bands in the correct position, as your orthodontist showed you. Take some pictures in the dental office and compare them at home using a mirror.

, Unless your orthodontist or dentist instructs otherwise, your rubber bands should be changed three times a day as they lose their elasticity over time. Changing them before bed and after meals can help you stay on schedule., In the event a rubber band breaks or falls off during sleep and cannot be found, you need to replace the band immediately. Rubber bands should be worn 24 hours a day, seven days a week. For every day you skip wearing rubber bands, you lose three days of treatment. This can result in you having to wear braces significantly longer than is comfortable.

, It will take your teeth time to adjust to rubber bands. Expect your teeth to be sore for the first few days.


The first 24 hours with rubber bands is generally the worst. After awhile, you'll be able to wear your rubber bands nonstop with minimal pain.
If the pain is intense, talk to your orthodontist about gradually easing into wearing rubber bands rather than starting off wearing them 24/7., Orthodontist-prescribed rubber bands generally hold up well, but they do sometimes break or fall off. Always keep backup rubber bands. If you're going out, keep a small bag of backup bands in your pocket or purse., Rubber bands come in a variety of colors. As many people feel unattractive when wearing braces, and experimenting with different color rubber bands can be a fun way to make them feel more appealing.


Try coordinating colors for special events like holidays. You could use black and orange rubber bands for Halloween, for example.Ask for rubber bands in your favorite color. Some orthodontist offices may make neon or glitter colored rubber bands for teens and preteens."

Take care of your teeth.,
Stick to soft foods in the beginning.,
Avoid hard or chewy candies.,
Wear your rubber bands all the time.,
Take care of loose wires and brackets.",How to Deal With Dental Devices1," It’s easy for food to get caught in between your braces, which causes plaque build up and overall poor dental health. Be sure to establish a good dental hygiene routine that includes brushing, flossing, and rinsing with mouthwash every day. Brush at least twice a day, in the morning and before bed. It’s best to brush after eating as well to avoid letting food sit in the braces.

Flossing with braces can be tricky. Use 18 inches (about 46 centimeters) of waxed floss. Thread it carefully under the main wire of the braces and then pass between two teeth. Work the floss between your teeth without pulling on the arch wire.Carry a travel toothbrush to make sure you are able to brush your teeth after every meal.
Use an oral irrigator. This device uses a stream of water to clean any bacteria or debris left in between teeth, braces, and gums. They can also increase blood flow in the gums, which leads to an increased antibacterial protection offers by natural antibodies.
Try an interdental brush. These brushes are designed to clean between your teeth, so they can help when you have braces. Brushing gently with an interdental brush can help remove food from your braces.;
, Your braces, unfortunately, are going to hurt for the first few weeks. Eat foods that you can easily swallow without chewing much like macaroni and cheese, applesauce, ice cream, popsicles, and shakes, all of which will ease you into the braces.


To get in your veggies, try steaming them until they’re soft enough to chew easily.
Soft cooked rice, noodles, and seafood such as tuna and salmon are easy to chew and substantial.Eat soups if you’re having trouble chewing anything at all.

, These can damage or break your braces, and also generally cause poor tooth health. Don’t eat foods such as caramel, sticky or chunky peanut butter, hard candies, nuts, chewy candy, taffy, gummy bears, popcorn, or gum.

, If your orthodontist decides you need to wear rubber bands, you need to be diligent in wearing them all the time so that your teeth will move properly. Also, keeping your rubber bands in will prevent the hooks from getting caught in your cheeks.If your dental work is extensive, you may need headgear. Headgear provides something to anchor your braces to, applying needed pressure to the teeth, which helps them move into the proper place. Headgear may go around the back of your head or strap to your forehead or chin.
You must wear the gear for the set amount of time. Usually, you need to wear it about 12 hours a day, though in most cases, you won't need to wear it the whole time you have braces on your teeth., Broken braces, loose bands, and protruding wires are all common problems that plague braces wearers. These problems can be painful and lead to prolonged discomfort in the mouth, so it’s important to call your orthodontist. Until you can get an appointment, you can try a few at-home remedies to alleviate pain.For a loose bracket, use orthodontic wax to temporarily reattach the brackets. This tactic provides a cushion between the gum and bracket.If you don't have wax, you can also use a little sugar-free chewing gum as an emergency option until you get to your appointment.
For a protruding or broken wire, use the eraser end of a pencil to move it to a better position until you can see a doctor. You can also apply orthodontic wax so that the wire doesn’t cut your gums or cheeks.Do not try to cut wire, as you may accidentally swallow or inhale it.
For loose bands, see a doctor, as these need to be re-cemented into place or replaced. Save the band if you can for your appointment."

Wear your retainer for the recommended amount of time.,
Always carry a case for your retainer.,
Keep your retainer clean.,
Keep it away from heat sources.",How to Deal With Dental Devices2," The point of a retainer is to maintain the work of your braces, and if you don’t wear it, you risk having your teeth move back to their original position. Wear your retainer for the recommended amount of time, except when eating, cleaning the retainer, or participating in ball sports that could result in injury to the mouth. Remember what it was like to go through braces; you don’t want to have to do that again.For example, your doctor may recommend wearing a removable retainer all the time for three months, then move to only wearing it at night.

, You need to remove your retainer during meals and having a case handy allows you to store your retainer when it’s not in your mouth. While it may be tempting to simply place your retainer on the table next to you, this is less hygienic than a case and also puts your retainer at risk of being broken. Carry your retainer in your pocket, backpack or purse so that you have easy access at all times. Wrapping your retainer in napkins instead of putting it in a case often results in the retainer accidentally getting thrown in the trash.
Retainers are expensive to replace, costing as much as $250. Keeping a case with you will make you less likely to lose your retainer., Having a good cleaning routine prevents buildup of bacteria and keeps your retainer from developing a nasty smell. Be sure to brush your retainer once a day with warm water. Always check with your dentist about which types of cleaners you can use, as you cannot use toothpaste with some retainers.Soak your retainer in a disinfectant at least once a week but preferably once a day. Choose a denture-cleaning solution, and mix the cleanser with one cup of warm water. Or you can opt for dissolving pills that have the similar effect and remove any bacteria on the retainer. You can also use mouthwash.
Instead of commercial cleaners, you can try a few home remedies if you don’t want to use denture cleaner or mouthwash. You can soak your retainer in equal parts water and vinegar for fifteen to thirty minutes or in a 3% hydrogen peroxide for thirty minutes., Heat sources can cause the plastic in the retainer to break or bend. Make sure you don't use hot water to clean it, just warm water. In addition, make sure not to leave it on hot surfaces, like the radiator."

Wear each set of trays for 20 – 22 hours a day.,
Keep your aligners clean.,
Change your aligners every two weeks.",How to Deal With Dental Devices3," If you want to see results from your clear braces, you must commit to wearing your aligners for a minimum of 20 hours a day. For best results, only remove clear braces for eating and cleaning. Do not remove clear braces at night., Brush your aligners with lukewarm water whenever you brush your teeth. Similar to retainers, aligners should be soaked and cleaned in a denture cleaner anywhere from once a day to a few times a week.It is also best to maintain good dental hygiene while wearing clear braces to keep your aligners smelling fresh and bacteria-free. Brush your teeth at least twice a day, but ideally, brush after every time you eat to prevent food particles from getting caught in your aligners.
Use mouthwash to create a bacteria- free environment before placing the aligners back in your mouth.
Do not brush your aligners with toothpaste or mouthwash as these substances can cause damage.

, At the beginning of your treatment you will be given several sets of aligners that are meant to continually shift your teeth in the right direction and advance your progress. Be sure to change your aligners as instructed to ensure the best result, and check in with your doctor every six weeks.You will feel the actual aligner getting loose when the next one is required. This means that you need to see your orthodontist for the next stage of teeth straightening.

Give it time.,
Visit your dentist.,
Make or ask for adjustments.,
Try a different device.,
Skip these devices with dentures.",How to Deal With Dental Devices4," Many of the problems associated with dental devices will diminish over time as you become more accustomed to wearing the dental device. For instance, some people experience problems with a mandibular repositioning device, such as more saliva in the mouth or dry mouth, jaw pain, headaches, or gum irritation. Most of these symptoms will fade over time.However, if you're having pain during the day after using one of these devices, particularly when you're moving your jaw or eating, then you should talk to your dentist.
Your dentist or doctor may also be able to show you jaw and tongue stretches to help with any pain., Having healthy teeth and gums can also help minimize problems with dental devices, such as gum irritation. Make sure you are visiting your dentist twice a year, as doing so can help keep your teeth healthy. Plus, your dentist can check any problems you may be having with the device.Be sure you are checked out by a dentist before you get fitted for such a device. Doing so will help ensure your teeth are healthy enough to have a dental device for sleep apnea.
Also, be sure to maintain healthy teeth at home by brushing twice a day and flossing every day.

, If your device is causing you pain, you should ask for adjustments or make them yourself if you are able to. You may need a slightly different position for it to be the most comfortable. Talk to your dentist or doctor about what's best for you., You have several options when it comes to dental devices for sleep apnea. If one isn't working out for you, try using another instead. In fact, each type of device has several different styles, so you can even change it up by switching to another style. Mandibular repositioning devices, for example, work by fitting over your teeth and changing the position of your lower jaw, opening up the airway. Tongue retaining devices adjust your tongue by pulling it forward and opening the airway, while other dental devices are combined with a CPAP machine to make it easier to use.
With mandibular repositioning devices, you have the option of the boil and bite style, adjustable style, or hinged style. The boil and bite version has you boil the device, then sink your teeth into it to create a mold of your mouth. The adjustable style has ways of adjusting the device for a more comfortable fit, while the hinged style still allows you to open and close your mouth. Choosing a different style may make it easier to deal with., If you wear dentures, you're probably going to need to find another solution for your sleep apnea, such as a CPAP mask. Most dental devices won't hold properly when the person is wearing dentures, though the mandibular repositioning kind will be particularly difficult."
"
Try a CPAP machine for sleep apnea.,
Use a ramp feature to adjust to air pressure.,
Choose a different size mask.,
Try a different style.,
Use the humidifying chamber for dry mouth.,
Make adjustments if the mask is causing you discomfort.",How to Deal With Dental Devices5," A CPAP machine is often the first treatment suggested for sleep apnea, though it is not a dental device. It provides a steady flow of air to you through a mask, helping to keep your airway clear and unobstructed. Unfortunately, many people find the mask uncomfortable to wear, and therefore, end up not using it.To adjust to wearing the mask, try putting it on for a little while each day, then adding air pressure once you're comfortable. Once you start wearing it to bed, make sure to use it every time you sleep to help you adjust easier.

, You may find you have difficulty adjusting to the forced air pressure. If that's the case, you may try a ""ramp"" feature, which increases the air pressure over time. In other words, you start with a lower pressure as you fall asleep, and it slowly moves up to a higher pressure. Other machines will adjust automatically to your different breathing patterns, making it easier to sleep., One step you can take to make your CPAP device more comfortable is to pick a different size mask. Masks come in all different sizes, and you may not be the same size across brands. In addition, most are adjustable to make them more comfortable.If you don't know how to adjust your mask, ask. Your doctor or a person at the place you bought the machine should be able to help.

, CPAP masks come in a wide variety of styles. One style may not suit you, but you may find another that does. Finding the right kind of mask for your particular needs can make the mask much more comfortable and usable.For instance, if you tend to knock your mask off, you may want one that has straps across both your cheeks and forehead, as that's more secure than other masks.
However, if a mask with secure straps makes you uncomfortable, you might try one with a nasal pillow instead, which only strap under your nose. You can also see over this type of mask better.
You may also need to choose a different mask or tubing if you end up with a runny nose after using the machine, which could indicate you are allergic to part of it.If you feel uncomfortable wearing a mask, ask about newer devices, such as the micro CPAP. These new styles eliminate the hoses and other accessories by only placing a small device into your nostrils.

, If you end up with a dry mouth after using your CPAP machine, you can try making the air more humid. Most machines have this capability already built in. Adding moisture to the air, particularly during cold, dry months, can help cut down on dry mouth.A dry, stuffy nose can also be caused by low humidity in the machine. You can also try a saline spray before bed to help with your nose.Follow your machine's instructions for using the humidifying chamber.

, Your mask should not be on so tightly that is irritating your skin or causing you discomfort. If it leaks or won't stay on your face, you may need to make adjustments. Change the length of the straps, and adjust the pads to try to get a better fit.You may also need to consider another style of mask, as other brands or styles may fit your face better."

Wear a night guard for teeth grinding.,
Use a mouthguard when playing sports.,
Learn to turn a palatal expander.",How to Deal With Dental Devices6," A night guard slips over your teeth to protect them while you sleep if you grind your teeth. The most important thing about a night guard is to make sure you wear it. To make it more comfortable, get fitted for one by a dentist rather than choosing a ""boil-and-bite"" type from a pharmacy. The dentist-fitted kind tends to be more comfortable over time as they are more accurate and made from a superior material.Decrease grinding by using a few tricks. For instance, try not to chew gum or other objects (like pens), as that teaches your mouth to chew all the time.
Also, try to cut down on stress, or meditate before sleeping. In addition, avoid caffeine and nicotine, as they can cause you to grind your teeth more.

, Mouthguards are designed to help keep your teeth from getting chipped or broken while playing sports. They provide cushion, much like a night guard provides cushion against you grinding your teeth.For the guard to be effective, make sure to always wear your guard every time you play sports, particularly contact sports.
To make it more comfortable, have one fitted by a dentist rather than buying one over-the-counter.

, A palatal expander helps increase space in a child's mouth, which in turn allows for teeth to be straighter. This device may be intimidating to you, however, since it requires turning once a day. Your dentist will show you what kind of turns you need to do with your child's expander, but mostly, you use a small key to turn parts of the expander a little bit each day.Stick with soft, enjoyable foods for the first couple of days, such as yogurt, applesauce, ice cream, or mashed potatoes. While the expander is in, skip hard candies, as they can stick to the expander.
Note that an expander is mostly painless. A child may experience some pain in the first few days and a little pressure after each turn, but it is relatively light.

Rinse off the retainer to remove any visible buildup.,
Place the retainer in a shallow cup, and fill with enough denture cleaner to cover the retainer completely.,
Let your retainer soak in the denture cleaner liquid for 15 to 20 minutes, or as instructed by packaging.,
Submerge the retainer in non-alcoholic mouthwash for anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours.,
Remove the retainer after the allotted time and rinse.",How to Clean Your Retainer2," Use this method only once every so often, as it is powerful. Repeated use of denture cleaner can cause yellowing or warping of the plastic mold on the retainer.

, Denture cleaners can be purchased over the counter at most drug stores or pharmacies, and come in cream, liquid, powder, or tablet form. As the name suggests, they are primarily used to clean dentures, but can also be used to clean retainers.

, Consult the packaging of the denture cleaner to make sure that you're soaking the retainer for the recommended time.

, The longer you can soak your retainer, the better. Just be sure to use non-alcoholic mouthwash.


Alcohol mouthwash can degrade the plastic mold of the retainer. If all you have is alcohol-based mouthwash, soak the retainer in the mouthwash for a maximum 20 minutes.

, Your retainer is now clean and ready to be used again!

Make a paste of baking soda and distilled water.,
Using a toothbrush, apply the paste to the retainer and scrub thoroughly.,
Rinse the baking soda paste off and enjoy your newly-freshened retainer.

",How to Clean Your Retainer3," Add equal parts distilled water and baking soda to form a paste. The paste should have the consistency of a very light toothpaste.

, Attack the retainer with the baking soda paste you would if you were brushing your retainer with actual toothpaste.


Baking soda is a very effective natural cleaner. Specifically, baking soda naturally increases the pH of the mouth, making it more basic. Bacteria that lodge themselves in retainers tend to enjoy more acidic environments, making baking soda a very effective cleaning agent.,"
"
Get your hands on some castile soap.,
Dissolve a bit of liquid castile soap in a bit of warm water.,
Submerge the retainer in the castile soap solution and go at it with a clean toothbrush.,
Rinse the excess castile soap solution off and use your retainer as instructed.

",How to Clean Your Retainer4," Castile soap is much more gentle than other types of soap, being olive- and coconut-based for the most part. Named after the Castile region of Spain, castile soap does a good job of cleaning the retainer without inundating it in harsher, more harmful substances.

, Suds may not activate, as castile soap is a lot more gentle than conventional soap. Rest assured that it's still capable of cleaning.

, Try to designate a toothbrush specifically for using castile soap. Although castile soap is gentle and probably won't hurt you if ingested, it's a good idea to try to avoid implicating your regular toothbrush in this castile cleaning.

Rinse the retainer off in running water.,
Soak the retainer in a small bowl covered with distilled water for 10 minutes.",How to Clean Your Retainer5," Mix until suds develop.

, Rinse after the retainer has been fully cleaned.

, If you don't have alcohol available, you can use Listerine, or any alcohol-based mouthwash, instead. Just be sure not to soak the retainer in the alcohol for too long. At most, soak the retainer for 20 minutes.

, Try to remove any and all alcohol from the retainer.

, This process ensures that any remaining alcohol on the retainer is leeched away during the final soak.

Consult a dentist.,
Look at the tooth.,

Note if there is any pain.,
Avoid hard foods.,
Stay away from cold foods and drinks.,
Consider temporary filling materials.,
Try dental wax.,
Apply cold compresses.,
Take pain relievers.,
Control any bleeding.,
Arrange to see a dentist as soon as possible.,
Consider getting your tooth recontoured.,
Schedule an appointment for a dental filling.,
Look into getting a dental crown for large chips.,
Get the tooth removed.",How to Protect a Chipped Tooth," When you chip a tooth, you should consult a dentist right away.If there is pain or bleeding, this is especially important. Even if you do not feel pain, but suspect you have a chipped tooth, you should call a dentist as soon as it is feasible. You may not be able to see or accurately assess the damage yourself, and even if you are not in pain at the moment, complications could develop after a few days or weeks.;
, Visual inspection be useful, but may not reveal thin cracks.If you can, look at the tooth in a mirror to see if there is any visible reduction in tooth size. If the break is large enough, you may be able to see the damage. Small chips and cracks, however, can be much harder to identify. The upside is that small chips are easier to fix, and may only require a single visit to the dentist. Extensive damage may require many visits.Look for a darker color near the missing piece. This can indicate tooth decay.
A chipped filling can also cause a chipped tooth. Look in the mirror to compare the part that is chipped to the remaining tooth.

, If you do not see any visible damage, check for a chip by running your tongue along the tooth. If the tooth feels rough, especially if the edges are sharp and jagged, you may have a chip. Because the shape of your teeth is very familiar, you may quickly notice changes in the shape of your teeth.


Sometimes, with chipped teeth, especially at night, the sharp edges of dentin and enamel might hurt your tongue. Be careful when you're checking the chip with your tongue, and see your dentist as soon as possible.

, There are a number of indications that a chip has occurred, from visual signs to tactile ones. One of the most common signs is a sensation of pain or discomfort. This pain may come and go or be event specific, as when releasing the pressure from biting and when exposed to extreme temperatures.Pain from a chipped tooth can be caused by a few conditions:


A fracture extending to the second layer of the tooth or to the pulp, where blood vessels and nerves are located.
An indentation large enough to trap food, which will increase your chance of getting a cavity.
A vertical chip positioned in such a way that it is placing added pressure on the tooth.

, If your tooth is chipped, it is already weak; it can no longer support biting or chewing anything hard. Stick to soft foods to keep from exacerbating the damage.If possible, chew on the other side of your mouth.

, Chipped teeth can be very sensitive because their nerves are more exposed. Cold foods and beverages will make this problem worse. Eating cold foods may cause pain. If you find a food is irritating your tooth, stop eating it, as it may cause further damage., Dental cement and other similar materials are available over the counter, and they typically come with clear instructions. You simply place them over the fractured area. If your chipped tooth is bothering you, this might be worth a try.


Remember that these materials are only temporary; they are not meant to take the place of a visit to the dentist’s office. Make an appointment as soon as possible.
Temporary materials wear away rather quickly. When this happens, it leaves your tooth extremely vulnerable to decay., If your chipped tooth has sharp and jagged edges, it can injure your cheeks and tongue. Placing dental wax over these edges will offer some protection from it.It can also help to protect your tooth from temperature sensitivity.


Keep in mind that dental wax is very temporary. It falls off frequently, requiring you to replace it again and again. As with filling materials, it does not take the place of professional dental care.
If you have it on hand, you can also try placing a bit of sugarless gum over any sharp edges.

, If you are in pain, a cold compress can help. Simply wrap some ice in a towel and place it gently on your cheek. This will help to numb the pain.Never apply cold compresses directly to your chipped tooth; this will intensify your pain rather than relieving it.
Try a bag of frozen food if you have nothing else handy.

, Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen, will temporarily alleviate your discomfort. Follow the instructions on the label. Even though these should not cause any complications with pain medication your dentist may give you, you should make sure to always tell your dentist that you are taking medications.You can also try putting a corn kernel sized amount of anesthetic gel onto a piece of gauze and holding it on your painful tooth. Try not to swallow the gel or bite down too hard.

, If you are bleeding, get a clean piece of sterile gauze or cotton. Place it in your mouth and bite on it. The pressure should stop the bleeding until you can get to a dentist.


Bleeding is serious in a tooth that is broken. Immediate dental care may be require to keep the tooth from dying.If the bleeding continues for more than fifteen minutes or seems very heavy, you need to get help immediately. Consider heading to the emergency room or an urgent care center if you cannot get in to see a dentist.

, If you have a chipped tooth, you need to see a dentist – even if the fracture is small or if you have no pain. Only a dentist can properly diagnose your problem and perform the correct treatments to restore the tooth. Do not attempt to treat it yourself.

, This is the quickest and best method, assuming that the chip is very small. If the chip is small, a dentist can simply smooth the rough area and perform other small necessary adjustments. Tooth recontouring can be completed in just one appointment., For small to moderate chips, a simple dental filling can fix the problem. This is more painful than having the tooth recontoured, but it can be done for medium-sized chips and can usually be completed in just one appointment. This is often an ideal fix due to the durability and cosmetic versatility of this method.This will happen under local anesthesia, which will numb the nerve of your tooth and not cause you any pain.

, Crowns or other kinds of restorations may be necessary in extreme situations.If the fracture involves half of the tooth or more, you may need a dental crown, which carries the added benefit of protecting the remaining tooth. This treatment involves multiple dental visits.

, If the tooth is extensively damaged and the root has suffered a large infection or fracture, or simply if the patient prefers, a dentist can simply remove it. This solution works well in the short term, but may require the patient to wear a prosthesis later on. Talk with your dentist about the best solution for your situation."

Look for bloody diarrhea.,
Watch for gastrointestinal pain.,
Remember that some infections trigger vomiting.,
Be aware of serious kidney complications.,
Learn about other causes of bloody diarrhea.,
Learn about other causes of severe cramping.,
Be aware of medications that increase your risk.",How to Recognize the Symptoms of E. Coli Poisoning," Most varieties of E. coli are completely harmless and some others cause relatively brief bouts of mild diarrhea. However, a few aggressively pathogenic strains, such as E. coli O157:H7, can cause severe gastrointestinal upset and bloody diarrhea.The most pathogenic strains of E. coli, including O157:H7, produces a powerful toxin that damages the lining of the intestines, leading to the appearance of bright red blood mixed in with the watery stool. The toxin is called Shiga toxin and bacteria that produce it are referred to as Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, or STEC for short. Another common STEC strain that's more prevalent in Europe is labelled 0104:H4.


Bloody diarrhea from an E. coli O157:H7 infection typically begins 3-4 days after exposure, although it may occur as soon as 24 hours or as late as 1 week.
Diagnosing a serious E. coli infection is fairly straightforward and involves sending a stool sample to a laboratory for testing and culture. They will look for evidence of toxins and STEC strains.
Unlike many other pathogenic bacteria, STEC strains can cause severe infections even if you ingest only relatively small numbers of them.;
, As the Shiga toxin irritates and ultimately causes erosion and ulceration of the lining of the large intestine, abdominal pain is often felt.The pain is usually described as severe cramping mixed with some burning pain. The discomfort can cause people to double-over and prevent them from leaving the house or even walking around within their homes. However, unlike more common causes of abdominal cramps, there is usually no associated severe bloating or distension of the abdomen with STEC infections.


The sudden onset of severe abdominal cramps and pain is typically followed within 24 hours by bloody diarrhea.
E. coli infection can occur in people of all ages, but it's most common in children, the elderly and those who have weakened immunity.
About 265,000 STEC infections occur yearly in the U.S., with the O157:H7 strain accounting for approximately 36% of cases., In addition to severe abdominal cramping and bloody diarrhea, some people with E. coli infections also experience nausea and vomiting.Although the cause is not always clear, it appears that the Shiga toxin is not directly responsible for nausea and vomiting, but rather the intense pain caused by the invasive bacteria that burrow into the lining of the intestines. The pain triggers the release of adrenaline and other hormones, which leads to nausea and vomiting. As such, keep very well hydrated while combating an E. coli infection, but avoid fatty or greasy foods that may trigger nausea.


Other minor symptoms sometimes associated with E. coli infections include mild fever (less than 101˚F) and fatigue.The most common source of an E. coli infection is contaminated food, such as contaminated ground beef, unpasteurized milk and unwashed vegetables.

, Unlike other E. coli pathogens that remain on the membranes of intestines, STEC strains are invasive. After proliferating rapidly, they tightly bind to the intestinal lining and breach it, which allows for absorption of the toxins through the bowel wall.Once in circulation, the Shiga toxin attaches to white blood cells and is carried to the kidneys where it can cause acute inflammation and organ failure — referred to as hemolytic uremic syndrome or HUS. Symptoms suggestive of HUS include bloody urine and decreased urination, very pale skin tone, unexplained bruising, confusion and irritability, and swelling or puffiness throughout the body. Most people with HUS need to be hospitalized until their kidneys recover.


While most people recover from HUS, a small amount of people may have permanent kidney damage or die from it.
STEC infection is recognized as the most common cause of acute kidney failure in infants and young children.
In addition, your doctor may order a CBC and tests of your kidneys if you have any signs of HUS.

, There are many other causes of bloody diarrhea, most of which are far less life threatening than a severe STEC infection. Several other bacteria can cause bloody diarrhea, such as salmonella and shigella. Other conditions that can lead to blood in the stool include: anal fissure, hemorrhoids, broken blood vessel from aggressive wiping, diverticulitis, ulcerative colitis, stomach ulcer, parasitic infection, colorectal cancer, taking blood thinners such as warfarin, and chronic alcoholism.However, E. coli infections come on suddenly and the diarrhea containing bright red blood is preceded (by about 24 hours) by severe abdominal cramping.


Bright red blood in the stool is indicative of a problem in the lower digestive tract (such as the large intestine). In contrast, blood coming from the stomach or small intestine tends to make the stool appear black and tarry in appearance.
The most similar condition to a STEC infection is likely ulcerative colitis (a type of inflammatory bowel disease), but that can be diagnosed by viewing the bowels through a small endoscope.

, Most causes of abdominal cramps and/or stomach pain are benign and are not a cause for concern, despite the discomfort. For example, less serious causes include indigestion, constipation, lactose intolerance, food allergies, irritable bowel syndrome, stomach flu, kidney stones and menstruation.More serious causes of cramping and/or bloating include: appendicitis, abdominal aortic aneurysm, bowel obstruction, stomach or colon cancer, gallbladder inflammation, diverticulitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, pancreatitis and peptic (stomach) ulcers. Of these conditions, only colon cancer diverticulitis and ulcerative colitis can truly mimic a STEC infection due to bloody diarrhea, but E. coli infections occur suddenly with no prior symptoms.


Foods that represent high risk for E. coli poisoning include undercooked (pink) hamburger, soft cheeses made from raw milk, unpasteurized milk and unpasteurized apple juice or cider.Although it's not clear why, most E. coli infections in the U.S. occur between the months of June and September. So it seems to be more of a summertime problem.

, Although no medication causes E. coli infection, many create certain conditions that make it much more difficult for your body to combat the pathogenic bacteria — which you're exposed to probably more often than you think. For example, people undergoing chemotherapy, or taking drugs to prevent the rejection of an organ transplant or using antiviral medications long-term (to prevent AIDS or liver failure from hepatitis) are at higher risk of E. coli and many other infections because of weakened immune systems.In addition, people who take drugs to reduce stomach acid production are also at increased risk of E. coli infection because hydrochloric acid offers some protection against the bacteria.


Avoid taking anti-diarrheal medication during an E. coli infection because it will slow your digestive system down and prevent your body from getting rid of the toxins.
Avoid taking salicylates, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, because they can increase bleeding from the intestines.

Brush regularly.,
Use a small soft brush.,
Use an interdental brush.,
Floss daily.,
Use a fluoride mouthwash.",How to Clean Your Braces1," If you wear braces it’s essential that you maintain excellent oral hygiene habits. It can be a bit tricky to brush your teeth with braces, but with some practice you will soon get used to it. You should brush for at least two minutes, two or three times a day. With braces it’s advisable to brush after every meal if possible.


Brush with a fluoride toothpaste or with an anti-sensitivity toothpaste that also protects your enamel.
Braces can increase the chances of getting bits of food stuck in your teeth and around your braces.
A quick brush after eating can deal with this.
Try to carry a travel toothbrush with you, but if you get caught out, you can rinse your mouth out with water to dislodge bits of food.
Swoosh the water well in your mouth and then spit it out.;
, When you brush you should use a soft bristle toothbrush, which has a head small enough to enable you to get to all of your teeth. You should be able to use an electric toothbrush, but you will have to take extra care when you do this. Speak to your orthodontist if you’re struggling to clean your teeth with your brace. The orthodontist will be able to recommend special smaller headed toothbrushes that make it easier.Place the brush at a 45 degree angle, where your gums meets your teeth.
Use a vertical, circular scrub motion and remember to clean all the surfaces of your teeth., Your orthodontist may recommend you supplement your regular toothbrush with a special interdental brush. These are essentially mini-toothbrushes, which are designed specifically to get into hard to reach places in your mouth. They are excellent for people with braces, as they can get under the wire and between the wire and the tooth.


You can also use oral irrigators (sometimes called water picks) to help you clean around your braces. Oral irrigators are great for people with braces because they also massage your gums, which can help to prevent gingivitis.
These devices spray out a pressurized stream of water mixed with mouthwash that can dislodge food from around brace wires and bands.
Remember that these devices should be used in addition to, not instead of, brushing and flossing., It is still important to floss every day if you have braces. Floss before you brush your teeth at least once a day. You might find it easier to do this in the evening before you go to bed as you will probably have more time than in the morning. Flossing can be tricky with a brace, but you can do it if you thread the floss carefully.


If you are struggling to floss around your braces you may find that using a “floss threader” helps.
These devices act like the eye of a needle, which you can thread the floss through before pushing it under the wire., You should use an alcohol-free fluoride mouthwash once a day to help you keep your teeth and your braces clean and in a good condition. You will be able to find a suitable mouthwash in your local drug store or pharmacy.


Use the mouthwash at a different time of day to when you brush your teeth to help maintain the fluoride protection of your teeth for longer.
Try to avoid eating or rinsing your mouth for twenty minutes after using the mouthwash."

Recognize the foods that should be avoided.,
Clean off stubborn and sticky things.,
Clean stains from clear braces.",How to Clean Your Braces2," If you are wearing braces, it’s a good idea to get to know the types of foods which can cause you problems. Some foods might damage your braces and others could get stuck and be difficult to clean off. Hard foods may damage your braces by bending the wires and potentially snapping off brackets.


Try to avoid hard foods, such as nuts, hard pretzels, popcorn, chips, hard pizza crust, corn on the cob, apples and carrots that haven’t been chopped up first, and always avoid eating ice.
Sticky foods can also cause problems. Avoid chewy and sticky candies, caramel, chocolate, biscuits, peanut brittle, candy apples and licorice.
Avoid chewing gum as this can also get stuck around the wires and brackets., You should try to avoid sticky and sugary foods, and things that could easily get stuck in your braces, but if you do eat them you will have to spend some time cleaning your braces thoroughly. There is no magic bullet for cleaning things like caramel or gum. You will have to carefully brush, and use any other tools you have. Interdental brushes and floss are the main tools that you should use to supplement brushing.


Carefully clean around the braces to dislodge food that is stuck in your braces.
Don’t get frustrated and be too forceful or you might damage the braces.
If you do eat sticky or sugary foods without thinking, act quickly to clean your braces.
If you don’t thoroughly clean off foods that get stuck around your braces, you could develop cavities and other tooth problems, such as gum problems, gingivitis, and tooth sensitivity., If you have opted for clear braces, such as Invisalign aligners, you will find that they are susceptible to staining just like your teeth are. Keeping your teeth clean is absolutely essential for those with aligners, as any bacteria will be trapped and pressed up against your teeth by the braces. Be sure to brush after every meal and floss at least once a day. If you do find your clear braces have become stained, you can clean them.


You can use a specialist cleansing solution, which you will soak your clear braces in to tackle any stains.
Consider trying an effervescent denture cleaning product.
You can also use cool water and a soft-bristled toothbrush to scrub gently at the braces. For a better antibacterial effect, you can even add some chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash.
Set aside a toothbrush that you will use just for cleaning your braces."

To keep your retainer clean and in good shape get into to the habit of cleaning it quickly every time that you brush your teeth. Don’t forget to take out your retainer before you brush.


Once you have brushed your teeth, clean your retainer with cold water and a toothbrush.You can clean it over the sink, but be careful not to drop it in.

, You should regularly disinfect your retainer with a solution of a special denture cleaner mixed into a cup of warm water. You should use warm water, but never hot water as this could damage your retainer. You can buy retainer or denture cleansers in your local pharmacy or drug store. If you are uncertain ask the pharmacist.


Be sure to follow the instructions on the packet.
Soak your retainer in the solution at least once a week, and preferably once a day.
You can get into the habit of soaking it in the solution when you go to bed.
Be sure you rinse your retainer thoroughly with cool water before putting it back into your mouth., If you have reason to remove your retainer during the day, such as when playing sport, ensure that you store it in the special protective case your orthodontist gave you. Take it out carefully and place it in the box to keep it in good condition. Don’t click it in and out of your mouth with your tongue and teeth, as this could damage it.You should rinse out the box regularly, and disinfect it occasionally.

Know if you are at higher risk.,
People who have contracted Crypto will begin to show symptoms of the parasitic infection in 2-10 days (usually 7 days).,
There are also certain situations that can put people at higher risk.",How to Recognize Symptoms of Cryptosporidiosis (Crypto)," For some people Crypto can be a serious, even fatal infection. The following is a list of those who may be at higher risk:


Those with inherited diseases that affect the immune system
People with AIDS/HIV


Cancer patients
Organ transplant patients
Anyone who is taking immunosuppressive drugs
Infants and young children;
, The following is a list of symptoms to look for:


Watery diarrhea

Take note of nausea and vomiting.,
Be aware of abdominal cramping and diarrhea.,
Look for fever and chills.,
Seek medical care if your fever gets too high.",How to Recognize Salmonella Poisoning (Salmonellosis)1," Salmonella poisoning’s number one symptom is often nausea and vomiting. Because people often contract salmonella poisoning as a result of eating something contaminated with feces, your body’s natural response is to void the contents of your stomach.Although nausea is the most common symptom of salmonella poisoning, there are a number of other ailments that may cause the same symptom.
If you are vomiting, you will need to rehydrate, but avoid drinking water immediately after vomiting. This may promote more vomiting. Wait until you no longer feel nauseous to drink water. Just take small sips of water if you need to or suck on ice chips in the meantime.;
, The next most prominent symptom of salmonella poisoning is abdominal cramping with coinciding diarrhea. Salmonella poisoning has the most significant effect on your bowels, and the repercussions of salmonella poisoning can take longer to subside in your stomach than anywhere else.Like vomiting, diarrhea can dehydrate you. Dehydration can cause other medical issues or limit your body’s ability to recover from salmonella poisoning, so it’s important to stay hydrated.
Having blood in your stool is also a common symptom of salmonella that may present itself in conjunction with diarrhea.

, Salmonella poisoning can cause your body temperature to rise. If you have a fever while experiencing other common symptoms of salmonella, it is likely that you are suffering from salmonella poisoning.There is often a headache that coincides with salmonella poisoning, especially among those with a fever.
Fevers can be worsened by dehydration, as your body’s ability to regulate your temperature is limited when you don’t have enough fluid in your body.

, Most people with salmonella poisoning are able to recover on their own within a reasonable amount of time, but if the symptoms of salmonella become dangerous, it’s important to seek medical attention immediately.


If your fever exceeds 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius), seek immediate medical care.
If you become dehydrated as a result of vomiting or diarrhea, and cannot tolerate taking liquids in, then you may need to be hospitalized to receive IV fluids.

"
"
Make sure to hydrate.,
Take anti-diarrhea medications.,
Take anti-nausea medications.,
Know when to seek medical attention.,
Have your doctor prescribe antibiotics.,
Get plenty of rest.",How to Recognize Salmonella Poisoning (Salmonellosis)2," The most dangerous aspect of salmonella poisoning is its ability to dehydrate your body. Dehydration can cause a number of medical issues, exacerbate your fever, and hinder your body’s ability to combat the illness and get better. In order to avoid further complications related to salmonella, it’s important that you stay hydrated.Drinking plenty of water and other fluids such as Gatorade, fruit punch and flat soda can help you recover from salmonella poisoning faster.
If you are unable to keep fluids down, you may need to be hospitalized to receive IV fluids.

, Your doctor may prescribe you anti-diarrhea medication like loperamide to ease issues with diarrhea and abdominal cramping. This may help you retain hydration levels, as your body will void much of its fluids through diarrhea otherwise.However, keep in mind that taking these medications can sometimes make your diarrhea last longer.For many people, salmonella passes within a few days without the need to be prescribed any anti-diarrhea medication.

, Like anti-diahrreals, medications designed to prevent you from vomiting can help curb the worst symptoms of salmonella poisoning and help you to stay hydrated until your body can recover.Vomiting may be in your best interest in the first day of salmonella poisoning as it allows your body to get rid of any contaminated foods still in your stomach.
These medications will not speed up your recovery, but instead make your condition more manageable while you recover.

, Most people can recover from salmonella without any assistance from a doctor, but those who are very young or very old should seek medical attention early because their immune systems may not be strong enough to fend off the illness alone. Healthy adults may want to see a doctor if they exhibit any of the following symptoms:Your symptoms persist for longer than a few days, you may need antibiotics to combat the bacteria.
You begin to experience eye irritation, painful urination or joint pain.
Your fever reaches 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius).

, In most cases of salmonella poisoning, the patient can recover on their own in a few days, but for patients with severely compromised immune systems, antibiotics may be the only way to fight off the illness. In some patients, antibiotics can actually prolong one’s salmonella poisoning, as well as the time frame in which they can infect others.If the salmonella poisoning enters the bloodstream of an otherwise healthy patient, a doctor may prescribe antibiotics to assist in combating the illness as well.
Studies have demonstrated that because of an increasing resistance to the traditional antibiotics used to treat salmonella, the bacteria are sometimes found in greater numbers in the stool of those prescribed them for longer than those who are not., Like most other illnesses, rest is an important part of recovering from salmonella poisoning. Giving your body plenty of rest will help give your immune system the chance it needs to speed you along to recovery.Get plenty of sleep, and try to relax while awake during your recovery from salmonella poisoning.
Sleep deficiency has been proven to limit a body’s ability to defend against bacterial or viral infections.

"
"
Cook your foods thoroughly.,
Wash your hands regularly.,
Keep your foods separate during preparation.,
Avoid unpasteurized dairy products.,
Be aware of food recalls.,
Protect others from infection.",How to Recognize Salmonella Poisoning (Salmonellosis)3," Most people contract salmonella poisoning from eating poultry, hamburger meat, or eggs that were not cooked sufficiently to kill all of the bacteria present. Food products produced by animals could be infected with salmonella by coming into contact with feces or the bacteria from it. Cooking your foods completely will kill that bacteria.Be wary of foods that may contain raw eggs such as homemade salad dressings, cookie dough or ice creams.
Make sure the meats you eat are cooked thoroughly and have no pink coloration.

, Washing your hands regularly can prevent you from transferring salmonella causing bacteria from dirty surfaces to your mouth or food that you are preparing. Make sure to wash your hands after you use the bathroom or handle raw food in particular.Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly regularly throughout your day.
Always wash your hands after using the bathroom, cleaning up pet feces, or coming into contact with birds or lizards to limit your chances of contracting salmonella poisoning.

, If food that is already cooked or does not require cooking comes into contact with food that has not been cooked yet, you run the risk of cross contaminating salmonella bacteria onto the ready-to-eat foods. Avoid this by keeping food separate until you eat.Do not place cooked foods back on to plates that once held raw foods.
Do not use the same utensils while handling already cooked foods and raw foods.

, Pasteurizing dairy products like milk and cheese eliminate much of the bacteria that can cause salmonella. Drinking or eating products that were not put through the pasteurization process increases your risk of contracting the illness.Unpasteurized milk offers a level of risk very similar to that of eating raw meat.

, Occasionally food is recalled because of its exposure to dangerous viruses or bacteria. Keeping apprised when food gets recalled can help you ensure you don’t accidentally eat something that is known to be contaminated with a virus or bacteria like the one that causes salmonella.You can find a comprehensive list of food recalls by the FDA here: http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/

Most companies also publish press releases on their websites if they need to recall some of their products. You can check with specific companies if you’re concerned about food you don’t find on the FDA’s list.

, Salmonella infection is caused by exposure to the bacteria that causes it. If you have salmonella, you can help to ensure you don’t spread it to others by following a few simple guidelines:Wash your hands regularly and especially after using the bathroom..
Do not handle the food of others while infected with salmonella.
Do not share glasses or utensils with others while infected with salmonella.
Cover your mouth when you sneeze or cough.

"
Drink plenty of fluids.,
Get plenty of rest.,
Apply heat to reduce the pain.,
Use analgesic medications.,
Consult with your doctor about antibiotics.,
Avoid excess vitamin C. Vitamin C is generally helpful to the human body; particularly when it comes to the healing of wounds and bone formation.,
Drink cranberry juice regularly.",How to Relieve Kidney Pain1," This is single most important thing to relieve kidney pain. You should drink between two to three liters of water per day when healthy, but you may need more to help you pass kidney stones.Water helps wash away bacteria and dead tissues from the kidney. Stagnant urine is an excellent medium for bacterial growth. By drinking plenty of water, you can create a continuous flow of water through the kidney which prevents bacteria from growing and multiplying.A small kidney stone (<4mm) may also be passed spontaneously with urine if the flow is adequate.
Limit your intake of coffee, tea, and cola to one to two cups per day.;
, Sometimes bed rest can be helpful in reducing pain.If your pain is caused by a kidney stone or kidney injury, excessive movement or exercise could cause your kidney to bleed.Lying on your side could aggravate your kidney pain., A hot pad or warm cloth may be applied to the site of pain for temporary relief. Heat improves blood flow and reduces nerve sensation, both of which reduce pain. Heat may be particularly helpful if your pain is caused by a muscle spasm.Do not apply too much heat, as this could cause burns. Use a heating pad, soak in a hot bath, or use a cloth that’s been soaked in hot (but not boiling) water.

, There are some over-the-counter painkillers that can fight kidney pain. Acetaminophen/paracetamol is commonly recommended for pain caused by infections and kidney stones.Consult with your doctor before taking any pain medication, as some can increase kidney problems or interact with other medical conditions.Do not take high-dose aspirin. Aspirin can increase the risk of bleeding and can worsen any vascular obstruction, like a kidney stone.
NSAIDs can be dangerous if you have decreased kidney function. Do not take ibuprofen or naproxen if you already have a kidney condition, unless it's recommended by your doctor., Antibiotics should be used if you have any kind of urinary tract infection. Kidney stones can cause stagnant urine to get backed up in the kidney, which in turn causes bacterial growth and may lead to an infection. If this is the case, your doctor will prescribe you with an antibiotic.Common antibiotics used in this type of infection are Trimethoprim, Nitrofurantoin, Ciprofloxacin, and Cefalexin. In mild to moderate infection, men should be treated for 10 days while women should be treated for three days.
Always take the full course of antibiotics prescribed to you, even if you begin to feel better and your symptoms disappear.

, However, excess vitamin C gets converted to oxalate in the kidney. This oxalate can then turn into a stone, so avoid getting excess vitamin C if you are prone to developing kidney stones, or have a history of stones in your family.People who are prone to developing calcium oxalate stones should limit their consumption of oxalate rich foods such as beets, chocolate, coffee, cola, nuts, parsley, peanuts, rhubarb, spinach, strawberries, tea, and wheat bran., Cranberry juice is an amazing natural remedy for kidney and urinary tract infections. It starts to act within eight hours of consumption by preventing bacteria from increasing and colonizing. It also helps to dissolve struvite and brushite kidney stones.Avoid cranberry juice if you have an oxalate stone, as it contains significant amounts of vitamin C and is high in oxalates.

See a doctor if you think you may have kidney infection or pyelonephritis.,
Talk to a doctor if you think you have kidney stones.,
Go to the emergency room if you think your kidney may be bleeding.",How to Relieve Kidney Pain2," Kidney infection begins as a urinary tract infection and progresses to your kidneys. It can cause permanent damage to the kidneys if it’s not treated promptly.One or both kidneys may be infected, causing a deep, dull pain in the abdomen, back, side, or groin. If you have the following symptoms, seek medical attention as soon as possible:Fever, possibly with chills
Frequent urination
A strong and persistent urge to urinate
Burning or pain while urinating
Pus or blood in the urine (may be red or brownish)
Foul-smelling or cloudy urine
Seek emergency medical attention if you have these symptoms combined with nausea and vomiting, Kidney stones are one of the main causes of kidney pain. The pain starts when the kidney tries to get rid of the stone and has a problem doing so. This sort of pain generally comes in waves.Kidney stones often manifest in sudden, extreme pain in the lower back, side, groin, or abdomen.Kidney stones may also cause other symptoms, including pain in the penis or testicles, difficulty urinating, or a frequent, urgent need to urinate., The bleeding could be caused by trauma, disease, or drugs. Some bleeding disorders may lead to blood clot formation in the kidney. When the clot impairs blood supply to any part of the kidney, pain starts. This sort of pain also comes in waves but is generally felt in the flank. The flank is located between the upper belly area and the back.Other symptoms of kidney injury include:Abdominal pain or swelling
Blood in the urine
Drowsiness or sleepiness
Fever
Decreased urination or difficulty urinating
Increased heart rate
Nausea and vomiting
Sweating
Cool, clammy skin

Make a note of increased upset stomach.,
Check if you have a loss of appetite.,
Feel if you have any abdominal pain.,
Be aware of any itches around the anal region.,
Determine if you have intense headaches.,
Pay attention to loss of sleep.",How to Recognize Dwarf Tapeworm Infection1," These could be signs of the infection or other problems, but they are a potential warning.Increased occurrences of nausea and/or diarrhea could be symptoms of dwarf tapeworm infection.
You may also experience abdominal pain along with the upset stomach.
The severity of your symptoms could vary greatly.
Duration of these symptoms could be from a few days to intermittently over years.;
, This too can be a sign of the tapeworm infection or other problems.As this is not as an immediate symptom as nausea or diarrhea, you may want to take a few days to make sure this is occurring. Weight loss is rarely an occurrence with dwarf tapeworm infection.See if you are turning away even your favorite foods.
There is a risk of vitamin deficiency and body chemistry imbalance with this, so consult your doctor if it persists.

, While you cannot feel the worm inside you, the subsequent infection can induce pain..


If the pain is intense, see a doctor immediately in case it is a symptom of something else.
This pain could vary in intensity from and duration from immediately of a few days to on and off for years depending on the persistence of infection. If you can identify the pain as acute (sharp and intense) and/or chronic (frequent occurrence)--this may help your doctor's diagnosis.The pain's location may not situate itself in any one location in the abdominal area.
Similar to the other conditions, it could be a symptom of the tapeworm infection, or other problems.

, This could be a sign of localized infection and irritation and it is most common in young children.The irritation could also vary in intensity and duration depending on the timeline of the infection.
A rash or physical blemish is not typically associated with this irritation, though you may risk inflicting such harm if you scratch too much.

, This could be a sign of a more severe infection and this symptom is also seen in young children more often.If you feel the headache in conjunction with the other symptoms, this too could be signs of other illness--but the tapeworm infection remains a possibility.
The headache's intensity and duration may vary greatly depending on the persistence of the infection.
There are ways to classify your pain level, if it's sharp and severe (acute) or frequent (chronic). This can be useful to your doctor for diagnosis., Problems sleeping can be signs of a more severe infection..


Similar to loss of appetite, you should see if this pattern holds up over a few days to determine if it's an actual symptom of your problem.
Sleep loss caused by an associated problem is called ""secondary insomnia"" (as opposed to ordinary sleep loss or ""primary insomnia"").
As with pain problems, this can be acute (brief intense bouts) and/or chronic (frequently occurring). Let your doctor know how you are being affected.
Besides waking up at night, you might experience sleepiness during the day, fatigue (tiredness), irritability (bad mood), and problems concentrating/memory.
Any repeated disruption to your normal sleeping period can be a symptom of insomnia, but determining the cause may be up to your doctor and you.

Identify locations the dwarf tapeworms may have placed eggs.,
Ask if others have been infected around you.,
Examine the possibility of secondary hosts.,
Determine if local soil has been exposed.,
Examine potentially exposed water supplies.",How to Recognize Dwarf Tapeworm Infection2," Finding places where exposure could have happened can help with diagnosis, and prevent further contamination.These eggs are frequently passed through accidental ingestion.
Fecal contamination is a possibility especially in poor sanitary/hygiene areas.
You may not be able to visibly spot the eggs. While the worms can grow up to a couple of inches in length, the eggs will need medical instrumentation to detect., You may have come in contact with the same substances they have.See what they ate, drank, or touched of an organic nature that may have been a carrier for the eggs.

, See if another animal or insect have been exposed and carried the infection into local consumables.Sometimes these other animals and insects will eat the eggs and then contaminate the food, water, and/or soil supply indirectly. The infection can spread by one consuming the intermediate host. The intermediate host may not show any obvious signs of infection.
Contact an entomologist (expert on insects) either locally or if one can be reached at a nearby university for assistance on identifying infected insects in the area. Consult local environmental reports to see if any infections are reported.
Ask your local forestry, or game and wildlife service to see if any animals in the area have been infected with tapeworms.

, If you do any yard or farm work, this is especially important.Accidentally ingesting some contaminated soil by putting your fingers to your mouth can lead to infection.
Fecal contamination is a risk as the reproducing worm and eggs can pass through the bowels.
Ask government agencies for reports on potential contamination. Get independent verification if possible.
See if there are any environmental groups that work in the area and have contaminant information. Also independently verify their data if possible.

, This is of even greater concern in poor sanitation/hygiene areas.As with the food supply and soil, this is an at risk area for exposure to the eggs and fecal contamination from intermediate hosts.
Ask to see if others have been infected from a particular water supply.
File requests with the local government to get reports on the environmental health of the water supply. Independently verify the data with other sources if possible.
Check with local environmental groups to see if they have been monitoring contamination of water supplies. But independently verify the data.

"
"
Go to a doctor to confirm if you have a dwarf tapeworm infection.,
Take the prescribed treatment.,
Know the prognosis of dwarf tapeworm infections.,
Learn how to prevent infection while you are infected.,
Maintain prevention of infection.",How to Recognize Dwarf Tapeworm Infection3," A fecal examination is the usual way this diagnosis is made.Diagnosis is made by identifying the eggs in the fecal stool.
Your doctor will ask you to submit specimens collected over several days confirm if you are infected or not.

, Usually the drug praziquantel is given for dwarf tapeworm infections.Praziquantel dissolves the dwarf tapeworm within the intestine.
Praziquantel is usually well tolerated. Sometimes more than one treatment is necessary--up to ten days.Follow your doctor's instructions when taking praziquantel. But usually it is taken by mouth, with food, three or four times a day (four to six hours apart).
You should take the medicine with a full glass of water.
Do NOT chew or suck the medicine tablets.
You should avoid consuming grapefruits or grapefruit products while taking praziquantel.
Contact your doctor immediately if your condition persists or worsens.
Sometimes Niclosamide or nitazoxanide are given as alternative medicines. Follow your doctor's instructions when taking any of these medicines., This disease is relatively minor if treated on time.Most patients fully recover with treatment.
More severe symptoms can result from prolonged infections, so treatment should be sought immediately.

, You do not want to spread the infectious eggs while you are receiving treatment.If you have multiple bathrooms at home, consider using one while your family/guests use the other.
Disinfect any bathroom equipment you use thoroughly after every use. Standard antibacterial sprays and soaps should be sufficient, but ask your doctor if they recommend something else.
Consider leaving food preparation to others until your doctor certifies you as clear of the infection.
Have an independent/portable food and water supply if you are traveling.

, Improving hygiene and sanitation not only can help prevent spreading the infection from a contaminated person, but prevent infection in the first place in the future.Wash your hands with soap and warm water. Do this after any task involving potential contaminants--especially after using the toilet, diaper changes, and during food preparation.
Be particularly mindful of educating children in your area about cleanliness around potential contaminants--especially with their higher risk for dwarf tapeworm infection.
If you are in a situation where food may be contaminated, you should wash, peel and/or cook all raw vegetables and fruits with safe/tested water before eating.

"
"
Stay close to bathrooms.,
Always wash your hands.,
Rest as much as possible.,
Keep well hydrated.,
Eat small bland meals.,
Try taking herbs that kill parasites.,
Confirm a diagnosis.,
Get treated for dehydration.,
Ask your doctor about antibiotics.,
Use anti-diarrheal medication cautiously.",How to Treat Giardiasis," The main symptoms of giardiasis are abdominal cramps and bloating, flatulence (gas) and watery foul-smelling diarrhea that may alternate with soft, greasy stools.As such, you shouldn't get too far from a bathroom because you'll need one frequently throughout the day for at least 2 weeks and maybe as long as 6 weeks while your body combats the infection.


The bloating and cramps may make it difficult to walk, so don't plan on any hikes or being too active until you're back to full health.
Consider postponing any holidays if you get giardiasis because you'll likely be too uncomfortable to enjoy the trip.
If you're out of your house shopping or doing errands, always carry some wet wipes in case you have to use a toilet that doesn't have any toilet paper.;
, The Giardia parasite survives outside the body within feces (poop) as spores. These hard spores can live almost anywhere for long periods of time until they get ingested via contaminated water, food or from someone's unwashed hands. The spores then hatch in your stomach or small intestine and cause infection. Washing your hands after going to the bathroom will prevent you from getting re-infected and infecting your friends and family.Be especially careful washing your hands after changing diapers or picking up pet feces.
Always make a habit of washing your hands with soap and water before eating or preparing food.

, While sick with the symptoms of giardiasis, resting is important because it'll allow your immune system more energy to fight off the infection.You'll likely be very tired due to the nausea, diarrhea and lack of appetite (which severely limits your eating), so taking some naps during the day shouldn't be difficult to do. Your immune system tends to kick it into ""high gear"" when you sleep.


Some walking and light housework is fine, but take a break from the gym and other vigorous physical activities until you feel much better and stronger.

, Since a primary symptom of giardiasis is moderate-to-severe diarrhea, dehydration from fluid loss is always a concern. As such, replenishing your fluids throughout the day is important, so aim for at least 64 ounces of purified water (eight 8-ounce glasses). If you're very nauseous and having trouble keeping liquids down, try taking small sips of water or sucking on ice chips.In addition to water, drinking some fresh fruit / veggie juice is important to replenish your electrolytes (mineral salts), which are lost with diarrhea and vomiting. You can add a pinch of salt and half a teaspoon of honey or one teaspoon of sugar to an eight ounce glass of fruit juice. This will make your fluid replacement even easier to tolerate.
Avoid fizzy drinks and anything with alcohol or caffeine until you're feeling healthy.
Symptoms of dehydration include: dry mouth, thirst, tiredness, headache, dizziness, reduced urination and increased heartbeat.Children with diarrhea are more susceptible to dehydration than adults are.
Hydration is a really important part of managing mild diarrhea. If you can't intake all the hydration you need orally, you may need an IV to help replenish your fluids. If you think that you may need an IV, talk to your doctor as soon as possible.

, You need energy to fight off the parasitic infection and to be able to go about your day, but the nausea and abdominal cramps from giardiasis can greatly diminish your appetite. As such, ease back into eating with small meals (or snacks) spaced throughout the day. Eat bland, low-fat and easy to digest foods, such as crackers, toast, soup broth, bananas and rice.Don't eat during waves of nausea.


Until you're feeling better, avoid fried foods, fatty and overly spicy foods. Avoid dairy products because you may have some degree of lactose intolerance that aggravates intestinal symptoms caused by giardiasis.
Don't eat too much fresh fruit or veggies (especially cauliflower, onions and cabbage), because it can lead to even more gas, bloating and abdominal cramping.
Snack on foods that can help your body get rid of parasites, such as pumpkin seeds, pomegranates, papaya, beets and carrots., There are a number of herbs that have anti-parasitic properties, which means they can inhibit the spread of parasites in your body or actually kill them outright. Effective examples include barberry, goldenseal, Oregon grape, anise seed, wormwood, curled mint and black walnuts.These anti-parasitic herbs are usually taken as tinctures under the tongue or diluted in some water. Taking them in capsules or using them to make herbal teas can work too.


Other herbs sometimes used to kill parasites include grapefruit seed extract, fresh cloves, olive leaf extract and garlic.
Some herbs used to treat intestinal parasites can interfere with certain medications, so use them only under the supervision of a qualified practitioner.

, If the above-mentioned symptoms linger for more than a few weeks or get worse, then call your doctor or head to a walk-in clinic. While in a clinic or hospital, your doctor can confirm a diagnosis of giardiasis by taking a stool sample and looking under a microscope for parasitic spores.A stool antigen test and trichrome staining techniques are also available to diagnose Giardia.


As a rule, it takes 3 different stool samples to diagnose 90% of Giardia cases. Lab technicians look for a high concentration of either spores or trophozoites.
Staining might not be sufficient to identify Giardia because variable concentration levels can make people sick — some people are more sensitive to the parasite than others.

, If your diarrhea is severe and you're unable to replenish your fluids at home, you may need to get treated at a clinic or hospital for dehydration. As such, if dehydration symptoms appear (see above), call your doctor and ask for advice on where to go. The best way to replace water and electrolytes (such as sodium, potassium and calcium) is intravenously, which requires a needle to be inserted into a vein in your arm.While you're on intravenous, you can also be given glucose and various essential vitamins, which can give you more energy and reduce your mental fog.
An intravenous session typically lasts a few hours, although you may need to stay overnight(s) if your dehydration and/or malnourishment is severe.
You may be given some oral rehydration solution to take home — they typically contain electrolytes and glucose dissolved in water.

, Some antibiotics are effective for also killing parasites, so ask your doctor about getting prescribed one if your giardiasis lasts for much more than 2 weeks. Commonly prescribed antibiotics for giardiasis include metronidazole, tinidazole and nitazoxanide.Furazolidone and quinacrine are also effective for treating giardiasis, but no longer available in the U.S.The most common antibiotic used to combat giardiasis is metronidazole (Flagyl) — it has an efficacy rate of between 75-100%, but it often causes nausea and a metallic taste as side effects.Tinidazole (Tindamax) may work even better than metronidazole for giardiasis and it can be given in a single dose, but it also causes some side effects.
Nitazoxanide (Alinia) comes as a liquid and may be easier for children to swallow and tolerate.
Paromomycin and albendazole are less effective medications for giardiasis, but still sometimes used.

, If your diarrhea persists for more than a few weeks, it's tempting to put a stop to it with medication, but your doctor may advise against it. Sometimes anti-diarrheal medicines can prolong the infection and make your condition worse because your body is prevented from getting rid of the parasite that's causing the diarrhea.Talk to your doctor about the pros and cons.


Over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medicines include loperamide (Imodium) and bismuth subsalicylate (Kaopectate, Pepto-Bismol). Bismuth subsalicylate can also be used to treat nausea and vomiting.
A stronger prescription anti-diarrheal is called Lomotil, although it must be taken as soon as you start experiencing diarrhea.

Understand what common symptoms mean.,
Notice abdominal pain.Abdominal pain describes a range of symptoms which can be either intense and acute, intermittent, or dull in severity.,
Check your bowel movements.,
Watch for a fever.,
Monitor your energy levels.,
Look for dark or discolored urine.If your urine is abnormally dark — the color of cola or tea — you should consult a doctor immediately.Even if you don’t have Hepatitis B, dark urine is a sign that something is wrong.

,
Be aware of mental disturbances.If you find yourself getting confused or suffering hallucinations, you might have a more severe form of Hepatitis B.,
Watch for a swollen stomach.Your stomach might jut out and take on an enlarged shape even when you haven’t changed or diet or gained significant weight.,
Pay attention to nausea.If you feel as if you might vomit, or actually vomit, you may have Hepatitis B.,
Look for jaundice.Jaundice is the discoloration of your skin and eyes.,
Notice if you are dehydrated.As a result of diarrhea or vomiting, you may become dehydrated.,
Pay attention to a loss of appetite.If you no longer feel as hungry as you used to, you might have Hepatitis B.,
Look for irritability.When you’re in constant pain due to abdominal swelling or tenderness and feel badly fatigued all the time, you’ll probably become irritable.,
Confirm a diagnosis with your doctor.,
Stay hydrated.Drink plenty of water to replenish water lost through vomiting or diarrhea.,
Avoid smoking and drinking alcohol.Both smoking and drinking alcohol can put excess workload on the liver.,
Eat a healthy diet.,
Don’t take acetaminophen.",How to Recognize Hepatitis B Symptoms," Common symptoms typically occur one to four months after Hepatitis B infection. In addition, keep in mind that having just one common symptom, such as fatigue or a fever, does not indicate you have Hepatitis B. If, however, you believe you may have been exposed to Hepatitis B and you are displaying common signs and symptoms of the disease, you should talk to your doctor about getting tested.If you think you were exposed to Hepatitis B within the past 24 hours, a preventative treatment may reduce your risk of infection.
If you believe you were exposed to Hepatitis B but do not have symptoms, you should still talk to your doctor, as those with chronic Hepatitis Be remain symptomless for as long as 20 or 30 years.;
, You may feel as if your guts are burning, cramped, swollen.The abdominal pain will often be in the epigastric area, or right upper quadrant of the abdomen.

, Excessive or unusually-colored stool can indicate Hepatitis B. If you have diarrhea and/or clay-colored stool, contact your physician.It might not be Hepatitis B, but it should be cause for concern nonetheless.

, Technically, a fever is any body temperature above the normal 98.6°F (37°C). Usually, however, doctors will not diagnose someone as having a fever until their body temperature is above 100.4°F (38°C).Take your temperature with a thermometer to determine if you have a fever.

, Fatigue is a very common symptom of Hepatitis B.Fatigue is a long-term feeling of weariness or tiredness. Normally, you can dispel fatigue by getting a full night’s sleepor eating more healthily. If you have Hepatitis B, however, your fatigue will last many weeks or months and you will be unable to shake it.

,, Contact a doctor immediately if you’re experiencing mental disturbances.

, You might also notice a star-shaped pattern of veins across your swollen belly.Contact your physician immediately if you notice your belly has swollen.

, Since Hepatitis B symptoms last for weeks to months, you’ll know it isn’t the flu when nausea has lasted more than a week or so., Both or either may turn yellow. This is due to the inability of the liver to process old red blood cells.While healthy babies might have jaundice for a few weeks immediately following their birth, in adults jaundice is a possible symptom of Hepatitis B.

, An inability to urinate or a constant thirsty feeling could indicate your are dehydrated. Try to drink as much water as possible to combat dehydration.

, The loss of appetite could be a result of abdominal pain, but it might be independent of it, too. Monitor your eating habits and your weight closely in order to determine whether you’re eating less than before and, as a result, losing weight.

, You may have less patience with friends or loved ones and become easily frustrated by situations which, before the onset of the primary Hepatitis B symptoms, caused you no stress. Listen to your friends and family to determine if you’re becoming irritable, and monitor your own behavior if you think your demeanor is changing.

, If you think you have Hepatitis B, you should see your doctor for testing. Acute Hepatitis B cannot be treated with medication. If you have Hepatitis B, however, you and your doctor can come up with a plan to treat and minimize symptoms. Though not appropriate for everyone, the following medications may be used to treat Hepatitis B: entecavir, interferons, and lamivudine.

, Fruit juice, iced tea, and sports drinks are also good for replenishing your body’s water content. Soups and smoothies are good options during meal times.


Daily fluid intake (including fluids found in foods and all beverages, not just water) for women should be 11 8-oz glasses (2.7 liters) and 15 cups (3.7 liters) for men.

, If you have chronic Hepatitis B, avoid both for the rest of your life. If you have acute Hepatitis B, avoid both until you've been cured of the infection.

, Eat a satisfying breakfast, but don’t eat too much. Make fruits and whole grains the foundation of your healthy breakfast. Later in the day, eat light meals consisting primarily of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and small portions of lean protein. Avoid processed foods heavy in salt, sugar, and fat.Integrating ginger into your diet can relieve nausea.

, Tylenol and other pain medications use acetaminophen as an active ingredient. Unfortunately, this can exacerbate your liver’s already compromised state. Ask your doctor for alternatives to traditional pain relievers."

Avoid foods that bother you, if you're sensitive to gluten.",How to Test for Gluten Intolerance," Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and other grains. Gluten gives bread dough its elastic ""doughy"" quality. Many commercial foods contain gluten. There is gluten in all wheat bread and other wheat-based products. That includes things like certain processed meats, condiments, soups, beer, and even make-up.Some people have difficulty processing gluten, which can cause the small intestine to become inflamed over time. This can lead to a variety of problems including malabsorption and chronic diarrhea or pain.Most gluten absorption problems are quickly healed by adopting a gluten-free diet.;
, Celiac disease is a potentially serious auto-immune disease that affects the small intestine's ability to process gluten. Your doctor can test you for Celiac. But not everyone who is sensitive to gluten will test positive for Celiac disease, despite having similar symptoms and responding well to a gluten-free diet. This is why it's important to visit a doctor and secure a diagnosis.


Non-celiac gluten sensitivity is characterized by symptoms similar to Celiac disease, but without the intestinal damage associated with Celiac. Sometimes, a gluten sensitivity can come and go, so your symptoms may alleviate over time. Most people with gluten sensitivities respond immediately to a gluten-free diet. There is no test way to test for non-Celiac gluten sensitivity.
""Wheat allergies"" are potentially very serious and are typically diagnosed in childhood. Wheat allergies require a different set of tests, which your doctor can perform. If you have a wheat allergy, you need to avoid wheat products and food that was processed around wheat.

, Gluten intolerance affects your digestive system. The most common symptoms of gluten intolerance are abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation, and bloating. These symptoms can also be signs of many other afflictions. The symptoms can be vague, and some people have no symptoms. Common symptoms of gluten problems include:


Abdominal bloating
Abdominal pain
Persistent diarrhea or constipation
Vomiting
Pale, foul-smelling, fatty stools
Weight loss
Fatigue
Irritability
Failure to thrive in children
ADHD
Persistent rash on the elbows and knees

, Celiac disease runs in families. If you have a direct relative who has Celiac, you're much more likely to have or to develop a sensitivity sometime in the future. It's important to get tested promptly, if your relative has Celiac., If you've been having digestive problems, it's a good idea to start keeping a food diary. Write down everything that you eat each day, including the amount of the food and the time that you eat it. If you start experiencing pain, or other symptoms of celiac, write them down in your journal as well. This can be helpful at the doctor.

, Gluten must be present to diagnose you with Celiac disease. If you start going gluten-free now, it will make it very difficult to get a diagnosis. This can be a frustrating and confusing experience. Keep eating normally and schedule an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible.


If you're diagnosed, most people report that their symptoms are alleviated in only a few days after starting a gluten-free diet. Eat however makes you feel good, but make sure that you know gluten needs to be present to confirm Celiac disease.

, If you suspect you may have a sensitivity to gluten, bring up your concerns with your doctor. Receive a physical examination to check for signs of swelling and other physical problems. You'll also probably do a complete metabolic panel to check your blood count and organ function.


Bring in your food diary, and be as detailed as possible. Be clear. If you're worried about gluten, say, ""I'm concerned that I may have a gluten problem and I'd like to be tested for it."" Don't leave it up to your doctor to guess.

, If your GP can't find anything to account for your symptoms, you will be referred to a specialist for treatment and further testing. Abdominal problems are usually quite complicated, and the symptoms can be indicative of lots of different things, so it's important to consult a specialist for more specific testing.


Why not go straight to the gastro specialist? It's important to get a once-over from your regular doctor to rule out other possible concerns and receive guidance in this matter. The symptoms of gluten intolerance can be any number of different things, some serious and some not. Eliminate these possibilities first.

, Most doctors and experts recommend a TG test as the most reliable blood test for Celiac, which should be the first step in testing. Some doctors may also order a more comprehensive panel to check for your overall organ function and health, which may suggest a variety of things. The process is as easy as giving blood, and should only take 10-15 minutes. Most insurance plans cover this test in whole or part., A sample of tissue from the walls of the small intestine is the most accurate way to diagnose Celiac disease. This is a relatively simple procedure that takes less than 20 or 30 minutes in most cases. After being sedated, an endoscope is introduced into the small intestine from the mouth. A small tissue sample is taken to see if the villi have been destroyed by an allergic immune response. If so, this is a strong indicator of Celiac, along with the presence of antibodies.Endoscopes are very common and very safe. It's also an excellent way to check for other issues that may account for your symptoms, including gastritis, ulcers, or other stomach problems.

, Your blood-work and biopsy should yield information that will result in a positive or negative diagnosis for Celiac disease. If you tested positive, you need to adopt a gluten-free diet immediately. If you tested negative, talk to your doctor about other possibilities and whether or not you might be non-Celiac gluten sensitive.Do not attempt to ""test"" yourself. Lots of people read an article about gluten intolerance and decide they've got it without consulting a doctor. Celiac disease is a serious auto-immune problem, and requires a clinical diagnosis. If you start avoiding gluten actively, it can make it much more difficult to receive that diagnosis.
If you tested negative for Celiac, fight for some diagnosis. If you're still experiencing symptoms, talk to your doctor about other testing options and other causes that could result in your symptoms. Get a second opinion if necessary.

, If you have Celiac disease, the only way to heal your small intestine is to avoid products that contain gluten entirely. Most patients report that immediately eliminating gluten from their diet achieves results in a few weeks, with some responding as quickly as a few days after going gluten-free.In the short term, it's often best to avoid lactose and dairy for a while. If your small intestine has been worn down, you'll have difficulty processing this as well. In most cases, you can gradually introduce dairy back into your diet.
Fortunately, it's easier than ever to find a variety of nutritious and tasty gluten-free meal options, products, and restaurants in most places.

, If you have Celiac disease, it's important to schedule regular follow-ups with your doctor to make sure that you're responding well to your lifestyle changes. Keep track of any changes in your symptoms and make sure that you visit with your doctor regularly to stay on top of your disease.


Your doctor may recommend that your follow-up with a nutritionist as well, to make sure that you're supplementing you diet with enough vitamins and minerals to keep your healthy during your transition.

, If you've had Celiac disease for a long time, you might have developed some vitamin and mineral deficiencies, making it important to supplement your diet. Consult your doctor or a nutritionist and receive regular follow-ups to check your blood count.


Iron, folate, and B12 are common supplements recommended for the gluten intolerant. In most cases, a multivitamin is sufficient.

, If you test negative for Celiac, but still seem to have difficulty processing gluten, avoid the foods that bother you. Different people will struggle with different kinds of foods, so try keeping your food diary regularly and cutting the things that make you sensitive.


Try an experiment: If you have a down day, check out what you ate recently and try avoiding those foods for the next couple of days to see if you get better. Then try them again. Do your symptoms return? If so, it may be best to avoid those foods going forward.
Try avoiding processed and bleached wheat flour, which is a common complaint among the gluten sensitive.

Look for aloe vera in liquid form.,
Check that the product is herbicide and pesticide free.,
Look for a seal of approval from an independent testing organization.,
Note if the label says “flash pasteurization.” During the processing of aloe vera, it is exposed to heat to keep it sterile.,
Take two ounces of aloe vera juice before you eat.,
Be aware of the possible side effects of aloe vera.,
Make lifestyle changes while you take aloe vera.,
Take over-the-counter medications if your condition does not improve.",How to Use Aloe Vera to Treat Acid Reflux," Aloe vera in liquid form, as a gel or juice, is considered safe to consume orally. The leaf part of the aloe vera is a laxative and is not recommended for daily consumption.Aloe vera gel is known to taste more bitter than aloe vera juice. The gel comes from the inner part of the aloe leaf and the juice comes from the outer portions of the leaf.;
, When you are shopping for liquid aloe vera, you should check that the product is labeled free of herbicides and pesticides. This is an important label as you are going to be consuming the aloe vera and you do not want to ingest any toxic byproducts.You should also look for aloe vera juice and gel that is labeled 99% aloe.

, Like many supplements and natural products, aloe vera products are not regulated by the Federal Drug Administration. But reputable producers will advertise any independent testing that has been done on the product to ensure it is effective.Look for a seal of approval from the Natural Products Association (NPA), NSF International or the US Pharmacopeia (USP).

, However, you should go for an aloe vera gel or juice that has been through “flash pasteurization.” This means it has been processed with the least amount of heat for the shortest period of time.


When aloe vera is exposed to heat for a prolonged period of time, it can start to lose some of its vitamins and minerals. “Flash pasteurization” ensures the aloe vera is sterile but still contains many of its natural medicinal properties., Though dosage will vary depending on the manufacturer of the aloe vera product, you can start by taking two fluid ounces of aloe vera juice three to four times a day. Take the juice twenty minutes before you eat.


If you are taking aloe vera gel, you can take two fluid ounces of gel two to three times a day, before meals. The taste of aloe vera can be strong so you can dilute the aloe vera gel or juice in a glass of water or herbal tea.
Though aloe vera gel capsules have not be studied specifically for the treatment of acid reflux, you can follow the manufacturer’s instructions. In general, you can take one to two soft gel capsules, two to three times a day, before meals.
Always follow the dosage specified by the manufacturer on the label, as dosage can vary from product to product. Do not take more than the recommended dosage as aloe vera can be toxic in high doses., Aloe vera is considered safe to consume in gel or juice form, but there are negative side effects associated with this plant. You should be aware of the side effects before you take aloe vera for acid reflux.You may experience loose stools and diarrhea, though the laxative effect often occurs when you eat the aloe leaf. Aloe vera juice can also lead to lower blood sugar levels, as well as stomach pain and stomach cramps.Aloe vera can sometimes also cause rashes and skin irritation.
If you are pregnant and/or breastfeeding, you should talk to your doctor before taking aloe vera.

, Combining aloe vera juice or gel with lifestyle changes can make a significant impact on your acid reflux. You should consider adjusting your lifestyle if it seems to be causing your acid reflux.You may make changes like quitting smoking and taking up exercise to reduce your weight.
You may also adjust your eating habits to reduce the symptoms of acid reflux and to avoid irritating your acid reflux. For example, you may eat smaller portions for each meal to put less stress on your stomach and avoid eating two to three hours before bed so you do not lie down with food in your stomach. You may also eat more slowly so your stomach can digest your food easily and quickly.
You should also wear clothing that does not constrict your abdomen or stomach, as this can irritate your stomach and lead to acid reflux.

, If you do not see an improvement in your acid reflux symptoms after two weeks of taking aloe vera gel or juice and making lifestyle adjustments, you may want to take OTC medication for acid reflux. You can take antacids to help neutralize the acid and they often improve your symptoms within two weeks. Follow the dosage instructions on the label.You can also take H2 blockers, which help to decrease your stomach’s secretion of acid. You can get low doses of H2 blockers over the counter at your local pharmacy or drugstore. Note that H2 blockers have several side effects, including constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, hives, and nausea or vomiting.
If your condition does not improve after you take OTC medications for two to three weeks, you should see your doctor. You may need stronger prescription medication or you may have another medical issue that is causing your acid reflux.

If you run only a few inches of water in a bathtub, add 2 to 3 tablespoons. Make sure the water is not too hot or it could make your hemorrhoid more painful. Soak in the bath for 10 to 15 minutes a few times a day.You can also use a sitz bath, a small tub that you place over the toilet so you can soak only your bottom.
This might be a good chance for you to relax while someone else takes care of the new baby. Or, use the time to nurse the baby.;
, Get a clean, cotton wash cloth and soak it in warm (not hot) water. Apply the compress directly to your hemorrhoid for about 10 to 15 minutes 3 times a day.


You can also try using ice packs to reduce the swelling but only use them for 5 to 10 minutes and make sure not to apply the pack directly to your skin. This can cause tissue damage.Try alternating a warm compress with cold packs.

, Apply aloe vera gel or an ointment that has phenylephrine. Phenylephrine acts as a decongestant which can help shrink the hemorrhoid. Aloe vera gel has been shown to prevent infection and help healing in minor wounds.You can also try applying a little baby teething gel on the area. This contains a local anesthetic that can relieve pain and discomfort.


Avoid applying steroid creams since these can damage the delicate tissue around a hemorrhoid.

, Take a cotton pad and soak it in witch hazel. Apply the pad to the hemorrhoid for several minutes. Repeat this as often as you like, especially after painful bowel movements, or at least 4 or 5 times a day.


Witch hazel acts as an astringent and can reduce the swelling.

, Avoid using toilet paper to clean yourself after toileting.Instead, fill a plastic peri-bottle with warm water and squirt the area. Gently pat the area dry with a soft cloth or use baby wipes. Choose unscented wipes to avoid ingredients that irritate.


You might have gotten a peri-bottle from the hospital or you can buy them at a drugstore or pharmacy.

, It's important to prevent straining and pressure when you have hemorrhoids. Fiber helps keep water in the stool and bulks it up so that it's easier to pass (and with less pain). Try to eat 21 to 25 grams of fiber a day. Good sources include:Whole grains: brown rice, barley, corn, rye, bulgur wheat, kasha (buckwheat) and oatmeal
Fruits (especially with the rinds or peels): apples, raspberries, pears
Vegetables: leafy vegetables like Swiss chard, collard and mustard greens, spinach, lettuces, beet greens
Beans and legumes (which may cause intestinal gas)

, The Institute of Medicine recommends that you drink 8 to 10 eight-ounce glasses of water a day.Not only will this help your body function normally, but hydration can help your hemorrhoids. Specifically, water can also help soften your stools making them easier to pass.


You can also drink juices or clear broths if you get tired of drinking water.

, There are several types of laxatives which can make toileting with hemorrhoids easier. Bulk laxatives often contain fiber to increase the mass or weight of the stool. This helps to pass the stool. Or, you could use stool softeners which also make stools soft and easy to pass. Lubricant laxatives can lubricate the walls of the intestines and rectum which makes the stool pass easier. Regardless of what you choose, use laxatives sparingly since they can be habit forming and can weaken the bowels (which leads to chronic constipation).If you're nursing, talk with a doctor before taking laxatives. Some ingredients may pass to the baby and cause diarrhea.You can try a natural softener like senna or psyllium. Senna is a gentle stimulant laxative that has been used for centuries to relieve constipation. You can take senna as tablets (follow manufacturer’s instructions) or as a nightly tea. Or you can try psyllium fiber which is a natural bulking agent.

, These stimulate the bowels to pass stools, but these are more likely to be habit forming than other laxatives. If you use stimulant laxatives, try to only use them once or twice, since they are the harshest and can cause dehydration.Instead of using stimulant laxatives, try to increase the fiber in your diet to improve your stools.

, Keep your body moving to keep your bowels moving. This essentially massages them. You can do any type of exercise: aerobic, endurance, cardiovascular or just walking. As your body moves, internal organs move and get massaged as well.


Be in the habit of exercising 20 to 30 minutes a day., Arrange regular times to use the bathroom without interruptions which can make bowel movements easier. But, if you feel the urge to have a bowel movement, don't wait. Go as soon as you can, but don’t sit for too long waiting. Sitting is associated with an increased risk of hemorrhoids.


Avoid straining which is one of the main causes of hemorrhoids. Let gravity help, but let your bowels do most of the work. If nothing happens, wait 30 minutes or so and try again., Your body just went through a lot of changes during and immediately following pregnancy. These physical, mental, and emotional changes can all cause strain. Your body is recovering from carrying a heavy growing fetus and your digestive system is recovering from the physical changes of pregnancy. These can increase the chance of constipation which aggravates hemorrhoids.


Hemorrhoids after pregnancy and delivery are commonly caused by pushing during labor., You may notice blood on the toilet paper or in the toilet after having a bowel movement. This is the most common symptom. Hemorrhoids can also be itchy and painful. You may feel an external hemorrhoid when cleaning yourself. It will be a tender swelling around the anal opening. You won’t usually feel internal hemorrhoids, but they can bulge through the anal opening.A physician can diagnose internal or external hemorrhoids by performing a rectal exam. If rectal bleeding is not caused by a hemorrhoid, your doctor will probably recommend a more extensive test called a sigmoidoscopy or a colonoscopy because one of the symptoms of colon cancer is rectal bleeding., Stand with your back facing a large floor length or bathroom mirror. Bend over slightly while turning your head to face the mirror. Look closely at your anus to see if there are any lumps or if there's a swollen mass. These may be hemorrhoids.


The lumps or mass may be the same color as your skin tone or they might appear darker red.

, If you're using home treatments, hemorrhoids will usually resolve within 2 to 5 days. If they don't, call your doctor or midwife. Occasionally for external hemorrhoids and more often for internal hemorrhoids, you may still need some medical intervention. The most common medical treatments are:Ligation: tying a rubber band around the base of the hemorrhoid to cut off blood flow
Injection of a chemical solution: to shrink the hemorrhoid
Cauterization: burning the hemorrhoid
Hemorrhoidectomy: surgical removal of the hemorrhoid

Knowing the different causes and symptoms of constipation may help you identify why you’re unable to have a bowel movement and take proper action.


Know that while constipation is often very uncomfortable, it is also very common.Only in cases where you can’t defecate after a protracted period of time can constipation get serious, and you’ll need to see a doctor to relieve the problem.
You can become constipated for a wide array of reasons including: dehydration; not enough fiber in your diet; a disruption in routine or travel; not enough activity; eating large amounts of dairy; stress; laxative abuse; hypothyroidism; some medications such as pain medications or antidepressants; eating disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, and pregnancy.There are also several different symptoms including: infrequent bowel movements or difficulty having bowel movements, hard or small stools, a feeling of having incomplete bowel movements, a swollen abdomen or abdominal pain, vomiting.Every person varies in how often they have bowel movements. Some people have three a day, while others will only have a bowel movement every other day.If you notice that you’re having bowel movements less frequently than usual or you don’t pass more than three stools per week, this may be a sign of constipation.;
, Before you use aloe vera or another natural remedy to relieve yourself, first try drinking some more water, eating some fiber, and even squatting. These may alleviate your constipation without having to use a laxative.


Try drinking two to four extra glasses of water a day. You can also try warm liquids such as tea or warm water with lemon.Try eating some fiber-rich food to get your digestion moving. Fruits and vegetables are excellent options. You could also eat some prunes or bran cereal for fiber as well.Men should aim for 30-38 grams of fiber per day, while women should try to eat at least 21-25 grams of fiber per day.For example, one cup of raspberries has 8 grams of fiber, while one cup of cooked whole wheat spaghetti has 6.3 grams of fiber. Beans have considerably more fiber, with one cup of split peas providing 16.3 grams of fiber and one cup of lentils containing 15.6 grams of fiber. Artichokes and green beans have 10.3 grams and 8.8 grams of fiber, respectively.If drinking more water and eating fiber-rich foods doesn’t relieve your constipation, try a natural laxative like aloe vera.

, You can use the aloe plant as a laxative in three different forms: as a juice, a gel, or a capsule. In any form, aloe is a very powerful laxative and should be taken sparingly or not at all.


Aloe’s medicinal products come from two substances the plant produces: the gel and the latex. Aloe gel is clear and jelly-like that is found within the plant’s leaf. Aloe latex, which is yellow in color, is located just under the plant's skin.
Some aloe products are made by crushing the leaves and thus contain both gel and latex.
Aloe latex is hard on the kidneys and for this reason should be used sparingly. Because of concerns about potentially harmful effects of aloe as a laxative, the Federal Drug Administration required that it be removed as an ingredient from over the counter laxatives by the end of 2002.

, Aloe juice, pure aloe gel, and aloe capsules are fairly easy to find at retailers such as grocery and health food stores. You’ll need to mix both into another kind of juice or tea.Health food stores are the most likely place to find 100% aloe juice and pure aloe gel. Some retailers that specialize in selling nutritional supplements also usually sell aloe juice and pure aloe gel.
Many grocery stores will also sell these products, especially aloe juice.
Make sure you buy pure aloe gel and not a topical aloe gel meant to soothe sunburn. This particular product is not meant for ingestion and can harm you if taken instead of pure aloe gel.Aloe capsules in particular can cause cramping. You may also want to consider purchasing a calming herb like turmeric or a peppermint tea to help keep side effects at bay.Health food stores are the most likely place to find aloe capsules. Some retailers that specialize in selling nutritional supplements will also sell aloe capsules.

, If you have been constipated for two weeks or more, contact your doctor and schedule an appointment. This will not only rule out a more severe condition such as bowel obstruction, but your doctor will also likely be able to prescribe you a more effective and safe method for evacuating your bowels.

, If you are finally able to relieve your constipation and want to avoid having this uncomfortable condition again, consider some changes to your diet and exercise habits. These can help prevent you from getting constipated again.Make sure to eat a well-balanced diet with plenty of fiber from fruits, vegetables, and whole grain breads and cereals such as bran.
Drink at least 1.5 to 2 US quarts (1,000 to 2,000 ml) (48oz. to 64 oz.) of water and other liquids a day.
Get regular exercise. Even something as simple as a walk will help get your bowels moving.

, Twice a day, prepare either your aloe juice or aloe gel to take if you choose this option over aloe capsules. This should help relieve your constipation within a few days.The dosage for aloe juice is ½ quart (16oz. or 2 cups) in the morning when you wake up and ½ quart (16oz. or 2 cups) in the evening before you go to bed.The taste of aloe juice is quite strong, Drink it alone if you can handle the taste, but if not, mix it with 8oz. of a juice to dilute the taste.The dosage for aloe gel is 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) per day mixed in with your favorite juice., Three times a day, take your aloe capsule with a calming herb or tea if you choose this method over aloe juice or aloe gel. This should help relieve your constipation within a few days.The dosage for aloe capsules is one 5g capsule of aloe concentrate three times per day.Consider taking a calming herb such as turmeric or an herbal tea like peppermint to help reduce the side effects of aloe capsules., Not everyone should use aloe as a laxative. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, avoid using aloe as a laxative. Children and individuals with diabetes, hemorrhoids, kidney problems, and intestinal conditions like Crohn’s disease should also avoid aloe as a laxative.Anyone with an allergy to onions, garlic, or tulips should avoid aloe., Aloe is a very powerful laxative and taking it doesn’t come without potential side effects, including abdominal pain and stomach cramping. For this reason, it’s important to follow the dosage directions and discontinue use after 5 days.Long term usage of aloe as a laxative can have serious consequences on your health. Beyond stomach cramping, it can also cause diarrhea, kidney problems, blood in the urine, low potassium, muscle weakness, weight loss, and heart problems.
Consider alternative laxatives such as psyllium fiber or senna or an over the counter version if you don’t want to use aloe. Both of them are gentler laxatives."

Focus on the long term benefits.",How to Deal with Braces1," Brushing your teeth changes when you have braces. After getting your braces put on, learn to brush your teeth carefully. Talk to your orthodontist about how to best brush your teeth and follow their instructions carefully. With braces, you brush each tooth carefully from the top to the bottom. Shift the brush at a 45 degree angle to get both the tops and the bottoms of your teeth while brushing. Then, use your brush to brush the bottom and inside surfaces of your teeth.Make sure to clean all of your teeth. Do not forget to brush the area below the braces. This area is frequently neglected.
A dentist may request that you use a special brush, called an interproximal brush, to clean between your braces. If a dentist gives you a brush like this, talk to them about how to best use it.;
, Flossing with braces can be a challenge. To start, gently feed the short end of the floss through the uppermost portion of your teeth, near your gums and the main arch of your braces. Saw back and forth to work the floss between your two teeth. Then, repeat between all the other gaps between your teeth.Be very gentle when flossing with braces. Do not press against the wire arch of your braces when flossing.

, A braces kit can be a handy tool to carry with you throughout the day. You can bring the kit with you to places like school or work. If anything happens with your braces while you're out, you will have the supplies you need. In a small toiletries bag, store the following:A mini toothbrush
Toothpaste
Dental floss
Dental picks
A small mirror
A pack of tissues
Some wax for your teeth

, Sometimes, food may get caught in your teeth when you're not home. In this case, take your dental kit to a public restroom. Take out the supplies you need to brush your teeth or dislodge anything stuck between your gums.As brushing your teeth in public can feel awkward, try to find a private bathroom if possible.
If you do have to brush your teeth in a public restroom, remember lots of people have braces. Most people will be understanding that you need to occasionally brush your teeth in public.

, It can be grating to have to wear braces. You may feel embarrassed or insecure about your braces. However, remember braces have positive long term effects. Even if you dislike having to wear braces now, remember that your teeth will be straighter and healthier. If you start to feel discouraged due to your braces, think about how nice your teeth will look when you get them removed.Try making your braces fun. Some dentists can provide you with special colors or glitter. This can make you feel excited about wearing braces. You can also look into invisible braces.
If you're insecure about your smile, try focusing on other aspects of how you look. Invest in some new clothes. Change your hairstyle. Try a new makeup routine.

Eat cold foods.,
Do a salt water rinse.,
Try over-the-counter painkillers.,
Talk to your orthodontist about wax.",How to Deal with Braces2," Cold foods can help you deal with the pain of braces. Things like ice cream, popsicles, fruit smoothies, and frozen yogurt can temporarily numb the pain. If your braces are bothering you, try treating yourself to a cold snack.However, remember not to overdo it on sugar. If you've already had ice cream to numb the pain, have a healthy smoothie with frozen fruit instead of another sugary snack.

, Mix some table salt in a glass of warm water. Swish it around in your mouth for about 30 seconds before spitting it back into the sink. For some, rinsing with salt water can numb pain in the mouth. Salt water can also help heal cuts and abrasions in your mouth from your new braces.Keep in mind, salt water does not work for everyone. If salt water irritates your mouth, stop using it.

, Painkillers such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen can be used to help numb pain caused by braces. If your mouth is chronically sore, taking over-the-counter painkillers on occasion can dull the pain. Make sure to only take the dosage recommended on the bottle.If you're on any existing medication, talk to a pharmacist to make sure it does not interact poorly with over-the-counter medication.

, When you go in to get your braces adjusted, ask your doctor about wax. An orthodontist can place wax between your gums and braces. This provides a barrier that can ease some pain. If you're experiencing pain, having an orthodontist apply wax at your next adjustment can really cut down on discomfort.Your orthodontist can give you wax to use at home. To use the wax, roll a portion of wax into a small ball. Then, press it against the front of your braces. Do this with any of the braces irritate your mouth or rub against your gums and lips."
"
Chew slowly.,
Go for soft food.,
Avoid certain types of foods.,
Have patience.",How to Deal with Braces3," When you're first adjusting to braces, eating can be difficult. You may find yourself struggling to chew and food may be harder to swallow. Chewing slowly can help you get a feel for how to eat with your braces. It can also cut down on cuts and other injuries.Try to make a habit of chewing a set number of times, like 10 times, for each bite.
You can also try to time how long it takes you to eat a meal. Strive to make every meal last 20 minutes, for example.

, At first, you should only eat softer foods when you have braces. Harder foods can be hard to chew and cause pain. Stick to things like mashed potatoes, soft fruits, soups, noodle dishes, and other foods that are easy to chew.This can be frustrating, but remember it's only temporary. The longer you have braces, the more comfortable you will be eating with them. Eventually, you'll be able to enjoy a wide variety of foods even though you have braces.

, Some foods should be mostly avoided while you have braces. Certain types of chewy or sticky foods can easily stick to your braces. Even after you've adjusted to your braces, you should still avoid the following:Gummy snacks
Foods with tough textures, like bagels and apples
Corn on the cob
Hard snacks like pretzels and nuts
Chicken wings, beef jerky, and wings
Pizza crusts
Pickles
Bubble gum

, At first, it can be frustrating not to enjoy the foods you love. However, remember to have patience. With time, people are able to adjust to their new braces. As pain decreases, and you get more comfortable chewing, you can enjoy a wider variety of foods while wearing your braces."

Buy the right Epsom salt.,
Warm some water.,
Add the salt.,
Drink the mixture.,
Drink only twice a day.,
Drink more water.,
Avoid Epsom salt if you have certain symptoms.,
Do not take Epsom salts while on certain medications.,
Consult a doctor if you have certain conditions.,
Recognize constipation.,
Discover the causes of constipation.,
Monitor your bowel movements.",How to Use Epsom Salt as a Laxative," There are numerous types of Epsom salt that you can buy. Make sure the type of Epsom salt you buy has magnesium sulfate as its main ingredient. If it has any other type of ingredient as the main ingredient, do not buy it. You could poison yourself if you buy the wrong kind.


Try brands such as Epsoak Epsom Salt.;
, To begin an Epsom salt mixture for a laxative, warm eight ounces of water in a pot on the stove over medium heat. Don't let the water boil, but make sure it is warmer than room temperature.


This can take a few minutes., Add two to four level teaspoons of Epsom salt to the warm water mixture if the mixture is for an adult. Stir well under low heat until all the salt has dissolved. If the salty taste bothers you, add a small amount of lemon juice to help with the taste.You can use the microwave to heat the water first, then add the salt.

, Once you take it off the stove, set it aside in a mug or cup to cool. Allow the mixture to cool down to a comfortable and drinkable temperature. When it is cool enough for you to drink but still warm, drink the whole cup at once., This mixture is safe to use twice a day. Drink the doses at least 4 hours apart each day. You can continue drinking this mixture for up to 4 days. If after 4 days you haven’t had any bowel movement or if you still feel constipated, call your doctor for advice.


Epsom salts taken as a laxative generally work within 30 minutes to six hours. Make sure you take it during a time where you have easy access to a bathroom to avoid accidents or discomfort.
If you are giving the laxative to a child under the age of 12, you may use one to two level teaspoons.Do not give this mixture to children under 6 years old. The safety of Epsom salt as a laxative on this age group has not been tested., While you are taking Epsom salt as a laxative, increase your water intake. The mixture can cause dehydration and you need to keep your water levels up in order to stay hydrated and healthy.


Increased water intake can also help with your bowel movements, so it is helpful in multiple ways. , Constipation can come along with other symptoms. If you are experiencing any symptoms other than constipation, avoid taking Epsom salt or any other laxative until you call you doctor.


Never take Epsom salt as a laxative if you are experiencing severe stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, have had a sudden change in bowel habits that has lasted two weeks or longer, are suffering from rectal bleeding, or have dark, tarry stools.

, There are certain medications that cannot be taken with Epsom salts. Do not use Epsom salt as a laxative if you are taking antibiotics such as Tobramycin, Gentamicin, Kanamycin, Neomycin, and Amikacin.


If you are currently taking other medications such as corticosteroids, blood pressure medications, diuretics, pain relievers, antacids, or antidepressants, consult your physician before using Epsom salts as a laxative.

, There are some conditions that might be complicated if you take Epsom salt. Make sure you check in with your physician before using Epsom salt as a laxative if you have kidney disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, any known heart arrhythmia, or if you have an eating disorder.


Also ask your doctor if it is safe for you to use if you are pregnant or breast feeding.
Also contact your doctor before using it if you have used another laxative in the last two weeks that has not worked for you., Constipation is the difficult or uncomfortable passage of stools. The most common symptoms of constipation are a decreased number of bowel movements, smaller than normal stools, stool that is difficult to pass and pain or bloating in your abdomen.


If constipation becomes chronic or long-term, it can be serious and you should consult a physician., Constipation commonly occurs because people don’t include enough fiber or water in their diet. Constipation can also be due to too little exercise or as a side effect of a number of different drugs. These include antacids, diuretics, narcotic pain relievers, antidepressants, and muscle relaxants. Constipation can also be caused by pelvic disorders or it can be a sign of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a form of which has both diarrhea and constipation.


It is important to remember and realize that constipation can be a symptom of a number of more serious medical disorders including diabetes, an underactive thyroid, inflammatory bowel disease, and some neurological disorders.
Other causes of constipation are changes in your daily routine such as travel and not enough time to have bowel movements. This can happen if you have a particularly busy lifestyle or are busy helping spouses, partners, or children or are a caregiver to an elderly relative., There is not really a set rule to how frequently you should have a bowel movement. Most people feel most comfortable when they have at least one bowel movement every day, but there is a wide variation for normal bowel movements. Some people have two to three bowel movements a day and this is perfectly normal. Other people have a bowel movement every other day, and this is normal for them.


In general, at least four to eight times a week seems to be most common. The key is your diet and comfort level. People with more frequent bowel movements tend to have high fiber diets and are often vegetarians or vegans. Those with fewer bowel movements tend to have a higher meat content in their diet."

Consult with a gastroenterologist or another digestive health specialist.
Have your IBD formally diagnosed, if it has not been already.
Explain your symptoms to the doctor. For example, if you experience frequent diarrhea, pain, weight loss, and fatigue, let your doctor know.
Your doctor may diagnose you with ulcerative colitis and/or Crohn’s disease – forms of IBD.;
, Start a journal of what you eat so you can keep track of the types of foods that aggravate your IBD. Without tracking what you consume and your digestive track’s reaction to them, you and your dietitian won’t be able to create a dietary plan tailored to your needs.


Write down what you eat and when.
Note days and times where you have an IBD flare up.
Look for patterns about what aggravates your IBD. For instance, you may have noticed that cured meats or fried foods give you diarrhea frequently. The plan you put together with your dietitian will restrict or eliminate those foods., After consulting a doctor and starting your journal, you’ll need to find a dietitian that specializes in IBD. Dietitians with experience consulting with IBD patients will have the most knowledge to help you successfully create a plan to suit your needs.


Have your digestive specialist recommend a dietitian.
Attend IBD support groups in your area. They’ll likely have a list of dietitians who specialize in digestive health.
Review a list of digestive health dietitians at websites like http://www.diarrheadietitian.com.

, After meeting a dietitian, you’ll set up an appointment for a dietary assessment. During this assessment, the dietitian will review your food intake and other factors unique to you. The dietary assessment will provide them with the information they need to put together a dietary plan. You dietitian will note:


Your weight, height, and body mass index.
Your diet and diet history.
Your physical condition and medical history.
Your blood and biochemical makeup. They’ll likely request a blood and/or urine test., Your dietitian will create a plan for you to follow on a daily basis. This plan will address your condition and your dietary needs. It will be designed to minimize IBD flare-ups and symptoms.


Your plan will detail foods you should avoid. For example, stay away from greasy and fatty foods.
The plan will list foods you should eat. It will likely name many fresh fruits and vegetables.
Your plan may include a list of meals and dishes you should prepare.
The plan might also include an exercise routine., You need to make sure you keep regular contact with your dietitian. This is important, as the dietitian will be able to monitor your food intake and IBD flare-ups and symptoms and will adjust your dietary plan accordingly.


At first, you should see your dietitian every week or two.
Over the mid-term, you need to visit your nutritionist every month.
If you work with a dietitian over the long-term, you should see them every six months, or as needed., Your dietitian will most likely instruct you to drink a lot of water. While water keeps you hydrated and helps insure a healthy digestive track, most people do not consume enough of it. Water is especially important for people who suffer from IBD because you’ll need to replenish what you lose after a bad episode of diarrhea.


Drink 1 ounce of water for every 2 pounds of weight. For instance, a 120-lb. person should drink 60 ounces (54 kilograms to 1.77 liters) of water daily.
Add more water after exercising.
Consume more water after an episode of diarrhea.
Consider water or liquids infused with electrolytes and other necessary vitamins like vitamin A, C, D and others., Consuming the right amount and type of fiber is important for people who suffer from IBD. Fiber is important because it makes your intestines work more efficiently. Thus, your dietitian will likely recommend fiber as a major component of your dietary plan.


Fiber might decrease some symptoms of IBD, like bloating and pain.
Your dietitian will probably recommend increasing your consumption of dietary fiber – fiber that is present in foods you might normally eat. Dietary fiber includes fruits and vegetables like apples, pears, carrots, and whole grains.
Depending on your diet and circumstances, your dietitian may also recommend increasing your consumption of added fiber, which may be a supplement like Benefiber., There are a wide variety of foods that aggravate IBD. Thus, your dietitian will likely recommend eliminating or reducing them from your diet. By eliminating certain products, you’ll probably experience fewer and less severe IBD flare-ups. Some things your dietitian might recommend limiting include:


Lactose
Caffeine
Alcohol
NuSorbitol
Fatty or greasy foods
Gas-producing foods like cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussel sprouts., You dietitian may recommend certain supplements and vitamins as part of your diet. This is important, as your IBD may result in your depletion of certain essential vitamins. Always speak to your doctor or dietitian before taking supplements of any kind. Some important vitamins and supplements include:


Fish oil and flax seed oil
Vitamin D
Vitamin B12
Electrolytes
Prebiotics, psyllium, and probiotics."

Fiber laxatives act in a more natural way as they suck water into the colon where the dry stool is, and then swell inside it making it softer. Stimulant laxatives, on the other hand, trigger the colon walls to contract in a way to expel stool.
Stimulant laxatives should only be used in cases of chronic constipation, not like fiber laxatives which can be used as a first line treatment.;
, Increasing your child’s water intake and giving him other natural fiber sources such as smashed apples or pears can help the laxatives to take effect more quickly.


Don’t give your child laxative suppositories without a doctor’s permission and always store them out of your child’s reach.

, Suppositories are given by lying your child down on his left side, and keeping his legs bent, then gently inserting the suppository (pointed tip first) about one inch into his rectum.


Use little side moves to facilitate its insertion. You could also moisten the suppository with a little warm water to make it easier to insert. Keep the child lying down for about 15 minutes, giving the suppository time to melt and release all the active ingredients. The suppository should give take effect about 20 or 30 minutes after administration.
Liquid suppositories types as Pedia lax liquid suppositories can be also administered by squeezing the active liquid inside the child’s rectum. These have the advantage of taking effect more rapidly than the normal suppositories, producing their pharmacological effect within minutes.
Infant suppositories can be given to children between age two to five, as one suppository every day, for no more than a week., Laxative chewable tablets are also available for children of this age, such as Pedia lax chewable tablets containing Magnesium hydroxide. These act like osmotic laxatives, where the active ions of Magnesium attract water inside the colon by increasing the pressure, resulting in softened stool.


Pedia lax chewable tablets come with a watermelon taste, which is appreciated by children. They provide a rapid effect within half an hour, which makes them a good choice for mild cases of constipation.
As this form of medication may seem like a candy to a child; parents must pay close attention to keep them out of the child’s sight, in a high place that can’t be reached, to avoid any risks of being taken by their child accidentally.
The chewable tablets can be taken as follows: one tablet given up to three times daily, according to the child’s medical condition or doctor’s orders., Laxatives Syrups are also available for children aged two to five years, examples include Pedia lax liquid stool softener. This contains Docusate, a stool softener that works in a sustained release manner, which takes effect over a duration of 12 to 72 hours. This is a good choice for chronic constipation cases.


It is available in fruity flavors and can be mixed with water, juice or milk for children to drink.
Pedia lax liquid can be given in does of one tablespoonful to be mixed with water, milk or juice once daily., Laxative chewable tablets such as Pedia lax can also be given to older children, in the same way as discussed above.


However, the daily dose would be increased to one or two tablets to be chewed up to three times daily. The total maximum dose should not exceed six chewed tablets each day.
Never give your child the maximum daily dose unless under doctor’s prescription, as overdose can cause watery stool instead of treating constipation, or cause more severe problems, such as dehydration and electrolyte loss.

, Laxatives syrups can also be used with older children to ease their constipation.


Pedia lax liquid stool softener (as mentioned above) is also used for older children with a little adjustment to its dose. Two or three tablespoons can be given daily, according to doctor’s advice.
Pedia lax can be mixed with milk, water or their favorite juice to hide the unpleasant taste, and to prevent any chance of throat irritation.

, Pedia lax also offers another pharmaceutical form of supplemental fiber, which can be given to children to soften their stool and give them easier bowel movements. However; some doctors classify these fiber gummies as only a supportive fiber source and not a treating laxative.


Each fiber gummy contains about two grams of fiber, which is approximately equal to the fiber contained in two boiled potatoes.
They are sugar and gluten free, which makes much safer for incorporation into your child’s daily diet than regular gummies.
The recommended dose is one gummy to be chewed three times daily.

, Laxatives in the form of drops can be given to children in this age group. Examples include Skilax drops which contain Sodium Picosulphate and are a stimulant laxative.


Drops come with a special measurable dropper to use for accurately measuring the prescribed dose.
Make sure to wash the measuring dropper before and after using the medication with warm water to keep it clean. Close the bottle firmly after using every time.
The recommended dose of Skilax is two to five drops once daily to be mixed with water, or juice to mask the undesirable taste.
Skilax as a stimulant laxative may take at least eight or twelve hours to provide a direct effect on the intestinal mucosa stimulating its contraction, so its advised that the child takes it before bed.

, Metamucil capsules (Psyllium) are made from a natural type of fiber that attracts water to the colon, which is absorbed by the stool, causing it to swell and making it softer, which eases its passage out.


Metamucil capsules are taken with a full glass of water, as they need water to provide their pharmacological effects and to avoid any possible side effects, such as cramps or flatulence.
This drug can alter the absorption of other drugs like Aspirin or Warfarin, so patients are advised against taking other drugs one hour before or two hours after taking the laxative.
Don’t take this drug without your doctor’s advice if you are pregnant, breast feeding, vomiting, or have recently noticed any unusual changes in your bowel movements., Colac medication is an example of a stool softener that is available as 50 or 100 mg capsules, or as a syrup. It contains Docusate as its main active ingredient.


Being a stool softener; it acts by softening the stool and creating an emollient effect. The recommended dose for adults is from 50 mg up to 200 mg according to doctor’s orders or the patient’s constipation degree.
It should be taken with a full glass of water and the patient should continue to drink water throughout the treatment, in order to stay hydrated., Dulcolax (Bisacodyl), Ex Lax (Senna) and castor oil are all examples of stimulant laxatives.


Castor oil is a liquid laxative that acts in the small intestine by gathering fluids there and stimulating the expulsion of stool. It works after two to six hours so it shouldn’t be taken before bedtime, and should be taken on empty stomach with water or juice to hide its bad taste. It should only be used on a once-off basis, not repeated frequently as it impairs the absorption of various minerals from the intestine.
Dulcolax is available as 5 mg tablets, the daily dose for adults is one tablet to be taken up to three times daily with a full glass of water. Tablets should not be taken with milk or antacids to avoid any side effects such as flatulence or cramps. They take effect within six to ten hours. Treatment should be stopped if there is no improvement, or rectal bleeding occurs.
Miralax powder sachets are an example of osmotic laxatives containing polyethylene glycol, which acts by increasing the osmotic pressure inside the colon, making the stool much softer and easier to expel. The sachet should be dissolved in a full glass of water, juice or even tea and stirred well before drinking. It should be taken only once daily, and can’t be used for more than two weeks. The patient should return to his doctor if there is no improvement., Dulcolax is also available as a suppository to be taken rectally. The rectal suppositories provide faster relief from constipation than the tablet forms, taking action within 15 minutes to an hour.


The recommended dose of dulcolax suppositories is one suppository to be inserted gently in the rectum while the patient is lying down on his back.
Be sure to wash your hands before and after inserting the suppository.

, Patients taking laxative medications should increase their water intake to more than eight glasses daily.


This is because some laxatives depend on sucking water inside the colon cavity to soften the stool. These are known as osmotic laxatives.
Others need additional water to swell inside the colon. These are known as bulk laxatives.

, Natural fiber sources should be included in the patient’s diet. Fiber is found in many sources, such as:


Fruits (apples, citrus fruits, pears, raspberries), vegetables (Cauliflower, potatoes, artichokes, broccoli), legumes (Beans, lentils) and whole grains.
These natural fibers absorb fluids, swell and keep the stool emollient and soft. This enhances enhance bowel movements and prevents hard constipation.

, Bulk laxatives should be taken with a whole glass of water to avoid any risk, of blocking the patient’s throat while swallowing them as they swell and increase in size with water.


In order to prevent any suffocation risks; this medication can’t be prescribed to or taken by patients with any kind of swallowing difficulties, patients who vomit, patients with respiratory disorders, breathing difficulties, or children younger than twelve years old.

, Lubricant laxatives such as mineral oils can slow the absorption of vitamins A, D or E, so it’s advisable to take them on an empty stomach. Other medications that the patient may be taking should be administered one hour before or two hours after the laxative intake.

, Mineral oils (if taken in high doses) may leak out of the rectum of the patient, staining his clothes and causing itchiness and irritation in the anus area. It may be useful to divide the recommended dose to overcome this problem.

, Whatever the kind laxative that was prescribed to you, you can’t use two types of laxatives categories at the same time, as this can cause an overdose and lead to diarrhea (watery stool), dehydration and loss of electrolytes from the body.


You should especially avoid taking laxatives and mineral oils at the same time, as this leads to the absorption of mineral oil into the blood circulation, leading to other problems like inflammation of the liver or the lymph nodes.

, If you missed a dose; never double the next one to try to compensate for the forgotten dose. This could easily trigger the medication's side effects, such as stomach cramps or other unpleasant reactions.


If you feel any sudden stomach pain, or experience any sudden rectal bleeding, you should stop taking the medication and seek your doctor's help immediately.
You should not take any laxative for more than one week. Call your doctor if you don’t notice any improvement in your medical condition after one week.

, You can mix liquid laxative (syrups / drops) with water, juice or tea to overcome the bitter or bad taste. Even laxatives designed for children which come in different flavors should be mixed with juices, to prevent any risks of throat irritation or discomfort.

, Bulk laxatives can cause flatulence (gas), nausea or cramps, especially if taken with small amounts of water. These side effect can easily be avoided by taking them with a full glass of water, and increasing your daily water intake.

, Osmotic and saline laxatives can cause the leakage of magnesium or phosphate ions into the blood circulation causing an increase in their levels. This can be a risk factor for patients with low renal functions, hypertensive patients (elevated blood pressure), or patients with heart failure.


These patients should not take these types of laxatives at all, their doctor should switch them to another category to treat their constipation.
Other side effects of these laxatives include gas, nausea or increased thirst.

, Stimulant laxatives may cause irregular heart beats, stomach cramps, or general weakness in some patients. Prolonged use of them may lead to laxative abuse, which is discussed in the next step.

, Wrongful use of laxatives, overdosing on laxatives, or taking laxatives for a prolonged time (if not advised by a doctor) can lead to laxative dependency.


People may develop laxative dependency as a result of a perceived inability to have normal bowel movements without using a laxative. Other patients mistakenly use laxatives as a fast-track to losing weight or getting rid of unwanted excess calories.
Laxatives, and especially stimulant laxatives can affect the normal peristalsis and weaken the intestine muscles, decreasing their ability to contract normally. This can lead to serious problems as a result of severe dehydration and loss of essential electrolytes.
This directly affects vital organs such as the heart, kidneys and nervous system, causing possible tremors and fainting in chronic cases. As a result, laxative abuse can be life threatening case if not treated."

Get surgery.",How to Undergo a Pancreas Biopsy1," Since you will go under some kind of anesthesia, you need to have someone take you to the clinic and drive you home. You should not expect to drive afterwards since you will be recovering from the anesthetic and may be experiencing minor pain.

Ask a family member or friend if they could help you. Since the procedure with waiting times may take as long as two hours, you can have one person drop you off and another pick you up.;
, The doctor will numb the area of your abdomen where the needle will go. Then, they will clean the area to remove any bacteria. The doctor will insert the thin needle through the abdominal wall and into your pancreas. The needle will then take cells from the pancreas.Imaging scans are used to help the doctor guide the needle to the correct area of your pancreas.
This procedure usually takes around half an hour.

, Another method used to biopsy the pancreas is through an EUS. The doctor will numb your throat or place you under anesthesia. Then, an endoscope, which is a thin tube, is placed down your throat. A small needle is used with the scope that will go through the wall of the stomach into the pancreas to take a sample.The endoscope also completes up close imaging tests of your pancreas, stomach, and intestines.
This method results in less discomfort. It is also usually the most accurate biopsy method for the pancreas.
This method can take up to an hour.

, A brush biopsy is conducted with an endoscope. In this procedure, your throat is numbed or you are put under general anesthesia. A brush is inserted into your abdomen through the endoscope. The brush will collect cells from the pancreatic or bile duct.This particular procedure may be used if they need a sample from the bile duct or pancreatic duct.
This method is generally not as definitive as other methods.

, A forceps biopsy is also done through an endoscope. After either having your throat numbed or being put under anesthesia, the doctor will place the endoscope into your abdomen. Forceps will be inserted through the endoscope, where they will remove a sample of the tumor on the pancreas.New technology using forceps has made this type of biopsy promising. The forceps may be used to take a large sample., Another way a doctor can take a biopsy is through a surgical procedure called laparoscopy. The surgeon will make small incisions on your abdomen. Then, they insert thin video tubes into the cuts so they can look at the pancreas. The doctor will then insert a cutting tool to remove a small sample of cells or of the tumor.Though this method isn't as common, the doctor may choose this type of biopsy if they believe cancer has spread to surrounding organs."

, If you think you are at risk for dehydration, an emergency rehydrating solution can be useful. You can drink these drinks in small amounts throughout the day. These formulas are safe for children and infants in small amounts.Mix 1/2 teaspoon sea salt (or table salt if that’s all you have), 1/2 teaspoon baking soda, four tablespoons sugar or two tablespoons of honey, and one liter safe drinking water.
Another rehydrating drink can be made by mixing ½ cup of fresh orange juice, ¼ cup of lemon juice, two cups of filtered or purified water, two tablespoons of organic honey or maple syrup, and ⅛ teaspoon of sea salt. You can use two cups of coconut water instead., If you are vomiting or nauseous, you should avoid solid foods for the first 24 hours. After this time, or when you can hold food down, stick with a bland diet. One such diet is the BRAT diet, which is a diet of bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast.You may also wish to eat soups, crackers, eggs, cereal, stews with soft meats and vegetables, and custards.

, Make sure you get enough rest. This can help your body heal and fight off whatever is causing the traveler’s diarrhea. Likely you are already exhausted from your travels. The diarrhea is likely to make the fatigue worse. Get all the rest you can.


If you are still traveling, try to take it easy for a day or two. Rest in your hotel and make sure you catch up on sleep and rehydrate.
If are home, take a day off from work or school if you need to. This might also help you have the freedom to go to the toilet when you need to.
If you can’t get out of work, just take it easy and slow. Don’t overdo it.

Increase the amount of water you drink each day.,
Include high amounts of fiber in your diet.,
Eat prunes every day.,
Drink a cup of coffee.,
Do not delay if you feel the urge to defecate.,
Place a small footstool next to the toilet.,
Establish a daily routine when defecating.,
Exercise regularly.",How to Treat Severe Constipation1," Water consumption plays an important role in your ability to defecate. When you drink enough water, you will be able to avoid passing stool that is hard and dry, which can make it easier to defecate. Drinking a lot of water also helps to move your stool along the large intestine.


While everyone has different drinking requirements, the average adult woman should try to drink at least 2.2 liters (0.6 US gal) of water a day, while the average adult man should try to drink 3 liters (0.8 US gal) of water a day.;
, Fiber can also be helpful when it comes to treating severe constipation. Fiber helps to bulk up your stool, thereby making it easier for your large intestine to move the stool. Fiber can also help to soften your stools. Try to eat at least 14 grams of fiber for every 1,000 calories of food that you eat.For many men, that means trying to eat at least 30 grams of fiber a day, while women should generally try to eat between 21 and 25 grams a day.Foods that are high in fiber include:


Legumes: Lentils, black beans, lima beans, and split peas.
Vegetables: Green peas, artichoke, turnip greens, broccoli, sweet corn, carrots, and Brussel sprouts.
Fruit: Raspberries, apples, bananas, pears, oranges, and raisins.

, As mentioned in the previous step, eating high amounts of fiber can help to relieve constipation. In particular, prunes are very high in fiber and are often recommended for people who are dealing with constipation because they contain sorbitol, which acts as a natural laxative.One cup of uncooked prunes contain about 12 grams of fiber, while three dried prunes contain 3.9 grams of fiber., Caffeine, which is found in coffee, has bowel-stimulating properties. Drinking a cup of coffee can help you to pass soft and moist stool because coffee increases peristalsis, which prevents the reabsorption of water in fecal matter.This means that your stool is kept soft and well-formed.


Try to drink one cup (eight ounces) of coffee a day, unless told otherwise by your doctor.

, If you are constipated, it is important not to miss the opportunity to pass out stool, if the opportunity arises. If you feel the urge to go to the bathroom, drop everything and go.If you hold your stool in, the large intestine will withdraw more water from the stool, making it hard, dry, and more challenging to pass out.

, Rest both of your feet on this footstool. Doing this will help to elevate your knees above your pelvis. This position helps to facilitate the evacuation of fecal matter by relaxing and opening your anal muscles.

, Having a regular daily pattern may help to prevent and relieve constipation. Try to defecate every morning; take your time and do not rush yourself when sitting on the toilet.

, Exercising may help to relieve and prevent constipation by increasing your intestinal mobility, which means that it helps to stimulate your large intestine to push out stool. Exercising can also help to increase your metabolism, thereby making your digestive system more efficient.If possible, try to exercise 30 minutes a day, five days a week. Exercising can include jogging, swimming, bicycling, rock climbing, and lifting weights.

Go to the dentist regularly.",How to Treat Hemophilia B," It is important to understand the severity of your diagnosis because this indicates the treatment choices and frequency. The severity of your diagnosis is determined by how much clotting factor IX is in your blood, which you need to help your blood clot. A person without hemophilia has 50 percent to 150 percent of what they need to form a clot.Mild hemophilia B is defined as having a percentage from 6 percent to 49 percent. Moderate hemophilia B ranges from 1 percent to 5 percent, while severe hemophilia is classified as a person having less than 1 percent.;
, You may have some different options for how you receive treatments, such as whether you will need to go for treatments or if you can get trained to treat yourself or your child at home. Ask your doctor about your options and discuss them to find out which option is best for your situation.

, When you have hemophilia B, your blood doesn't clot as it should. One treatment is increasing the concentration of clotting factor IX in your blood. The clotting factor is created from human blood and injected into your bloodstream. Used as a preventative treatment, it can help prevent excessive bleeding when you do get a cut because it helps your blood clot.This treatment does have some drawbacks. Your body may develop antibodies that destroy the clotting factor, though that is rare in people with hemophilia B.
In some cases, you can develop viruses from human blood, which can be prevented by thorough screening of blood donors and by you being vaccinated for diseases that can pass through the blood (such as hepatitis).

, This therapy works similarly to plasma-driven therapy. However, this therapy isn't made from human blood. Rather, it's produced from hamster cells.They are easier to store, and they can be used at home. Like plasma-based replacement therapy, recombinant is injected into your bloodstream.One benefit of this therapy is that the hamster cells do not carry human viruses.

, You may need more frequent or regular treatments depending on the severity of your disease. In some cases, you may be able to take replacement therapy on a preventative basis or on a demand basis. Which one you choose depends on several factors, including the severity of your condition and what your doctor thinks is best for you.With preventative replacement therapy, you take clotting factors on a regular basis, so that when you do bleed, the clotting concentration in your blood is high enough to stop bleeding. One drawback to preventative treatment is that it can get expensive. Without insurance, each treatment can cost several thousand dollars.With demand treatment, you only take the therapy when you notice bleeding. It does stop the bleeding. However, damage can happen to your body before you can receive treatment, particularly joint damage with internal bleeding. Having it available in home can make it faster.

, These medications help keep blood clots from breaking down once they have formed, which can stop excessive bleeding. Generally, when you use this medication as a treatment for hemophilia B, you'll take it in conjunction with other treatments.Often, you take these medications after an infusion of clotting factors in replacement therapy., Replacement capsules are in the works as a simple delivery system that will allow you to just swallow a capsule to treat hemophilia. While they aren't on the market yet, they could be in the near future, so keep your eye out by reading good news sources. Also, ask your doctor to keep you apprised of when they might be on the market. Replacement capsules could offer an easier delivery system, as traditional replacement therapies must be injected into a vein or port., Another promising therapy being developed (as of 2017) is gene therapy. Basically, this therapy tells the liver to produce more clotting factor. In clinical trials, patients showed improvement after a single dose of gene therapy, making this treatment a likely one in coming years., These medications are commonly taken for pain, and they are available over-the-counter. However, you should avoid taking these medications, as they can decrease your blood's clotting ability, making your condition worse., If you're living with hemophilia B, particularly a severe case, it's important to reduce your risk of injury that could cause a bleeding episode. Therefore, it's a good idea to skip activities like contact sports, which could cause you severe injury., One way to help your diagnosis is to maintain a healthy weight by exercising and eating well. Many people with hemophilia B suffer from joint and soft tissue bleeds. Sometimes, bleeding is spontaneous, while other times, it is caused by trauma.Either way, maintaining a healthy weight can help reduce the occurrences of joint bleeding., Of course, you know regular dental visits are important for good dental hygiene. However, if you have hemophilia B, it's even more important. If you put off dental work, your gums will be more prone to bleeding; anyone who doesn't practice good dental hygiene is at risk for bleeding gums and gum disease. In your case, that can be a more severe problem, as you'll have a harder time stopping the bleeding in your mouth than the average person."

Sit or lay in a position where you feel stable and won't be distracted by pain or discomfort.Spend a few minutes simply allowing your mind to wander as you slowly relax all of the muscles in your body.
You can focus on specific muscle groups, or guide your mind toward the idea of relaxing and easing the tension in your whole body.;
, Deep breathing can provide a gentle massage for your digestive system and gastrointestinal tract. As you inhale, expand your belly and engage your diaphragm to pull the air deep into your lungs.Expanding your belly will maximize the space in your lungs, allowing you to take in more air. Lift your chest as you inhale slowly through your nose.
As you inhale, imagine you are filling a glass with water. The first air you take in goes to the bottom of your lungs and you continue to fill your lungs all the way to the top with air.

, Pull in and squeeze the air out gently as you exhale, but don't contract your stomach or tense your abdominal muscles. If you allow your stomach to fully relax, it will naturally fall in towards your spine as you exhale.Think of your exhale as emptying a glass of water. Release the air at the top of your lungs first, gradually exhaling all of the air all the way to the bottom.
Exhale fully, allowing a pause after you exhale before you inhale again. It can take some practice, but over time you'll become used to resisting the urge to inhale immediately after exhaling.

, When you first start meditating, your mind will tend to wander and urge you to think about various things. When this happens, openly acknowledge the thought and gently guide your mind back to your point of focus.Don't criticize yourself or engage in negative self-talk because your mind is wandering.
If you're new to meditation, it can help to listen to music or use a guided meditation audio file, so you have something external to direct your concentration. As you gain practice, you can move to focusing solely on your breath.

, Regular meditation can help restore the processes that control digestion. The practice also calms you and eases anxiety, which often is responsible for gastrointestinal irritations.To reap these benefits, try to get in the habit of brief meditation periods in the morning and in the evening.
Start with five-minute meditations, gradually increasing over time as your mind becomes more accustomed to the practice. Ultimately you should be able to meditate for 20 to 30 minutes twice a day.

, With cat-cow pose, you alternately compress and lengthen your intestines as you move. Deep breaths throughout the pose give your digestive organs a relaxing massage that can ease pain and discomfort.To enter cat-cow pose, get on all fours with your hands under your shoulders and your knees directly below your hips.
Inhale, then drop your belly button toward the floor as you lift your heart and hips upward. This is cow pose.
Exhale and round your upper back, looking down toward your navel. Press your hands and the tops of your feet into your mat. This is cat pose.
There's no need to hold these poses. Simply follow the breath and keep your movements smooth and controlled. Continue alternating between the two poses for 10 rounds.

, The extended puppy pose stretches your midsection as well as your spine and shoulders. This pose can be especially helpful in relieving cramps or bloating after you've eaten a large meal.From the same position on all fours as you were in for the cat-cow pose, slowly walk your hands forward in front of you. Make sure your hips stay in the same place. Your back should be a straight line from your hips to your shoulders.
Let your head drop to the floor and breathe deeply, feeling gravity open your chest.

, The apanasana is also known as the wind-relieving pose, if that gives you any indication of how it works to improve digestion. The pose can help you gain relief from pain or discomfort related to gas or bloating.Lie down flat on your back, relaxing all of your muscles and allowing your head to rest on the floor. As you exhale, pull your knees up.
Grab your shins with your hands and hug your knees to your chest. To maximize the stretch, you can rock your knees from side to side, or you can stay motionless.
Take five to ten deep breaths in the position, then release your legs and return to a flat lying position. You can repeat the pose a few more times if you want.

, This pose compresses your colon, which stimulates nerves to help you eliminate gas, reducing the pain from gas and bloating. You may want to make sure you're not around people when you do this pose – just take a hint from its name.Lay on your back on a yoga mat or on the floor. Place your hands on the underside of your right thigh and bring your right knee up to the right side of your ribcage.
Press your straight leg down into the floor. Move your hands to the top of your right shin to pull it closer to you.
Hold this position for a minute or two, then release and repeat the same action with the other side. This pose is a variation on the apanasana or wind-relieving pose.

, The seated forward bend is a simple stretch that primarily serves to relax the body and ease stress, which can cause digestive issues. This pose also provides a good stretch for your spine and hamstrings, and can soothe a headache.To begin this pose, sit on the floor with your legs straight out in front of you. You may want to sit on a folded blanket to raise your buttocks off the floor and give yourself some cushioning, particularly if you're on a hard floor.
Slowly hinge forward from your hips, keeping your back flat as you lower your upper body down to fold over your legs. You should only lower yourself as far as you can do comfortably – don't try to force yourself into a forward bend, especially if you're a beginner.
Stretch your arms out in front of you, resting your palms on the floor in front of your feet if you can. If you're not able to bend that far, rest your hands on the tops of your feet or your shins.
Breathe deeply for five to ten breaths. With each exhale, push yourself deeper into the bend.
You may want to place a rolled-up blanket under your knees to make this pose more comfortable, particularly if you are extremely stiff.

, If you've had a particularly large meal, you can use this pose to stretch out your belly and encourage healthy digestion. The seated heart opener also gives you a good upper-body stretch.Sit on the floor on your heels. If you have stiff knees, you may want to place a rolled-up blanket behind your knees to reduce the stress on your joints.
Lean back and place your palms on the floor behind you. Your fingers should be pointing away from you. Press your hands firmly into the floor and lift your chest as high as you can.
Arch your back, pushing your hips down into your heels.
If it's comfortable for you, release your head behind you and stretch through your neck. Hold the pose for five to ten breaths, then lower your chest and move your hands to your sides.

, You can move straight from the seated heart opener into child's pose, which provides a relaxing stretch. This pose naturally massages your intestinal tract to aid in digestion, as well as easing stress and tension.If you're coming from the seated heart opener, move your legs further apart. Your knees and feet should be balanced at about hip-width.
Lean forward with a flat back and reach out in front of you. Rest your head on the floor, or use a block or a pillow if you can't reach the floor.
As you take deep breaths, feel your belly being pushed into your legs.
Child's pose is a true resting pose, so you can hold it as long as you like.

, This pose relaxes your gastrointestinal tract as well as giving you a deep whole-body stretch. Alternating between child's pose and downward-facing dog is both energizing and calming.From child's pose, raise up so that you are standing, your feet about hip-width apart.
As you exhale, hinge forward from the hips and press your palms flat on the ground. Your back should be flat. If you have trouble keeping a flat back, try doing the pose from your knees rather than your feet.
Hold the pose for five to ten breaths, then lower yourself back down into child's pose.

, This pose works well if you move into it straight from the half gas release pose. This twist effectively wrings out your digestive system like you would wring out a wet cloth, stimulating waste removal from the body.Laying on your back, hug your right knee into your chest. Spread your arms out on either side of your body to form a ""T.""
Allow your right knee to fall over to your left side. Keep your neck neutral or twist it to the right.
For a deeper twist, press your right thigh further to the ground with your left hand.
Hold the pose for at least five breaths, then switch to the other side.
You can hold this twist for longer than many others, which enables you to reap more benefits from it.

, The spinal twist soothes your midsection, as well as toning your abdominal muscles and obliques. The twisting motion squeezes toxins out of your gastrointestinal tract to improve your digestion and ease pain associated with indigestion.Lie flat on your back and hug your knees to your chest as you did in the apanasana pose and inhale.
As you exhale, drop your knees to the left, using your left hand to push them down. Stretch your arms out to either side and turn your head to the right.
Hold this position for five to ten breaths, then move your legs back to the center. Take a couple of breaths, then repeat the twist on the right side.

, The seated twist will help you wring out the toxins in your digestive system and ease your digestive process, allowing for smoother flow of waste through your intestines.Start these poses by sitting with your legs out in front of you. Bend your right knee, placing your right foot just outside of your left knee.
If you keep your left leg outstretched, you are doing a one-legged seated twist. If you fold it in as you would to sit cross-legged, you are doing a full seated twist. You can do either or both of these poses, whichever is your preference.
Place your right hand palm-down on the floor behind you with your fingers pointed away from your body, and wrap your left arm around your right leg.
As you inhale, open your chest and lengthen your spine. On exhale, pull yourself deeper into the twist while keeping your hips forward.
Hold the twist for five breaths, then release and repeat the action on the other side.

, The chair pose works the muscles in your abdomen and lower body. Adding a side twist to the pose tones your kidneys and digestive organs, helping improve your digestive process.Move into this pose from a standing position. Lower your hips and reach your arms overhead to get into chair pose. Don't allow your knees to push out over your toes – keep your shins straight and perpendicular to the floor.
Press your palms together at the center of your chest and inhale.
As you exhale, twist to the right and hinge your body from the hips, placing your left elbow on the outside of your right thigh.
Inhale and move back to center, then exhale and repeat the twist on the left side.
Complete the twist five times on each side.

, This pose gives your entire body a good stretch and a twist, lengthening your torso and strengthening the muscles in your abdomen, which can improve digestion.From a standing position, take a big step backward with your right foot and turn it toward the side of your mat.
Spread out your arms and keep your back long and straight as you hinge forward, resting your left hand on the mat next to your forward leg. If you can't reach the mat, you may want to place a block next to your leg to assist you, or you can just place your hand on your shins.
Look up toward your right arm, stretched upward toward the sky. Hold this position for between five and ten breaths, then release and repeat on the other side.

, The high lunge stretches your chest and abs, while the twisting motion gently massages your digestive organs to stimulate and smooth your digestive process.Start in high lunge position with your left foot forward and your right leg extended straight behind you. Your left knee should be at about a right angle with your shin perpendicular to the floor. Don't allow your knee to press forward over your toes.
As you inhale, straighten your legs and raise your arms overhead towards the ceiling, lifting and lengthening your spine.
When you exhale, return to high lunge position and begin your twist, reaching your right arm forward over your left leg and your left arm behind you.
Inhale back to center, then repeat the same twist 20 times. Inhale back to center and switch legs so you can twist in the other direction.

Be prepared to take it easy the day of the biopsy.,
Wait a few days to a few weeks for the results.,
Talk to your doctor if you start feeling worse.,
Follow recommended recovery instructions after your biopsy.,
Try to stay calm.,
Reach out for support.",How to Undergo a Pancreas Biopsy2," Though most pancreatic biopsies are minimally invasive, you still will go under anesthesia and may have a few wounds. If they use an endoscope, your throat may be tender. Don't expect to work that day after the biopsy.

Instead, you should take it easy at home for the rest of the day. Rest and let yourself physically and emotionally recover from the procedure.

, It generally takes a few days for the biopsy results to come back, but it may take up to two weeks. The sample must be sent to a lab so a pathologist can analyze the samples. This is done under a microscope, where they look for cancer cells.While they examine the cells, they will also stage it, which means they will determine how far the cancer cells have spread. The stage of the cancer helps them determine your treatment.

, Sometimes, pancreatic cancer symptoms can worsen suddenly. If you are waiting for the biopsy results and you start to feel sick, visit your doctor immediately. Do not wait., Most pancreatic biopsies require little to no recovery. You may feel some minor pain or discomfort, so take over-the-counter medication if you feel any pain.If you have a percutaneous FNA, you may experience swelling or soreness at the site.
The incisions used in a laparoscopy generally heal within a week.

, Waiting for the results of a biopsy can be extremely stressful. You may feel scared, hopeless, or anxious, but you should try to stay calm. Trying to predict your results and what that means won't help you. Instead, focus on other things in your life as you wait., If you are having trouble while you wait, you may want to reach out to people who can provide support. Talk to friends or family about how you are feeling, and spend time with them to take your mind off of your results.

You may also choose to go see a therapist. Talking through your emotions may help you prepare for your results and any treatment that might be necessary.

Recognize the symptoms of pancreatic cancer.,
Get blood tests.,
Undergo imaging tests.",How to Undergo a Pancreas Biopsy3," Knowing what may indicate pancreatic cancer can help you detect it early. Early signs include nausea, abdominal or back pain, lack of appetite, and unexplained weight loss.Jaundice is another sign of pancreatic problems. This is when your skin and eyes start to have a white tint.

, The first thing the doctor will do if they think you have pancreatic cancer is to perform blood tests. These may include liver function tests, kidney function tests, and complete blood counts.The oncologist will also look for tumor markers in the blood. These are compounds found in the blood that may indicate cancer is present in the body. It is not completely reliable, but higher tumor markers indicate a biopsy may be needed.

, After blood tests, the doctor will order a series of imaging tests. These tests will give a better view of the pancreas to see if there are visible tumors or other abnormalities.Common imaging tests include CT scans and MRIS of the abdomen.
You may also undergo an endoscopic ultrasound, which is an ultrasound conducted by placing a tube that takes images of your abdomen down your throat.
An endoscopic retrograde cholangio pancreatography is a procedure where an endoscope is placed down your throat and injects dye into your abdomen. An x-ray is then taken.

Try OTC medications.,
Take antibiotics for bacterial infections.,
See your doctor.",How to Treat Traveler's Diarrhea2," You can use over-the-counter medications to treat the traveller’s diarrhea. You can use an anti-diarrhea medication, such as Immodium. Medicines containing diphenoxylate (like Lomotil or Lonox) can be useful if the diarrhea is debilitating. The anti-diarrhea medicine can make it easier for you to ride on buses and airplanes while you get over your traveler’s diarrhea. You can also take bismuth subsalicylate, better known as Pepto-Bismol, which can help calm your digestive system.You should understand that by taking these medications, you are actually lengthening the course of your illness. Every time you use the toilet, you are eliminating the agent that is causing your misery. These medicines stop you from going to the bathroom.
Stop using these if you have abdominal pain or if your symptoms get worse. If this happens, call your physician.
Do not give your child any adult anti-diarrhea medication (like Imodium) unless told to by your pediatrician. These can be dangerous for young children.
For any OTC medication, follow the manufacturer’s directions exactly. More is not better. Do not use Pepto-Bismol with children, pregnant women, or anyone allergic to aspirin.
For adults it is recommend to take 4 mg of Imodium at the first sign of diarrhea and then 2 mg if the diarrhea comes back. Remember that it may take up to 48 hours to take effect. For children, consult a doctor, as the medication is dosed upon age of the patient and may vary.

, For the most part, traveler’s diarrhea can be treated at home; however, for some people at risk of dehydration or at risk because of their overall health, antibiotics may be prescribed.Antibiotics commonly prescribed include: Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim DS), Ciprofloxacin (Cipro), Norfloxacin (Noroxin), Ofloxacin (Floxin), or Doxycycline (Vibramycin).
The antibiotics you take may depend on where you go. You might be able to get antibiotics from your doctor before you go abroad so you can have them in case of traveler’s diarrhea., Traveler’s diarrhea usually isn’t serious and only lasts for a few days; however, if you or your child have blood or mucus in your stool, vomiting that won’t stop, diarrhea that lasts longer than two to three days, a fever over 102°F (38.9°C), or you experience any abdominal or rectal pain, you should call your doctor right away.


If any of this occurs, you may need antibiotics or other medications for parasites.

"
"
Recognize the symptoms of traveler’s diarrhea.,
Identify risk factors for traveler’s diarrhea.,
Learn where traveler’s diarrhea is most common.",How to Treat Traveler's Diarrhea3," Traveler’s diarrhea occurs when you drink water or eat food that has been contaminated with a bacteria, virus, or parasite. Because of this, the symptoms can start during your trip or right after your trip. The most common symptoms include:Fever
Nausea
Vomiting
A sudden onset of needing to pass three or more loose stools in 24 hours
A sudden or very urgent need to use the toilet
Abdominal cramping

, There are certain conditions that lead to traveler’s diarrhea. Though you may not be able to eliminate all potential risks, you can be a more conscientious traveler. You should always eat food that is cooked and served fresh and hot. Only eat raw fruit and vegetables after washing them well and peeling them. Only drink water and other beverages from factory-sealed containers. Don’t eat ice or drink water not from a sealed bottle.Avoid eating any raw or undercooked food, including meat, vegetables, and seafood. Don’t eat any unpeeled fruit or unpasteurized dairy products.

, Traveler’s diarrhea is most common when visiting parts of Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Mexico, and both Central and South America. You may also get it in the Caribbean islands, southern Europe, and Israel. Generally people from those areas don’t get sick because their immune systems have developed immune defenses against the infectious agent while you haven’t because you are not from there.What causes traveler’s diarrhea in these areas are bacteria, viruses, and parasites. The most common bacteria causing traveler’s diarrhea are E.coli, Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Vibrio species. The most common parasites are the Giardia, Entamoeba, and Cryptosporidium species, while the most common viral causes of traveler’s diarrhea are viruses from the Norovirus, Rotavirus and Enterovirus families.

Take bulk-forming agents.,
Try a stool softener.,
Talk to your doctor about saline laxatives.,
Consider taking lubricant laxatives.,
Discuss osmotic laxatives with your doctor.,
Consider taking stimulant laxatives.",How to Treat Severe Constipation2," You can take a fiber supplement, such as a wheat, psyllium, or methyl cellulose supplement each day. These supplements can help to bulk up your fecal matter, thus making it easier to eliminate from your body.


Your doctor may prescribe a low sub-therapeutic dose that you gradually increase each week.

, Stool softeners are laxatives, which means that they incorporate fat and water into your stool, making it soft and easier to pass out. These medications are generally used for people who have a short history of severe constipation (which means that they are not frequently constipated).


Docusate is often prescribed for people who should try to avoid straining while they defecate. It’s usual dosage is generally 50 to 500 mg, taken at bedtime.Senna is also a normal prescription. It works by acting directly on the intestinal mucosa to make it easier to pass out stool., These laxatives are saline (or salt water) based, and are often prescribed for people with acute constipation so long as there is no intestinal obstruction. There are three different kinds: magnesium hydroxide, magnesium sulphate, magnesium citrate.Magnesium hydroxide works by causing your gut to retain water, which helps to stimulate your colon’s activity, which relieves constipation.
Magnesium sulphate has a similar mode of action, but works more quickly. It can be effective in three hours if it is taken orally, and can have effects in 15 minutes if it is administered through the rectum. However, it is not recommended for children or people with kidney diseases.
Magnesium citrate acts in the same way as the two previously mentioned saline laxatives, but you must discuss taking this laxative with your doctor as it will not work for all people.

, As the name suggests, these laxatives work to lubricate your intestine, which helps to facilitate the passage of stool. They should begin to take effect about eight hours after your take them. They contain mineral oils like fleet and kondremul. You should only take these laxatives after talking to your doctor.


The normal dose for fleet is 15 to 45 mL per day while the dose for kondremul is 30 to 75 mL taken each day., These laxatives use osmosis to help distend your bowel, which increases the movements of the colon. Osmosis is a process that brings water to your intestinal tube, which causes the tube to open up.


The usual dose is 15 to 30 mL each day. It should begin to take effect 24 to 48 hours after you consume the medication., These laxatives help to stimulate the movement of your gut muscles, which helps to push stool out. There are several different kinds of stimulant laxatives, including:


Senna leaf extract, bisacodyl, and castor oil.

Make an individualized treatment plan.,
Have a plan for care during severe flare-ups.",How to Treat Inflammatory Bowel Disease1," An accurate diagnosis is essential for getting appropriate treatment. Ask your healthcare provider whether there are additional tests necessary to solidify your diagnosis prior to beginning aggressive or targeted treatment for IBD.


If your doctor is unable to diagnose your issues definitively, then you may want to consult another healthcare professional for a second opinion.;
, Record your diet and symptoms in a journal for a few weeks before meeting with your doctor. This will help a dietitian or physician develop a nutritional intervention plan to ease your symptoms of IBD.


Unless your symptoms are currently very severe, your healthcare provider may have you adjust your diet to test its effectiveness on easing symptoms before prescribing medication.

, Many medications have been developed to reduce inflammation and ease the pain and discomfort of inflammatory bowel disease. Medication options include anti-inflammatory drugs, cortisone or steroids, immune system suppressors, antibiotics, anti-diarrheal medications, and other prescription drugs that fight irritation and prevent symptoms.Specific treatments will depend on whether you have Crohn’s Disease, ulcerative colitis, or another form of IBD.
Just as with other medications, IBD drugs involve some side effects and may not be compatible with certain other medications. Be sure to discuss any other medications or supplements you take with your healthcare provider.
In some cases, the first medication you try may not be effective or suitable for your lifestyle. You may have to try several types of medicine before you find a drug that works well for you and eliminates your symptoms.

, In many cases, nutritional changes and lifestyle tweaks can help control symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease. Ask your doctor about specific dietary changes you can begin immediately to help prevent flare-ups or to ease symptoms and reduce inflammation.In general, eliminating irritating foods, such as high-fat foods, caffeine, alcohol, and spicy foods, from your diet can help minimize your IBD symptoms.
Eating a well-balanced diet that is high in soluble fiber and lean protein is typically good for people with IBD.
In some cases, your doctor with refer you to a dietician to help form a plan for dietary treatment of IBD.

, Well-managed inflammatory bowel disease may never require surgery. In some cases, however, significant bowel damage or dangerous pre-cancer cells may develop. In these cases, surgery may be necessary.Surgical treatments for IBD include strictureplasty (which widens narrow areas of the bowel), resection of the intestines, colectomy, and removal of abscesses and fistulas.
If you do not currently require surgical intervention, following your treatment plan closely and adjusting your treatment when necessary under the guidance of a health professional can help you avoid surgery in the future.

, Because there are multiple forms of inflammatory bowel disease, and due to the variety of symptoms and experiences people have with the disease, treatment for IBD is almost always individualized. They will vary depending on the severity and frequency of your symptoms and the specific type of IBD that you have.Besides working hard to keep yourself healthy and active, particularly during periods of fewer symptoms, most treatment for inflammatory bowel disease involves continued medical care.

, Even with treatment, IBD can involve painful resurgences of symptoms that do not subside with use of your medication and dietary regimen. Discuss treatment options with your healthcare provider for such instances, including which over-the-counter medications may help ease symptoms.Also ask if your healthcare provider is available for emergency treatment in severe cases.

The sooner the problem is dealt with, the easier it will be to solve. If you have any of the following symptoms that persist for several days or that cause you serious discomfort, call your doctor:


Pain in your upper abdomen, which can radiate toward your back. This pain will usually be worse after eating. Your abdomen may also be tender. Nausea and vomiting.
Oily, greasy-looking stools.
Weight loss without apparent cause.;
, These same symptoms may be from other sources. You may not have pancreatitis, but instead have some other problem. However, these problems can still be very serious, so it's important to still seek treatment. Other possible sources of the problem include:


Ulcers - black or bloody stool is one of the major symptomatic differences between ulcers and pancreatitis
Gallstones - fever and skin discoloration are some indicators of gallstones over pancreatitis but many of the symptoms are exactly the same
Liver disease - skin yellowing or discoloration is a common indicator of liver problems instead of pancreatitis
Heart attacks - tingling in the arms is one clear indicator that you're having heart problems and not pancreatitis

, Alcoholism, cystic fibrosis, hyperparathyroidism, infection, and cancer are some of the causes of pancreatitis. These are serious conditions that have lots of other negative impacts on your health and well-being, so it's important to be sure that they are being treated.


Alcoholism is one of the most common causes of pancreatitis and is very closely associated with the disease. Even though you may not think you have a problem, it's a good idea to consider it.

, Because the causes of pancreatitis are often very serious and because the treatment you'll need is more than what you can do at home, you're going to have to go to a hospital. Either immediately see your own doctor, who will probably have you admitted to the hospital, or go to the emergency room if you don't have a general doctor to make sure that pancreatitis is really your problem.

, If you live in places like the US, it is possible that you do not have access to health insurance. This should not keep you from seeking treatment, however. There are programs in place to help you and treatment centers across the country that you can go to. See the official listings to find out the closest location to you.

, Ignoring pancreatitis may lead to severe weight loss, diabetes, debilitating pain, lung failure, or even death. Death isn't good! Seek immediate help if you suspect that you have pancreatitis and don't assume that the problem will just go away. Many cases of pancreatitis may not require medicine, but they do require healthcare procedures that you can't do at home!

, You may need to undergo some tests to find out if you have pancreatitis. Blood tests, stool tests, CT scans and ultrasounds are the most common tests to find out the source of your health problems when pancreatitis is suspected.

, For 75% of patients, basic hospital care will be all that is needed to recover.However, this is still complex enough care that it will need to be done at a hospital and home remedies are not usually an option. Your doctor should be able to explain your situation.


Expect to fast. Eating no food for up to several days, and instead being switched to feeding tubes, special diets, and other alternatives is generally the main basic treatment for pancreatitis. This is because eating makes the problem worse and makes you unable to heal.
Get IV fluids. Severe dehydration is a major part of pancreas problems, so expect to be given a large amount of fluids to combat this. This will most likely come in the form of IV fluids, but you may also be asked to drink more water.
You will probably be given some medication. Pancreatitis causes significant and constant pain and your doctor should give you painkillers to help alleviate the pain. Meperidine or Demerol are the most commonly prescribed painkillers for patients with pancreatitis.Take antibiotics should your doctor prescribe them. They may be given to prevent possible infection or to treat an existing one.

, For basic or mild cases, the underlying cause may be very easy to treat (such as a change in medications). However, more severe cases or chronic cases may require more serious treatment.


Surgery is the most likely option if you have a severe problem. What kind of surgery will depend on what the underlying cause is, however. Some options include gall bladder removal, surgery to repair or remove parts of the pancreas, or surgery to remove bile duct obstructions.
Treatment for alcohol dependency will be recommended if it is determined that this is the source of the problem. For your own happiness and well being, it is recommended that you comply with your doctor's wishes in this area, even if you don't think you have a problem.
There are enzyme supplements which you may be asked to take if your problem is hereditary or cannot be fixed in another way. These supplements are in the form of a simple tablet and aid with digestion, keeping the pressure off of your pancreas.

, If you have only a mild case of pancreatitis, you may want to take some precautions so that you don't get pancreatitis again in the future. One of the best things that you can do is to eat healthy and exercise in order to lose weight. Pancreatitis can develop due to high triglycerides or diabetes. Keeping yourself healthy may help relieve pancreatitis symptoms. This means eating a diet low in sugar and rich in vegetables and protein.


Eat fewer carbs (like pasta and chips) and cut foods with lots of sugar out of your diet. Eat more vegetables than fruits (which contain lots of sugar) and bid goodbye to soda! Lean proteins are also great, so eat lots of fish and chicken.
You can also get some help with exercise, if you need it. You'd be surprised how easy it is to fit exercise into your day.

, Drinking alcoholic beverages on a regular basis can cause pancreatitis. If you have been diagnosed with pancreatitis or seem to be prone to pancreas problems, stop drinking alcoholic beverages.


If you want to still fit in and socialize with your friends, quietly order an apple juice or a water in a martini or whiskey glass. Both of these look like booze but aren't actually alcoholic.

, Smoking also causes pancreas problems and may cause or make your pancreatitis worse. Smoking also has lots of other negative health effects, so you're better off trying to quit. There are lots of great methods these days for helping you quit, so don't sweat it and just give it a try.

, Talk to your doctor about medications. Some medications may cause pancreatitis. Your doctor should recognize this on their own, but you may want to bring it up if you feel it may not have been considered. This is especially important if you are with a new doctor who may not know your medical history.

Know the signs and symptoms of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.,
Have your vital signs tested.Depending upon the degree of bleeding, an upper GI bleed can, in some cases, be life-threatening.,
Receive blood tests and assess for anemia.One of the key factors to assess in a GI bleed is the degree of blood loss.,
Receive fluids or a blood transfusion, if needed.After determining your degree of blood loss (through a combination of clinical signs and a blood test for anemia), your doctor will offer you IV fluids and/or a blood transfusion if he or she determines that your blood volume is sufficiently low and needs to be replenished.,
Ask your doctor for PPIs (proton pump inhibitors).,
Opt for gastric lavage.Prior to receiving an endoscopy, it is sometimes helpful to receive a ""gastric lavage."",
Receive an upper GI endoscopy.,
Identify the cause of the bleeding.The most common cause of upper GI bleeding is peptic ulcers (ulcers in the stomach).,
Have the source of the bleed treated endoscopically.When the upper GI endoscope is inserted to look for the source of the bleed, it can also be used to administer treatment at the site of bleeding once that location is found.,
Stop any medications that may worsen the GI bleed.,
Treat recurrent GI bleeds as needed.",How to Treat Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding," The signs of upper GI bleeding can be scary — one of the most common indicators is vomiting blood. Don't panic — call your doctor and get immediate attention if you experience the following:Vomiting blood, which may resemble coffee grounds
Black stools with a foul odor
Fresh blood passing through the anus, usually found with stool (this is more likely to indicate lower GI bleeding, but may still be present with upper GI bleeding)
Feeling faint and lightheaded, weak
Pain in the upper abdomen, just below the ribs
Heartburn or indigestion;
, If you are losing blood at a rapid rate, the amount of blood left to circulate through your body decreases, which can lead to lightheadedness, paleness, fainting, and ultimately signs of shock from blood loss. Your doctor can test your vital signs to get an idea of how much blood you have lost. Signs pointing toward more severe blood loss include:


An abnormally rapid heart rate
An abnormally low blood pressure
An increased respiratory rate
A decreased level of consciousness

, In cases of severe blood loss, the key will be to replace the lost blood and stabilize you medically before moving onto specific diagnosis and treatment options. If you are only losing minimal blood, however, your doctor can proceed straight to diagnosis and treatment.


The best way to assess the degree of blood loss, if it is uncertain (i.e. assuming you are not in shock or showing other clinical signs of blood loss), is through a blood test.
The blood test will check your hemoglobin levels, which is the molecule in your blood that is responsible for carrying oxygen.
Low hemoglobin is diagnostic of ""anemia,"" and the severity of the anemia correlates to the degree of blood lost from the GI bleed.

,


IV fluids are given in cases of less severe blood loss. They boost your blood volume (the amount of fluid traveling in your circulatory system), but do not directly increase the hemoglobin (or functional oxygen-carrying capacity) of your blood.
If your hemoglobin is substantially decreased (i.e. if you have very severe anemia leading to functional compromise of your cardiorespiratory system), you may need a blood transfusion.

,

PPIs are medications that can help to decrease the severity of upper GI bleeding. Even before the cause of the bleed is identified, it is recommended to receive PPIs as having them in your system decreases the chances that you will need an endoscopic repair, once the source of bleeding is identified., This is where the contents of the stomach — including possible blood pooling — are washed away to allow a clearer view of the stomach wall on endoscopic examination.


This allows for easier identification of the source of the upper GI bleed.
It also allows for a clearer view to aid in treatment of the GI bleed (which depends upon having a view to identify the source of the bleed).

,

Once you have been stabilized medically, if needed (i.e. if your vital signs were compromised or your degree of blood loss was severe enough to warrant fluids and/or a transfusion), the next step will be for your doctor to determine the underlying diagnosis — that is, the cause of your GI bleed. Determining the cause will be what dictates the ultimate treatment plan.

An upper GI endoscopy is usually recommended as a diagnostic evaluation within the first 24 hours of the bleed (if possible).
An upper GI endoscopy is when a tube with a camera on the end is inserted down your throat, through your esophagus, and ultimately down to your stomach.
The purpose is to visually assess (via the camera) for the source of the GI bleeding.
Treatments may also be given endoscopically if and when the source of the bleeding is identified.

, These account for 60% of upper GI bleeds. They are more prevalent in individuals who have active H. Pylori infection in their stomachs, so offering antibiotic treatment for this bacteria may be part of the advised treatment plan. What accounts for the other 40% of upper GI bleeds? If you are not diagnosed with a peptic ulcer(s), your doctor will consider the following sources of possible upper GI bleeding:


Mallory-Weiss tears — these are tears in your esophagus, often caused by extreme force such as forceful retching or vomiting leading to rupture of esophageal blood vessels.
Esophageal varices — these are delicate blood vessels in the esophagus that may rupture and bleed.
Arteriovenous malformations — these are genetic abnormalities of the blood vessels predisposing a person to bleeding in the area of the malformation.
Cancer (such as stomach/esophageal/intestinal cancer) — the delicate blood vessels of cancerous growths are highly susceptible to bleeding.
Gastritis — this is abnormal inflammation and irritation of the stomach lining, which may lead to blood loss.
Duodenitis — this is abnormal inflammation and irritation of the duodenum in the small intestine, which may also lead to blood loss.

, Types of treatment that can be offered endoscopically include:


Injection of epinephrine
Thermocoagulation
Banding
Application of clips
Studies have shown that the combination of an epinephrine injection with another form of treatment for the bleed is the most successful at stopping the bleeding and preventing recurrences.

,

While medical treatment is not the mainstay of treating an upper GI bleed, removing any medications that you may be on that could make the situation worse is key. Medications that may exacerbate (or predispose you to) GI bleeding include:

Blood thinning medications such as Warfarin (Coumadin) or others, which disrupt your natural clotting cascade and hence worsen any existing bleeds. Talk to your doctor about temporarily stopping these medications until your GI bleed is resolved or if you need to stop them permanently.
NSAIDs such as Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), because in many cases these cause upper GI bleeds. Therefore, if you are taking one regularly, consider stopping it and/or replacing it with a different medication.
Aspirin, which interrupts platelet aggregation and hence worsens any existing bleeds. Talk to your doctor about temporarily stopping this medication until your GI bleed is resolved.

, It is important to understand that 10-20% of treated upper GI bleeds recur. That is, the treatment does not last long-term. In cases of recurrence, physicians are advised to try a second attempt at the same endoscopic therapy tried the first time. If this fails again, and the bleed recurs for a third time, physicians are advised to proceed with ""arteriography with embolization,"" or with surgery.

Take your medication regularly.,
Eat a balanced diet when your disease is inactive.,
Eat a bland diet when your disease is active.,
Stay physically active.,
Be social.,
Continue medical assessment.",How to Treat Inflammatory Bowel Disease2," When on any medical treatment, it is important to be consistent and take your medication when instructed to do so. Following your prescription can help you eliminate your medical problem more efficiently and effectively, and it will minimize the chance of a flare up.This is true for all IBD medications, whether you are on anti-inflammatory drugs, cortisone or steroids, immune system suppressors, antibiotics, anti-diarrheal medications, or some combination of these.

, Good overall nutrition helps give your body the nutrients it needs to control inflammation and manage symptoms as easily as possible. Drink plenty of water and eat foods high in soluble fiber, lean proteins, good fats, and foods high in calcium. With good nutrition your body's immune system and digestive system can work together to keep symptoms at bay.There are a variety of special diets that may help you control your symptoms, including gluten-free diets and elimination diets. However, do not begin a restrictive diet plan or eliminate entire food groups from your daily diet without the advice of a dietitian or nutritionist and the approval of your physician.

, While your symptoms are active, you will need to eat fewer foods to keep them under control. In general, avoid alcohol, caffeine, raw fruits and vegetables, spicy foods, high-fiber foods, or generally large meals when you are having a flare-up. Instead, you should eat bland, soft foods like:Fruit juices
Applesauce
Bananas
White rice and refined pastas
Fully cooked vegetables
Potatoes without skin
Lean meats, fish, and tofu

, A major goal of IBD treatments is to restore your quality of life, particularly when the disease is well managed during periods of remission. Because IBD flare-ups can limit physical activity, many IBD specialists encourage patients to take advantage of remission periods to enjoy physical activities that may other times be impossible.When you feel well, go dancing with your significant other, take a swim, chase your children around in the park, ride your bicycle, train for a race or sporting competition, or enjoy gardening. Taking advantage of your mobility and freedom from symptoms can help make IBD less intimidating and restrictive.

, By enjoying your symptom-free time as much as possible, you can help relieve stress and anxiety surrounding your condition. The act of minimizing stress and enjoying your life, you may itself ease some of your symptoms.Socializing with friends and family can help improve your quality of life, making flare-ups more bearable and reminding you that it is possible to live a happy, well-balanced life with IBD.

, Many dietary changes and medications may become less effective over time. It is important to regularly discuss your symptoms and treatment options with a health professional. This will allow them to keep tailoring the best possible treatment plan to manage your condition.

In many cases, treatment plans will change with time, depending on your health and symptoms, and as medications and dietary alterations lose some effectiveness over time.

Identify the common symptoms.,
Get a medical evaluation.,
Rule out other causes of symptoms.",How to Treat Inflammatory Bowel Disease3," There are a variety of symptoms that are common with inflammatory bowel disease. While not all cases will have every symptom, a person with IBD may have some of these symptoms:Diarrhea
Rectal bleeding
Urgent need to go to the bathroom
Abdominal cramps and pain
Feeling of incomplete evacuation
Constipation
Fever
Loss of appetite
Weight loss
Fatigue
No menstrual cycle

, If you suspect that you have IBD, you should consult with a medical professional. Your doctor will be able to assess your overall health and investigate the cause of your symptoms with diagnostic testing and assessment.Your doctor may do tests on your blood to help them diagnose your condition. They may also want to take a stool sample for evaluation as well.
If your symptoms are severe, see your doctor right away. Problems like diarrhea and bleeding from the bowels can severely impact your health and you should have them addressed right away.

, Inflammatory bowel disease symptoms can be indicative of other problems or conditions. In order to rule out other causes, you need to be professionally diagnosed before beginning an IBD treatment regimen.This is why it is important not to attempt to self-diagnose IBD or treat its symptoms without the help of a health professional.

Visit your doctor.,
Get a breath test at your doctor’s office.,
Undergo an endoscopy if you have symptoms of bleeding or unexplained weight loss.",How to Treat Peptic Ulcer1," Burning stomach pain is the most common symptom of a peptic ulcer, and nausea and heartburn are common, as well. Over-the-counter antacids like Pepto-Bismol, Tums and Rolaids often help the pain, but when the pain keeps coming back, see your doctor to discuss your symptoms.


Other severe symptoms of ulcers can include blood in your vomit (hematemesis) or stool (hematochezia). Seek immediate medical attention if you have nausea and vomiting after eating, your vomit looks dark or like coffee grounds, or your stool has a tarry black appearance.Ask your doctor something like, “I used to get heartburn after eating spicy food, but Tums would always help. Now I feel like the pain is worse and comes back more often. Do you think it’s something other than just heartburn?” It’s helpful to describe your symptoms and how they have changed over time.;
, The most accurate way to test for the presence of H. pylori is with a breath test.However, this test is not used very often in a clinical setting. If you’re having symptoms of a peptic ulcer, your healthcare provider can do this test to determine whether the bacteria is present. The test requires drinking a special liquid and then later blowing into a bag.A stool sample can also be used to diagnose H. pylori infection. This is the best way to detect H. pylori if it is an acute infection.
Be sure to tell your doctor if you are taking any medications, as this can also help with diagnosis. Using NSAIDS, smoking, and alcohol consumption can make this disease worse.

, This is the most frequent method of diagnosing a peptic ulcer. With an endoscopy, your doctor uses a scope (a small visualizing device) to look at your stomach, and possibly take a small sample of the lining to biopsy.This is usually done if you have severe symptoms of peptic ulcers like bleeding, weight loss for no reason, or trouble with eating or swallowing.You may also need an endoscopy if you are over age 45, even without more severe symptoms."

Consider the BRAT method.,
Eat bananas.,
Cook white rice.,
Consume more applesauce.,
Make toast.,
Try variations in the method.,
Shift your approach with children.,
Get potassium elsewhere.",How to Treat Diarrhea (BRAT Diet Method)1," Physicians often recommend the BRAT method when someone is suffering from acute diarrhea, which is diarrhea that last for less than 14 days. This method, which is a diet of bland foods incorporated into your diet, helps settle your stomach and helps you recover from a gastrointestinal infection that causes diarrhea. BRAT stands for bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast. These foods are typically recommended because they are easy to digest, are well tolerated by most people, and low in fiber to help firm up stool.


This is not a weight loss method and it not recommended for the long term. This diet is low in protein, fat, and fiber and lacks key nutrients needed to live over time. Only use this method for the few days it takes to be able to stomach normal food when you have diarrhea. Make sure you stick to it for at least 24 hours to help with your symptoms.Indeed, the major concern that doctors have about the BRAT diet is that it is unnecessarily restrictive and provides suboptimal nutrition. You should not stay on it for more than a few days until your diarrhea subsides.;
, The first step in the BRAT method is to eat bananas. Bananas are great when you are suffering from diarrhea because they are bland and easy on the stomach. They are also helpful because they are rich in potassium, which will help counter the loss of nutrients from diarrhea. Eat plenty of bananas while you are suffering from diarrhea. Do not over stuff yourself and cause more stomach issues. Only eat what you can without making yourself sick. Bananas contain about 422 mg of potassium making bananas a potassium rich superfood with 13% of the RDA of potassium in one banana. Potassium in an important electrolyte responsible for providing energy for the cells, tissues, and organs of the body.Green bananas are preferable due to the increased mounts of pectin.

, While rice is a great, bland starch that can easily be tolerated when your stomach is upset. Eat it by itself without added butter or salt. The extra ingredients may upset your stomach even more, especially in the first few days of the diarrhea.Don't eat brown rice. Brown rice has increased fiber, which can make your stools loose and may make your diarrhea worse., Applesauce is also bland but also has added sweetness and natural sugars. This is easily digested and easy to tolerate, even if your stomach is upset. You can buy individual applesauce cups for ease or large jars of applesauce to serve in bowls. Eat multiple servings of applesauce a day to help your calorie intake and keep your stomach settled.Avoid buying the flavored types of applesauce because they have increased sugar content and may upset your stomach more.
One concern is that doctors have is the consumption of simple sugars. Simple sugars, like the sugars contained in applesauce, increase stool output and are low in sodium and potassium, which are key electrolytes of the body., One of the blandest foods you can eat is plain bread. It is a good source of bland carbohydrates that are easy to digest when your stomach is upset. White bread is better because the flavor is milder and there is less fiber and will help firm up your stools.Avoid putting butter and sugary jams on your toast. Butter is high in fat and sugary jams can make your stomach worse., There are two common variations in the BRAT method. There is the BRATY method, which adds yogurt to the method. Plain yogurt has increased potassium and good bacteria for your system. You can also try the BRATT method, which adds tea to the routine. Gentle herbal teas can help keep you hydrated and settle your stomach.


You can combine them all to make the BRATTY method if you think all the different components work for you., In recent years, there are some doctors that believe the BRAT diet may be too restrictive for children with acute diarrhea because it lacks the nutrients their bodies need to get better. These doctors suggest this diet in the first 24 hours of the condition. After this period, they recommend adding in more nutrient rich foods from the children's normal diet while avoiding foods with simple sugars. These include soda, juice, gelatin desserts, or other highly sugared foods, which may worsen the diarrhea. Once the illness is over, children should receive additional nutrition to compensate for any nutritional deficiency that arose during the illness.


Certain guidelines have recommended avoiding fatty foods, but maintaining adequate calories without fat is difficult, and fat might have a beneficial effect of reducing intestinal motility. Instead, don't give your child overly greasy foods with little amount of nutrients in them.
Try to make them eat the foods of the BRAT method in the first 24 hours, even if it is in small doses to avoid them getting sick. The somewhat common practice of withholding food when diarrhea is first developed is inappropriate. Early feeding decreases changes in intestinal permeability caused by infection, which can reduce the duration of the illness duration and improves the outcome. Doctors recommend an age appropriate diet with complex carbohydrate, lean meats, yogurt, fruit, and vegetables. These are better tolerated than fats and simple sugars., If you do not like bananas or want to get your potassium from other sources while you are sick, there are many additional bland foods that can provide potassium for you. White beans, baked potato with skin, dried apricots, and avocados are great sources of potassium and can help you recuperate during bouts of diarrhea.Only eat these foods if you think your stomach is ready for them. You don't want to upset your system even more than it already is.

Keep a food diary.,
Follow the low FODMAP diet.FODMAP stands for fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols.,
Eat regular meals.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Reduce alcohol and caffeine.,
Limit processed foods.,
Eliminate artificial sweeteners.",How to Treat Irritable Bowel Syndrome1," Start keeping a food diary to keep track of what you eat and how it makes you feel.You can use your food diary to identify the foods that tend to trigger your IBS symptoms and use that information to avoid trigger foods in the future.In your food diary include things like:


what you ate
how much you ate
when you ate
how you felt one to two hours after eating;
, These ingredients are more likely to produce IBS symptoms, so reducing your intake of foods that contain these ingredients should help to improve your IBS symptoms.Foods that you should limit or avoid include:


certain fruits such as apples, blackberries, apricots, cherries, nectarines, mangoes, pears, watermelon, or plums
canned fruits
fruit juice
dried fruit
certain vegetables such as artichokes, cabbage, garlic, lentils, cauliflower, mushrooms, asparagus, beans, onions, snow peas , and sugar snap peas
dairy products
wheat
rye
high-fructose corn syrup
honey

, Having an irregular eating pattern can also contribute to IBS symptoms, so try not to skip any meals or eat meals that are spaced too far apart. Maintain a regular meal schedule and try to eat about once every three hours during the day.Avoid eating large meals as well. Large meals may also contribute to IBS symptoms, so try to eat four or five small meals throughout the day., Staying hydrated can also help to combat some of the symptoms of IBS. Aim to drink about eight 8 ounce glasses of water every day. If you exercise or have an active lifestyle, then you may need to drink more.Steer clear of fizzy water and other carbonated beverages. These can make IBS symptoms worse.

, Alcohol and caffeine can irritate your digestive system. They may cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, or constipation. Try to reduce or eliminate caffeine and alcohol from your diet and see if your symptoms improve.For example, instead of having two cups of coffee in the morning, just have one. Or, instead of having a martini with dinner, have a glass of water.

, Processed foods tend to contain the types of sugars that are hard for your body to digest and may pass through your system without getting broken down.Eating these foods may cause your IBS symptoms to flare up.

, Artificial sweeteners that end in “ol” may make your IBS symptoms worse if you tend to get diarrhea, so it is important to avoid these. These sweeteners are common in chewing gum and diet products, such as slimming shakes.Get into the habit of reading labels to make sure that none of the foods you are eating contain these sweeteners. Some of the sweeteners to avoid include:xylitol
maltitol
sorbitol
mannitol

Stop smoking.,
Limit your alcohol intake.,
Avoid spicy foods.,
Take over-the-counter antacids.,
Try botanical treatments like cabbage and turmeric.,
Decrease your stress level.",How to Treat Peptic Ulcer2," Many people have the H. pylori infection but don’t have any symptoms or problems with peptic ulcers. Smoking increases your risk of developing peptic ulcers if you have H. pylori present in your stomach. Stop smoking to reduce your risk of further ulcers and help those you do have to heal.Use the START Acronym to stop smoking:


S= Set a quit date.
T= Tell friends and family that you plan to quit.
A= Anticipate challenges.
R = Remove tobacco from the home, car, and work.
T= Talk to your doctor for more support and advice on quitting.

, The pain from peptic ulcers comes from stomach acid contacting the sore in the lining of the stomach or duodenum. Drinking alcohol increases the amount of stomach acid and causes irritation in the stomach lining, and increases the pain of ulcers. Stop drinking alcohol or limit your consumption as much as possible to reduce symptoms., Eating spicy food does not cause peptic ulcers, but it can worsen your stomach irritation when ulcers are present and make pain more severe. Limit your spicy foods to improve symptoms.Eating and drinking foods that increase stomach pH (make it less acidic in your stomach) can also help with pain. Milk, for instance, may decrease symptoms temporarily.

, You can buy a number of acid-decreasing medicines from your local drug store. These won’t heal your ulcers, but they will probably help with your pain at least temporarily. Try antacids like Tums, Rolaids, or Pepto-bismol.


The definitive treatment for peptic ulcer disease is triple therapy. This is when they give you three medications including an antacid and antibiotics to clear the infection, while sometimes a repeat endoscopy is needed to cure the infection/peptic ulcer.

, Alternative medicine should not be used alone to treat peptic ulcers, since ulcers can cause severe complications and require medical treatment. However, use of botanicals at home may help symptoms. Cabbage is a good choice, as is turmeric, neem bark extract, mastic, and licorice.Always consult with your doctor before trying natural remedies.

, Like spicy foods, feeling really stressed out might worsen the symptoms of pain caused by ulcers.Stress releases a hormone called cortisol, which negative affects numerous body systems – including your digestive tract. Try yoga, meditation, deep breathing, taking a walk – anything that helps you relax. If you have a stressful lifestyle due to work or family, practice mindfulness meditation or learn stress management skills. You cannot eliminate stress from your life, but you can control how you deal with it. Maintaining a calm, peaceful demeanor will help to improve your pain and health.


Keep in mind that quantifying stress can be difficult on a clinical level. While certain psychosocial factors influence the development of ulceration, these factors need to correlate with psychophysiological factors as well.

Kill H. pylori with antibiotics.,
Aid healing with acid-reducing medications.,
Discuss with your doctor whether you need additional medications.,
Stop your use of NSAIDs.,
Schedule a follow-up appointment when you’re done with your medicine.",How to Treat Peptic Ulcer3," The treatment for peptic ulcers varies depending on what caused them. H. pylori infection is the most common cause, so usually treatment is with antibiotics to kill the bacteria. H. pylori is pretty resistant, or hard to kill, so you will take several antibiotics in combination. Your doctor will prescribe some combination of tetracycline (Tetracycline HCl), clarithromycin (Biaxin), amoxicillin (Amoxil), metronidazole (Flagyl), tinidazole (Tindamax), or levofloxacin (Levaquin).You will usually take these antibiotics for 2 weeks, plus other medications to decrease your stomach acid and promote healing.

, A class of drugs called Proton Pump Inhibitors (commonly PPIs) decreases acid production in your stomach and helps your ulcers to heal. You will almost always take a PPI like Prilosec, Protonix, Nexium or Prevacid while your ulcers are healing.Histamine blockers (H-2’s) like Pepcid and Zantac also reduce stomach acid, and may be prescribed.The combination of antibiotics, antacid, and PPI is called triple therapy, and this is very effective in the treatment of Peptic Ulcer Disease.

, PPIs can increase your chances of bone fractures, so if you are at risk of having low calcium your doctor may prescribed a calcium supplement.It’s possible that you will also be prescribed an antacid to reduce pain, or perhaps a medication to protect the inner surface of your stomach like Carafate or Cytotec.Discuss your health problems and medications with your doctor to get the best drug combination for you.


Share questions and concerns with your provider, such as, “You mentioned that the medication you’re giving me can decrease my calcium. I have osteoporosis, so is there something I should do about that?”
Further, PPI’s can decrease the bioavailability of other medications depending on how they are metabolized and absorbed by the intestine.

, Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, when used long-term, can also cause or prevent healing of peptic ulcers.If you regularly take over-the-counter pain relievers, discuss alternatives with your doctor. Switching to something gentler on the stomach can help ulcers to heal.


Some common NSAIDs include aspirin, ibuprofen products like Motrin and Advil, and Naproxen products such as Aleve and Anaprox.
If you must continue using NSAIDs, your doctor can give you a PPI medication to take simultaneously to lower your risk of ulcers., Once you have finished the treatment prescribed by your doctor, go back to ensure your ulcers have healed. Another breath test may be performed. If you have ongoing symptoms, you might need an endoscopy. An endoscopy is usually done 6-8 weeks after you are first diagnosed with peptic ulcers, and can also be used to make sure you do not have gastric cancer."

Drink plenty of fluids.,
Make a homemade rehydration solution.,
Notice signs of dehydration in children.,
Recognize dehydration symptoms in adults.",How to Treat Diarrhea (BRAT Diet Method)2," No matter what diet method you try while you have diarrhea, you need to keep hydrated. One of the major side effects of diarrhea is dehydration due to the continual loss of nutrients and fluids from the body. You need to continually replace these losses with electrolytes. Try drinking electrolyte rich drinks such as Gatorade and Pedialyte along with plenty of water. Electrolytes such as potassium are key to keeping you safe and healthy as you work through your sickness.Dehydration is more common with diarrhea than other stomach issues because the colon absorbs electrolytes and water, but when it is inflamed like it is when you have diarrhea, the colon cannot do either.
Make sure you pay extra close attention to your hydration during the first few days of your diarrhea. This is when you lose most of your fluids.Drink at least 64 oz of water a day or 8 eight oz glasses. Drinks with caffeine do not count toward the daily total of water consumption.

, There are some homemade mixtures you can make to help with rehydration. Take one liter of water and add 6 teaspoons of sugar and 1/2 a teaspoon of salt. Drink one teaspoon of this solution every 5 minutes., There are some groups who are more at risk for dehydration than others. Infants and toddlers are at an increased risk of dehydration when suffering from diarrhea. Watch infants, toddlers, and children for symptoms such as crying without tears, decreased urine in diapers or urinary output, and sunken eyes or fontanels. If you notice these signs, seek medical attention. Dehydration can be serious and require intravenous fluid replacement.Babies being breastfed can still be breastfed when suffering from diarrhea.

, Any adult can become dehydrated while suffering from diarrhea. Groups of people such as diabetics, the elderly, or those with HIV are at higher risk of dehydration. Look for symptoms such as dizziness when standing, a racing pulse with standing, dry oral mucosa, or feeling very weak. All the cells in our bodies run on what is termed the sodium-potassium pump, so losses of these minerals are critical, especially potassium. This can cause serious problems, including sudden cardiac death.If you are unable to tolerate oral fluids, keep a close watch on yourself. You may need to go to the emergency room to get IV fluids and electrolytes if you can't rehydrate on your own. You should go to the the ER if you are having nausea and vomiting associated with your diarrhea such that you cannot keep down liquids.

Exercise more.,
Express your feelings.,
Practice deep breathing.,
Set aside some time for you each day.",How to Treat Irritable Bowel Syndrome2," Regular exercise can help to stimulate your digestive system and reduce your stress levels as well. Try to incorporate at least 150 minutes of activity every week. For example, you could go for a 30 minute walk five days of the week to meet this goal.Try yoga. Yoga can provide some good exercise and allow you time to relax.

, Not having an outlet to express your feelings can contribute to stress and worsen IBS symptoms, so try to find an outlet for your emotions. Find healthy ways to deal with your emotions, such as:calling a friend
writing in a journal
drawing
talking to a counselor

, Deep breathing exercises can provide an almost instant sense of calm when you are feeling stressed. Try to practice deep breathing throughout the day to manage your stress.


To practice deep breathing, focus on using your diaphragm to pull air down into your abdomen.As you breathe in, count to five slowly. Then, hold the breath for a few seconds and release while counting down from five.

, Ensuring that you take time to focus on yourself is also essential for managing stress. Make sure that you set aside at least 20 minutes every day to do something that you want to do. For example, you could: read a book
take a bubble bath
watch an episode of your favorite show
listen to some music

Take fiber supplements.,
Incorporate a probiotic supplement.,
Try coated peppermint oil capsules.Peppermint oil capsules have been found to be effective for children with IBS.",How to Treat Irritable Bowel Syndrome3," Fiber is important for regulating your bowels and dealing with IBS symptoms. If you are having trouble getting enough fiber from your diet alone, then taking a fiber supplement may help to improve your IBS symptoms. Choose bulk forming laxatives because they are the least likely to irritate your bowels.The recommended daily amount of fiber is between 25 to 35 grams. If you are not getting this amount of fiber from food sources, then you can supplement with fiber.Fiber supplements are available as powders, capsules, and biscuits.
Make sure that you read and follow the manufacturer's instructions for use.
Always take fiber supplements with a full glass (8 ounces) of water.

, Probiotics may also be helpful for treating your IBS symptoms. Probiotic supplements contain good bacteria that can help to regulate your digestion. Try taking a probiotic for about a month to see if it helps you.A typical dose is between one to two billion colony forming units (also known as CFUs) per day. Make sure that you follow the manufacturer's dosing instructions.
Some doctors will recommend a higher dosage for their patients. Check with your doctor for a specific dose recommendation.When choosing a probiotic, make sure that the package provides the name and contact information of the manufacturer, the scientific names of the bacteria strains included in the probiotic, a ""best by"" date that states how many of the bacteria will be alive when the product expires, information about how to store the product, and dosage instructions. Avoid any products that make claims that the product will cure or treat a disease or condition., Peppermint capsules seem to reduce the abdominal pain that is common with IBS sufferers.Try taking peppermint oil capsules for a couple of weeks to see if it helps to soothe pain associated with your IBS.


A suggested dosage is to take one to two coated 0.2 mL peppermint oil capsules. You can take up to three doses per day.Keep in mind that some people experience heartburn from taking peppermint capsules."

Ask your doctor about antidiarrheal medicines.,
Talk to your doctor about medications for constipation.,
Discuss antidepressants with your doctor.,
Ask about antibiotics for bloating.",How to Treat Irritable Bowel Syndrome4," There are a few different medications available for those who have IBS with diarrhea.Talk to your doctor if you are interested in trying a medication for your IBS diarrhea. Some common drugs include:


AlosetronRifaximinEluxadoline, IBS can also make some people constipated. If constipation is a symptom of your IBS, then talk to your doctor about IBS medications for people with constipation. These drugs also help to relieve abdominal pain from constipation. Drugs available for those with IBS constipation include:Lubiprostone.Linaclotide, Antidepressants have also been found to be effective for those with IBS. Antidepressants seem to help regulate the digestive system for some people and they also have pain relieving effects. Your doctor may recommend a tricyclic antidepressant or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor to help treat your IBS., Antibiotics, such as rifaximin, may be necessary to treat IBS bloating. This antibiotic works by reducing the number of gas causing bacteria in your digestive system. Ask your doctor about rifaximin if bloating is a common problem for you."

See your doctor if you have pain after eating.,
Get emergency medical care if you have severe abdominal pain.,
Check yourself into the hospital.",How to Treat Gallbladder Disease1," The most common indication of cholecystitis is pain after you eat, especially after eating a large or fatty meal. The pain is usually in your upper right abdomen. See your doctor if this occurs regularly or suddenly.The pain can sometimes also be felt in your right shoulder, between your shoulder blades on your back, or in the center of your abdomen just below your breastbone.It may also feel tender when you touch your abdomen. Pain can last from a few minutes to hours.
You may also have nausea, vomiting, or a fever (a temperature of 100.4°F/38°C or higher).
Cholecystitis is often caused by gallstones that block the bile duct and cause bile build-up in the gallbladder. It’s important to see your doctor to resolve the problem and prevent complications like gallbladder rupture.;
, Seek emergency care if you have stomach or abdominal pain that is so severe you can’t sit still or get comfortable. This can be a sign of a serious illness that needs prompt treatment. Have someone drive you to the hospital, or call emergency services for help.If you get a high fever of 104°F/40°C or higher, or the whites of your eyes turn yellow, call for emergency care.

, If your doctor thinks you have cholecystitis they may send you to the hospital or refer you to a gastroenterologist – a doctor who specializes in the digestive system. Most treatments for gallbladder disease involve staying in the hospital for a few days. Doctors will want to monitor your signs and symptoms, and try to decrease the inflammation in your gallbladder. This is a normal course of action, so don’t worry.Mild symptoms usually subside in a day or two, though sometimes surgery is necessary.

Visit your doctor regularly.",How to Treat Diverticulitis," One of the possible causes of diverticulitis is the consumption of small, inadequately chewed and difficult-to-digest foods like seeds, corn, and berries. These get caught in the diverticula of the intestine and feed a bacterial colony, sometimes causing infection. If experiencing an episode of diverticulitis, it is best to avoid any foods which might worsen the infection. This means avoiding fiber (which pushes more waste into the infected area) and avoiding the aforementioned difficult-to-digest foods.


When the diverticulitis episode is over, you should greatly increase your dietary fiber intake.
Try not to consume too much dairy during this time.;
, Visit your doctor to get a prescription for antibiotics. Diverticulitis occurs when the diverticula (small pockets in the colon) become infected. This can only fully be treated with antibiotics, or else the infection will continue to spread. Follow the package directions with your antibiotics; they typically involve taking a pill orally at least once a day, but this will vary depending on your prescription.

, Most people suffering from diverticulitis experience abdominal pain and cramping. Although this won’t go away until the infection clears up, you can take pain medication to help reduce the pain in the meantime. Look for ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or naproxen in low doses so that you can take a bit whenever you experience a flare-up of pain., Some people have claimed that certain herbs expedite the healing process involved in ridding your body of infection, and also help to reduce any pain or discomfort you may be feeling. Look for teas or supplements containing chamomile or slippery elm, two herbs commonly used for stomach problems. If nothing else, drinking a hot glass of tea is soothing and can ease any cramping you’re experiencing in your stomach.

, Although it may sound strange to any non-acupuncturists, acupuncture can help relieve certain pressure points that cause pain or pressure in your abdomen. Find a local acupuncturist and see what they can do for your diverticulitis. Although this won’t help to heal the infection at all, it should make you more comfortable.

, Hydrotherapy is pretty straightforward - it involves using water as a means of treating your discomfort. There are a few different hydrotherapy techniques you can try at home. Take a warm bath with epsom salts, or use a hot water compress on your abdomen to loosen up the muscles and reduce your pain., If you experience a bout of diverticulitis without antibiotic treatment, the infection may spread into a pustule or abscess. Typically, you’ll experience more extreme pain, a high fever, and a high white blood cell count. Treatment for a diverticulitis episode turned abscess is a catheter that is inserted through the stomach into the abscess, which drains the abscess over several days.

, If you do end up getting an abscess that doesn’t get treated, the next infection level is peritonitis. This is when the infection/abscess spreads from beyond the pustule to encompass the entire lower portion of the large intestine. Typically, people with peritonitis will experience a high fever, illness with vomiting, abdominal pain, and low blood pressure. The only treatment is a course of vigorous antibiotics and surgery to remove the infected portion of intestine.

, If you have a bad case of diverticulitis, one possibility is that instead of the infection spreading to a larger portion of your colon, it could spread to adjacent areas of your body such as your bladder or skin. This has similar symptoms to peritonitis, but can only be identified and treated by a doctor. Treatment involves antibiotics at least, but often surgery as well.

, This is one of the rarer side-effects of diverticulitis; if you experience the infection which goes untreated, scar tissue may form and narrow a portion of the colon. This narrowing is called a ‘stricture’, and can prevent waste from passing through. The treatment for stricture formation is typically surgical, depending on the scope of the problem., If you consume dietary fiber on a daily basis, your body will be able to push waste through your colon in an efficient manner, preventing it from building up in the small diverticulos sacs that develop. Fruits and vegetables are both very high in dietary fiber, along with beans and whole grains. These foods all have other natural benefits beyond preventing diverticulitis, making them helpful to add to your diet anyway.


Don’t begin eating fiber until after you’ve recovered from an episode of diverticulitis.

, Because the infection that causes diverticulitis is a result of harmful bodily bacteria, some doctors have theorized that eating more healthy bacteria (probiotics) can cleanse your colon and prevent an infection. Probiotics are typically found as live cultures in certain types of yogurt and help to cleanse your stomach and intestines of harmful bacteria, making you feel better when consumed on a regular basis., Water and other fluids, when consumed on a regular basis, have a hugely positive effect on nearly every aspect of your body’s functioning. Aim to drink 5-8 glasses of water or another healthy fluid per day, as this will cleanse out harmful bacteria and help provide energy to your body .

, Once you’ve been diagnosed with diverticular disease, you should monitor your colon to help prevent future episodes. This can also help to prevent more serious side effects from occurring (see the aforementioned). Aim to visit your doctor about two months after your first episode, and look into getting a colonoscopy or barium enema x-ray. These will both be able to show any issues that might occur, allowing you to seek treatment before it’s too late."

Get lots of rest.,
Take pain relieving medication with caution.,
Cope with nausea and vomiting.,
Keep well hydrated.,
Combat itchy sensations.,
Avoid alcohol.,
Get vaccinated.,
Be cautious when traveling.,
Practice good hygiene.",How to Treat Hepatitis A," Symptoms of hepatitis A are often described as flu-like and include fatigue (tiredness), weakness, loss of appetite and a low-grade fever.To combat these symptoms, get plenty of rest, especially during the initial stages of the infection, and temporarily reduce your activities and exercise regiment.


You'll probably need to stay home from work or school until the flu-like symptoms fade away (a few weeks of so).
Focus on getting at least 8 hours of quality sleep each night, if not more.
Take a break from the gym for a few weeks until your energy levels build back up. Instead, go for a short walk on occasion to get some fresh air and stimulate your blood circulation.;
, Other symptoms associated with hepatitis A are abdominal pain or discomfort near your liver (upper right side beneath your ribs) and joint pain, especially large joints such as your hips, spine and knees.Over-the-counter pain medication such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and acetaminophen (Tylenol) can help reduce painful symptoms, but keep your dosage well below maximum recommended amounts.


The liver is responsible for processing (metabolizing) drugs in your body, so higher doses can irritate, inflame and damage liver cells, especially if they're already infected with viral hepatitis.
Adults tend to experience more symptoms than children because their liver cells don't grow and regenerate as quickly.
Ibuprofen is not appropriate for young children, so stick with small doses of acetaminophen if you need to reduce symptoms.

, Another common symptom of hepatitis is mild-to-moderate nausea and potential vomiting, which can wax and wane throughout the day.To combat nausea, eat smaller meals or snacks throughout the day instead of three large ones. Focus on bland food, such as crackers, bread and white rice. Avoid fatty and fried foods, as well as spicy seasonings.


Ginger is a natural remedy for nausea, so consider taking ginger capsules, eating pickled ginger or drinking real ginger ale.
If your nausea and/or vomiting is severe, your doctor may prescribe an antiemetic drug (such as metoclopramide) to reduce the symptoms.

, A further complication of chronic or severe bouts of vomiting is dehydration, especially if you can't keep fluids down. Symptoms of dehydration to look out for include: severe thirst, dry skin, sunken looking eyes, lack of urination, headache, confusion and lethargy (fatigue).Focus on drinking purified water and herbal teas for hydration, although chicken / beef broths and diluted fruit juices are also good sources of electrolytes (mineral salts that are lost with vomiting).


Avoid beverages with caffeine (coffee, black tea, colas, energy drinks) because it's a diuretic that stimulates urination and increases the risk of dehydration.
If you can't keep yourself hydrated with beverages, you'll need to go to a hospital or emergency clinic to get intravenous fluid through a vein in your arm.

, Another potential side effect with any form of hepatitis or liver disease is a general sense of itchiness (also called pruritis) all over the body.Liver-related itchiness is caused by two main factors: an accumulation of toxins that haven't been filtered out by a damaged liver, and a back-up of bilirubin in the blood.


To combat itchiness wear loose clothing, avoid hot baths and showers, don't get sunburned and maintain a cool, well-ventilated environment in your home.No amount of scratching relieves this form of pruritis, so don't start and then risk getting a skin infection.
A build-up of bilirubin levels due to a damaged liver also causes yellowing of the skin and eyes).
With severe cases of itching, taking an over-the-counter antihistamine medication may help because it reduces inflammatory reactions.

, An injured and inflamed liver has trouble processing and metabolizing (breaking down) the toxins in medications, as well as alcohol (ethanol).As such, take it easy on your liver by not drinking alcoholic beverages while your body fights the hepatitis A virus — it may take a few weeks to a few months, depending on the severity of the infection and strength of your immune system.


Although red wine has some health value (it contains antioxidants), it should also be avoided by people with hepatitis.
Instead of wine, drink grape juice with meals as long as it doesn't trigger nausea.
Instead of drinking regular beer after work or on weekends, try non-alcoholic varieties.

, The easiest way to prevent hepatitis A is to get vaccinated with the hepatitis A vaccine.It's proven to be effective at preventing infection by the virus. Hepatitis A vaccines are typically given in two doses — an initial shot in the arm followed by a booster shot about six months later. All children by the age of two years should get vaccinated to help prevent future infection.


People who are recommended to get vaccinated include: lab workers who handle hep A, people who work with sewage, men who have anal sex, illicit drug users, patients with chronic liver disease, and people traveling to areas with high rates of hep A.The effectiveness of the hep A vaccine ranges from 80-100% after 1-2 doses in most people.The three types of vaccines used against hep A are: a monovalent vaccine, a combined hep A and hep B vaccine, and a combined hep A and typhoid fever vaccine.
For adults, a booster hep A shot is estimated to protect you for at least 20 years., If you're traveling to higher risk places where hepatitis A outbreaks frequently occur, then take the necessary precautions. More specifically, peel and thoroughly wash all fresh fruits and veggies yourself before eating them.Avoid eating any raw or under-cooked meat, poultry and fish. Drink only bottled water and also use it when brushing your teeth. Don't drink any beverages with ice added.


Higher risk areas for hepatitis A include Mexico, China, Southeast Asia, Africa, Asia and most parts of South America.
If bottled water isn't available to you, boil tap water for about 10 minutes before drinking it.

, In addition to contaminated food and water, hepatitis A is also transmitted from infected people — either sexually or from their dirty dirty hands.As such, practice good hygiene by frequently washing your hands with warm water and antibacterial soap. As an alternative to soap and water, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, especially after you shake hands with someone or handle fresh produce (fruits and veggies).


Always wash your hands after using the toilet, changing a diaper and before preparing food or eating it.The hep A virus can also be transmitted sexually, so practice safe sex and always insist on condom usage.

Fast if your doctor says to.,
Take your medications as directed.,
Have surgery, if necessary.,
Take it easy for two weeks after surgery.,
Take medicine to dissolve gallstones if you can’t have surgery.,
Ask if you qualify for shock wave treatment.,
Discuss the risks and benefits of a gallbladder cleanse with your doctor.",How to Treat Gallbladder Disease2," Your doctor will probably suggest you don’t eat or drink anything for a little while, usually a few days, to take stress off of your gallbladder. If you have very mild symptoms and are told you don’t need hospitalization, drink water and eat small meals that are very low in fat. Usually you’ll be in the hospital, and the doctors will control what food you get.You might need to get IV (intravenous, or into your vein) fluids so you don’t get dehydrated.

, If you have an infection in your gallbladder, you will need antibiotics. Take them exactly as prescribed. Your doctor may also give you pain medication to make you more comfortable. Use these only as directed, and don’t take more than your doctor tells you to., Cholecystitis often comes back and can sometimes be severe, so you may need surgery to remove your gallbladder. When you have surgery will depend on how serious your symptoms are – sometimes it will be within two days of seeing your doctor, but other times you may be able to wait a little while. If a tumor is causing your gallbladder problems, you will need to have it removed.Most gallbladder surgeries are done with small instruments and cameras through tiny incisions (laparoscopic surgery), so you won’t even have big scars.
You don’t need your gallbladder! Other parts of your body can take over your gallbladder’s job once it’s removed.

, You should be able to return to your normal activities in about two weeks if you have laparoscopic surgery. In the mean time, take time off of work to rest. Don't drive for the first week. Incorporate slow walking into your day after a few days of rest, and gradually increase your activity. Start eating a normal, healthy diet when you get home from the hospital. Ask your doctor if you have any specific questions about recovery.Ask your doctor for recovery guidelines if you have open surgery. Open surgery requires more extensive recovery than laparoscopic surgery.

, If you can’t have surgery for some reason, ask your doctor about medications. The medications ursodiol (Actigall) and chenodiol (Chenix) can dissolve some kinds of gallstones, but this can take months or even years to work. Your gallstones might also return once the treatment is stopped, so this options isn’t the best choice if you can have surgery instead., Only about 15% of people with gallstones can successfully use shockwave treatment, called extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy. This uses painless shock waves to break up stones while you sit in a bath.Ask your doctor if this may work for you. It’s most effective if you have only one gallstone that’s smaller than 2cm in diameter.

, Alternative medicine practitioners suggest a gallbladder cleanse to break up gallstones – a mix of olive oil, herbs, and fruit juice (there’s no set specific recipe). There’s no data showing these work, and they may be risky to your health. Talk to your doctor first if you're interested in trying one."

Participate in diagnostic testing.,
Maintain a healthy weight.,
Eat a low-fat, high-fiber diet.",How to Treat Gallbladder Disease3," Go to the hospital prepared to participate in testing. You will probably have a blood sample taken, and they may look at your gallbladder with an ultrasound machine or CT scan. Do these important tests as soon as your doctor recommends it.You may also need a HIDA scan – a test that watches how bile moves in and out of your gallbladder. This involves injecting radioactive dye into your body. Tell your doctor if you have liver or kidney problems before this test.
A procedure call ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) can both diagnose and remove gallstones.It does not remove your gallbladder., Overweight people are at greatest risk of getting gallstones. Achieve and maintain a healthy weight by limiting your calorie intake and doing aerobic exercise for at least 30 minutes 5 days a week.Lose weight slowly to limit your risk of getting gallstones. Aim to lose 1-2 pounds (0.5-1 kilogram) a week.

, Eating fatty foods raises your risk of getting gallstones. Eat healthy by limiting the fat in your diet, and eating a lot of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.Base your meals on whole grain pasta and rice with fresh vegetables. Eat low-fat proteins like salmon and skinless chicken. If you eat red meat, choose lean cuts and only have small portions.
Keep a regular meal schedule and don’t skip meals. Fasting can increase your risk for gallstones."

The locator will narrow your choices down by location, insurance provider, and specialty. You cannot limit by their ability to help with IBS, but you can find ones in your area and then do more research about their ability to help you.If you can't find a therapist that specializes in IBS, the International Foundation for Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders has a care locator that can help you find a doctor in your area that specializes in IBS. She may be able to help you find CBT treatment.;
, When you work directly with a therapist or counselor for CBT, the treatment is made to be short term. Most CBT treatments take place over 4 to 20 sessions with your therapist.Meet with your therapist and work out when each of these weekly sessions will be.


The length of your treatment will vary depending on your personal need and the methods of your therapist.

, One of the major points of CBT for IBS is to help you identify your anxiety related to your IBS and combat the adverse effects it causes. In your sessions, your doctor will help you pinpoint how the stress of IBS affects your everyday lifeand how you could modify negative behaviors and thinking patterns and replace them with more positive ones. You can also learn about how to monitor stressful events to prevent IBS flare-ups, as well as how to address your specific stress triggers before they will aggravate your IBS symptoms. You also might learn muscle relaxation exercises and how to modify your conditional response and thoughts that amplify your emotional stress which leads to worsening of IBS.


Your therapist will help you verbalize the anxiety you have, such as ""I become anxious when I'm in a closed meeting at work because of my IBS."" Or, ""I worry about how my IBS may affect my interpersonal relationships.""

, The stress you put on yourself because of your IBS will actually make it worse. Instead of letting stressful situations intensify your IBS symptoms, your therapist will use CBT to help you change your patterns of behavior and thought processes to a more positive, affirming outlook.For example, if you worry about how your friends or significant others will react to you IBS, your therapist will help you see that it is a normal problem that your loved ones will understand. You will learn to see that these interpersonal relationships are stronger than your disease and you don't have to spend all of your time with them upset.

, Once you deal with the stress directly related to your IBS, you need to look into what situations in your every day like cause you stress. External stress often causes IBS symptoms to worsen, so learning to identify these situations will help you change you behavior.


These can be hard to identify at first, so your therapist may ask you to keep a diary of your IBS flare ups, where you list the activities that happened directly before and after your flare up., Once you identify stress patterns in relation to your IBS, your therapist will help you change your perception of these events, giving you more positive ways to think about stressful situations. This will help lessen your symptoms because your body will not go into flight or fight mode in order to deal with these situations.Instead, you will find healthier ways to deal with these situations.For example, if you normally get really upset about morning traffic, your therapist may help you realize that the traffic is an inevitable occurrence that you cannot change, therefore you should not stress about it.
If you have presentations at work that causes IBS flare ups, he may help you reframe your thinking to ""I am a competent individual who is ready for this presentation. I will do my best and have no reason to stress.""
If you are having trouble doing this, your therapist will help you problem solve to find that best ways to deal with these situations.

, During stressful situations, your IBS flares up partially because your body is too tense. In order to help you relax and calm your body down, your therapist may teach your breathing exercises and progressive muscle relaxation to help combat these symptoms.


These are techniques that help your body muscles relax, which will calm your bowel muscles to reduce flare ups., In order to ensure that the CBT will help you after your sessions end, your therapist will help you restructure your overall thought patterns to more positive, stress free patterns. You will learn to focus on positive, uplifting ideas related to your daily life and to stressful situations instead of giving in to your anxiety.


This takes a little more effort on your part, since you will need to continue these modes of thinking after your CBT is over."

Raise the head of your bed 4 or 5 inches (10.2 or 12.7 cm) higher than the foot.",How to Treat Acid Reflux1," If you experience acid reflux frequently, you may have noticed an increase in your symptoms when you eat certain foods. Try cutting back on the following foods to experience acid reflux less often:




Chocolate
Spicy food
Garlic and onion
Fried or greasy foods
Acidic foods such as tomatoes and citrus fruits
Mint and peppermint;
, Eating more often and in smaller portions helps your digestive system operate more efficiently, so acid does not build up. Limit your portions to one serving size each. Wait until you no longer feel full before eating more food.




, Give your digestive system an assist from gravity by not eating too close to bedtime. Wait at least 3 hours after eating before you lie down.




, Obesity is a chief contributor to acid reflux. The extra weight puts pressure on your esophagus, causing acid to rise back up.Diet and exercise may eliminate symptoms without requiring further treatment.




, Alcohol and caffeine loosen the sphincter that controls the passage of the esophagus into the stomach, allowing acid to flow backward. Avoiding them, especially before bedtime, can ease the symptoms of GERD.




, Smoking interferes with digestion and can damage the lining of the esophagus. Even if you can't quit, it's important to cut back as much as you can.




, Tight waistbands compress the internal organs and may block digestion. Wear pants and skirts with elastic waistbands. If you wear form-fitting clothes and heavy fabrics at the office, change into sweats or other comfortable clothing as soon as you get home.




, Simple gravity is a contributor to GERD, especially if you are overweight or have a hiatal hernia or other abnormality of the passage from the esophagus to the stomach. If your head is higher than your feet, acid can’t back up.





Use blocks to raise the whole head of the bed. Raising your head with pillows isn’t as efficient, because it exaggerates the bend in your waist.

Manage your symptoms in the long term.",How to Treat IBS with CBT2," In some situations, self-motivated CBT may work better for you than therapist, session driven CBT. This method is typically more affordable, may be more available, and be easier to schedule. In some studies, it has been shown that the benefits last longer because the methods are done on your own to begin with.With this type of CBT, you will have three to four in person sessions over a 12 to 20 week period. These sessions help you get the benefit of a trained therapist but makes it easier on you. You will receive materials that help lead you through your self-motivated sessions., During the first few self-motivated sessions, you will learn about your IBS. Your therapist will help you learn more about how IBS works and how your body responds to certain situations, causing the symptoms. For follow self-session, you will track your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors related to your IBS. You will look for stress that may cause your IBS and sketch of how your IBS related to stress.


During this week, you need to keep a diary of your IBS symptoms, including the severity, stress reactions, and manifestation, as well as your eating habits. Also track your IBS flare ups., Over the next few self sessions, you will analyze your symptoms to identify common triggers. These may be stress related or food related. You will learn to incorporate exercise to help with your symptoms and become more aware of your triggers and situations that cause them.


You will also learn about other natural ways to help with symptoms, such as increased everyday activity and food control. If you identify food related triggers, you need to change these eating habits., The next few sessions focus on changing your thought patterns in relation to you IBS, especially now that you know your stress triggers. You will need to identify these situations and change your perception of them. You will keep a daily thought record so you can keep track of negative thought patterns and come up with realistic alternative thought patterns.You will then use your log of your stress and IBS related negative thoughts to change these thoughts. Identify these thoughts and reframe them in a positive light, such as ""I do not need to be anxious about going out with my friends tonight. I am in control of my IBS and my friends care about me."" or ""Going to work should not make me anxious. I am a good worker and am valued by my coworkers. My IBS does not change my ability to do my job well.""

, The last few weeks of your self-motivated IBS focuses on how to manage symptoms of IBS and dealing with your stress in the long term. You will learn about relaxation techniques, such as progressive muscle relaxation targeted to the abdomen and deep breathing exercises.


You are also taught how to take care of your overall health, such as improving your sleep patterns and continuing to process your emotions in a positive manner.
You will also discuss how to maintain self-treatment of flare ups over the long term, which will vary depending on your personal triggers.You will also be asked to maintain regular exercise. Exercise and activity are an important component of CBT.
You will learn how to modify “unhelpful thoughts” and change them to more constructive alternative ones.

Know how CBT helps IBS.",How to Treat IBS with CBT3," Irritable bowel syndrome has very specific symptoms. A person usually has IBS if the symptoms last for six months or longer. The symptoms include:A change in your normal bowel movements
Bloating
Excess gas
Pain, especially in the lower belly
Mucus in your stool
Pain in the belly at least three days a month
Pain is often relieved by a bowel movement
Pain is connected to the frequency of your bowel movements
Pain is related to the type of stool
Constipation, diarrhea, or an alternating combination

, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, also known as CBT, is a form of talk therapy. The aim of CBT is to help teach you to identify negative, unhealthy thoughts and change thought patterns. You work to change your negative thoughts into positive, more constructive ways of thinking., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy can be a helpful tool if you have IBS. It works as a pain management tool. CBT helps you learn how to change your negative thoughts and behaviors that worsen your stress responses. By reducing your stress responses, you can help alleviate some of the symptoms and pain associated with IBS."

Try an over-the-counter medicine.,
Try H2 blockers.,
Treat acid reflux with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).,
Try home remedies.,
Herbal remedies for GERD: Herbs have been used since many ages to reduce the hypersecretion of gastric acid.",How to Treat Acid Reflux2," Over-the-counter antacids, such as Tums or Alka-Seltzer, may ease symptoms of occasional indigestion. Recurrent or severe heartburn and acid reflux require consultation with your doctor.





See your health care provider if heartburn or indigestion recurs for more than 2 weeks.

, Medications such as ranitidine (Zantac), cimetidine (Tagamet) and famotidine (Pepcid) act to block the histamine receptors that signal your stomach to produce acid.





Take H2 blockers before eating to prevent symptoms of acid reflux, or after eating to treat heartburn.
H2 blockers are available over the counter.

, Medications such as omeprazole (Prilosec, Nexium) prevent the production of stomach acid.





Taking PPIs for up to 2 weeks may not only relieve the symptoms of acid reflux, but can also repair the damage done to the esophageal lining.
Some PPIs are available over the counter. Others require a prescription.

, If you'd rather go the natural route, there are a few home remedies that are said to reduce acid reflux:





Drink one tablespoon of baking soda mixed with water.Eat raw almonds, which can balance your pH and reduce acid reflux.
Drink a few teaspoons of apple cider vinegar every day; it helps your digestive system do it's job properly.Drink chamomile tea.
Drink aloe vera juice.

, Before the invention of newer drugs like H-2 receptor blockers and Proton Pump Inhibitors, only herbal remedies were available to treat the gastric acid reflux. Herbs such as Glycerrhiza glabra or liquorice, Asparagus racemosus, Santalum album, Cyperus rotundus, Rubia Cordifolia, Ficus bengalensis, Fumaria parviflora, Bauhinia variegate, Mangifera indica, , are quite effective to reduce the gastric acid secretion, to heal the erosions of the soft mucosal linings of stomach and esophagus, to eliminate the infections such as H.Pylori. Similarly resonance homeopathic medicines like Natrum Phos and Argentum nit also help in GERD. Studies suggest that Natrum Phos may work by kick-starting the repair of damaged tissues. Studies suggest that Argentums nit may neutralize the acid present in the stomach for fast relief from heartburn.

Consult your doctor if lifestyle changes and medications do not successfully treat acid reflux.,
Undergo testing to determine causes and rule out other conditions.,
Explore the possibility of surgical repair.",How to Treat Acid Reflux3," In some cases home remedies, lifestyle changes and over-the-counter medications won't be sufficient. If your symptoms are painful or last more than 2 weeks, consult your doctor.




, Ulcers, cancer, and other conditions can cause acid reflux to occur. Tell your doctor you'd like to find out if an underlying condition is causing your symptoms.




, Certain problems, such as hiatal hernias, can be corrected through surgery. If you have chronic acid reflux, you may want to consider this option.





Traditional surgery can reconstruct the stomach opening to block reflux.
Less invasive options, done with endoscopic tubes, include stitching to tighten the loose sphincter, balloon stretching to ease blockages from scar tissue and cauterizing to remove damaged tissue.

Change the way you eat.,
Avoid food and beverage triggers.,
Shift your habits.,
Rethink the way you sleep.",How to Treat Acid Reflux Naturally1," You can change the types and amounts of foods you eat in order to make your acid reflux better. Decrease the amount of food you eat at any one time. This reduces the stress pressure on your stomach. Don’t eat for 2-3 hours before bedtime in order to reduce the risk of food putting pressure on the LES as you try to sleep.


Try to eat slowly because it allows the food to be digested more easily and quickly, leaving less food in the stomach adding pressure on the LES.;
, You need to figure out exactly what kinds of food trigger your acid reflux. Start keeping track of foods and beverages you eat and note any that cause you any problems. Use a common triggers list to begin with and add any foods or beverages that you know you are sensitive to. If any food you eat bothers you an hour later, you should eliminate that food from your diet.


For example, if you eat spaghetti and meatballs with tomato sauce for dinner and experience acid reflux within an hour, your trigger could be the spaghetti, the meatballs, or the tomato sauce. Next time, eliminate the tomato sauce. If you have no hyperacidity, you know that the tomato sauce is the trigger. If you still do, it could be the pasta or the meatballs. Next day, have some leftover pasta alone with no meatballs and no sauce. If you have hyperacidity, the pasta should be eliminated from your diet., There are certain things you can change in your everyday habits that can help with your acid reflux as well. Wear clothing that doesn’t constrict your stomach or abdomen. This causes unnecessary pressure on your stomach, which can cause acid reflux. You should also stop smoking because it increases the amount of acid in your stomach.


Try to lose weight, especially if you are severely overweight or obese. This will help reduce pressure on the LES and relieve your acid reflux., Some people have bad acid reflux overnight. If you have this problem, raise the entire head of the bed to allow gravity to help keep the acid in your stomach. This way, the acid will not creep into your esophagus overnight and cause you problems.


Piling up pillows won’t really help much as these tend to bend your neck and body in such a way that it actually increases the pressure and makes the hyperacidity worse."

And your doctor will probably want to know what you saw.Dark stool is called melena. It indicates that the blood is coming from your esophagus, stomach, or the beginning of the small intestine.
Causes include problems with the blood vessels, a tear in your esophagus, a stomach ulcer, inflammation of the stomach lining, blood supply being cut off to part of the intestines, an injury or object that is stuck in your digestive tract, or abnormal veins in your esophagus or stomach, called varices.;
, This is called hematochezia. It means that you are bleeding from lower in your digestive tract.Possible causes include: problems with the blood vessels or blood supply getting cut off in the small intestine, large intestine, rectum, or anus; a tear in the anus; polyps in the colon or small intestine; cancer in the colon or small intestine; infected pouches in the colon called diverticulitis; hemorrhoids; inflammatory bowel disease; an infection; an injury; or an object that is stuck in your lower digestive tract.

, It could be something you ate.If your stool is black, possible causes include black licorice, iron pills, Pepto-Bismol, beets, and blueberries.
If your stool is red, it could be from beets or tomatoes.
If you aren’t sure, the safest thing to do is to bring a sample to the doctor and they can test it to determine if you are actually passing blood.

, Even over-the-counter drugs can cause bleeding if taken in large amounts or for a long time. If this could be your situation, you should go to the doctor to discuss changing your medications. Medications that can do this include:


Blood thinners like aspirin, warfarin, and clopidogrel
Some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs which include ibuprofen or naproxen

, Your doctor will want to know:How much blood?
When did it start?
Could it be an injury?
Have you choked on anything recently?
Have you lost weight?
Do you have any symptoms of infection such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, or diarrhea?

, This may seem strange, but it will probably be necessary.During a rectal exam, the doctor will feel inside your rectum with a gloved finger.
It will be quick and painless.

, Depending on what the doctor suspects the cause is, he or she may recommend some of the following tests:Blood work.
An angiography. The doctor injects you with dye and then uses x-rays to see the arteries.Barium studies in which you swallow barium, which then shows up on an X-ray and lets the doctor see your digestive tract.A colonoscopy.An EGD or esophagogastroduodenoscopy. The doctor will put a scope down your throat to look at your esophagus, stomach, and small intestine.A capsule endoscopy in which you swallow a pill containing a video camera.A balloon-assisted enteroscopy in which the doctor can look at difficult-to-see areas of the small intestine.An endoscopic ultrasound that has an ultrasound device attached to the endoscope. Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to form a picture.An ERCP or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography which uses an endoscope and x-ray to see the gallbladder, liver, and pancreas.Multiphase CT enterography to view the walls of the bowels., Problems that often heal without intervention include:Hemorrhoids, also called piles, which may be swollen or itchy.
An anal fissure, which is a small tear in the skin around the anus. It is painful and may take a few weeks to heal.
A viral or bacterial infection, called gastroenteritis, will often heal on its own if you stay hydrated and allow your body to fight it.Low fiber diets can cause straining when you are passing stools. A diet rich in fiber will reduce straining when you go to the bathroom, making stool passage easier.

, This is often necessary for diverticulitis.Antibiotics will help clear bacteria out of the pouches and bulges in your bowels.
Your doctor may recommend eating only fluids for a few days to reduce the amount of feces your digestive tract must process.

, There are several methods which involve using an endoscopy to treat the damaged tissue:An endoscopic thermal probe uses heat to stop the bleeding, particularly for an ulcer.
Endoscopic cryotherapy freezes abnormal blood vessels.
Endoscopic clips will close an open wound.
Endoscopic intracranial cyanoacrylate injection uses a type of glue to seal a bleeding blood vessel.

, Conditions that are often treated with surgery include:


An anal fistula, where a passage forms between the bowels and the skin near the anus. This often happens after an abscess bursts. It usually doesn't heal without surgery.Recurrent diverticulitis.Bowel polyps. These are small bumps that are usually not cancerous, but usually need to be removed., If your bleeding is caused by an ulcer or by gastritis, these medications may be able to treat your underlying condition. Talk to your doctor to see if a prescription is right for you., Rectal bleeding, if severe, may cause anemia because of the blood loss. If you are feeling dizzy, fatigued, lightheaded, or weak, you should visit your doctor to get tested for anemia. Most mild forms of anemia can be treated by taking iron supplements , The treatments vary based upon where it is located and at what stage it is. Possible options include:Surgery

Understand how SSNS is treated.",How to Treat Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome," This is important and is the opportunity to participate in important aspects of your child's care. Here's what you can do to make the process as smooth as possible:



Weight monitoring. Weight monitoring should be done as often as daily or every other day if frequent relapses continue to occur or treatment with high dose prednisone is ongoing. If your child's weight begins to increase quickly without explanation and while in remission, it may indicate the imminent onset of a relapse.

Keep track of medication and dosages. Medication lists can be very helpful, especially if kept in a notebook with ""erasable"" paper. Medication doses change frequently in those with SSNS and are easily confused or changes forgotten. This is an important safety measure.

Urine monitoring. Home monitoring of urine protein is easily done using a test strip — a thin plastic strip about 3 inches (7.6 cm) long and ¼ inch in diameter. These can be purchased in bottles of 50 and 100. Testing the first urine made in the morning is highly preferable. In remission, periodic urine checking may allow the early identification of an imminent or partial relapse.;
, This is a corticosteroid medication (frequently referred to as a ""steroid""). Prednisone has several immunosuppressive properties and has been the mainstay of INS treatment for decades. In addition to being the initial drug of choice for INS, it also is a strong predictive indicator of outcome.


Patients whose INS is, and remains, responsive to steroid treatment have high likelihoods of the disease eventually resolving.
There are several corticosteroids closely related to prednisone that may be used as well. These are called prednisolone and methylprednisolone.
For the initial episode of nephrotic syndrome, the recommended dose of oral prednisone is 2 milligrams per kilogram body weight (or 60 milligrams per square meter body surface area) per day. Daily treatment continues for 4-6 weeks during which time most patients who will be steroid sensitive will have responded.
Following this, most treatment protocols reduce the dose and give it every other day after which the dosage is slowly tapered. The total initial period of treatment is 4-8 months.

, The immunosuppressive effect of these drugs is primarily due to their interference with white blood cell chemical signaling that allows them to provide a coordinated immunological response. These were initially applied in kidney transplantation but have been used to treat INS for many years.


The drug names are cyclosporine and tacrolimus. These have become the most frequent second line treatment of choice as an alternative to prednisone.
Side effects for both of these medications are risk of infection, and both are potentially toxic to the kidney and require careful monitoring. Cyclosporine may cause abnormal hair growth (hirsutism) and tacrolimus, which rarely causes a diabetes mellitus-like condition.
A disadvantage of treatment with these drugs is the need for periodic measurements of the blood level, which is used to determine the proper dose.

, This drug also provides immunosuppression by interfering with white blood cell growth. Although serious infections may occur with MMF, they appear to be less frequent then with the alkylating agents.


Some patients must continue to take prednisone in combination with MMF to be effective. Therefore, those patients with serious steroid side effects may not benefit.
Side effects are mostly gastrointestinal: cramps, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.
For a treatment regimen, talk to your doctor. He or she will know what's appropriate for your child.

, These drugs were first used as cancer chemotherapy agents. They work by interfering with cell replication and therefore have the greatest effect on cells that are growing and dividing rapidly. This is why they are useful in many cancers.


Alkylating agents are principally used in patients who have SSNS with frequent relapses or severe corticosteroid side effects. Today, they are rarely used in patients with steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome.
Cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil are the most frequently used forms and are given orally. Treatment with oral cyclophosphamide is usually limited to three months with a total dose of approximately 180 milligram per kilogram body weight. This dose appears to minimize the risk of infertility.
Principal serious side effects include increased risk of infection, infertility (dose-related), and severe bladder wall injury (hemorrhagic cystitis). Temporary hair thinning or loss may also occur.

, Unfortunately, most patients will relapse at some point, at which time they are retreated with prednisone in a similar starting dose but with a somewhat more abbreviated total treatment period.


One of the greatest challenges of prednisone treatment (and especially starting it back up) is balancing benefit against side effects. There are numerous side effects (discussed above), whose risks increase with longer duration of therapy.
There are several self-help publications that focus on managing mood swings and behavior changes, and appetite leading to obesity. They may help make everything more manageable., Unfortunately, with nephrotic syndrome, the complications practically outweigh the actual problem. Here are a few tactics to employ to ensure your child's health:


Do not end corticosteroid therapy abruptly unless specifically instructed by a physician.
Write down the corticosteroid doses – they may change frequently and in potentially confusing ways. And be sure to keep up with prescription supply.
Avoid contact with kids who are sick, in general. Avoid chicken pox exposure if your child has not previously had chickenpox or the vaccine. If there is exposure to chicken pox, or the appearance of shingles, contact your doctor promptly.
Routine non-live virus vaccines should be given on a normal schedule including the annual influenza vaccination. Give the pneumococcal vaccine. Avoid live virus vaccines until, if possible, your child is off all immunosuppressive medications.
Test for proteinuria frequently and report increased protein on first morning urine dipstick testing of 2+ (100 mg/dL) or greater on 2 consecutive days or if edema appears.

, In general, patients with nephrotic edema need only modest restrictions of fluid to see improvement. A simple way to modestly reduce fluid is to drink from a smaller cup. A smaller amount of fluid filling a small cup may be enough to quench thirst.


Do this very carefully. The last thing you want to add onto your plate is dehydration. Talk to your doctor about what a reasonable intake of water is for your child's situation.

, It’s important to recognize that the dietary intake of sodium from salt in the average American diet has 5 to 10 times the average daily requirement. Some useful diet guidelines include: Eat more foods with high quality protein and/or low salt, including unprocessed fresh vegetables, fresh fruit, milk and yogurt, chicken, fresh cut meat, and fish.
Avoid fast food, processed foods (luncheon meats, cheese, hot dogs), canned and dry mix soups, and snacks (chips, pretzels, salted nuts, and similar snacks).
Don't add salt to food when cooking and keep the saltshaker off of the table.

If more precise dietary salt restriction is necessary, a good place to start in the average child would be about 1600 mg of sodium per day. Sodium content is listed in the nutrition facts of most foods. Some will be expressed as milliequivalents rather than milligrams. 1 mEq = 23 mg of sodium.



, This class of medications has direct effects on various parts of the kidney filter to promote fluid and sodium excretion as a means of eliminating excess water from the body. Care must be taken since long-term or high-dose diuretic treatment can lead to serious disturbances of mineral electrolyte balance as well as dangerous reduction of the blood volume.


When there is doubt, FENa is a test you can take that has proved useful in evaluating the state of blood volume and, ergo, how aggressively diuretics may be used. This test uses a simultaneously obtained blood and urine sample to calculate a ""fractional excretion of sodium"" (hence the name). Tracking this measurement can contribute to treatment decision-making.
The principal diuretics used for nephrotic edema management are furosemide, thiazides, and metolozone.

, When edema is problematic and not responsive to dietary measures, furosemide (Lasix) is most commonly used, beginning at a dose of approximately 1-2 milligrams per kilogram body weight.


Furosemide may be given several times a day, although a higher total dose rather than dividing the dose throughout the day may be more effective. Do not adjust the doses without medical guidance!
With edema that is more resistant to treatment, furosemide may be combined with either a thiazide diuretic or metolozone.

Use of diuretic therapy to manage edema is only temporizing while awaiting disease remission.



, The use of albumin to remove fluid is not universally accepted as effective but does appear to be quite beneficial in certain patients. It may be particularly useful in the settings where there is a lot of edema but blood volume appears low. In that circumstance, more aggressive removal of fluid can lead to acute kidney failure.


Albumin is generally given at an infusion center or hospital clinic. It is almost always combined with a diuretic.
The logic is that by giving a large dose intravenous albumin over a short time, the blood albumin level will rise, fluid will tend to move back into the blood compartment at which time a diuretic can be more effective at promoting excretion of the additional fluid.
This is only a temporizing measure in those who have moderately severe edema, fluid in the abdomen or even in the chest sometimes affecting breathing, or while treating a skin infection or peritonitis.

, This is not a commonly used treatment, partly because it is time-consuming and the necessary facilities are not generally available. Nevertheless it is worth mentioning since it is a safe, non-pharmacologic approach to controlling edema. Here's what you should know:


When an edematous individual stands upright in water up to the shoulders or neck, the water pressure in the lower part of the body drives fluid from the skin back into the circulation.
Following 3-4 hours per day of immersion, significant fluid can be mobilized in this fashion and subsequently excreted. It requires a bath or pool deep enough to stand in and the patience to do so for prolonged periods of time.
It may, under certain circumstances, be a useful adjunct to other therapies.

, Unfortunately, one of the most common side effects of being on steroid therapy is an increased appetite, weight gain, and obesity. If your child is on a long-term treatment program, this has to be a concern as weight gain can lead to heart problems, diabetes, high blood pressure, and numerous other health issues.


Focus your child's diet on leafy green vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean meats, and low-fat dairy products.
Stay away from processed goods and fast food — they're full of bad fats, calories, salt, and additives your body doesn't even recognize.Try to eat smaller meals more often. This keeps the metabolism up, fights the constant cravings that come with steroid therapy, and keeps your child from eating too much in one sitting.

, To combat potential weight gain from drug therapy, starting an exercise program may be necessary. A combined diet and exercise program can keep your child's treatment symptoms at bay.It's recommended to get 30 minutes of exercise 5 days a week. Though moderate cardiovascular exercise is best, anything that fits into your schedule and matches your ability is a step in the right direction.
Try to make life more active in general. Switch up the movies for a swim or a hike; take the stairs instead of the elevator; take Fluffy for a longer walk. Even small changes add up!

, Edema, the swelling in various parts of the body due to excess water accumulation, is the initial symptom of nephrotic syndrome in about 95% of the patients.Common places for this extra fluid include the face (around the eyes and particularly in the morning after lying in bed all night), the legs (particularly the lower legs and after being upright during the day), within the abdominal cavity (where there is lots of space for it to accumulate), and in the genitalia.
It may be mild or sufficiently severe to cause a great deal of discomfort. As blood levels of proteins decrease, a portion of water contained in the blood moves out of the blood vessel and into surrounding tissue.

, Elevated levels of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides result from abnormal processing of the cholesterol and triglyceride precursors in the nephrotic syndrome. Relatedly, obesity and/or weight gain is a common side effect, too.


In severe and prolonged nephrotic syndrome these levels may be extremely high, raising concerns about long-term heart disease and cardiovascular risk in general.

, Increased risks of serious bacterial infections are seen in people with nephrotic syndrome. There are several changes that occur in the efficiency of our immune systems that principally result from losing certain proteins in the urine: sepsis (bacteria in the blood), peritonitis (bacterial infection in the abdomen), and cellulitis (bacterial infection of the skin) are the most common.


The most frequently seen bacterial organisms causing these infections are Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) and bowel bacteria such as Escherichia coli.

, Disturbances of blood clotting can lead to thrombosis (blood clots forming within body blood vessels) of major blood vessels. This is, however, more common in adult forms of nephrotic syndrome.


It is principally the result of imbalances of normal blood clotting regulation, with increases of factors that enhance blood clotting accompanied by urinary losses of substances that inhibit blood clotting.

, Acute kidney failure associated with the nephrotic syndrome is uncommon, particularly in the idiopathic nephrotic syndrome of childhood. When it does occur, it is usually the result of dehydration in the blood compartment of the body.


Both the very low blood protein levels leading to loss of blood volume, and fluid losses from acute illnesses with dehydration can combine and lead to poor blood flow to the kidney. This is often reversible with prompt treatment of the underlying problem.

, Unfortunately, prolonged steroid therapy has its own complications. Each case is different, and your child may experience only some of these symptoms. Knowing that, here are the most common side effects of prolonged therapy:


Weight gain, increased appetite, and obesity
""Cushingoid” facial changes (rounded face sometimes called a ""moon"" face)
Infection
Growth delay
Cataracts
High blood pressure
High blood sugars
Weakening of the bones (osteopenia)
Skin stretch marks

Serious side effects may not be experienced by a child whose SSNS relapses are infrequent and require only modest does of steroids.



, This is a syndrome, after all, and not a disease. The main characteristics of nephrotic syndrome include:



Excessive leakage of protein from the blood into the urine. In children the amount of protein lost is usually more than 1 gram per m2 body surface area per 24 hours.

Decreased serum albumin level to less than 2.5 grams per deciliter. Albumin is a key protein measured in the blood. A deciliter is 100 milliliters (this is a standard way to express certain laboratory results).

Edema and/or ascites. Edema is accumulation of fluid under the skin to cause swelling. Ascites is accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity.

Elevated serum lipid levels. The most common elevations are in the LDL (bad) cholesterol and triglycerides.

, Normal kidneys each contain about 1 million microscopic blood filters that conduct the process of cleaning the blood and adjusting body chemistry. Your blood flows into, through, and out of these filters through small blood vessels (capillaries). The kidneys are quite efficient, and only very small amounts of these important substances like protein are lost into the urine during the filtering process.


While small but still abnormal amounts of proteinuria (protein in the urine) may be seen in certain kidney diseases, in nephrotic syndrome the amount of protein lost is sufficient to significantly lower blood protein levels.
Albumin is one of the proteins lost in the urine and, when measured in the blood, is used as an indicator of the severity of proteinuria.

, The most common group of kidney diseases in children characterized by nephrotic syndrome is referred to as idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (""idiopathic"" meaning that it arises spontaneously). In other words, in most cases, it's not known what causes the syndrome.


Nephrotic syndrome in children as a result of other acquired kidney diseases may also occur.
In addition, there are rare hereditary (genetic) causes of nephrotic syndrome, most of which manifest in infancy.

, The most common type of nephrotic syndrome is ""Idiopathic Nephrotic Syndrome."" ""Idiopathic"" means that it arises spontaneously and for seemingly no reason. Of all causes of nephrotic syndrome, INS is the cause in about 90% of children between the ages of 1 and 8 years of age and about 50% of adolescents.


The cause of nephrotic syndrome in INS is still not completely understood but it appears to be a disturbance of the function of the capillary filtration membrane in the glomerulus.
There are numerous forms of INS, but the most common are minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). The terminology can be confusing because there can be some overlap between these two forms and the general implications about long-term outcome are very different:

MCNS has a much greater likelihood of eventually resolving than FSGS. The chance of the disease eventually causing deterioration of kidney function and kidney failure is much greater for FSGS.



, There is a second way to classify these two diseases that is often more practical. Prednisone (a corticosteroid medication) is the most frequently used drug to treat INS. Child patients whose disease responds to prednisone or related medications are likely to have a favorable outcome regardless of whether the disease is MCNS or FSGS.


Those whose disease responds to prednisone are generally referred to as steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome, SSNS, while the others have steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS).
The likelihood of a favorable response to prednisone is much higher in MCNS compared to FSGS.

, In most children with SSNS, episodes of proteinuria reoccur, often over a period of years. In some, these ""relapses"" are infrequent and in others they may occur 3-4 times year or more. Treatment strategies must take the frequency and severity of relapses into account.


The main goal is to achieve and sustain remission while avoiding, as much as possible, the possible adverse effects of therapy.
Treatment issues for SSNS can be considered in three groups: treating the symptoms of nephrotic syndrome, treating the disease itself, and taking other steps to minimize and/or managing the potential complications of SSNS.

Talk to your doctor first.,
Drink aloe vera juice.,
Try apple cider vinegar.,
Make citrus water.,
Consume more apples.,
Drink ginger tea.,
Try other types of tea.,
Take other herbal remedies.",How to Treat Acid Reflux Naturally2," There a number of different herbal approaches to treat hyperacidity, but you need to be careful. Talk to your physician first before trying these remedies. In general, natural remedies are very safe, but it is best to be certain they are safe for you. Combining these herbal approaches with the lifestyle modifications should significantly improve how you feel on a daily basis.


If you are pregnant, speak to your physician about using any of the herbs to ensure they won't hurt your baby. , Aloe vera is not just good for the outside of your body. Aloe vera juice has many healing qualities as well. Buy organic aloe vera juice. Pour 1/2 cup into a glass and drink. You can sip this multiple times throughout the day, but since aloe vera can act as a laxative, you may want to limit it to a total of 1-2 cups a day.


Aloe juice decreases inflammation and acts to neutralize the stomach acid. , Although it may seem counter-intuitive, you can use apple cider vinegar to help with acid reflux. Add 1 tablespoon of organic apple cider vinegar to 6 ounces of water. Stir it together well and drink. The vinegar doesn’t have to be organic, but only use apple cider vinegar.


Other vinegars don’t work as well and can end up making your problem worse., You can use citrus fruits to make a drink similar to lemonade or limeade that will help with your acid reflux. Squeeze a few teaspoons of pure lemon or lime juice and add water to taste. Add a bit of honey or a tiny bit of stevia, a natural sweetener, to the drink if you want to make it a little sweater. Drink this before, during, and after meals.


To make the drink more interesting, you can add both kinds of juices if you want.
The extra acid in the juices tell your body that it can shut down acid production by a process called feedback inhibition., Just as the old saying goes, you should eat at least one apple a day. Apples are very good for you and help to calm acid reflux. The pectin in the apple skin acts as a natural antacid.If you don't like eating plain apples, try adding them to a salad or putting them in a smoothie.

, Ginger acts as an anti-inflammatory and a soothing agent for the stomach. It can also help with nausea and vomiting. To make your own ginger tea, cut up about 1 teaspoon of fresh ginger and add it to boiling water. Let the mixture steep for about 5 minutes. Pour it into a mug and drink.


Do this anytime during the day, but especially about 20-30 minutes before meals.
You can buy ginger tea bags if you don't have any fresh ginger., You can make a few other varieties of tea to help with your acid reflux. Fennel helps settle the stomach and decreases the acid levels. To make fennel tea, crush about a teaspoon of fennel seeds and add it to a cup of boiled water. Add honey or some stevia to taste and drink 2-3 cups a day about 20 minutes before meals.


You can also use mustard seeds or powder to make a tea. Mustard acts as an anti-inflammatory and as an acid neutralizer. You can dissolve it in water to make a tea. If you are up to it, you can take 1 teaspoon of mustard by mouth.
You can also try chamomile tea to calm the stomach and act as an anti-inflammatory agent. You can buy chamomile tea in bags or as loose leaf tea., There are a few other herbs that can be taken to help your acid reflux. Deglycyrrhizinated licorice root (DGL) works very well to heal the stomach and control hyperacidity. It comes as chewable tablets, but bear in mind that the taste might take some getting used to. The standard dose of DGL is 2-3 tablets every 4-6 hours.


Try some slippery elm, which you can have either as 3-4 ounce drink or as a tablet. It coats and soothes irritated tissues. Slippery elm is considered safe in pregnancy.
Make sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions."
"
Make a baking soda drink.,
Chew gum.,
Attempt the heel drop.,
Use coconut oil.,
Eat probiotics.",How to Treat Acid Reflux Naturally3," Baking soda is a base, which means it helps counteract the effects of acid. This holds true for the acid in your stomach. To make this drink, dissolve a teaspoon of baking soda in about 6 ounces of water. Stir it well and drink. It is very effective in neutralizing the acid.


Make sure you get baking soda and not baking powder. Baking powder is not nearly as effective., After you eat, pop in a piece of sugar-free gum. This appears to work because chewing the gum stimulates the salivary glands, which releases bicarbonate into the saliva. The bicarbonate help neutralize the acid in your stomach.Don't chew sugary gum because it may contribute to the acid in your stomach.
You can also chew mastic gum. Mastic gum is made from a resin of the mastic tree, known as Pistacia lentiscus. It has antibacterial properties and has been used to kill the H. pylori infection often associated with peptic ulcers or too much stomach acid., There is a chiropractic approach that is used to treat hiatal hernias that is also effective for acid reflux. Drink a 6 to 8 ounce glass of slightly warm water the moment you get out of bed in the morning. While you are standing, bring your arms straight out to the sides and bend them at the elbows. Then, bring both hands in to meet at your chest. Stand up high on your toes, then drop down on your heels. Repeat 10 times.


After the 10th drop, keeping your arms up, pant in short, quick, shallow breaths for 15 seconds. Repeat every morning until you get relief.
This process seems to realign your stomach and diaphragm, so the hernia does not interfere with your esophagus., Coconut oil has antibacterial properties that help stop acid reflux. This may be the reason that chronic H. pylori stomach infections respond quite well to this simple home remedy. The bacterium H. pylori is often associated with reflux esophagitis.


Take 1/2 a tablespoon of coconut oil in warm orange juice, or directly by mouth if you can, three times daily. You can work this up to one to two tablespoons of coconut oil three times daily.
Stop three days after your symptoms have subsided., Probiotics are mixtures of a variety of bacteria normally found in your gut, which may include saccharomyces boulardii yeast, cultures of lactobacillus, and bifidobacterium. These good bacteria tend to improve overall well being, help with stomach health, and are all naturally found in your intestines.


You can easily get probiotics by eating yogurt with active cultures in it. You can also take a supplement, though make sure you follow the manufacturer's warnings."
"
Take quiet time.,
Try progressive muscle relaxation.,
Take a mental vacation.,
Try emergency stress relievers.,
Practice good sleep hygiene.,
Establish a relaxing bedtime routine.,
Seek medical attention if necessary.",How to Treat Acid Reflux Naturally4," Stress, especially chronic stress, has been linked to acid reflux. To help with your condition, you need to destress everyday. To relax, go into a quiet room or a quiet space outside and breathe deeply for a few minutes. Inhale through your nose slowly, and exhale through your mouth. Take twice as long to exhale as you do to inhale. If you have trouble keeping straight how long you breath, counting can be helpful. Inhale for the count of 6 to 8 counts and exhale, counting to 12 to 16. Repeat as often as you can., Since stress is such a common problem, the American Psychological Association (APA) has come up with multiple ways to help you relax. They suggest progressive muscle relaxation. For this exercise, stand straight up. Contract the muscles in your feet and lower legs, tightening them as much as possible for 30 seconds. After this amount of time, slowly release the tension. Move on to your upper legs and repeat.


Continue these exercises for your hands and lower arms, upper arms and shoulders, and finally your stomach and abdominal muscles. Repeat daily., The APA also suggests that, no matter where you are and even if you can't go on an actual vacation, you can take a mental vacation. Take a few deep breaths, relax, and close your eyes. Imagine the most beautiful place you have ever been or your dream vacation spot.


Try to experience that place as fully as you can, smelling the smells, feeling a breeze, hearing the sounds. Repeat daily., The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends certain emergency stress relievers. They suggest that, if you find yourself under too much stress, count to 10 before you speak, take 3-5 deep breaths, walk away from the stressful situation, and say you'll handle it later. You can also try going for a walk to clear your head.


To reduce stress, don't be afraid to say ""I'm sorry"" if you make a mistake.
Avoid stressful situation by setting your watch 5-10 minutes ahead to avoid the stress of being late, driving in the slow lane, and avoiding busy roads to help you stay calm while driving.
Break down big problems into smaller parts. For example, answer one letter or phone call per day, instead of dealing with everything at once., Your sleep hygiene is your daily routine of sleep related activities and your sleeping patterns. The National Sleep Foundation (NSF) recommends that you avoid naps during the day because naps tend to disturb the normal cycle of sleep and wakefulness. Also avoid stimulants, which include caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol, too close to bedtime. Alcohol can help you get to sleep, but can disrupt sleep later on as the body begins to metabolize the alcohol.


Only do vigorous exercise in the morning or late afternoon. Try more relaxing exercises, like stretching or yoga, later at night to help get a full night's sleep.
Avoid large meals, chocolate, and spicy foods around bedtime.
Make sure you get exposure to natural sunlight. Light exposure helps maintain a healthy sleep-wake cycle., Try to avoid any emotional, physical, or mental upset before trying to go to sleep. Try not to dwell on problems in bed. If you find yourself reviewing the day or reviewing problems you have, try getting up again for 10-15 minutes.


During this time, do something that relaxes you like reading a book, doing deep breathing exercises, or meditating. Then, try going back to bed.
Associate your bed with sleep. Don’t use the bed to watch TV, listen to the radio, or read. If you link your bed with activities, your body will not want to sleep while in it., If you have faithfully tried the lifestyle modifications and the natural remedies recommended and still have no relief after about 2-3 weeks, call your physician. You may need more direct medical help.


If you are pregnant or nursing, call your physician for advice on dealing with hyperacidity. Don’t try any of these approaches without discussing it with your physician first.
If you are taking medications and believe that your hyperacidity may be caused by these medications, call your physician and see if the medications or dose can be changed.

Determine if you have H. pylori bacteria in your system.,
Know that long-term use of anti inflammatory drugs such as Ibuprofen weaken the lining of the stomach, making it vulnerable to ulcer formation.

,
Understand that cigarette smoking raises your risk to develop a peptic ulcer, which, left untreated, can metamorphose into a bleeding ulcer.,
Realize that caffeine has a negative impact on your digestive functions.,
Consider the affect alcohol has on your ulcer.",How to Treat a Bleeding Ulcer1,"


H. pylori is a harmful bacterium that preys on weak areas of the digestive tract. It eats away at the protective mucus that coats the stomach. The newly created vulnerable spot in the stomach is irritated by stomach acid and H. pylori forming an ulcer. Many people have H. pylori bacteria but do not have ulcers. H. pylori — coupled with the wrong lifestyle choices and diet — are the main cause of most ulcers.;
,,


Nicotine raises stomach acid production, which can erode the stomach lining or further deteriorate an existing ulcer to cause a bleeding ulcer.

,


Like nicotine, caffeine spurs stomach acid production.

,


Alcohol — especially when consumed en masse and often — weakens the stomach lining making it susceptible to acid and a harmful bacteria.

Note that there is no cure.",How to Test for Mthfr," This gene allows the body to produce methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), an enzyme that plays a key role in the body's ability to process amino acids.Your body uses amino acids to build proteins and other bodily compounds.
More specifically, without MTHFR, the body isn't able to effectively convert the amino acid homocysteine to a secondary amino acid known as methionine.
Methionine is needed to maintain the body's metabolism and developmental capabilities. If your body doesn't have enough methionine, you could be more prone to certain cognitive, physical, and mood disorders.;
, There are multiple types of MTHFR gene mutation, but the most common cause abnormally high levels of the homocysteine enzyme to linger in the blood.When someone inherits the mutated MTHFR gene from both parents, that individual typically develops homocystinuria. This is the most common form of MTHFR deficiency, and it can also be the most problematic.
Too much homocysteine in the blood also means that there is not enough converted methionine.
When the balance of homocysteine and methionine collapses, the body is more likely to experience various physiological and psychological health problems.

, MTHFR gene deficiencies do not exhibit the sort of symptoms you would expect of a disease. Since the problem lies within your genetic code, the symptoms of MTHFR deficiency will actually reveal themselves as other illnesses, conditions, and disorders.Many of the medical conditions linked to MTHFR deficiency are fairly common, and on their own, they may not be indicative of a deeper problem. If you experience two or more of these medical conditions, however, it might be worth getting tested. This is especially true if the conditions you develop otherwise seem unrelated.

, Inadequate amounts of methionine can hinder the function of neurotransmitters in the brain, resulting in certain mood and memory disorders.MTHFR deficiency could be to blame if you struggle with clinical depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, insomnia, schizophrenia, and Parkinson’s disease.
Additionally, MTHFR related neurotransmitter issues could increase the risk of developing addictions to tobacco, alcohol, drugs, or other chemical substances.

, High levels of homocysteine are linked to many types of cardiovascular diseases and related disorders. As such, cardiovascular risks could be indicative of an MTHFR deficiency.


Heart attack, stroke, coronary artery disease, deep vein thrombosis, excessive clotting, and glaucoma are all disorders that have been linked to this type of deficiency.

, MTHFR mutations can also cause the body to have difficulty processing folic acid (vitamin B9).

A woman who is unable to process folic acid is more likely to experience problems related to pregnancy, including frequent miscarriages, still births, and pre-eclampsia.
This inability can also affect the developing fetus and might be responsible for certain birth defects, including cleft lips and cleft palates. The fetus can also develop brain defects like spina bifida, in which the bones of the spinal column fail to close around the nerves of the spinal cord, or anencephaly, in which large parts of the brain or skull bone do not form.

, MTHFR deficiency can also reduce the body's ability to eliminate heavy metals and other toxins, which can but stress on nearly all bodily systems.


Genetic immune and autoimmune disorders can be linked to this deficiency, as can severe allergies, chronic fatigue, frequent headaches, and insomnia.
An inability to eliminate toxins can also lead to thyroid disorders, menstrual disorders, kidney damage, and cancer.

, Medical problems that result from a combination of neurotransmitter, cardiovascular, developmental, and/or toxin elimination problems can also be indicative of MTHFR deficiency.


In particular, this can include fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, autism spectrum disorders, and peripheral neuropathy.

, Since MTHFR deficiency is a genetic disorder, it will probably run in the family. Others in your family will probably have the deficiency, too, especially close relatives.If one of your relatives has a known MTHFR deficiency, it's a good idea to talk to your doctor about testing yourself, too. This is especially true if you, your parents, your siblings, or your grandparents have experienced any of the known disorders linked to the deficiency.
Since medical knowledge about MTHFR is fairly recent, it is possible that your ancestors may have had the deficiency without an official diagnosis. If your family medical history includes many of the disorders linked to MTHFR, there is a stronger probability that an unknown MTHFR deficiency has been passed down to you.

, By testing for MTHFR abnormalities, you can identify future risk factors and take preventative measures to avoid certain health problems.


Since you'll need to develop a condition indicative of MTHFR deficiency before you might suspect a problem, testing for irregularities in the gene might seem pointless at first. By testing for the MTHFR abnormality, though, you can learn whether or not the problem is actually linked to the MTHFR gene. If it is, you can take preventative measures to stop other related disorders and conditions from developing.

, If you have two more more related health conditions, talk to your general physician about testing for MTHFR genetic mutations.


Your doctor will be able to discuss and analyze the risk more thoroughly. If he or she agrees that testing might be wise, your doctor can take steps to order it.
Depending on the circumstances, your doctor will either collect the necessary sample and send it to an analysis laboratory or send you to a hospital that will collect and analyze the sample in the same location.

, The most common and most accurate test for MTHFR mutations will be a blood test. Your doctor will collect the necessary blood sample and send it for analysis at an appropriate laboratory.


The lab technicians will study your blood sample at a genetic level and look for abnormalities in the MTHFR gene.

, During a saliva test, your doctor will collect a sample by swabbing the inside of your cheek. That sample will also be sent to a lab for genetic analysis.


Saliva tests are generally less thorough and may not be as accurate as blood tests, so your doctor is less likely to use it.
There are currently no home-based genetic tests that are approved for MTHFR diagnostic purposes. Even if you take DNA test that allows you to collect and send your own sample, you will only get raw data back, and you probably won't be able to decipher that data without professional medical knowledge.

, When the results come back, they will show as either positive or negative.


Positive results will usually name the specific mutation, as well. A written interpretation of those results might be included, but if it isn't, you will need your doctor to explain the results to you.
After you receive the results, you should also talk to your doctor about possible treatment plans.

, Since many of the medical problems associated with MTHFR mutation are connected to folate deficiencies, you might be able to help counteract those problems by consuming more external folate.


Include more folate-rich foods in your regular diet. Good options include spinach, asparagus, chickpeas, beans, and broccoli.
Consider taking a methyl folate supplement on a daily basis, as well. The supplement should provide your body with converted folate it can use to maintain bodily functions.

, MTHFR deficiencies can make it difficult for your body to naturally eliminate toxins, so you might be able to help your body by undergoing the occasional liver cleanse.


Popular liver cleanses include grapefruit and Epsom salt, cranberry juice, and apple cider vinegar.
You can also help cleanse your liver by avoiding foods that hurt the liver, consuming more foods that help the liver, and maintaining a healthier lifestyle.

, If there are other risk factors that may put your overall health at risk, your doctor may prescribe a stronger supplemental treatment to help provide your body with what it lacks.


One of the most common prescription treatments is 5-MTHF supplementation. This is the end product of healthy, normal MTHFR catalytic reactions. Since your body isn't producing enough 5-MTHF, artificial supplementation may help correct some of the problems caused by the deficiency., MTHFR abnormalities are a genetic problem, so no medication, surgery, or other treatment can correct it.


Once you know about the problem, though, you can take measures to combat it and reduce your risk of experiencing further MTHFR complications.

Go to the doctor if you think you might have Crohn’s.,
Get a medical exam.,
Ask your doctor about symptom relief.,
Make a treatment plan with your doctor.,
Consult your doctor about alternative therapies.",How to Treat Crohns with Natural Remedies1," The disease can be debilitating and requires medical supervision. If you have the following symptoms, you should get checked:Diarrhea.
Fever. Many people with Crohn’s suffer from low fevers during flare ups.
Exhaustion.
Abdominal cramps and discomfort. If it is severe, you may also feel nauseous or vomit.
Bloody stool. This may be fresh red blood in your stool or you may pass black or tarry stool.
Mouth sores.
Lack of hunger and weight loss.
Pain or drainage around the anus.
Inflammation of your skin, eyes, and joints.
Inflammation of the liver or bile ducts.
Delayed growth and sexual maturation in children.;
, The doctor will likely do a series of tests to determine whether you have Crohn’s. This may include:Blood tests to check whether you are anemic.
Stool tests to determine if you are passing blood.
A CT scan. During a CT scan you will lie very still inside the scanner while it takes a series of X-rays of your body. The machine will take a series of images which get put together to form a detailed picture of your organs.An MRI. During an MRI you will lie inside a machine which will use magnets and radio waves to create a picture of your organs. The machine may be loud. Tell the doctor if you are pregnant or have metal or electronic implants in your body. You should also tell the doctor if you have had an injury that left metal shards in your body or are a welder.An endoscopy to take pictures of the inside of your digestive tract. This may be done by having you swallow a camera in a capsule or by using a scope.

, Crohn's can cause diarrhea and abdominal discomfort that can make it difficult to go about your daily life. Your doctor may be able to recommend medications for quick relief.Anti-diarrheal medications. This could be either a fiber supplement (Metamucil, Citrucel) or stronger medication like loperamide (Imodium).
Pain relievers. Your doctor may recommend painkillers with acetaminophen (Tylenol, and others). Other over-the-counter painkillers may exacerbate your symptoms. This includes ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, and others) and naproxen (Aleve and Anaprox).

, What your doctor recommends will vary based on the severity of your condition. If you have a preference for natural remedies, discuss this with your doctor. It may be possible to use natural remedies in addition to other options. However, it is crucial to discuss it with your doctor because some remedies and supplements may interact with medications. Your doctor may suggest several different types of medications:Anti-inflammatory drugs. These may be prescribed to reduce the inflammation of the digestive tissues and get your Crohn’s flare up to go into remission. In general two types may be prescribed: Oral 5-aminosalicylates or corticosteroids. Oral 5-amniosalicylates have side effects that include diarrhea, vomiting, heartburn, and headaches. Corticosteroids may be associated with puffiness in the face, facial hair, night sweats, insomnia, hyperactivity, high blood pressure, diabetes, osteoporosis, eye problems, and increased vulnerability to infections.
Immune system suppressors. These drugs may be prescribed in different combinations. These drugs reduce inflammation by lowering the activity of the immune system. They may have serious side effects over the long term including increasing your risk of infections, cancer, and liver problems. Some of these medications cannot be used by men or women for 6 months before they try to have a baby because they may cause birth defects.
Antibiotics. The effectiveness of antibiotics as a treatment is controversial. However, if you have fistulas or abscesses, they can speed up healing. They may also reduce the levels of pathogenic bacteria in your digestive tract, promoting healing and remission.

, These may be done in addition to medication, if your doctor feels it is necessary. Talk to your doctor to figure out what is likely to be best for you.Nutrition therapy. This is important if your symptoms were so severe that they have resulted in malnutrition. Children may also require nutrition therapy if they are not absorbing enough nutrients to grow and develop. Nutrition can be administered through a feeding tube or intravenously. It will also enable your digestive tract to rest which can promote healing and lessening of inflammation.
Surgery. If nothing else works, your doctor may need to do surgery to remove unhealthy parts of your intestines, treat abscesses and fistulas, or expand areas of the intestine that have become too narrow.

Take antacids.,
Try H2 blockers.,
Look into proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).",How to Treat Acid Reflux Naturally5," There are several over the counter medications that you can use to help with your acid reflux. There are many different brands, but they typically have the same function. Antacids help neutralize the acid in your stomach. These are generally used to provide relief for up to two weeks.


If you still need antacids after that time period, it is recommended you call your physician because long-term use of antacids can affect mineral balance, affect the kidneys, and cause diarrhea.
Foam barriers are a combination of antacid and a foaming agent. As the tablet dissolves in the stomach, a foam is formed that helps to block the entry of acid into the esophagus. Currently, the only foam barrier on the market is Gaviscon.
Follow manufacturer’s instructions and don’t overdo it. Antacids, if overdone, can cause some problems., H2 blockers are also over the counter remedies that come in many different brands. They decrease the stomach’s secretion of acid instead of just neutralizing it like antacids. H2 blockers include cimetidine (Tagamet), famotidine (Pepcid) and ranitidine (Zantac). The over the counter variety come in small doses, but your physician can prescribe higher doses.


Keep a look out for the side effects, which include constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, hives, nausea, vomiting, and problems with urination. More serious side effects are difficulty breathing or swelling of the face, lips, throat, or tongue.If you are using H2 blockers, follow manufacturer’s instructions.

, PPIs block acid production by the stomach the same way that H2 blockers do. You can try many different types, including esomeprazole (Nexium), lansoprazole (Prevacid), omeprazole (Prilosec), pantoprazole (Protonix), rabeprazole (Aciphex), dexlansoprazole (Dexilant) and omeprazole sodium bicarbonate (Zegerid).


Side effects of PPIs include headache, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, rashes, and nausea. Long-term use of PPIs are associated with a higher risk of osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine.If you are using PPIs, follow manufacturer’s instructions.
If these do not help within 2-3 weeks, it is strongly recommended that you see your physician. You may need stronger medication or you may not be dealing with pure acid reflux. There may be something else going on."

Recognize the symptoms.,
Learn the triggers.,
Understand the causes.,
Diagnose acid reflux.",How to Treat Acid Reflux Naturally6," Acid reflux can be quite common. Typical symptoms of acid reflux include heartburn, or a burning sensation in the chest. This can occur after eating or while you sleep. You may also experience a sour taste in the mouth, bloating, dark or black stools, burping or hiccups that won’t stop, nausea, dry coughs, or pain that gets worse when you bend over or lie down.


You may also experience dysphagia, which is a narrowed esophagus that feels as if there is food stuck in your throat., There are a number of possible triggers for acid reflux. These triggers include smoking, overeating, stress, and lack of adequate sleep. It can be triggered by certain foods and beverages that you may be sensitive to, such as citrus fruit, caffeinated beverages, chocolate, tomatoes, garlic, onions, alcohol, fatty foods, and spicy foods.


Certain medications including aspirin, NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, and blood pressure medications can make acid reflux worse. Also, antibiotics, tetracycline, bisphosphonates, and some iron and potassium supplements can be a problem and make acid reflux worse., The actual cause of acid reflux is complicated and often includes many different causes. The cause, despite its name, is not the production of too much acid. Factors that can contribute to acid reflux are pressure on your stomach or esophagus. This can be caused by pregnancy, constipation, being overweight or obese, or a hiatal hernias, which is when the upper part of the stomach moves above the diaphragm.


It can also be caused by LES abnormalities, abnormal contractions in the esophagus, and slowed or prolonged emptying of the stomach., The diagnosis of acid reflux, or GERD if the symptoms are more severe or have been longer term, depends on the symptoms you report. You will likely have an endoscopy, a test where a thin tube with a mini-camera on the end is fed into your esophagus. You may also have other imaging procedures like X-rays and tests to measure the acid levels in your esophagus. It is possible that you may be given an esophageal motility testing to measure and determine movement and pressure in your esophagus.


If you are experiencing any symptoms more than twice a week, if the symptoms continue after trying over-the-counter remedies like TUMS or other antacids, or if you have difficulty swallowing and are nauseous or cannot eat, call your doctor for an appointment right away."

Use herbal remedies as an adult with acid reflux.,
Try natural remedies in moderation.,
Consider natural remedies if you're not pregnant or breastfeeding.,
Exercise caution if you have other medical conditions.,
Treat your acid reflux after talking with your doctor.",How to Treat Acid Reflux Naturally7," Most natural acid reflux remedies are safe for the majority of adults. Note that some herbal remedies, however, may not be safe for children or teenagers. It’s best to try mild lifestyle changes first if you need to treat acid reflux in an adolescent. If these do not work, consult your doctor or do some thorough research before giving an adolescent an herbal remedy.


For example, you should not give aloe juice to children under the age of 12 since it typically results in abdominal pain, diarrhea, and cramping., Most herbal remedies and other natural treatments will be safe in moderate amounts, but too much of a good thing can quickly become bad. When using herbal supplements, check the label for dosing instructions. For any natural remedy that does not have dosage instructions readily available, do some research to find out how much you should safely be able to endure.


For instance, aloe juice can cause stomach pain and other forms of digestive upset, especially if the juice contains aloe latex. Long-term use of large amounts can also result in kidney problems, muscle weakness, and heart problems. Make sure that any juice you drink contains no more than 200 mg aloe or 50 mg aloe latex to avoid complications.Consuming apple cider vinegar is usually considered safe short-term, but drinking 8 oz (250 ml) per day for several weeks or months may result in low potassium.High or prolonged doses of licorice root can result in headaches, fatigue, high blood pressure, heart attacks, and water retention. Do not take licorice for more than four to six weeks., If you are not currently pregnant or are not at risk of becoming pregnant, most natural remedies are likely safe for you. However, for acid reflux connected to pregnancy, always talk to your doctor before treating your symptoms to make sure you do not inadvertently harm your baby. It’s important that you do this before trying any herbal remedy, dietary fix, or lifestyle change.


Similarly, if you are currently breastfeeding, you may need to stay away from certain ingested remedies since they could get into your breastmilk and harm your baby. Most lifestyle remedies will likely be safe, though.
Potentially problematic remedies for pregnant and breastfeeding women include, but are not limited to, aloe juice, apple cider vinegar, ginger, fennel, licorice, and slippery elm., In addition to pregnancy, certain medical conditions may also make herbal remedies or other natural fixes unsafe. If you have a known health concern other than acid reflux, talk to your doctor or do your research before trying any particular home cure.


Avoid aloe juice if you have diabetes, intestinal conditions, hemorrhoids, or kidney problems.Avoid apple cider vinegar if you have diabetes.Ginger may cause problems if you have a bleeding disorder, a heart condition, or diabetes.If you are allergic to celery, carrot, or mugwort, you may have an allergic reaction to fennel. You should also avoid fennel if you have a bleeding disorder or hormone-sensitive condition, like estrogen-sensitive cancers.Licorice root may cause problems if you have heart disease, heart failure, hormone-sensitive cancers, fluid retention, hypertension, diabetes, kidney disease, liver disease, or low potassium.If you have an immune system disorder, you may need to avoid taking probiotic supplements.Additionally, you may need to consult your doctor or avoid herbal remedies if you take certain medications, including medications for congestive heart failure, insulin, anti-diabetes drugs, stimulant laxatives, blood pressure medication, diuretic drugs, anticoagulant drugs, antiplatelet drugs, birth control pills, antibiotics, or estrogen pills.

, While most healthy adults can safely treat acid reflux at home using natural remedies, it’s never a bad idea to confirm the diagnosis with your doctor and discuss treatment options before making any major changes. This is especially important if you’ve already been trying home treatments and they haven’t worked.


If your condition worsens after following natural remedies or does not improve after two to three weeks, you may need to make an appointment with your doctor.
If you experience acid reflux symptoms more than twice per week or if you are unable to swallow/eat because of your symptoms, call your doctor before trying home remedies.
In addition to guiding your treatment and possibly prescribing stronger medications to treat your acid reflux, your doctor can verify that acid reflux is the problem and rule out other conditions that may behave in similar ways.

Both the symptoms and the medications may make you vulnerable to particular deficiencies. Do not take supplements without first discussing them with your doctor because they may interfere with other medications, even over-the-counter medications.Iron. Long-term intestinal bleeding can cause your iron to become depleted. If this is the case, your doctor may recommend that you take supplementary iron.
Vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 is important for avoiding anemia, maintaining a healthy nervous system, and, for children, growth. This can be administered as an injection.
Calcium and vitamin D. Crohn’s may reduce your ability to absorb calcium and vitamin D from your food. In addition, if you are also on steroid medications, they may raise your risk of having lower bone density and sustaining bone fractures. Calcium and vitamin D supplements can help guard against this.Multivitamins. If you are malnourished or think you may have difficulty absorbing enough vitamins and minerals from your food, a multivitamin may help.

, While Crohn’s does not appear to be caused by specific foods, it may be possible for you to determine which foods are less likely to aggravate your symptoms. Write down everything you eat and how you felt afterwards to see if there are patterns. Some people report improvements when they:Eat bland, not spicy, foods. This may mean that the spices are prone to irritating the inflamed lining of the digestive tract.
Reduce dairy. Dairy may cause diarrhea, gas, and cramping which can make your symptoms worse.
Avoid fatty foods. Crohn’s makes it difficult for you to absorb fats. This means they pass through you. As they do, they make you more likely to have diarrhea. In particular, try to reduce your consumption of butter, margarine, oils, cream, and fried food.
Eat soft foods and be careful with high-fiber foods. Try baking or steaming fruits and vegetables to make them less crunchy. You may be particularly sensitive to cabbages, broccoli, cauliflower, nuts, seeds, corn, and popcorn. High fiber foods like whole grains may also be more difficult for your digestive system to handle.
Avoid caffeine and carbonated beverages. Caffeine is a stimulant and may make diarrhea worse. Carbonated beverages can increase gas production, leading to abdominal discomfort. If you are prone to diarrhea, be sure to drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration.

Talking to friends and family
Discussing nicotine replacement therapy or residential treatment with your doctor

, Though stress does not cause Crohn’s, it may make it worse. When you are stressed, your stomach produces more acid and digests food slower. Your intestinal activity may also increase or decrease. You may see an improvement in your symptoms if you:Exercise. Try to do at least 75 minutes of physical activity per week. This can include walking, running, biking, swimming or engaging in sports like soccer or basketball. Exercise will promote regular bowel movements and release endorphins which will relax you and lift your mood.Use relaxation techniques. Different people find that different things work for them. Things to try include deep breathing, meditation, yoga, art or music therapy, visualizing calming images, or progressively tensing and relaxing the different muscle groups in your body.Try biofeedback. With this technique, you are connected to a machine that measures your biological responses, such as heart rate, sweating, temperature, blood flow, etc. By learning to control your body’s reactions, you may be able to influence the cramping and discomfort in your digestive tract. But be sure that you go to someone reliable. Ask whether they are supervised by a doctor.Get social support. This may involve talking about the things that worry you with trusted friends or family members, seeing a counselor, or joining a support group.

Look for stomach pains or cramping.,
Look for diarrhea.,
Look for nausea and vomiting.,
Look for excessive sweating and dehydration.,
Look for muscle weakness.,
Look for more extreme symptoms, such as blurred vision or fever.,
See your doctor if symptoms worsen or persist.,
Stay away from any poorly prepared food.,
Be careful around raw food.,
Avoid drinking unclean or untreated water.,
Be careful with certain foods that are prone to causing food poisoning.,
Understand the difference between food poisoning and the stomach flu.",How to Tell if You Have Food Poisoning," Stomach pains and cramping are the most common symptom of food poisoning, and they can appear as soon as 30 minutes after ingesting the contaminated food. The pain ranges from moderate to unbearable, and happens as a result of the digestive organs becoming stretched and distended.
The pain and cramping can last anywhere from several hours to an entire day.;
, Diarrhea is the body's way of flushing out the toxins that caused the food poisoning. Once diarrhea occurs, it means that the contaminant has reached the intestinal section of the gastrointestinal tract.


Diarrhea occurs due to decreased movement in the intestines, which prevents the water in food from being absorbed by the body. The excess water is then flushed from the body along with any waste, resulting in diarrhea.
Experiencing diarrhea more than 4 times in a 24 hour period is a good indication that you have food poisoning.

, Nausea and vomiting are two more symptoms of food poisoning that occur when the body identifies a toxic substance in the stomach.


When the stomach identifies food as ""good"", it is digested and used by the body, but when food is identified as ""bad"", the stomach rejects it and eliminates it through vomiting.
With food poisoning, vomiting may occur three or more times a day. It usually stops after 24 hours, but sometimes it goes on for longer.

, Dehydration is a common side effect of food poisoning, as the body expels excess water through diarrhea and vomiting.


You'll know you are dehydrated if you are sweating more than usual (which occurs due to over-stimulation of parasympathetic system) and your mouth feels dry,
Dehydration can also lead to decreased urine production, as the body attempts to conserve water by rerouting the blood that's meant for the kidneys to other parts of the body.

, With food poisoning, muscle weakness often occurs due to a loss of electrolytes, caused by diarrhea and vomiting. You may also experience low blood pressure and heavier breathing.

, In more serious cases of food poisoning, you may experience additional, severe symptoms which require immediate medical attention. These may include.



Fever and chills: This is an indication of botulism poisoning, a a potentially fatal of food poisoning.Confusion and blurred speech or vision: These kinds of symptoms can occur after the accidental ingestion of a poison mushroom.

, Although most cases of food poisoning will resolve themselves within a day or two without the need for medical attention, there are certain situation in which it will be necessary to see a doctor immediately. These include:



Black, tar-colored, or bloody stool: This may indicate bleeding in the gastrointestinal system, which will require immediate medical attention.

Extreme dehydration: Dehydration which causes dry skin and mouth, sunken eyes, dizziness and decreased urination requires immediate medical attention to replace lost fluids.

Fever above 102 °F (39 °C): A high fever above 102 °F (39 °C) can cause irreversible damage to the brain cells, so medical attention is required to bring the temperature down.

Prolonged diarrhea or vomiting: If children have been suffering from diarrhea and/or vomiting for more than one day (or adults for more than two days) they can become severely dehydrated and may need to be hospitalized.

, One of the main causes of food poisoning is improperly prepared food. This includes food that has been exposed to germs and bacteria through improper storage, unclean preparation surfaces or unwashed hands.Take care to prepare food properly at home and don't eat a restaurant or cafe that looks dirty or messy. If you're not sure, take a look at the bathrooms — if they're dirty, the kitchen probably is too.
For more information on how to avoid food poisoning, see this article.

, Raw fish and other seafood is prone to causing food poisoning, as are raw, unwashed fruits and vegetables. Poultry is also a major cause of food poisoning when it is not cooked all the way through.

, Water from wells or streams that has not been treated with bacteria-killing chemicals can cause food poisoning, due to high levels toxins and microorganisms.


If you're visiting a place and you're not certain whether the water is drinkable, drink from purified bottled water to be on the safe side.

, Certain foods are more likely to cause food poisoning than others. Aside from seafood, raw foods and undercooked poultry, you can get food poisoning from:


Dairy products like milk, cheese and yogurt that haven't been cooled properly.
Undercooked eggs or eggs that haven't been refrigerated after cooking.
Mayonnaise that has been left out of the refrigerator for too long.

, It is very difficult to distinguish between food poisoning and gastroenteritis (aka stomach flu), as the symptoms are almost identical. The best way to distinguish one from the other is to make a note of when the symptoms first appear.


With food poisoning, symptoms can manifest as soon as an hour after eating contaminated food. With gastroenteritis, symptoms can occur up to 12 hours after coming in contact with the virus.
If you suspect food poisoning, it is a good idea to take note of what you ate and drank and if possible, get a sample of the suspect food or beverage for analysis. This can be sent to the lab for testing, to confirm a diagnoses of food poisoning
It can also be helpful to find out if other people who ate the same food are also displaying symptoms of food poisoning.

, Aspirin-based pain relievers can be harsh on the stomach and even cause bleeding, so avoid taking aspirin specifically. Ibuprofen and naproxen can be irritating as well. Instead of these options, take acetaminophen to relieve stomach aches.


For general stomach pain, call your doctor if it persists for several days or begins to worry you.
Aspirin should never be given to children or teenagers unless prescribed by your doctor due to the risk of Reye's syndrome, which can be dangerous.

, Heartburn will feel like a painful burning sensation in the chest. It will usually occur after eating or while you are lying down. It is caused by acid build up in the stomach.

, There are several options to chose from. You can drink a cup of herbal tea after each meal to help settle an upset stomach. The following three types are worth trying:


Chamomile tea contains an anti-inflammatory agent that can help settle an upset stomach. You can pick up chamomile tea at almost any supermarket. Try having a cup of tea after meals to settle your stomach. You should drop the tea bag in hot, but not boiling, water, so as not to destroy chamomile's active ingredient.
Mint tea is a useful remedy for gas, bloating, and indigestion because it works to relax stomach muscles. Peppermint tea is available at most supermarkets, but you can also use fresh mint leaves. Simply drop the leaves in hot water and let them sit for five to 10 minutes. Enjoy this drink after meals for best effect.
Make yourself a rice tea. Rice tea is simply rice, water and honey. Boil half a cup of rice in six cups of water for 15 minutes. Next strain the rice out of the water, saving the water in a bottle. Add a small amount of sugar or honey to the water and drink warm. Rice tea has been shown to help settle upset stomachs., Yogurt can help speed up digestion because it contains active cultures. Mix yogurt with fruit juice for a healthy snack that will aid digestion. Try one part yogurt, one part juice.


Carrot, apple, and peach drinks work well for indigestion. Avoid acidic fruits such as orange juice, as they can be harsh on an upset stomach.
Yogurt labels will note if they contain active cultures. Be sure to only buy those with active cultures if you are using it to help with a stomach ache.

, Try mixing a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar with one cup of warm water and a tablespoon of honey. This will help to reduce cramping, gas, and even heartburn., Ginger has been used for thousands of years to settle stomachs.

Ginger can be taken fresh, in ginger capsules, ginger chews, or as ginger ale., For maximum effectiveness the pad or bottle should be around 104 °F or 40 °C. The heating pad or hot water bottle works by activating heat receptors deep in the body which, in turn, cause your body to not feel as much pain.This treatment is particularly recommended for menstrual pain.

, Each body is different, so it can be difficult to give general advice about what foods should be avoided. When you eat a certain food, pay attention to how you feel afterwards.

Talk to your doctor to see if you may have an allergy to a certain food, gluten sensitivity, or celiac disease. Be particularly mindful about the following foods:


Processed foods, including fast food, white bread, sausage, donuts, hamburgers, and potato chips.
Dairy products can cause stomach aches in some people, especially if they are unknowingly lactose intolerant. Try staying off dairy products for a week to see if there is improvement, or try a soy based milk.Spicy and greasy food can irritate the stomach and should be avoided if you are experiencing stomach pains.

, The best foods to help with a stomach ache are high in fiber. Your stomach aches may actually be caused by a lack of fiber in your diet. It is also important that you drink water, approximately two to three liters per day (nine to 13 cups) is the recommended amount.Foods high in fiber include fruits like bananas, vegetables like broccoli, and many whole grains. Prunes, cherries, raisins, and apricots are particularly effective. These foods will help with regular bowel movements and prevent constipation.

But being familiar with the most common symptoms may help you to determine if you need to see a doctor. Some of the common symptoms of tapeworm include:abdominal pain
nausea and/or vomiting
diarrhea
weight loss
dizziness
insomnia
malnutrition
jaundice (yellowish tinge to the skin and eyes);
, One way to tell if you have a tapeworm is to examine your stools for pieces of the worm. If you notice any particles that look like grains of white rice, then you may have a tapeworm infection. These small white segments contain eggs from the tapeworm., It is common to lose your appetite when you have a tapeworm, but some people experience an increase in appetite. This is more common in tapeworm that has been caused by eating undercooked beef or pork. Watch for any unusual changes in your appetite., Tapeworm caused by eating undercooked fish may lead to a vitamin B12 deficiency because the tapeworm may be sucking up all of your vitamin B12.

, One way that your doctor can determine whether or not you have a tapeworm is by ordering a lab analysis of your feces. Before your appointment, ask if you will need to collect a stool sample., If a stool sample shows negative results and you have symptoms that indicate that you may have a tapeworm, then you may need to get a blood test. A lab analysis of your blood will show whether or not you have been infected with a tapeworm., If you do have a tapeworm, then your doctor may want you to have a CT (computed tomography), ultrasound, or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) to see if a tapeworm has caused damage to other parts of your body.These tests are not painful, but they may be a little uncomfortable and time consuming.

, Your doctor will prescribe a medication to help you pass the tapeworm. Carefully follow your doctor’s instructions for how to take your medication. The most common medications prescribed to treat a tapeworm infection include:Praziquantel (Biltricide). This medication works by killing certain worms. Do not take this medication if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, allergic to any ingredient in the medication, have a worm infection in your eye, or if you are on rifampin.Albendazole (Albenza). This medication prevents newly hatched worms from growing in your body. It treats specific types of tapeworm infections, including those you get from eating pork and from being around infected dogs.Nitazoxanide (Alinia). This medication is mainly used to treat parasites that you pick up from swimming in a lake or spending time in other moist places., If you have to pass a large tapeworm, it is likely that you will have some pain and cramping.This is normal, but make sure that you call your doctor if the pain becomes severe.

, To ensure that you are tapeworm free, your doctor will need to check your stools again one month following your treatment and then again three months after your treatment.Make sure that you keep this appointment even if you are feeling fine.

Seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe side effects.",How to Take Psyllium Husk," Psyllium husk is a source of soluble fiber. It is often used for occasional constipation and to help restore regularity. Psyllium husk works by absorbing water in your digestive tract and combining with the water to form bulky stool. This process stimulates digestion and helps quicken the passage of stool. For this reason, psyllium husk is known as a bulk forming laxative.Psyllium husk is also used to help treat irritable bowel syndrome and diverticular disease. These conditions cause pain and digestive problems that may be alleviated by incorporating psyllium husk into your daily routine.;
, Your doctor may advise against taking psyllium husk products if you are on any medications. Psyllium can reduce the absorption of medications into the digestive system.


If your doctor says it's okay to take psyllium husk with your medications, he or she may recommend that you take psyllium husk at least 2 hours before or after you have taken your other medications. This time between taking psyllium husk and your medications will reduce the likelihood that the psyllium will affect your medication absorption., You can get psyllium husk in a wide variety of forms, from powders to cookies. Pure psyllium husk powder has a sawdust-like texture that some people find unpleasant, so it is also available in forms that are flavored and easily dissolvable. The advantage of these products is that they have a more pleasant taste and texture than pure psyllium husk.


Psyllium products like Metamucil are known as blond psyllium and they often contain sugar and other additives. You can purchase flavored Metamucil powder to mix with water or you can even get cookies or wafers that contain psyllium husk. Follow the instructions on the package when taking one of these forms of psyllium husk.If you prefer, purchase a 100% psyllium husk powder product at a health food or nutrition store.

If you have any questions about the product and whether or not it may interact with your medications, ask a pharmacist.

, Some products may not be compatible with certain medications or chronic conditions. In addition, dosages differ with each product. Most psyllium husk products can be taken one to three times a day.


Your doctor may suggest a higher dosage to relieve severe constipation or diarrhea or if you are using it for other issues.

, It is better to add fiber to your diet slowly to decrease discomfort, bloating and gas. Measure half teaspoon dose the first time you take psyllium and increase the amount by a half teaspoon every few days until you are taking the recommended dosage.

, Stir it well for about 10 seconds. Add more liquid if it is too thick. Do not allow the mixture to sit after you have mixed it because it will begin to form a gel that may be difficult to swallow., Psyllium husk becomes gel-like and bulky after a short time. It can create a choking hazard if it is taken in a semi-solid form. Make sure that you have used enough liquid and that you drink the mixture right away to avoid this potential hazard.If your psyllium husk mixture is gel-like, throw it out and mix a new batch.

, If you are taking multiple doses of psyllium husk, try to space your doses out throughout the day. For example, you could take one dose of psyllium husk in the morning, one at midday, and one in the evening.


Keep in mind that your doctor may suggest a higher dosage to relieve severe constipation or diarrhea. Do not exceed the recommended dosage unless your doctor has told you to do so.
For treatment of high cholesterol, 10 to 12 g of psyllium may be prescribed. This is approximately two to three tbsp. of psyllium, broken up into smaller doses with 8 to 16 oz. of water throughout the day.If you think that you may have overdosed on psyllium, contact your local poison control center by calling 1-800-222-1222., Wafers may also be preferable if you dislike the taste of the drink mix. Take small bites and chew each bite very well. Drink a glass of water or juice with the wafer. This will ensure it starts to bulk up when it reaches your stomach., Read the product instructions to determine how many capsules you should take per dose and how many doses you should take per day. Take the capsules with a large glass of water., It may take up to 3 days for your symptoms improve. Your stools should be softer and more frequent. If psyllium husk has been recommended by your doctor, keep using it as directed.


Talk with your doctor if your symptoms do not improve after 3 to 5 days of treatment. Do not use psyllium husk products for more than seven days without consulting your doctor., If you are planning to take psyllium to help with constipation, make sure that you incorporate some other positive lifestyle changes as well.

Avoid medicine that will affect the sample.,
Consult with your doctor.,
Prepare your toilet with a hat.,
Cover your toilet bowl with plastic wrap.,
Lay a sheet of newspaper across your toilet bowl.,
Defecate into the collection device.,
Deposit sample in the container.,
Dispose of your collection device.,
Refrigerate the sample.,
Return the samples to your doctor as soon as possible.",How to Take a Stool Sample," Your stool sample needs to be solid, so you should avoid taking certain medicines before collecting it. This includes anything that might soften your stools, such as Pepto Bismol, Maalox, mineral oil, antacids and Kaopectate. Also, if you have had a Barium Swallow, a metallic compound used to see abnormalities in the esophagus and stomach during an x-ray, you should postpone taking the stool sample., He or she will provide you with the necessary equipment for collecting your stool sample, including a container for storing the sample. Ask about the procedure and if you can receive a “hat.” Follow your doctor's instructions and read any directions that come with your equipment carefully.


Keep in mind that toilet water, urine, paper, and soap can all ruin the stool sample, so make sure that you have a way to protect your stool from becoming contaminated by these things. Set up a way to catch your stool sample ahead of time., The hat is a plastic device that looks like its namesake and is used to catch the feces so that it does not come into contact with toilet water. Ask your doctor if one is available, because it will make the process easier. The hat will fit neatly over a portion of the toilet seat.


To put the hat in place, lift up the toilet seat, place the hat over the bowl, and then close the toilet seat again. Position yourself on top of the portion of the bowl covered by the hat.

, If your doctor does not provide you with a hat, then you can also cover the toilet bowl with plastic wrap. To use plastic wrap, lift up the toilet seat and then place the plastic wrap across the toilet bowl. Close the toilet seat on the plastic wrap to help secure it.


You can also tape the plastic wrap to the side of the bowl for additional security.
Before you defecate, push down on the plastic to create a small dip in the plastic where the sample will collect., As a last recourse, you can also use a large sheet of newspaper to collect your stool sample. To use a piece of newspaper, lift up the toilet seat and place the newspaper across the toilet bowl and then close the toilet seat to secure it.


You can also tape the newspaper to the side of the bowl to hold it in place.
You may also want to push down on the center of the paper to create a place for the sample to settle., Be sure to urinate first so that you do not contaminate the sample. Whether at home or at the doctor’s office, secure the toilet with either a hat or plastic wrap. Be careful that all of the sample is collected and does not come into contact with the toilet water.

, Open up one of the containers that the doctor gave you. There should be a small shovel-like tool attached to the cap of the container. Use the shovel to scoop a small bit of stool into the container. Try to take some stool from each end and from the middle.


The size of the sample will vary somewhat with the test. Sometimes your doctor will give you a container with a red line and liquid on the inside. You will want to put in enough stool to raise the liquid to the level of the red line. If not, aim for a sample approximately the size of a grape.

, Flip over the contents of the hat/plastic wrap into the toilet. Flush away the stool and deposit the hat/plastic wrap and any other garbage into a trash bag. Tie the trash bag in a knot, and put it somewhere that you cannot smell it.

, Whenever possible the sample should be returned immediately. If you are not doing so, it should be refrigerated. Put the container with the stool in a sealed bag and store in the fridge. Label it with your name, date, and time of collection. Consider an opaque bag so that no one can see your stool sample., Under no circumstances should you wait more than 24 hours before returning the sample to a doctor. The bacteria in your stool will grow and change. Usually your doctor will want the sample back within two hours to get an accurate result.Follow up with your doctor to get the results of your stool sample.

Get rid of excess air.,
Cut down on carbohydrates.,
Reduce anxiety.",How to Suppress Flatulence1," Flatulence is the body’s simple way of expelling excess air from your stomach. Eating or drinking too fast, talking while you eat, smoking, and drinking carbonated sodas all cause the swallowing of too much air.Eat and drink slowly. By taking time to eat your food and drink your beverages, you will swallow less air.
Avoid carbonated drinks and beer since they are known to release carbon dioxide gas.
Part of chewing gum or sucking on hard candy is swallowing large amounts of air. Avoid both if you flatulating too often.
If you smoke, you are swallowing lots of air. The stinky smell on your clothing might not be from smoke.;
, Complex carbohydrates are gas-producing foods that can cause discomfort. Complex Carbohydrate Intolerance (CCI) occurs because you lack the enzyme necessary to break down complex carbohydrates. In most cases, however, you are more likely just to suffer from bloating and stomach pain.Cut down on vegetables such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and cauliflower.
Avoid fruits such as apples, peaches, and pears.
Bloating and discomfort can originate from eating whole grains, cereals, nuts, and seeds. Celiac disease, which is an autoimmune disease triggered by gluten, can cause bloating and gas.
Steer clear of drinking milk (especially if you are lactose intolerant), alcohol, and carbonated drinks.

, Although food intolerances and digestive issues are the main causes of flatulence, anxiety can also lead to its own set of flatulence problems. Anxiety can lead to further anxiety. Chest and stomach pains caused by digestive symptoms results in flatulence and anxiety followed by the increased anxiety of flatulating in public.Excessive stress and anxiety usually cause you to breathe faster, which result in swallowing more air and more flatulence. Severe anxiety can increase hydrochloric acid in the intestines causing more gas to be produced as well as flatulence.
If you experience anxiety from either excessive flatulence or pain, the best thing to do is let the gas out safely. Find a secure spot where you are comfortable and away from other people.
Practice deep belly breathing, or breathing from your diaphragm, which simulates the parasympathetic nervous system and helps to relax the body. Place a hand on your belly and inhale so that you can feel your stomach rising (as opposed to your chest). Hold your breath for a few seconds, then slowly exhale.

Cope with having diarrhea.,
Ease nausea and vomiting with a gentle diet.,
Seek medical care if you become dehydrated.,
See your doctor if you have pain or a high fever.,
Unblock constipation naturally, if possible.,
Ease acid reflux and heartburn (GERD) with diet and medications, if needed.,
Soothe indigestion with warm fluids.",How to Stop Stomach Problems1," Stay hydrated by drinking water, juice, and broth throughout the day.Get plenty of rest by staying home from work or school and staying in bed. Try over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medicines like Pepto-Bismol or Immodium A-D to help relieve symptoms. Follow a clear liquid diet of water, broth, juice, and sports drinks until you can handle solid food, then introduce the BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast).


Avoid fatty foods, dairy, caffeine, alcohol, and artificial sweeteners.
Many cases of diarrhea are caused by viruses and will pass in a couple of days. It may also be the result of foodborne illness, which is far more common than you might think.
If your symptoms get worse or don’t resolve after 48 hours, see your doctor — you may need antibiotics or other medications.;
, Stay hydrated — like with diarrhea, dehydration is the biggest risk when you’re sick with vomiting. Follow the same guidelines as when you have diarrhea. If you can eat without vomiting, eat small amounts of bland foods like toast, crackers, and jell-o. Once you can keep these down, add rice, cereal, and fruit to your diet. Increase what you eat slowly as your illness improves.If you’re too nauseated to drink anything, try sucking on ice chips to get small amounts of fluids.
When you do drink liquids, try to have them at room temperature. Avoid cold or hot drinks.
Don’t eat spicy or fatty foods, which can further irritate your stomach.
Let your stomach calm down after vomiting by waiting 30 – 60 minutes afterwards to eat or drink anything. Don’t try heavy solid foods until at least six hours after you last vomited.If your stomach upset is from motion sickness, try a medication like Dramamine before traveling.

, If you have diarrhea or vomiting that lasts over 24 hours, or you cannot keep any liquids down for over 12 hours, see your doctor right away.Seek emergency care if you have any signs or symptoms of dehydration, such as:Extreme thirst
Dry mouth or skin
Dark urine, or producing little or no urine
Weakness, dizziness, fatigue, lightheadedness

, Signs that your stomach problems necessitate medical care include a fever of 102°F (39°C) or higher, or moderate to severe stomach, rectal, or chest pain. If you have blood in your stool or vomit, or your stool is black and tarry, see your doctor right away.

, Try eating prunes or yogurt containing live cultures. Hydrate well and get regular exercise. Increase the fiber in your diet with vegetables and whole grains. Consult your doctor if you do not have a bowel movement for over a week — they may suggest castor oil, over-the-counter milk of magnesia, or a laxative.


People have different rhythms, and it’s normal to have a bowel movement every day to three times per week. If your stool is very hard or you have to strain to poop, see your doctor., GERD can often be controlled with dietary changes. If symptoms persist, try an over-the-counter antacid like Tums or Rolaids. Visit your doctor for a prescription for a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI), histamine (H2) blocker, or a medication called Baclofen. In extreme cases, surgery is possible.Make the following dietary changes to minimize your symptoms of GERD:Restrict fatty foods in your diet.
Avoid chocolate, mint, caffeine, and carbonated beverages.
Skip spicy foods if you’re currently having a reflux flare-up.
Don’t drink alcohol.
Be wary of acidic foods like citrus, tomatoes, onion, and garlic.
Eat whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and lean meats.
Add ginger and fennel to recipes.Try probiotics from live-culture yogurt.
Stay upright after eating. Don’t lay down for at least a couple of hours after eating.

, If your stomach upset is more severe on a particular day, give your stomach a rest by drinking clear soup (not creamy) and tea. Chamomile tea, ginger tea, and peppermint tea may be especially soothing."

Eat a healthy diet.,
Take over-the-counter remedies.,
Limit the side effects.",How to Suppress Flatulence2," Troublesome gas is often treated with nutritional advice on what and what not to eat to reduce or prevent flatulence. A range of dietary measures exist, so try experimenting with different combinations until you find one that works for you.Keep a journal of the foods and drinks you consume and record when you have excessive flatulence. There are a host of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and milk products that cause flatulence; by keeping a journal you can narrow down which ones personally affect you the most.
Fried and fatty foods should be eaten in moderation because they cause bloating and the buildup of gas.The inability to relieve this gas is painful.
Foods high in fiber cause flatulence. Fiber is an excellent and necessary food for the body, though, so try to temporarily cut back and then begin to reintroduce fiber in your diet slowly until your body adjusts to it.
Reduce your dairy intake by substituting milk with low-lactose foods like yogurt, or in addition to Lactaid or Dairy Ease which helps digest milk products. If you cannot eliminate dairy completely from your diet, try smaller portions or consuming it with other foods to reduce the impact.
Keep yourself hydrated by drinking enough water throughout the day.
Avoid caffeine and alcohol as much as possible.

, Flatulence can be caused by another health problem. Treating the underlying condition with over-the-counter remedies might be able to offer you relief from excessive  flatulence. Add Beano to reduce the amount of flatulence produced by vegetables and beans. Beano must be taken within the first few bites of food to be effective. It must arrive before the gas.
If you are lactose intolerant, try taking Lactaid or Dairy-Ease to help you digest lactose. Or, you could also try lactose-free or reduced lactose dairy products.
Popular gas relief products — Gas-X, Gelusil, Mylanta, and Mylicon — use simethicone to bust gas bubbles and relieve flatulence. Be aware, however, no studies have proven that these products actually work to relieve gas or gas pain.
Charcoal tablets — CharcoCaps and Charcoal  Plus — use an activated charcoal agent to relieve gas and ultimately flatulence. Similar to simethicone, no studies prove they work.
Other measure include the use of probiotics such as Florastor and Align.

, Many of the foods that cause flatulence are healthy for you and should not be completely left out of your diet.Foods that contain medium carbohydrates like beans and legumes are water-soluble. This means if you rinse them off or soak them in water, some of the carbohydrates will leach out, reducing the impact of gas and flatulence. Make sure you soak for a few hours before cooking them.
It is not a good excuse to cut vegetables from your diet because they make you gassy. Instead, puree your cruciferous vegetables. This increases the surface area of the food particles allowing them to be more readily absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract — and causing less flatulence.
Add inulin, a prebiotic fiber, found in fiber-rich foods to your diet. A prebiotic fiber is a carbohydrate that stimulates the growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in your stomach. Foods such as pears, pistachios, blueberries, and chia seeds are high in prebiotic fiber.
Eat fennel seeds after a meal heavy with vegetables. Fennel seeds are a natural flatulence-fighter used to improve digestive tolerance to beans, lentils, and cauliflower. Either chew on the fennel seed or break it apart and put them in your tea to enjoy their benefits.

Eat smaller portions.,
Exercise regularly.,
Try natural remedies.",How to Suppress Flatulence3," Since swallowing air is a big part of eating, try smaller portions to limit the intake of air and reduce the impact of creating gas. By taking your times and chewing your food thoroughly, you will digest it quicker and it will pass through your body much easier.Cut food into smaller pieces.
Chew your food for about twenty to thirty bites with your mouth closed.
Try keeping the amount of food on your utensil to a minimum. Don’t scoop it off your plate right into your mouth as if you were eating directly out of a bowl.
Between bites of food, set your utensil down on the table. This will slow your roll.
Stay relaxed and have a peaceful mind while you eat. Food is something to be enjoyed.

, Physical activity is believed to aid the movement of gas through the digestive tract. Regular exercise, such as tightening your abdominal muscles, can help with digestion and, therefore, with easing the effects of gas, bloating, and flatulence.According the the President's Council on Fitness, Americans need 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise each week, or about 30 minutes five days a week. You should also try and get two to three days of weight/resistance training in as well every week.After eating, take a walk for ten to fifteen minutes to relieve bloating. Or, you could take a jog, stretch, or other types of vigorous exercises to move gas through the digestive tract. The faster the stomach empties, the faster the gas moves into the small intestine. A brisk walk will be more stimulating than a slow one, so try to keep a good pace.
Staying upright and moving around, despite discomfort, is better than hitting the couch after a meal. Lying down allows gas to collect in your stomach and leads to bloating.
Studies have shown that weak stomach muscles are a factor in bloating. Muscles in the stomach help move food and gas through the body. Strengthening stomach muscles or walking helps reduce gas and flatulence.
If you are not interested in weight training, then try yoga to aid in the digestion of food and the reduction of gas. Yoga is a great stress reliever. Minimizing stress can reduce many of the painful symptoms associated with bloating, gas, and flatulence.

, Never try to hold gas in. It is a painful process and there is nowhere for the gas to go but out. There are many ways to treat excess flatulence, but simple natural remedies are not only good for you, but they will help fight flatulence.Peppermint tea eases gas pain because it contains the essential oil called menthol. Menthol creates an antispasmodic effect on the smooth muscle of the digestive tract. By soothing this muscle, as well as nerves and stress, a cup of peppermint tea will keep things moving along smoothly.
Ginger contains gingerols and Shogaol  which relaxes the intestinal tract and prevents the formation of excess gas. Drink a cup of ginger root  tea before a meal to help with digestion.
Caraway is known to help relieve excess gas by pushing it through the digestive tract. Eat a few caraway crackers or seeds if you feel bloated or gassy.
A cup of chamomile tea will relax your digestive tract as an anti-inflammatory to help the movement of gas through the body.
Pumpkin reduces the gasses produced by high fiber foods. Eat about one cup of pumpkin with your meal to fight off gas and flatulence.
Drink a cup of warm lemon water to stimulate the production of hydrochloric acid (HCL), which helps break down food. The water also helps by flushing out your entire system. Drink a cup for breakfast to feel refreshed all day long.

See your doctor for diagnosis and treatment.,
Treat peptic ulcers with triple therapy and lifestyle changes.,
Treat Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) for symptom relief.,
Limit complications of Crohn’s Disease with medical treatment.,
Manage Ulcerative Colitis (UC) similarly to Crohn’s, and watch for cancer.",How to Stop Stomach Problems2," Chronic diseases are those that persist beyond the course of a normal, temporary illness. They usually require working with a doctor for long-term care. Chronic diseases of the gastrointestinal tract — your stomach and intestines — can be treated with diet, medications, and sometimes surgery. If you have stomach problems that won’t go away, get diagnosed by a doctor and start the appropriate care.


Discuss options with your primary care doctor — they may refer you to a nutritionist, surgeon, or specialist called a gastroenterologist.

, Over-the-counter antacids like Tums, Rolaids, and Pepto-Bismol can help to relieve symptoms of stomach ulcers, but medical treatment can help to actually cure the ulcers. Treatment requires working with your doctor and most likely treating with triple therapy: antacids, antibiotics, and a medication called a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI).Make concurrent lifestyle changes to stop smoking, avoid alcohol, and minimize your stress.
Avoid the use of NSAIDs, which can aggravate peptic ulcers.

, The general rules of a healthy digestive tract apply to IBS: avoid foods that trigger your symptoms, manage your stress, exercise, get plenty of sleep, and stay hydrated.Additional treatment can include dietary changes and medications. Speak with your doctor about what’s appropriate treatment for you:


Sometimes it helps to eliminate foods that cause gas: carbonated beverages and raw fruits and veggies are the worst. Talk to your doctor about this first, because a healthy diet usually contains plenty of vegetables and fruits.
Try a gluten-free diet and see if that helps your symptoms.
Avoid fructose (fruit sugars), lactose (milk sugar found in dairy), and FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, polysaccharides, and polyols).Consult a nutritionist for details about how to avoid foods containing FODMAPs.Generally, minimize eating high-FODMAP foods like: onions (and leeks, chives, and onion-like vegetables); garlic; processed meats; products containing wheat; honey and corn-syrup; apples; watermelon; snap peas; artichoke; and baked beans.
Discuss medications with your doctor. People may benefit from fiber supplements, antibiotics, anti-diarrheals, or anti-spasmodics. It depends on your symptoms and what is causing them.
For severe symptoms, consider an IBS-specific medication like Alosetron (Lotronex) or Lubiprostone (Amitiza). Which you use depends on your symptoms.

, Work with your stomach doctor to control your symptoms and try to attain remission. Treatment is usually with medications, and sometimes surgery. First, work with your doctor to try anti-inflammatory drugs like sulfasalazine (Azulfidine), mesalamine (Asacol, Delzicol, and others), or a corticosteroid like prednisone. From there, you can try other treatments or a combination of treatment methods:Immune suppressing medications can help significantly decrease the inflammation that causes symptoms of Crohn’s. These medications have unpleasant side effects, however, so risk must be weighed against the possible benefit.
Antibiotics like Flagyl and Cipro will help if you have fistulas or abscesses.
Other supplementary medications can be used to treat other symptoms, like anti-diarrheals, pain relieves, iron supplements and vitamin B12 shots (to prevent anemia), and calcium and vitamin D supplements.
A low fiber diet can help. In severe cases, you may have a hospital stay for “bowel rest” and get your nutrition from an IV.
In severe cases, surgery can remove a damaged part of your colon.

, Treat UC with your doctor’s help using similar medications to what is used for Crohn’s Disease – the two illnesses are very similar other than the location of the damage to the intestine. Notable differences are that surgery to manage UC is generally more extensive and may require using a colostomy bag afterwards to collect stool. It is also important to have regular screenings for cancer:Have a surveillance colonoscopy as soon as eight years after you are diagnosed with UC if your whole colon is involved, or 10 years after if only the left side is involved.
Start screening one to two years after diagnosis if you are also diagnosed with primary sclerosing cholangitis.
Have a screening colonoscopy every one to two years if the disease involves more than your rectum.

Choose lean, low-fat meats.,
Eat plain, unsweetened yogurt.,
Eat the right kind of vegetables and fruits.,
Reduce your intake of coffee and black tea.,
Stop drinking soft drinks.,
Reduce your alcohol intake.,
Avoid artificial food additives.",How to Stop Stomach Problems3," Try to limit how much fat you eat in your diet — fat is difficult to digest and can cause you to gain weight, which also impacts stomach problems. When you choose meats, avoid tough meats and those with casings like hotdogs or sausages; instead, opt for poultry, fish, or tofu.Lower your fat intake by replacing red meat with poultry and fish, opting for low-fat or non-fat dairy, and cooking with olive oil instead of butter.

, Yogurt contains beneficial bacteria in the form of probiotics and is high in calcium, which can offset the effects of acid-forming foods. Also, try other fermented foods, such as kimchi, sauerkraut, natto, or kefir.If you’re lactose intolerant, try replacing milk with yogurt. Many people who cannot digest milk deal with yogurt better., Fruits and vegetables provide essential fiber to assist with digestion and increase the health of good bacteria in the gut. However, if you have diverticulitis stay away from berries with small seeds like strawberries, corn, and small seeds and nuts – these can aggravate the intestine.Bananas are a great, soft fruit that also provide a lot of fiber.
Ginger is an excellent root to add for flavor, and is also known to calm the stomach.

, These are both very acidic and high in caffeine, which can contribute to heartburn and stomach upset.Caffeine can also increase your stress levels, which may increase risk of other health issues such as ulcers. Try red tea (rooibos) instead – it is high in antioxidants, low acid-forming, and has no caffeine.

, The phosphoric acid and sugar feed unhealthy bacteria populations in your gut. Sugary foods can also result in diarrhea and cause weight gain.Stay away from diet sodas, as well; the carbonation can worsen gas, and many diet beverages contain artificial sweeteners.

, Alcohol can contribute to a number of stomach problems, including ulcers, heartburn, diarrhea, and nausea. Drinking alcohol can also worsen nutritional disorders.If you don’t drink, don’t start. If you do, keep it to a minimum: 1 alcoholic beverage per day for women, and 2 per day for men.

, Many people are sensitive to artificial colors and food additives like MSG, even though they’re “recognized as safe” by the Food and Drug Administration.Try to buy natural, organic foods if you have a sensitive stomach and stay away from products listing artificial additives in the ingredients. Limit your intake of:


”Artificial flavors” or “FD&C,” and anything labeled in the ingredients list as a color and a number like “red no. 4.”
MSG, also sometimes listed as glutamic acid, hydrolyzed protein, and others.Artificial sweeteners like Sweet’N’Low and Equal.
Deli meats and processed, pre-packaged foods.

Keep a food journal.,
Follow food safety rules.,
Eat smaller portions.,
Drink eight to 10 cups of fluids a day.,
Sleep eight to 10 hours per night.,
Exercise five days per week.,
Avoid taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs).,
Quit smoking.,
Decrease your stress level.",How to Stop Stomach Problems4," The most important thing you can do to help your mild stomach issues is to know what’s causing them. Keep a journal for a month – write down everything you eat, what time, and in what amounts. Also record what symptoms you have, how severe they are on a scale of 1 – 10, what time they occur, and how long they last. Look for patterns.


If your symptoms occur when you eat dairy, you might be lactose intolerant.If grains and carbohydrates cause you stomach upset, you may have a gluten sensitivity or, more rarely but more seriously, celiac disease. You can get this diagnosed at your doctor’s office.

, Many cases of upset stomach are caused by foodborne illnesses. The CDC estimates that there are 9.4 million cases of foodborne illness each year in the US, if not more, as people often think they just have the flu or a stomach virus. Avoid foodborne illnesses by washing your hands after using the bathroom and before preparing food or eating. Make sure all foods are cooked to the proper internal temperature and fresh foods (like fruits and vegetables) are rinsed thoroughly.Poultry and ground meats should be cooked to an internal temperature of 165˚F (74˚C). Whole meats (like steaks) and fish should be cooked to an internal temperature of 145˚F (62.8°C). F
Foods should be stored at under 41˚F (5˚C) or above 135˚F (57˚C) to avoid the rapid growth of bacteria.

, Limit how much air you swallow when you eat by eating slowly and eating smaller portions. Chew your food slowly and completely before swallowing. Try to eat multiple small meals throughout the day instead of two to three big meals.


Don’t chew gum or drink carbonated beverages — these cause you to swallow a lot of air and can contribute to stomach discomfort., Staying hydrated is important for keeping your bowel function healthy and regular. Drink eight to 10 cups of water, juice, tea, or milk (unless you’re lactose intolerant) every day., Not getting enough sleep affects more than your mood and your mind – sleep deprivation can contribute to upset stomach and diarrhea.Poor sleep also worsens stress and can cause weight gain, both of which can contribute to stomach issues. Try to get 8-10 hours of sleep every night.


Set a specific wake time and bedtime.
Have good sleep hygiene — only use your bedroom for sleeping, and sleep in a cool, dark space.
Get exercise during the day, and try not to nap.

, Exercise can help reduce stress, thereby reducing health risks associated with stress, and keep your bowel function more regular.Start slowly and gradually increase how much you exercise, and if exercise is new to you talk to your doctor about a workout program.


Aim to work up to exercising for 30 minutes five days per week.

, Consuming NSAIDs for stomach pain can exacerbate your problem instead of relieving it. NSAIDs have been known to cause or worsen stomach ulcers, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and upset stomach. If you have stomach problems, talk to your doctor about which pain relievers you should use. Common NSAIDs include (note that these can be over-the-counter, and appear in many medications like cold medicines):Aspirin
Ibuprofen (Motrin)
Indomethacin (Indocin)
Naproxen (Naprosyn)
Celecoxib (Celebrex)

, Smoking increases your risk of ulcers and can contribute to other causes of stomach upset.Use the START acronym to stop smoking:


S = Set a date to stop smoking.
T = Tell loved ones that you intend to quit.
A = Anticipate that there will be challenges.
R = Remove tobacco from your home, car, and workspace.
T = Talk to your doctor for support and advice on quitting.

, The stress hormone cortisol negatively affects numerous body systems – including your digestive tract – and stress can contribute to ulcers, nausea, diarrhea, and other stomach issues.Try yoga, meditation, deep breathing, taking a walk – anything that helps you relax. If you have a stressful lifestyle due to work or family, practice mindfulness meditation or learn stress management skills. Maintaining a calm, peaceful demeanor will help to improve your pain and health.Don’t exercise right before or right after eating.

Eat foods high in fiber.,
Incorporate probiotics.,
Add psyllium husks to your meals.,
Avoid processed and junk foods.,
Drink water during the day.,
Sip fruit juice.,
Include caffeine in your water totals.,
Drink alcohol and caffeine in moderation.,
Consider fiber supplements.,
Move your body.,
Squat on the toilet.,
Avoid suppressing the urge move your bowels.,
Use caution with laxatives.",How to Stay Regular," Incorporate 14 grams of fiber for every 1,000 calories you eat every day. If you eat a 2,000 calorie diet, that translates to 28 grams of fat. This is equivalent to 4 cups of raspberries per day or a range of fruits, vegetables, and grains.Fiber adds bulk to your stools and can stimulate your bowels, though too much can make constipation worse.Choose any of following high fiber foods as a part of your regular meals:Fruits such prunes, pears, plums, peaches and pineapples
Cruciferous veggies such as broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower
Beans
Wheat, bran and other whole grains
FlaxseedsPeas
Brussels sprouts;
, An imbalance of intestinal bacteria can cause irregularity. Eating foods high in probiotics, such as fortified yogurt, can restore the beneficial bacteria and aid in proper digestion. You can get probiotics from foods such as:Probiotic yogurt
Dark chocolateGreen peas
Sauerkraut
Kimchi
Green olives
Pickles

, Psyllium husks are very fine flakes of psyllium bran. They are usually sold under names such as Metamucil, FiberCon and Citrucel. Adding psyllium husks to your diet can keep your stools soft and make them easier to pass.Mix 8 ounces of water with ½ teaspoon psyllium husks.Consider adding them to a fruit and yogurt smoothie. This combination can keep you regular and give you vital nutrients.

, Eat processed foods in moderation. They are often high in calories, fat, and sugar. This can throw off the balance in your intestines, causing diarrhea and constipation. Types of processed and junk foods to avoid include:Fast food
Fried food
White bread, pasta and rice
Dairy products such as cheese
Candy and baked goods

, Getting too little or too much water can cause irregularity. Drink 6-8 ounces (180 to 240 milliliters) of water every hour can keep you hydrated and regular.Steer clear of carbonated and flavored waters. They can cause gas and bloating.Tote a reuseable water bottle. It can remind you to sip throughout the day and may even stay on track with your fiber-rich diet.

, You can boost your fiber by incorporating a small amount of fruit juice into each meal. Drink 2-4 ounces (60 to 120 milliliters) juices such as prune or pear juice.Mix one part juice and one part water if the juice is too intense for you or your taste buds. These can keep the balance in your intestines and maintain your regularity.

, Have a cup of coffee or two as part of your liquid intake. The caffeine can also help relieve mild constipation, since it's a diuretic. Avoid putting too much cream or sugar in your java, as it can contribute to intestinal issues and weight problems., Alcoholic beverages such as spirits, wine, and beer can dehydrate you. Caffeine can have the same effect. Dehydration can make it hard to pass stools and stay regular. Let yourself enjoy a cup of coffee or an alcoholic beverage no more than once a day. This can help to keep you regular in the long run., You can further boost your fiber intake with supplements. Add the package-recommended dose of fiber powder powder with water and drink the mixture. This can bulk up your stools and help maintain regularity.Follow dosing instructions for fiber. Getting too little fiber can cause irregularity, but so can consuming too much., Physical activity can get your blood flowing and stimulate your intestines. Aim for at least 30 minutes of light physical activity most days. Recognize that 15 minutes of exercise can stimulate your bowels. This can help ease fecal material into your bowels and keep you regular.Try some of the following types of physical activity to stay regular:Running
Walking
Biking
Swimming

, It may difficult to move your bowels by sitting on the toilet. This is because sitting forces your anus into a straight position, which isn’t conduice to pooping. Squat down on to your toilet by placing your feet hip distance apart and bringing your knees close to your torso. to keep your anorectal angle in its natural position. This can help you more easily and regularly evacuate your bowels.Consider getting a foot stool on which to rest your feet while squatting. This can help you get your knees closer to your torso.

, Waiting to poop or resisting the urge to go can cause constipation. Get to a bathroom as soon as you can if you feel the urge to move your bowels. This can prevent constipation and keep you regular.Put yourself on a schedule if possible. For example, try having a bowel movement every morning. Your body will gradually adjust to the schedule and may respond by staying regular., Some people use natural oils, laxatives and enemas to stay regular. Use these only as necessary because they can cause chronic constipation. They may also injure the muscles of your colon and anus and create laxative dependence. Ask your doctor if laxative use is appropriate and safe to keep you regular."

Be aware of contaminants that take longer for symptoms to develop.,
Prepare foods using freshly cleaned utensils.",How to Stay Hydrated if You Have Food Poisoning," Most cases of food poisoning can be handled at home. Symptoms can begin within hours and last for hours or days and even longer in some cases.Mildly contaminated foods, or some types of contaminants, may not cause the symptoms to start for several days, or even longer. When the onset of symptoms is delayed, the duration of the problem can last for days to weeks.
Chronic symptoms should be promptly evaluated by a doctor especially if you are having hematemesis or hematochezia, which is bloody vomit or diarrhea, respectively.
The symptoms of food poisoning include nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhea, abdominal pain and cramps, sweating, and fever.;
, You may want to let your stomach settle for an hour or so, but then you need to start introducing fluids to prevent dehydration. Take small sips of whatever liquid you can most easily tolerate, and continue to drink as much as possible throughout the day.Sip on water or suck on ice chips. Taking small sips of water may help calm nausea and will provide your body with a small and steady dose of this essential liquid.
If your stomach is not ready for liquid, then try putting ice chips in your mouth and let them dissolve.
Try sucking on a ginger candy or drink some ginger tea. Ginger can help with digestion and treat stomach upset, diarrhea, and nausea., Diarrhea and vomiting also cause your body to lose essential electrolytes. A good way to replace the lost electrolytes is to sip on a caffeine-free sports drink (not an energy drink) once you can hold it down.


Other products are available for adults and children that help to replenish fluids and restore electrolytes. These products are called electrolyte replacement drinks.
Types of sports drinks include Gatorade and Powerade, to name a few. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist for a specific recommendation.

, Sometimes a little carbonation may actually help reduce symptoms of nausea.


Try sipping on ginger ale or other clear carbonated beverages over ice.

, Sip on clear broth, such as chicken, vegetable, or beef, once your stomach has settled enough and you are not likely to trigger the nausea and vomiting.Starting with broth is a good way to help replenish fluids and begin to introduce nutrients back into your body.
Move on to foods that are bland, low-fat, and easily digested. Some examples include saltine crackers, toast, and gelatin. Back away from these solid foods if your nausea returns.

, Some beverages should not be used while are trying to restore the fluids you lost during your illness. Some liquids pull water from your body tissues and contribute to the problem of dehydration.Alcoholic beverages are not to be used while you are still sick.
Avoid caffeinated beverages including coffee, tea, colas, or energy drinks.
Fruit juices and fruit drinks contain carbohydrates, are low in sodium, and may aggravate your upset stomach.
Avoid dairy products and spicy drinks or foods until you are feeling better.

, When you contract food poisoning, or develop any other form of gastroenteritis, the symptoms of the condition can cause dehydration to occur very rapidly. You can become dehydrated within 24 hours if you are unable to retain any liquids and the symptoms continue.The signs of dehydration include fatigue, loss of appetite, flushed skin, poor skin turgor, heat intolerance, light-headedness, dark-colored urine, and a dry cough.
Clearly some of the signs can be difficult to determine since many overlap with the symptoms of food poisoning.
In some cases, food poisoning can be severe or caused by a toxin so dangerous that professional medical attention is essential.
An example of this is B Cereus infection, which secretes a toxin that creates gastrointestinal distress. This commonly occurs after you eat infected fried rice.Watch for warning signs to determine whether you need immediate care for your dehydration.

, Dark yellow or brownish urine can be a sign of serious dehydration.


If you do not urinate at all or produce very little urine of a dark color, seek emergency care for your food poisoning.
Dehydration also causes significant weakness and fatigue. If you are so weak you can barely move or if you are so tired you can hardly stay awake despite adequate sleep, you may need medical attention.
You should consult a medical professional well before you have symptoms such as extreme weakness and problems sleeping. The doctor will be able to give you fluids to resuscitate you.

, The only helpful product available over-the-counter is loperamide, which is made to help to manage the diarrhea. Dehydration is a result of frequent vomiting and persistent watery diarrhea. The diarrhea is your body’s way of getting rid of the unwanted toxins that are causing the stomach problems. If you can endure it, let your body do its job.


However, if the watery diarrhea is continuing, then it is also contributing to your poor hydration status. At some point you have to determine if you want to slow the process by using the loperamide which can help to prevent dehydration.
Loperamide should be taken as follows: 4 mg, followed by 2 mg after each loose stool. Chronic use of loperamide is not recommended.

, If the food poisoning symptoms persist for more than two 48 hours, are severe, or are complicated by other factors, then see your doctor as soon as possible or go to an emergency room or urgent care facility.Complicating features can include age. Food poisoning in infants, young children, and the elderly warrants prompt medical attention.
Also, people that have other medical conditions that require a stable situation and the ability to take their medications on a regular basis may need medical attention to recover from food poisoning as quickly as possible.

, Sometimes the symptoms progress beyond the basic initial symptoms and can lead to medical complications if access to appropriate medical care is delayed. Examples of more severe symptoms include the following:Persistent episodes of vomiting and the inability to keep any liquids down for more than one or two days
Bloody vomit or blood in the stools
Diarrhea for more than three days
Extreme pain or severe abdominal cramping
A temperature higher than 101.5F when taken orally
Neurological changes such as blurred vision, muscle weakness, and tingling in the extremities
Dizziness, lightheadedness, and severe weakness
Unresolved signs of dehydration which include excessive thirst, dry mouth, little or no urination, and very dark colored urine

, Hospitals and other facilities will proceed quickly with trying to restore your fluid balance and resolve the dehydration. They may also do tests to determine the cause of the symptoms and prescribe treatments to help the symptoms resolve.An IV will be started to provide resuscitation of fluids and electrolytes you have lost during your episodes of vomiting and diarrhea.
If you are still nauseous and have diarrhea, medications may be given through the IV line, such as odansetron for severe nausea, to help you feel more comfortable.
Blood tests will be performed to establish the severity of your condition.
Additional tests may be done to attempt to determine the source of the contamination. This may or may not be possible.
Some types of food poisoning, for example listeria contamination, may require antibiotics to treat your condition.
If you are pregnant, prompt treatment may help prevent exposure of the contaminant to the baby.

, It may prove helpful if you know what you ate that caused the problem. Some examples of possible contaminants that have an onset of symptoms within hours after ingestion are listed below.Clostridium botulinum: symptoms begin in 12 to 72 hours, and examples of possible methods of contamination include home-canned foods, improperly canned commercial foods, smoked fish or salted fish, potatoes baked in aluminum foil, or other foods kept at warm temperatures for too long.
Clostridium perfringens: symptoms begin in 8 to 16 hours, and possible sources include meats, stews, gravies, and foods served in dishes that fail to provide adequate heat or food is chilled too slowly.
Listeria: symptoms begin in 9 to 48 hours, and possible sources include hot dogs, luncheon meats, unpasteurized milk and cheeses, unwashed raw produce, and possibly spread through contaminated soil and water.
Noroviruses: symptoms begin in 12 to 48 hours, and possible sources include raw, ready-to-eat-produce, shellfish from contaminated water, and spread by an infected food handler.
Shigella: symptoms begin in 24 to 48 hours, and possible sources include seafood, raw ready-to-eat produce, and can be spread by an infected food handler.
Staphylococcus aureus: symptoms begin in 1 to 6 hours, and possible sources include meats, prepared salads, cream sauces, cream-filled pastries, and can be spread by hand contact, coughing, and sneezing.
Bacillus Cereus: Disease occurs within 24 hours of consumption. Usually diarrhea or nausea results from eating rice contaminated with the toxin, but this condition can be from consumption of dairy products, bean sprouts, spices, and other vegetables. Treatment involves supportive measures, while antibiotics are usually not necessary., Symptoms of food poisoning often develop rapidly but some sources of contaminants can lead to a delayed presentation making it difficult to identify the source.Campylobacter: symptoms begin in 2 to 5 days, and sources include meat and poultry, with contamination occurring during processing procedures as animal feces come in contact with meat surfaces. Other sources include unpasteurized milk and contaminated water.
Escherichia coli: symptoms occur in 1 to 8 days, and common sources include beef contaminated with feces during slaughter, undercooked ground beef, unpasteurized milk, apple cider, alfalfa sprouts, and contaminated water.
Giardia lamblia: symptoms begin in 1 to 2 weeks, and common sources include raw ready-to-eat produce, contaminated water, and can be spread by an infected food handler.
Hepatitis A: symptoms begin in about 28 days, and are caused by raw ready-to-eat produce, shellfish from contaminated water, and can be spread by an infected food handler.
Rotavirus: symptoms begin in 1 to 3 days, common sources include raw ready-to-eat produce, and can be spread by an infected food handler.
Vibrio vulnificus: symptoms begin in 1 to 7 days, and sources include raw oysters, raw or undercooked mussels, clams, and scallops, and can be spread through contaminated seawater.

, Keep in mind that a problem called cross-contamination can sometimes occur.This involves preparing foods that are to be consumed raw, like salads, vegetables, or other produce, that may have been contaminated by exposure to a surface that was exposed to raw meat or fish.
Examples of utensils or surfaces that can be contaminated include cutting boards, especially wooden style boards, and knives or shredding devices that were not effectively cleaned prior to use.

Drink more water.,
Eat foods that have slight laxative effects and are high in fiber.,
Eat more fiber.,
Maintain healthy gut bacteria by eating yogurt.,
Add supplements to your diet to promote healthy digestion.,
Stimulate your bowels with a cup of coffee.",How to Soften Hard Stools1," Dehydration can cause your body to extract as much water as it can as foods move through your digestive tract, producing dry, hard stool. Drinking enough water will soften your stool and help things move along more easily.Doctors sometimes recommend about two liters, or 8 glasses, of water per day. However, that may not be enough for you, depending on your activity level and the climate you live in.
If you have frequent headaches, fatigue, dizziness, nausea, don’t urinate often, pass dark or cloudy urine, and don’t sweat much, you are probably not getting enough water.;
, Some of these, like prunes, have sorbitol. Sorbitol draws water into the stool, making it soft and easy to pass.Prunes or prune juice
Peaches
Pears
Plums
Apples
Apricots
Raspberries
Strawberries
Beans
Peas
Spinach

, Fiber is the indigestible material in plant foods. Your body passes them through without absorbing them. This means that they help to produce soft, bulky stool which is easy to pass.Most people don’t eat the entire recommended amount of fiber each day, which is 25 to 30 grams (0.88 to 1.1 oz).You need both water soluble fiber, which turns into a gel-like material in water, and insoluble fiber, which does not dissolve.
Soluble fiber is found in oats, peas, beans, apples, citrus fruits, carrots, and barley.
You can get insoluble fiber in whole-wheat flour, wheat bran, nuts, beans, and vegetables like cauliflower and green beans.
Many plants have both soluble and insoluble fiber, you can get both by eating lots of different grains and vegetables.
Eating more fiber will be most effective if you drink extra water to help dissolve the water soluble fiber.

, Your digestive tract needs the right balance of microbes to efficiently digest your food. When this microbe community gets out of balance, it can make you constipated and interfere with the absorption of nutrients. Live culture yogurt and other fermented dairy products like kefir can help restore and rebalance your gut bacteria. This can help you combat hard stools due to:Irritable bowel syndrome
Unexplained diarrhea and constipation
Diarrhea or constipation after antibiotics have killed some of the naturally occurring gut bacteria

, But be sure to consult your doctor first because some supplements may change how your body processes some medicines.


Try fiber supplements. They will make your stool bulkier, softer and easier to pass. These supplements are often called bulk forming laxatives and you should try these before moving on to other types of laxatives. Look for ones with methylcellulose, psyllium, calcium polycarbophil, and guar gum as active ingredients (e.g., FiberCon, Metamucil, Konsyl, and Citrucel).Try probiotic supplements. Probiotics are bacteria and yeasts that are like your naturally occurring gut microbes. Taking probiotics may help if you are experiencing cycles of diarrhea and constipation or irritable bowel syndrome., Coffee can have a mild laxative effect, so adding a cup or two of coffee to your daily regimen may help to keep your bowels regular.


If you already drink coffee you may either need a bit more, or your body may be too habituated for it to provide relief.

Pay attention to the foods that cause heartburn for you.,
Stop eating at least three hours before bedtime.,
Eat your food slowly.,
Drink a glass of low-fat or skim milk as a snack between meals.,
Chew a piece of sugar-free gum after meals.,
Sip a cup of herbal tea after meals.",How to Relieve Heartburn1," While there are some common foods that cause heartburn, everyone has different trigger foods. Keep track of the foods that seem to cause heartburn for you and try to avoid or at least limit your intake of those foods.


Try keeping a food diary to help you keep track of the foods that cause you heartburn.Common heartburn trigger foods include peppermint, caffeine, sodas, chocolate, citrus fruits and juices, tomatoes, onions, and high-fat foods.;
, Plan to have your last meal of the day at least three hours before bedtime, since your body requires about two hours to digest the food that you have eaten. If you lay down while there is still food in your stomach, you have a higher chance of getting heartburn., One study found that eating your food too quickly can increase the risk of heartburn. People who eat their food too fast are also more likely to suffer from gastroesophageal reflux disease, also known as GERD. Take your time while you are eating to eliminate fast eating as a factor in your heartburn.Try putting down your fork between bites and chewing your food more to help slow yourself down while you eat.

, The calcium in milk can act as a temporary acid buffer, which may help to relieve your heartburn. Keep in mind that the effects of drinking milk are only temporary, so you may need to use other methods to help stave off heartburn.A cup of yogurt might provide the same benefit as drinking milk, helping to relieve heartburn.

, Chewing gum causes your mouth to produce more saliva, which acts as an acid buffer. While you chew gum you also swallow more often, pushing acid back down into your stomach. Chew a piece of gum for 30 minutes after each meal to help relieve heartburn symptoms., Some studies have found that chamomile and licorice tea are effective against heartburn symptoms when taken after a meal. Chamomile and licorice both have anti-inflammatory properties, which may be why they help to relieve heartburn for some people. Try both kinds of tea to see if either one works for you.


Ginger has also been found effective against heartburn. You can make your own ginger tea by adding a few slices of fresh ginger to boiling water. Cover the water and allow the ginger to steep for 30 minutes before drinking. For best results, drink ginger tea about 20 minutes before a meal.Be aware that licorice should not be used long term because it contains a chemical called glycyrrhizin, which can cause tissue swelling and high blood pressure. As with any herbal medicine, talk to your doctor first."
"
Reduce your intake of foods that may cause constipation.,
Eat many small meals rather than only a few large ones.,
Exercise for at least 30 minutes per day.,
Reduce stress in your life.,
Give yourself time on the toilet after each meal.,
Use biofeedback to learn to release your pelvic floor muscles.",How to Soften Hard Stools2," Many of these foods are low in fiber, but high sugar and fat. This causes you to feel full before you've eaten enough fiber. Examples include:Milk and cheese
Squash
Sugary foods like pastries, puddings, candy and cake
Prepackaged, processed foods which usually have added sugar, salt, and fat., Eating regularly will provide your digestive tract with continuous, low level stimulation and promote healthy digestion and regular contractions.


Eat slowly to give your body time to process your food. Eating too fast makes you more likely to overeat, overwhelming your digestive system.
Chew your food thoroughly to promote easy digestion and moderate portion sizes.

, Exercise will stimulate your bowels to contract, moving food through your system.The activity should be strenuous enough to increase your heart rate like fast walking, swimming, running, or biking.
Sometimes this works surprisingly quickly. Plan a route with frequent bathrooms available!
If you have other health concerns that might make exercise inadvisable, talk to your doctor first.

, Stress has been shown to cause constipation and diarrhea, both of which may accompany hard, dry stools. Try relaxation techniques such as:Deep breathing
Yoga
Meditation
Tai chi
Massage
Listening to relaxing music
Visualizing relaxing locations
Progressive muscle relaxation where you go through your body and deliberately tense and release each muscle group

, You can simultaneously do relaxation techniques to promote movement through your system.Spend at least 10 minutes on the toilet approximately 30 minutes after eating.
Put your feet on a low stool, so your knees are above your hips. This may make the bowel movement easier.

, This can make bowel movements easier.The therapist will use a machine to measure the tension in your rectum and help you practice tightening and releasing your pelvic floor muscles.
Go to a therapist that works with a doctor or is recommended by your doctor to be sure that they are reliable.

Consult your doctor.,
Lubricate your bowels with a small amount of mineral oil.,
Try stool softeners.,
Use osmotic laxatives to make your stool wetter.,
Consider stimulant laxatives.,
Remove a fecal impaction.",How to Soften Hard Stools3," Some prescription medications can cause constipation, such as opioid pain relievers. Your doctor may recommend changing your medication or adding a laxative to counter constipation. Your doctor may recommend either over-the-counter medicines or prescribe something stronger. See your doctor right away if you have:Rectal bleeding
Severe weight loss
Fatigue
Severe abdominal pain

, Consult your doctor to determine what the right dose is for you.Wait at least two hours after eating because it may prevent you from fully absorbing the nutrients.
It will work within the next six to eight hours.
Do not take it while lying in bed, because if you accidentally inhale some of it, it can cause pneumonia in your lungs. For this reason, do not give it to children younger than seven.
Do not take mineral oil if you are pregnant, as it may prevent the uptake of nutrients and cause bleeding in the newborn if taken for a long time.

, These medications take moisture out of the intestines and use it to make your stool wetter.Common ones include Colace and Surfak.
Drink an extra few glasses to water each day when you take them.

, These medications work by generating more liquid in your intestines. This will also stimulate your intestines to contract and move stool along, though it may take a few days. Common ones include:Milk of magnesia
Magnesium citrate
Lactulose
Polyethylene glycol (MiraLax)

, These are useful if your stool is soft enough to pass, but your intestines aren’t contracting to move it through. These medications stimulate contractions and should work within 12 hours. Common ones are:Senna
Bisacodyl
Sodium Picosulphate

, If your rectum is blocked with hard, dry stool, you can get relief from a suppository, enema, or manual disimpaction.A suppository is a capsule of medication that you put in your anus where it dissolves and is absorbed.
An enema is a liquid medication that is introduced into the large intestine via the anus. This should be done by the doctor.
Manual disimpaction requires your doctor or nurse to put on gloves and insert two lubricated fingers into the rectum to break up and remove impacted feces."

Quit smoking.,
Lose weight.,
Wear loose fitting clothing.,
Change your usual sleeping position.,
Relax every day.",How to Relieve Heartburn2," Not only does smoking cause cancer and many other health problems, it may also be the cause of your heartburn. Smoking has been linked with heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Studies have found that smoking weakens the lower esophageal sphincter, which is the muscle that keeps your stomach contents from backing up into your esophagus. A weakened lower esophageal sphincter is more likely to allow stomach acids to escape and cause damage to your esophagus. Talk to your doctor about smoking cessation programs in your area, if you want to quit smoking.Try using the START acronym to quit smoking:


S= Set a quit date.
T= Tell friends and family.
A= Anticipate challenges ahead.
R= Remove tobacco products for home, work, and car.
T= Talk to your doctor for more support.

, Being overweight is thought to be a contributor to heartburn because the excess fat on your abdomen puts pressure on your stomach and may force your stomach contents back up into your esophagus. Studies have shown that a drastic weight loss is not necessary to help relieve heartburn caused by being overweight. Even a small weight loss, 5 to 10% of your body weight, may help relieve your heartburn.To lose weight, try to limit calories to 1800 to 2000 kcal a day, while also exercising for 30 minutes five times per week. You can use a fitness tracker or application to log your food and keep track of your activity.

, Tight pants and belts may be contributing to your heartburn by causing too much pressure on your abdomen and causing your stomach contents to back up. Make sure that your pants fit comfortably and that you do not wear your belt too tight. Choose clothing that is a size too big or that has an elastic waistband if your heartburn is severe., If you often suffer from nighttime heartburn, there are two positions that seem to be the most effective against heartburn: sleeping on your left side and sleeping with your upper body elevated. Try one or both of these sleep positions to see if either one helps to relieve your heartburn.


Sleeping on your left side helps aid digestion. Try sleeping on your left side if elevating your upper body does not seem to help.
Sleeping with your upper body elevated reduces the possibility that stomach acid will flow up your esophagus. Try using a wedge-shaped pillow to elevate your whole upper body. Using regular pillows will just elevate your head., Stress may contribute to your heartburn symptoms by causing your stomach to produce more stomach acid. Incorporating relaxation techniques into your daily routine, especially after you eat, may help to relieve heartburn. Try meditation, yoga, massage, aromatherapy, deep breathing, or something else to help yourself relax every day."
"
Mix 1 teaspoon of baking soda with water and drink the solution.,
Use an over the counter antacid to relieve occasional heartburn.,
Use an over the counter acid reducer to relieve frequent heartburn.,
Talk to your doctor about prescription heartburn medications.,
Discuss surgical options if medications do not help.",How to Relieve Heartburn3," Your stomach produces hydrochloric acid in order to digest food. This is a strong acid which is very corrosive and causes the burn in your chest. You can neutralize some of the acid by consuming a base, such as baking soda mixed with water. Compared with over the counter antacids, this homemade medicine doesn't taste very good. But drinking a mixture of baking soda and water will bring the pH of the liquid in your stomach and help relieve the burn.Do not use this method if you are on a low sodium diet because baking soda is very high in sodium.

, If you suffer from an occasional episode of heartburn, an over the counter antacid like Alka-Seltzer, Tums, Milk of Magnesia, Maalox, Rolaids, Pepcid Complete, or Pepto-Bismol may be all that you need to feel better. Keep one of these medicines on hand to help relieve heartburn when it strikes. Make sure that you read and follow the instructions before taking any over the counter medicine., If you have heartburn two or more times per week, then an acid reducer, like an H2 blocker or a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), may be what you need. Drugs like Pepcid, Zantac, Prilosec, and Nexium are all available over the counter. They have been approved by the FDA for up to 14 days of continuous use. Make sure that you read and follow the instructions before taking any over the counter medicine.


H2 blockers may take longer to work than other types of heartburn medicine, but the relief lasts longer.Types of H2 blockers include cimetidine, famotidine, nizatidine, or ranitidine.
PPIs may be helpful if you have heartburn more than twice per week. However, taking PPIs for more than a year may increase your risk for a broken hip, low blood levels of magnesium, pneumonia, and Clostridium difficile.Talk to your doctor before you start taking a PPI medication. Over-the-counter proton pump inhibitors include lansoprazole and omeprazole. Keep in mind that these medications can be expensive if you purchase them without a prescription.
If you find that you need to take these medicines daily for more than two weeks, then you should talk to your doctor about a prescription acid reducer., If your heartburn does not seem to respond to lifestyle changes or it is interfering with your daily activities, you should talk to your doctor about heartburn medication. Your doctor may prescribe an acid-blocking drug, like an H2 blocker, or a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to help relieve your heartburn.


Keep in mind that even though these medications will help to relieve your heartburn symptoms, your doctor will probably still recommend that you make other lifestyle changes to control your heartburn., If taking medications does not provide adequate relief, or if you do not wish to continue taking medication for your heartburn, there are surgical options. Your options include:Nissen Fundoplication. A Nissen Fundoplication will tighten and strengthen your lower esophageal sphincter. The surgeon will wrap the top of your stomach around the lower part of your esophagus, which should prevent heartburn.
Linx. Your other option is to have what is called a Linx device put in place, which is a small magnetic ring of titanium beads that behaves like your lower esophageal sphincter.

Drink plenty of water.,
Avoid drinks that dehydrate.,
Consume fiber-rich foods.,
Include yogurt in your diet.,
Avoid foods that increase your risk of constipation.,
Exercise often.",How to Soften Stool1," The water in your intestines should saturate the solid waste being produced, making it softer as a result. While water needs are different for everyone, the Institute of Medicine has determined that an adequate intake of water (AI) for men is about thirteen cups (three liters) per day, whereas AI for women is about nine cups (2.2 liters).A good way to measure whether you are drinking at is to look at your urine. If it is a pale yellow this is a good sign that you are well-hydrated. On the other hand, if it is a darker yellow, and in small amounts infrequently, you want to increase your water consumption.If you exercise a lot, you will need extra fluids (above the recommended amount of water) to compensate for fluid lost in sweat. Be sure to drink after a workout and to monitor the color of your urine.
If you are traveling, you may be extra prone to dehydration (particularly on flights). Be sure to bring water with you and to continue drinking throughout your travel day.;
, Even mild dehydration can harden stools, so you should avoid drinks that dehydrate you. This includes anything containing alcohol or caffeine.


Coffee can produced mixed results. A single cup of hot coffee consumed with plenty of water can act as an intestinal stimulant, but too much caffeinated coffee can cause stools to harden.Avoid iced coffees and soda that contain caffeine.You should also stay away from all wines, beers, and hard liquors.

, Fiber adds bulk to your stools, causing them to move faster down your GI tract. Stool retains more water by moving more quickly through your system, keeping it softer when you pass it. For best results, include approximately 25 grams for women and 38 grams for men of dietary fiber in your diet on a daily basis (most adults consume approximately half this amount so it is very important to increase it). Excellent sources of dietary fiber include:Whole grains, including whole grain bread, spaghetti, barley, bran flakes, oatmeal, and brown rice.
Legumes such as black beans, garbanzo beans, lima beans, baked beans, black-eyed peas, pinto beans, and kidney beans.
Vegetables such as green peas, broccoli, carrots, brussels sprouts, and corn.Fruits such as bananas, apples, oranges, strawberries, raspberries, pears, and raisins.Nuts like almonds, pistachios, and pecans are among your best options.
Edible seeds are another great source of fiber. Flax seeds are one of the best to try since they also contain omega-3 fatty acids. Mix one tablespoon (15 ml) of ground flax seeds with two cups (500 ml) of water and drink the mixture once per day. You can also snack on seeds that can be eaten whole, like sunflower seeds.
Note that there are two types of fiber: soluble and insoluble (the foods listed above fall into a mix of both categories). Soluble fiber adds moisture to your stools and insoluble fiber adds bulk to your stools, so both are helpful in relieving and preventing constipation., Select a brand of yogurt that contains probiotics, a type of healthy bacteria that regulates your digestive system. Probiotics have been found in some studies to help soften stools and assist with regularity.Try eating a single-serving cup of yogurt each day.
Another option is to add a daily probiotic supplement to your morning routine.
Other foods rich in probiotics include kefir, sauerkraut, and Kombucha tea. Naturally fermented foods such as these are actually more effective than the pill form of probiotics as they last much longer in your gut.

, Low-fiber foods can increase the risk of constipation, which leads to harder stool. Low-fiber foods to limit include:Cheese, ice cream, and other dairy products.Red meat.Processed foods, including fast food and microwave dinners, as well as fried foods.These foods can be difficult for your intestines to process. As a result, they pass more slowly through your gut and end up creating harder stools.

, Exercise and physical activity in general increase your body's metabolism, which makes it easier for your digestive system to process food and keep it moving.While you should aim to get thirty minutes of aerobic exercise every day, simply taking a ten- or twenty-minute walk after dinner each day can make a big difference.


Waste that sits in your colon is more likely to harden. By passing waste quickly, you can usually keep it softer.
Exercise also helps with weight loss, and people who are not overweight have been shown to have less troubles with their bowels.So this is an additional benefit of exercise.

Take note of what medications you are on.,
Add a fiber supplement.,
Take an over-the-counter laxative or stool softener.,
Ask about prescription medications for chronic constipation.,
Find out if there is an underlying cause.",How to Soften Stool2," Pay particular attention to any new medications you may have started recently, that may have correlated with the onset (or worsening) of your constipation or irregular bowel symptoms.It is not unusual for medications to affect the bowels or to cause constipation as a side effect.If you think this may be the case for you, it is best to see your physician who can assess your medication list and make any changes as needed.

, If your diet (such as a prescription diet) makes it hard for you to get more fiber, then you can also add a daily fiber supplement or bulk forming laxative. These are over-the-counter products—often pills or powders to dissolve in water. Psyllium-containing products (such as Metamucil) are some of the most popular forms of supplemental fiber., A wide array of laxatives and other softeners are available to help soften stool. You can take a stool softener in capsule, tablet, liquid, or syrup form. Follow the instructions on the package to determine the correct dosage.Ask your doctor or pharmacist for recommendations as to what medication to take. Even though these products are available over-the-counter, it is best to consult a medical professional before choosing one, especially if constipation persists for you (longer than a few days).
Your doctor will likely recommend osmotic laxatives such as milk of magnesia, lactulose, magnesium citrate, or polyethylene glycol if bulk forming laxatives did not work for you.Or, your doctor may suggest stimulant laxatives such as bisacodyl or senna if osmotic laxatives do not work for you.
Notify your doctor if you experience extreme abdominal pain, pencil-thin stools, bloody stools, constipation alternating with diarrhea, pain in the rectal area, or unexplained weight loss. These symptoms are worrisome and definitely warrant further investigation.

, If nothing seems to help or if you cannot tolerate other types of laxatives, then you should talk to your doctor about prescription medications that are available to help with constipation. Medications, such as lubiprostone and linaclotide, can help to pull water into your intestines and help to soften your stools., If you have chronic difficulties with hard stools and constipation, you may want to consult your doctor to determine if there is a medical condition causing the problem.


Common causes include pelvic floor dysfunction, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), Crohn's disease, and hypothyroidism.Each disease will need to be treated differently, so it's important that you receive an actual diagnosis.
Also be aware of the fact that certain medications (including narcotic pain medications, antidepressants, and some blood pressure medicines) can cause your stools to become harder.Your doctor may or may not decide to change the medications you're on to see if there is any improvement.

Make yourself a cup of digestive tea.,
Eat some caraway seeds.,
Add dill weed to food.,
Consider taking digestive enzymes.",How to Relieve Gas Naturally1," Some herbs may help to relieve the pain and discomfort of excessive gas when taken as a tea. These herbs appear to work by calming the intestines, allowing the re-absorption of the gases produced, and making the gas easier to pass. The next time you need relief from intestinal gas, try drinking a cup of ginger, fennel seed, chamomile, anise, peppermint, or lemon balm tea.Ginger: Drink 1-2 cups of ginger tea with meals. Make the tea by grating 1 teaspoon of fresh, peeled ginger per cup of boiled water. Steep for 5 minutes and sip throughout the meal. Ginger tea can also be drunk after the meal. If taking ginger as a supplement, follow manufacturer’s directions. It is safe for children over the age of 2 and pregnant women. Discontinue use one week before any surgical procedure because ginger may slow blood clotting.Fennel seed: Fennel seed can be used as a tea (1 teaspoon steeped in 1 cup of boiled water for 5 minutes) or taken as the whole seed (1-2 teaspoons after a meal). It is safe for babies and children and is used to treat colic in babies.Chamomile: Chamomile is safe for babies and children. Pregnant women should avoid chamomile tea as there is a risk (a very small risk) of miscarriage that has been reported. It is most often taken as a tea.Anise: Anise fruit has long been used as a carminative. Caution is advised using anise as a tea in pregnant or nursing women and children younger than 5 years old. To use, steep ½ - 1 teaspoon of dried anise fruit in 1 cup of boiled water for 5 minutes.
Peppermint: Peppermint should not be used with children under 2 years of age. To make a tea, steep 1 teaspoon of dried peppermint leaves in 1 cup of boiled water for 5 minutes.Lemon balm. Do not use lemon balm if you have a thyroid condition. To make a tea, steep 1 teaspoon of dried lemon balm leaves in 1 cup of boiled water for 5 minutes.Use cautiously and under the advice of a knowledgeable physician for children and pregnant or nursing women.;
, This seed has also been traditionally used as an after-meal digestive aid. Try eating ½- 1 teaspoon whole seed after meals or look for recipes that call for caraway seed. You can also use caraway essential oil to treat Irritable Bowel Syndrome along with peppermint oil.Ask your doctor first before giving to children or if you are pregnant or nursing.

, Dill weed has been used for centuries to reduce gas and bloating and has Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status according to the US FDA.Use some fresh dill weed in a recipe, sprinkle over food as a garnish, or steep 1 teaspoon of dried dill weed in 1 cup of water for 5 minutes.

, These are natural enzymes produced by the pancreas to help digest foods. There are three main forms of digestive enzymes: Proteases (pre-digest proteins), lipases (pre-digest fats), and amylases (pre-digest carbohydrates). These enzymes are primarily derived from animal pancreas and are used to pre-digest your food, making it easier to absorb and decrease the amounts of undigested foods available to the gas-producing bacteria.


Examples of digestive enzyme products are made by Beano, Pure Encapsulations, Nature’s Secret and Source Naturals and can be purchased online.
Take digestive enzymes about 10-20 minutes before meals.
Some plants also contain natural digestive enzymes that can help reduce gas and can reduce the use of store-bought digestive enzymes. For instance, pineapple and papaya break up proteins, mangoes break down carbohydrates, and honey can break up proteins and carbohydrates."

Pass gas when you need to.,
Get more exercise.,
Limit your intake of foods that commonly cause gas.,
Increase probiotics in your diet.,
Slow down when you are eating.,
Talk to your doctor.",How to Relieve Gas Naturally2," Sometimes you may feel gas moving through your system and feel like you need to release it. Do not hold it in if you feel the need to pass gas. Find a private area and try to pass some of the gas. Holding in gas for “social purposes” is only going to make the discomfort worse.


Take a bathroom break.
Take a walk around the block (the movement and exercise will usually help move the gas out faster).
Have a “coffee break” to give yourself the time and the room to pass some gas.

, Regular exercise can help to stimulate your digestive system and may reduce the gas buildup. Aim for 30 minutes of moderate physical activity every day. You can even spread your exercise throughout the day in 10-15 minute sessions. For example, you could go for a 15 minute walk on your lunch break and then do a 15 minute workout video later in the day.Just try to find something that you enjoy and will stick with in order to incorporate more physical activity into your daily routine.

, Some individuals may be more prone to intestinal gas because of food sensitivities (lactose intolerance, gluten sensitivity), the types of foods in their diet (rice is more easily digested than potatoes, for example) and the types or populations of gut bacteria residing in their intestines —the gut flora can vary depending on where you live, what you eat and your overall state of health:. Try avoiding the following foods


Wheat products
Milk and other dairy products
High-fat foods
Beans
Cruciferous vegetables like Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli
Onions
Apples
Corn
Oats
Potatoes
Fruits such as pears, prunes, and peaches.

, Probiotics help to promote helpful gut bacteria that improve digestion. They can also lower the amount of ""bad"" bacteria in your system that can cause infections or other problems. Taking probiotics can help to balance your ""good"" and ""bad"" bacteria and keep your body working like it should.Eat yogurt. Yogurt containing active cultures of bacteria can replace and renew normal gut flora. Studies have shown that yogurt with probiotic containing lactobacillus or bifidobacterium strains have been especially effective in improving symptoms for irritable bowel syndrome.
Incorporate probiotic foods, such as miso, tempeh, kimchi, sauerkraut, and pickles.Consider taking a probiotic supplement. Look for a probiotic that includes information about the dose, genus, species, and strain of the probiotic, number of organism that will be alive by the use by date, and the company’s name and contact information., Some gas in the digestive system comes from swallowing air while eating — this may be due to gulping, eating or drinking too fast and not chewing enough.You can reduce the amount of air swallowed and help prevent excess gas if you eat your food at a slower pace and chew it well. Try putting down your fork between bites and chewing each bite 40 times for maximum nutrient absorption., If your intestinal gas does not improve within 2-3 weeks, call your physician for an appointment. Your gas may be due to another condition or a medication you are taking. Be sure to discuss any other symptoms that you have been having as well as any medications (prescription or over-the-counter) that you are taking.Call your physician right away if your gas is associated with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, heartburn or GERD, unintended weight loss, or blood in the stool."

Understand where intestinal gas comes from.,
Be aware of intestinal disorders that cause gas.,
Keep a diet diary.",How to Relieve Gas Naturally3," It’s important to understand intestinal gas build up in order to help prevent it. Some amount of intestinal gas is perfectly normal-- it is produced by the normal gut bacteria (gut flora) that are essential for digestive, immune and overall health. The gut bacteria (also known as the microbiome) produce gases such as hydrogen, carbon dioxide and methane as the bacteria digest complex carbohydrates (eg. cellulose), sugars (eg lactose, sorbitol and fructose)and long-chained sugars (polysaccharides such as starch)., If you have a persisting problem with intestinal gas and it is inhibiting you from carrying out your daily routine, you may be suffering from a health complication. Call your physician right away if your gas is associated with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, heartburn or GERD, unintended weight loss or blood in the stool.Here’s a list of some possible conditions:


Celiac disease — an autoimmune disease based on cross-reactions with gluten
Dumping syndrome — occurs after surgery to remove part (or all) of the stomach to help an individual lose weight.
Food allergy or intolerance — lactose and gluten intolerance are examples.
GERD — gastroesophageal reflux disease is a condition in which the stomach contents leak backwards from the stomach into the esophagus.Gastroparesis — the muscles of the stomach do not work properly, preventing your stomach from emptying correctly.Irritable bowel syndrome — a chronic condition that can cause abdominal cramps, bloating, gas, diarrhea and constipation.
Stomach ulcers — pits or erosions in the lining of the stomach.
Rarely, intestinal gas can also be caused by intestinal parasites. They are usually transmitted when someone comes in contact with infected feces (like contaminated soil, food, or water)., Write down exactly what you eat and what you experience after eating it. Note whether you feel boated, burp a lot, or pass gas after eating something. This can help you narrow down what if any foods increase intestinal gas for you.If you can identify a food that increases your gas, the best approach is to simply avoid it, or eat it only in small quantities.

Castor oil contains certain ingredients that may affect you if you are allergic to them.;
, Pregnant, breastfeeding, and menstruating women should not use castor oil. Other people who should not use castor oil to treat constipation include:People experiencing severe abdominal pain
People with intestinal blockage or gallbladder disease
People with nausea or vomiting
People experiencing undiagnosed abdominal pain or rectal bleeding
Castor oil should not be taken with a diuretic unless supervised by a physician. Electrolyte imbalances can result, particularly regarding potassium.

, Most people take castor oil without any trouble, but you should be prepared to experience a few possible side effects. Most of these are harmless and will go away before too long, but some are more serious.Minor side effects include abdominal pain or cramps, nausea, diarrhea, and weakness. These are generally short-lived. If they persist, contact your doctor.
More serious side effects include vomiting, irregular heartbeat, dizziness, and confusion. Also be on the lookout for a rash or itching affecting a large portion of the body, as this may indicate that you are having an allergic reaction. Stop use and contact your doctor right away if you experience these symptoms.

, Though usage of castor oil is not as common as it was in the past, most drug stores and supermarkets carry it. It typically comes in a small brown bottle, and is displayed in the gastrointestinal section.


When buying castor oil, look for keywords on the label like cold pressed/processed, virgin, 100% pure, and USP food grade to ensure that you are getting a high quality product., There are a few different guidelines for determining the proper amount of castor oil to take.


If you're taking castor oil under a doctor's guidance, take the proper dosage she prescribed.
Some bottles of castor oil come with specific dosing instructions. Read the label to see if there is a recommended dose.
If your doctor hasn't prescribed an amount and the label doesn't recommend a dose, the general rule is 15-60 mL for adults and and children over 12, 5-15 mL for children age 2-11 years, and 1-5 mL for children younger than 2 years., This will make the medicine work more quickly. If you want a slower result, take it with food., It is important to not use a kitchen spoon as a substitute for a measuring spoon or cup. Silverware is not accurately sized and could result in an improper dosage., Castor oil is known for its notoriously bitter and unappealing taste. You can make taking the dose more enjoyable by diluting the medicine with juice.


Be sure to use only cranberry, orange, prune, or ginger juice for mixing. Other juices may dilute the medicine's laxative effects.You can also chill the castor oil for at least an hour to reduce the unpleasant taste., Castor oil may work in as little as 2 hours or as much as 6 hours. If you don't have a bowel movement in this time, you may have a more serious problem like an intestinal blockage or impaction. Consult your doctor right away.Don't take castor oil at night, as the laxative effect is usually very rapid., Castor oil is known to clean out the entire intestinal tract rather than just the colon. Because of this, it is common to not have another bowel movement for 2 or 3 days after your constipation is successfully cleared., Follow the steps in the section on taking your first dose.

, Staying consistent with your dose will help you have regular and predictable bowel movements. Because castor oil tends to work within a few hours, it is usually best to take it first thing in the morning rather than at night., Castor oil is usually considered a temporary treatment for constipation and is not meant to be taken long-term. Unless under a doctor's supervision, you should not take castor oil for more than 7 days at a time. This could risk an overdose or increased dependence on castor oil to stay regular.Overusing castor oil can also cause dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.

, As long as you take castor oil as directed, this shouldn't be a problem. If you experience any of the following symptoms, however, you should stop use and contact your doctor.Prolonged diarrhea.
Serious abdominal pain.
Dizziness or confusion.
Vomiting.
Shortness of breath or chest pains.

, If you've taken castor oil but are still having digestive issues, you may be suffering from a different condition than simple constipation. Visit your doctor and see if there is another cause for your constipation.

Drink more fluids.,
Increase your fiber intake.,
Cut back on low-fiber foods.,
Avoid junk food.,
Regulate your caffeine intake.",How to Relieve Chronic Constipation1," Dehydration can worsen constipation by leading to hard, dry stools. When food waste passes through the colon, the colon absorbs water from the waste. If you are drinking adequate amounts of fluids, the colon will soak up less water from the food waste, resulting in softer stools.


Strive to drink about eight full glasses of water a day, or about two liters.Start your day with two glasses right after you wake up, even before coffee.
You should drink more water if you live in a very warm climate or when it's hot out. Be sure to also drink water while exercising to counteract the water lost through sweating.
You may also need to drink more water as you increase your daily intake of fiber.
If you suffer from heart or kidney problems and are receiving medical attention for either of these conditions, consult your doctor about your fluid intake before you make any major changes.;
, A healthy diet includes insoluble and soluble fiber. Soluble fiber helps the body to absorb more nutrients from the food you eat. Insoluble fiber does not break down in the body, but this type of fiber adds bulk and water to the stool, making it faster and more comfortable to pass the stool.Adults should aim to consume about 21-38 grams of fiber daily, depending on their age and sex. Women should eat 21-25 grams of fiber every day, while men require 30-38 grams.Sources of soluble fiber include oats, oat bran, apples, nuts, lentils and peas. Sources of insoluble fiber include wheat bran, seeds, almonds, whole grains, and most fruits and vegetables.Make sure to eat legumes and citrus fruits. In addition to fiber, these foods help colonic bacteria flourish which keeps the intestines healthier. Legumes in particular are among those foods that have the most fiber per serving.Incorporate prunes into your diet. Prunes are a good source of soluble and insoluble fiber and sorbitol, which has a natural laxative effect.Add more whole fruits and vegetables to your diet. Make sure you eat the skins on fruits and veggies, since the skin usually contains most of the insoluble fiber. Also be sure to eat whole fruits instead of fruit juices, which usually have less fiber and more sugar., These would include meat, ice cream, cheese, chips, meat, fast foods, and prepared and processed foods like hot dogs and frozen dinners. These low-fiber but high-fat foods may actually worsen constipation., Fatty, sugary foods like cookies, crackers, cakes, and so on, tend to slow the digestive system down, since the gut is working to get all the calories it can from the fat in them., Caffeinated drinks like coffee, tea, and soda have a diuretic effect and can lead to dehydration. However, caffeinated beverages can also promote contractions in the bowels and lead to bowel movements. In general, try to limit yourself to one cup of a caffeinated beverage per day, preferably in the morning to stimulate the bowels."

Get regular.,
Go to the bathroom when you need to go.,
Get in the right position.,
Exercise.,
Catch up on your sleep.,
Relax your mind.",How to Relieve Chronic Constipation2," Go to the bathroom at the same time each morning. Make this part of your morning routine because it is at this time that colonic motor activity is highest. In addition, the urge to have a bowel movement generally increases after you've had a meal, so try to take advantage of these natural signals from your body.Eat on a regular schedule to help ""train"" your body to regulate defecation. Try to eat your main meals around the same time each day. Your bowels love a routine!Since the mornings are peak times for bowel movements, make sure you eat high-fiber foods after you wake up. You may also want to include a hot drink (such as a cup of coffee) since warm beverages are calming and can help get the bowels moving., Start listening to your body and don't ignore the urge to have a bowel movement because you want to wait until you get home or you want to finish the movie you were watching. The movements that trigger a bowel movement, called peristalsis, come and go, meaning that if you don't go immediately, that urge may disappear. The longer stool stays in the bowel, the harder it gets as more water is reabsorbed, usually resulting in a more painful and uncomfortable bowel movement when you finally have one. , The position in which you try to eliminate stool can help you stimulate the bowels, although it is important to note that there is no right or wrong way to sit on the toilet. The following tips, however, might help make having a bowel movement easier and less painful: When you sit down on the toilet, place your feet on a small footstool. This helps to get your knees higher than your hips, which positions the rectum at such an angle that makes it easier to pass feces.Try leaning forward when sitting on the toilet. Rest your hands on your thighs. The leaning forward action will also help to get your rectum at a better angle.Try to stay relaxed and breathe deeply. Relax your anal sphincter to open your rectum and let the stool pass out., Many people experience an improvement in their constipation when they begin exercising or increase the amount of exercise they get. Doctors believe exercise helps food move more quickly through the large intestine. This means the colon has less time to absorb water from the stool. Aerobic exercise increases breathing and heart rate which can also stimulate the intestinal muscles to contract, which is an important factor in moving stools through the intestines.Do an aerobic exercise that gets your heart rate up for a period of at least 20-30 minutes, 3-4 times a week. If you can, try to do some exercise every day, even just walking for 15-20 minutes. Daily exercise will hopefully stimulate daily bowel movements because as you become active so do your bowels.Incorporate a more intensely aerobic exercise or non-competitive sports into your routine if you are already moderately active. Try running, swimming, or aerobic classes.
Abdominal strengthening exercises can also help stimulate the muscles in the digestive system., Lack of adequate sleep over a long time aggravates constipation and can lead to a more severe condition.Try to get between 7-8 hours a night of restful sleep. The bowels can also ""sleep "" night, so when you wake up, you may be able to have a bowel movement since that is the peak time!

, Because mental stress can interfere with relaxation of the whole body, including the bowels, it's important to use some type of relaxation technique daily. Doctors believe that some patients cannot push properly when having a bowel movement because they feel rushed and stressed out. In other words, stress increases constipation.Take up relaxing activities like yoga, meditation, swimming, etc. Read a book or watch a movie to escape to another world.

Use bulk-forming agents (or fiber).,
Take lubricant laxatives.,
Take emollient laxatives.,
Take osmotic laxatives.,
Take stimulant laxatives.,
Try natural or herbal laxatives.,
Note that all of these OTC treatments should only be temporary.",How to Relieve Chronic Constipation3," Fiber helps absorb fluid in your intestines and make your stool bulkier, which in turn helps the bowels contract and push the stool out. It is important, however, that you try to incorporate more fiber into your diet before trying a supplement as this is truly the best way to get more fiber. Most bulk-forming agents can be taken in capsule or powder form and mixed with 8 oz of water or fruit juice. Follow any directions on the label and only take the recommended dosage. Potential side effects include increased flatulence, cramping, and bloating. Most people see results within 12 hours to 3 daysCommon bulk-forming laxatives include:



Psyllium - Psyllium is a soluble fiber used to increase bulk and stimulate the bowels to contract and release stool with ease. A significant amount of research has suggested that psyllium can relieve constipation. You can find psyllium in the widely available product Metamucil. You must drink at least 8 oz of liquid when you take psyllium.Polycarbophil - Polycarbophil calcium has been shown in several studies to help treat chronic constipation., With the main ingredient being mineral oil, lubricants work by coating the surface of stool, which helps the stool keep fluid and pass more easily. Most people see results within hours of consumption. Popular brand names available in most pharmacies include Fleet and Zymenol. Lubricants are simple and inexpensive laxatives, but should only be used as a short-term prescription. The mineral oil in lubricants can decrease the effectiveness of certain prescription drugs and can also inhibit the absorption of fat-soluble vitamin and minerals in your body.Lubricant laxatives are generally taken at bedtime and may be taken orally on an empty stomach and in an upright position. Be sure to drink at least 8 oz of water or juice after you take this laxative.Physicians do not recommend mineral oil for persistent treatment of constipation., Better known as stool softeners, emollient laxatives, such as Colace and Docusate, work to increase the amount of water in the stool and to thereby soften it. These laxatives take longer to work (usually 1-3 days) but are commonly used by those who are recovery from surgery, women who have just given birth, and individuals suffering from hemorrhoids.Stool softeners come in capsule, tablet, and liquid form, and are generally taken at bedtime. Follow any directions on the label and take only the recommended dosage. Make sure to take capsules and tablets with a full glass of water.
For liquid stool softeners, there should be a marked dropper that helps you measure the exact dose. Ask the pharmacist for help if you're not sure how to use it. Mix the liquid 4 oz of juice or milk to mask its bitter taste and to make it easier to get down.

, Osmotic agents help your stool retain fluid and increase the number of bowel movements. Osmotic laxatives include Fleet Phospho-Soda, Milk of Magnesia, and Miralax, all of which work to draw fluid into the intestines from surrounding tissue. Potential side effects include dehydration, gas, cramps, and a mineral imbalance in your system. Older adults and people with existing heart or kidney problems should be careful when taking osmotic agents because of their dehydrating properties.Osmotic agents come in pill or powder form. Miralax, for example, is a powder that should be dissolved in 4-8 oz of water or fruit juice. The bottle comes with a measure device so that you can take the appropriate dosage (17 g). You can also buy single-dose packets. Follow any other directions on the bottle and only take the recommended dosage., Stimulant laxatives cause the intestines to contract, which moves stool quickly and pushes it out. You should only use stimulants if your constipation is severe and you feel like you require immediate relief. Stimulant laxatives should not be used on a continuing basis to treat chronic constipation. You should see results within 6-10 hours. Popular brands include Ex-Lax, Dulcolax, and Correctol. These laxatives can cause cramping and diarrhea.Stimulant laxatives can be taken orally (in pill, powder, or liquid form) or as a rectal suppository. Always take stimulant laxatives as directed and take only the recommended dosage. This type of laxative is generally taken at bedtime. Stimulant laxatives are the harshest laxatives on the body.They should not be used regularly or daily because they can weaken the body's ability to have a bowel movement on its own. They can also limit your body's ability to absorb vitamin D and calcium. Consult your physician if you're using these laxatives for more than one week., There are also a number of remedies to relieve constipation that involve household ingredients and/or herbs. However, you should note that many of these are not supported by strong scientific research. Consult with your pediatrician before giving any of these remedies to your child. Some of the most popular natural or herbal remedies for constipation include:



Aloe vera - Aloe juice or aloe latex, a yellow, bitter liquid derived from the skin of the aloe leaf, is a powerful laxative and can stimulate bowel movements. However, it can cause painful cramping and physicians do not recommend its use as a laxative. Baking soda - As a bicarbonate solution when mixed with water, baking soda helps relieve constipation and can also provide relief from stomach aches. Mix 1 teaspoon of baking soda in a 1/4 cup of warm water and drink the mixture.You could also try taking a bath with baking soda, by adding 2 tablespoons of baking soda to the bathwater and then soaking in the water for 5-10 minutes. This may help loosen the stool.Blackstrap molasses - Mix 2 teaspoons of blackstrap molasses in a cup of warm water. Then drink up. Blackstrap molasses is rich in magnesium, which helps ease bowel movements.Lemon juice - Lemon juice helps to cleanse the intestine and induce bowel movements. Add 1 teaspoon of lemon juice to a glass of warm water and add a pinch of salt. Drink the solution on an empty stomach., If you find yourself using a laxative for more than 1 week, you should consult your physician. Laxative abuse can actually worsen constipation, as your body may come to rely on the laxative in order to pass a stool.YNever use laxatives to be ""regular"". Always try to incorporate more fiber into your diet first."

Understand that chronic constipation is common and has multiple causes.,
Take note of your symptoms.,
Make an appointment with a doctor.",How to Relieve Chronic Constipation4," Chronic constipation affects between 15% and 20% of Americans. Even people who eat healthily, exercise, and drink lots of water can still suffer from chronic constipation.Lifestyle issues - Constipation has been related to a number of factors related to lifestyle and diet, including inadequate water intake, inadequate fiber intake, over-consumption of dairy, and a lack of exercise, among others.Existing or new medical conditions - Some medical conditions can cause changes in the bowels and chronic constipation, including colon cancer, hypothyroidism, irritable bowel syndrome, Parkinson's disease, and diabetes.Medications - Medications that often have constipation as a side effect include pain medications, antacids like calcium and aluminum, calcium channel blockers, iron supplements, and diuretics among others.Aging - As people get older, they become more sedentary (and get less physical activity), eat less fiber and drink less water, all of which contributes to chronic constipation. In addition, many over-the-counter and prescription medications taken to treat conditions more common in older people, such as arthritis, back pain, and hypertension, can cause chronic constipation.Psychological issues - For some people, chronic constipation is related to specific psychological issues, including depression, sexual or physical abuse, or loss of a family member or friend, among other emotional triggers.Nerve and muscle function in the bowels - In some cases, lack of proper nerve and muscle function can cause constipation. In particular, in cases of pelvic floor dysfunction (dyssynergic defecation), the muscles of the lower pelvis surrounding the rectum do not function properly and can cause constipation., Some physicians believe that chronic constipation cannot solely be determined by the frequency of bowel movements, but that a host of other symptoms need to be assessed, or what has been termed a ""symptom complex"". These include:Hard stools.
Excessive straining when having a bowel movement.
A lack of feeling of relief after a bowel movement or a sense that the bowel movement was incomplete.
A sensation that you are unable to have a bowel movement.
A decrease in frequency of bowel movements (fewer than 3 per week over a period of several months)

, If the dietary and lifestyle changes discussed above do not relieve constipation, consult your primary care physician. It's important to seek medical attention if you suffer from chronic constipation or if constipation is new to you, as it can be a symptom of a more serious medical condition.Be prepared to provide your doctor with information on your constipation, including the number of times per week you pass a stool, how long you have experienced difficulty defecating, and a list of any medications you may be taking. Be sure as well to tell your doctor of any treatments you have undertaken, including laxatives and lifestyle or dietary changes.
Your doctor will perform a rectal examination to check for tears, hemorrhoids, and any other abnormalities, and then do laboratory testing to screen you for different diseases and conditions. If after these tests and a comprehensive medical history interview the cause of your constipation is still uncertain, your doctor may order an imaging study of the colon and rectum to check for more serious problems, such as an obstruction.
In severe cases, your doctor may order more tests or refer you to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation.

Use a stool softener.,
Pick up a gentle laxative.,
Add in a lubricant.,
Try a suppository or enema.,
Manage your pain medication.,
Always talk to your doctor.",How to Relieve Constipation After Surgery1," One of the first medications to try if you're feeling constipated is a stool softener. These are easy to find over-the-counter and can help get you back on track.The way that stool softeners work is that they draw water into your stool from your intestines. This makes your stool softer and easier to pass.
Note that stool softeners do not necessarily give you the urge to go. They only make it easier to go.
Take a stool softener one to two times per day or as directed by your surgeon or the directions on the box.
If a stool softener does not work, or doesn't provide you the urge to go, you may need to add in an additional medication.;
, To pair with a stool softener, you may want to consider adding in a laxative. These are the medications that will give you the urge to go.There are two main types of laxatives: stimulants and osmotics. Try using an osmotic laxative first. Stimulants can cause diarrhea and stomach cramping.
Osmotic laxatives work by drawing in fluid into your intestines and helping to move stool through your colon.
Many times, a combination of a stool softener and an osmotic laxative is a great choice when it comes to relieving constipation.

, A less well known way to relieve post-surgical constipation is by adding in a lubricant. This is another option that you can find easily over-the-counter.


Lubricants are similar to stool softeners in the sense that they make it easier for your stool to be passed; however, they work by lubricating your colon instead of drawing fluid into your stool.Oil based products, like mineral or cod oil, are common lubricants. They aren't the best tasting, but do help relieve constipation without stomach cramping or diarrhea.

, If more gentle methods of relieving constipation are not working, you may need to change your methods. Using a suppository or enema are other ways to relieve more severe constipation.


Suppositories are generally made with glycerin. When inserted, the glycerin is absorbed by your rectal muscles causing them to gently contract. This helps make it easier to go and provides you with the urge to go.Prior to using a suppository, you may want to consider using a stool softener as well. It might be somewhat painful to pass stool that's been compacted for a while.
Another option to try is an enema. Although not pleasant, these usually relieve constipation immediately. Check with your surgeon to make sure this is ok, as you should not use them after certain types of operations, particularly on the lower colon and rectum.
Purchase an enema over-the-counter and read the instructions thoroughly. Only use an enema once. If no stool is produced, call your physician., There are a variety of medications that you can take to relieve your postoperative constipation; however, there are other medications you should manage to make sure they don't continue to cause constipation.


One of the main reasons patients become constipated after surgery is that they're on prescription pain medications. Although these medications are obviously very necessary, they do slow your bowels down.If you've been prescribed prescription pain medications, only take as much as you need and follow your doctor's instructions for use.
Assess your pain level every day. If it's decreasing, ease up on your pain medications. The sooner you can cut back or stop pain medications, the quicker your bowels will get back to normal.
Also, if you only have minimal pain, ask your physician if you can take a mild, over-the-counter pain medication instead, which is less likely to contribute to the constipation.

, Regardless of what medication you want to take, if you're feeling constipated and need medications to assist you, talk to your doctor first.


Most of the gentle over-the-counter constipation medications are safe and appropriate to use.
However, some medications may interfere with prescriptions provided to you after your surgery or are not safe due to the type of surgery you've had.
If you're feeling constipated and are unsure of what you're allowed to take, call your doctor or the physician on call. Ask exactly what you can and cannot take, how often to take it and when to call back.

Add more fiber-rich foods to your diet.,
Increase the intensity of fiber.,
Take a fiber supplement.,
Hydrate well.,
Add prunes or prune juice to your diet.,
Try the banana cure for mild constipation.,
Avoid foods that may cause constipation.,
Avoid alcohol.",How to Relieve Constipation1," Fiber-rich foods are known to help stimulate your bowels. Unfortunately, these foods, such as many fruits and vegetables, often get overlooked in a person's daily diet. Don't think of veggies or fruits as optional side dishes, but as crucial parts of every balanced meal. Not only will these foods relieve constipation, but they will also promote digestive health by improving your diet. Recommended fiber intake varies greatly by age, sex, and other factors, so talk with your doctor or use an online tool to help you figure out how much you should be getting.Here are some foods to add to your diet:Avocado, split peas, broccoli, kale, green peas, and lentils
Bran cereal, oatmeal, brown rice, and flax seeds
Black beans, kidney beans, lima beans, navy beans, pinto beans, and soybeans
Raspberries, blackberries, strawberries, blueberries, and oranges
Cabbage and cauliflower
Almonds, dried figs, and olives
Papaya and peaches;
, If adding a few fiber-rich foods to your diet doesn't improve your problem, you can try a three-day fast of a high-fiber vegetable, or substituting one or two of your meals for foods that are entirely fiber-rich. This is not a good long-term solution because a balanced diet does require proteins and carbohydrates as well, but the three-day method can work in a pinch.


Cabbage is particularly good because it's not only high in fiber, but it has enzymes which encourage the entire digestive tract to ""flush.""
Cabbage can be prepared in a number of ways, including skillet frying, if the oil used is grape-seed oil or olive oil. You should vary your recipes so the three-day fast becomes enjoyable.

, Consider taking a fiber supplement even if you think you are able to get that much fiber from your daily meals. Though these supplements aren't guaranteed to work, they have helped people relieve their constipation in some cases. Some semi-synthetic or synthetic fibers, such as Citrucel, Metamucil, or Perdiem, can do the trick., Constipation can also be caused by insufficient hydration. Generally drink a minimum of 33-66 ounces (1.5-2 liters) per day, or more depending on your size, the weather, or amount of exercise. Constipation results from a lack of liquid in your stools, and hydrating can help this problem.


If you're having a bout of constipation, increase your water consumption for 3-4 days, starting with a big glass in the morning and drinking regularly throughout the day.
Water may not help with all forms of constipation, but can help relieve constipation caused by dehydration. Likewise, drinking water before and during meals may help prevent future constipation.Other drinks, such as juice and soda, cannot compare regardless of how healthy or natural they are, because they tend to contain excessive sugar that could actually exacerbate constipation., Prunes are especially high in fiber and contain sorbitol, a stool-loosening sugar that naturally helps relieve constipation. Sorbitol is a mild colonic stimulant that helps reduce transit time of stool and thus decrease the risk of constipation.If you don't like the wrinkly texture or unique taste of prunes, prune juice may be a more palatable alternative.


Prunes can be more effective for relieving constipation than prune juice. Prunes have 14.7g of sorbitol per 100g, whereas prune juice has 6.1g per 100g. You will have to drink more prune juice to achieve the same health benefits because the prunes are processed, and you will have to take in additional sugars.

, This requires that you eat a banana by thoroughly chewing it. Make sure that the banana is very ripe, not unripe, or it can have the opposite effect., Constipation can result from over consumption of refined sugar, and dairy in comparison to fiber from whole grains, bran, fruits and vegetables. Avoid foods that are high in sugar, like candy or cookies, as well as too much cheese, red meat, white bread, white rice, and hard boiled eggs. You don't have to cut these foods out of your diet completely, but you should cut down on these foods if you're having trouble evacuating your bowels. Here are some other foods to avoid:Chips and crackers
Frozen dinners, which are often high in fat and low in fiber
Cookies
Fried foods like fries, doughnuts, and onion rings
Heavily breaded foods
Dairy products like butter, ice cream, and cheeseRed meat

, Alcohol can dehydrate you and make you more constipated.Limiting or stopping your intake of alcohol can help you relieve your bowels."

They can cause chronic constipation, injure the muscles of your colon and anus, and create dependence on laxatives to move your bowels. Ask your doctor if any of these treatments are suitable and safe for you., A home remedy used for generations, castor oil acts as a natural laxative. It breaks down into a substance that stimulates the intestines, which may relieve your constipation. Combining castor oil with massage may provide even quicker relief.Take 1-2 teaspoons of castor oil on an empty stomach. This should make you poop within 8 hours.
Mix castor oil with a sweetener such as orange juice. This can cut down on its bad taste.Avoid taking more castor oil than the recommended dose. Doing so may lead to overdose.

Let it out.,
Apply some heat.,
Drink mint or ginger tea.,
Eat garlic soup.,
Use over-the-counter gas relief medicine.",How to Relieve Gas1," If you're experiencing extreme gas pain, trying to hold the gas inside your body for the sake of social decorum is only going to make the pain worse. Remember that the average person passes gas ten times per day, and there's nothing abnormal about needing to do so, even if the timing seems inconvenient.


It might help to find a restroom and stay there until the bout of gas pain has subsided. If possible, stay at home and allow yourself to completely recover before going about your day.
When you're in a comfortable place, relax your muscles and change your positioning so the gas can exit your body more easily.;
, Gas leads to uncomfortable tightness in the abdominal region, and this pain can be eased by treating it with heat.

Increase your fluid intake.,
Drink a natural laxative tea.,
Reach for prunes or prune juice.,
Add in a fiber supplement.,
Avoid foods that promote constipation.",How to Relieve Constipation After Surgery2," One very essential way to prevent and treat constipation naturally is by drinking an adequate amount of fluids. The second you're able to drink in the hospital, start sipping on hydrating fluids.In general, people need about eight 8-oz glasses (2 liters) of clear, hydrating fluids each day; however, you may want to aim for more than that to help get your bowels restarted after your surgery.Try fluids like: water, sparkling water, flavored water, decaf coffee and decaf tea.
Avoid caffeinated beverages since these can deplete your body of fluids. Also stay away from sodas, fruit juice cocktails, fruit drinks, alcohol and energy drinks.

, In addition to plain water, there are some teas that are designed to help give you the gentle urge to go. Try including these teas as part of your fluids after surgery.


Look at your local pharmacy or a health food store for natural laxative teas. These are not stimulants and just combine herbs and dried tea to help relieve constipation.Since there are a variety of herbs and teas that can help move your bowels, look at the front description. It should say ""gentle laxative"" or ""bowel regulation."" This is the type you're looking for.
Try to drink these teas plain without adding sugar; however, just a touch of added sweetness from honey won't hurt.
Drink a glass or two of these teas daily, but don't overdo it. Many times, it takes a few hours for these herbal remedies to work.

, An old school natural remedy for constipation that works well is adding prunes or prune juice to your diet. This is a great first remedy to try when you're feeling constipated.Both prunes and 100% prune juice are great natural laxatives. Prunes have a naturally occurring sugar known as sorbitol which acts like a gentle laxative.
Start by drinking about 4 – 8 oz of prune juice once a day. Make sure that you buy 100% prune juice. In addition, if the prune juice is warm, it can help alleviate your constipation a bit quicker.
If you want to eat prunes for your constipation relief, buy prunes with no added sugar if you can. Measure out a 1/2 cup of prunes to start with.

, Another natural method to relieving constipation is by adding in a fiber supplement. When combined with an increase in clear fluids, this is a great way to soften your stools and make it easier to go.There are a few different ways that you can add fiber to your diet. The most common are fiber capsules, fiber gummies and fiber powder. All are acceptable as a supplement.

, There are a variety of natural ways to get your bowels going and making your stools soft; however, there are foods that you should avoid or limit immediately after your surgery.


Some nutrients in food, like potassium and calcium, can promote constipation or make it worse. If you're eating foods that have high levels of these nutrients or eating them in large quantities, you could worsen constipation.

Track your bowel habits.,
Eat a high-fiber diet with lots of fluids.,
Stay active.,
Stick to a regular pattern.",How to Relieve Constipation After Surgery3," Prior to your surgery, start paying attention to your bowel habits. This will help you figure out if you need to proactively treat constipation or just be prepared to treat it after surgery.


Knowing that surgery can cause some constipation, you need to be paying attention to your bowel habits prior to your procedure.
Note how often you go. Is it everyday? Is it two times a day or every other day?
In addition, start paying attention to whether or not it's easy to go. Even if you're feeling regular, if you have difficulty passing stools, this is still a part of constipation.
If you notice that you're having some signs of constipation, treat it before going into surgery. It could worsen after your surgery.

, To help keep your bowels moving prior to surgery, make sure you pay attention to your diet and fluid consumption. If you're not eating well prior to surgery, this could set you up for more constipation issues after your surgery.A high-fiber diet is one key aspect to constipation prevention. Knowing you have surgery coming up, focus on meeting your daily fiber recommendations.
The highest fiber foods include: legumes (like beans and lentils), 100% whole grains (like oatmeal, brown rice, quinoa or whole wheat bread), fruits and vegetables.
Track your fiber content in a food journal or tracking app. Women should aim for 25 grams of fiber daily and men should consume at least 38 grams of fiber per day.Also focus on meeting the minimum fluid guidelines each day. Remember, you should aim for at least 64 oz of clear, hydrating fluids each day.

, In addition to monitoring your diet prior to your surgery, also keep up with your physical activity routine. This is another essential component to constipation prevention.You should start walking around as soon as your doctor gives you the okay after surgery. Being active after surgery not only helps prevent constipation, it can also aid in overall healing.Regular exercise stimulates your colon. In addition, aerobic exercises with light impact (like walking or running) have some force on your colon to help promote regularity.

Try: walking, running/jogging, using the elliptical, hiking, dancing, biking or swimming.

, In general, it's important to try to maintain a regular bowel pattern. Pay attention to your body's signal so that you don't cause constipation.


Your body is great at giving you signals when it needs something - like the need to go to the bathroom.
If you feel the urge to go, don't delay or push it off. Sometimes, ignoring the urge will make the urge go away. If you continually push it off, you will cause yourself to become constipated.Over time, if you take care of your body and don't ignore it, you'll notice your body will stay consistent. You'll probably end up going to the bathroom around the same time of day every day of the week.

Heed the call.,
Schedule time each day for a bowel movement.,
Stay active.,
Do yoga.,
Squat on the toilet.,
Do daily acupressure.",How to Relieve Constipation2," If your body is telling you that it's time to have a movement, don't put it off. Even if it's only a mild suggestion, you should spend some time in the bathroom, even if you're in the middle of a busy day. If you ignore your body when it's telling you to have a movement, this can cause constipation later in the day. You may be ready to have a movement later, but your body won't be.

, Scheduling a time to have a bowel movement promotes regularity and can trigger your body to have a bowel movement. Make time for a bowel movement, whether it's in the morning, after your afternoon meal, or several times a day that are convenient for you. If you don't have a regular schedule, your body can be confused and unready to have a movement.

, When you're going through a bout of constipation, try some light exercise instead of sitting down. Just taking a 20 to 30 minute walk can help stimulate your digestive tract. Any form of exercise can help your body promote healthy bowel movements.


Though you may not have time to go on a bike ride during a bout of constipation, plugging exercise into your weekly routine can help ease your constipation over time.

, Yoga has been known to relieve stress and improve overall digestive health. There are also a few yoga poses that can stimulate the bowels, and holding these poses alone may be effective in relieving your constipation. Here are some poses to try:The shoulder stand. Lie on your back and raise your legs straight up in the air, so they're perpendicular to your torso. Then place your hands on your lower back, using your arms to support your legs as you straighten your spine.

The wind-relieving pose. Lie flat on your back. Bend one knee and extend it to your chest, holding it for ten seconds. Then switch and do this with the other knee. Alternate between knees at least five to ten times.
Kapalbhati Pranayam. Try Kapalbhati Pranayam yoga. Many people say it is very effective in relieving constipation. It should be done on an empty stomach or 5 hours after a full meal.







, When you sit on the toilet, don't put your feet on the ground. Instead, lift them up so you're squatting into the toilet a bit more, or place them on a footstool. This position is ideal for moving your bowels. If you want to try squatting, get a child's step stool or stack of phone books and prop up your feet while you're sitting on the toilet. If you don't feel comfortable squatting, pull your legs in as close as you can get to the toilet bowl and raise your heels so you are doing ""tippie-toes"" with your feet. Then lean as far forward as you can without losing your balance, this will get your body into a ""squatting position"" without actually squatting. This will let stools out easier., Massaging or pressing a few key pressure points in your body with a free hand or just two fingers can help stimulate your colon and relieve your constipation. Try applying pressure to the perineum to stimulate bowel movements."
"
Know when to talk to your doctor.,
Use a rectal glycerin suppository.,
Take a saline (osmotic) laxative.,
Take a stimulant laxative.,
Be wary of painkillers.",How to Relieve Constipation3," Though constipation is a common problem that can affect 15-20% of Americans, if your constipation lingers for two weeks or more, you should see a doctor because it could be a sign of more serious digestive conditions. Here are some other reasons to see your doctor:You have severe constipation and have never been constipated before
You have blood in your stools
You're bleeding frequently from straining
You've lost weight without trying

, This suppository works by irritating the colon, which draws water into the intestines. This usually results in a bowel movement within 15 minutes to an hour. This method is not meant to be used often, but is a measure to be taken in more extreme cases. Follow the directions on the label and don't use it more often than recommended., You should not take these types of laxatives if you're on a sodium-restricted diet or if you have high blood pressure or kidney problems. Some saline laxatives include Fleet Phospho-Soda, Milk of Magnesia, lactose, and Miralax. These laxatives don't irritate the colons or cause tolerance like stimulant laxatives can.

, Some stimulant laxatives, such as Ex-Lax, can also help relieve constipation. However, these should only be used in a pinch, and for no longer than two weeks without consulting your doctor. Regular use of laxatives can actually cause tolerance, weaken your bones, and may even cause constipation., Painkillers, especially narcotic ones such as hydrocodone (Vicodin, Lorcet, Norco) and oxycodone (Percocet and Oxycontin), can cause constipation. Though you shouldn't stop taking painkillers just to relieve your constipation if you really need them, talk to a doctor about alternatives."
"
Avoid foods that irritate your digestive system.There are certain foods that are known to cause gas, and some people are more sensitive to them than others.,
Consider other indigestibles that might be causing gas.,
Chew your food well.,
Eat protein first.,
Eat fermented food.,
Take digestive enzymes.",How to Relieve Gas2," If you experience gas problems regularly, consider avoiding or limiting these foods:


Legumes. Beans are difficult to digest because they contain a sugar called oligosaccharide that the body cannot break down because it doesn't produce the right enzyme to do so. The oligosaccharide molecules remain whole through most of the digestion process and produce gas in the small intestine.
Foods high in fiber. Fiber has many health benefits, but eating a large amount of grains and fibrous fruits and vegetables can lead to gas. Don't stop eating these beneficial foods altogether, but you might want to avoid the ones that seem to give you the worst gas.
Dairy products containing lactose. Many people are slightly lactose intolerant; that glass of milk you have in the morning might be contributing to gas.
Soda and other carbonated beverages.
Fried foods and other fatty foods.
Artificial additives. Sweeteners like sorbitol and mannitol lead to gas and diarrhea.

, Taking fiber supplements, laxatives, or antibiotics can cause gas. These irritate the bowels and remove the bacteria needed for properly digesting food.

, Taking the time to chew each piece helps to break down the food before it enters your stomach and intestines, creating less work for your digestive system. Chewing with your mouth closed can also help, since swallowing a lot of air can lead to gas.

, Changing the order in which you eat food can prevent the production of gas. Eating protein with or before fiber and carbohydrates allows your digestive system to work properly.When you begin eating a meal, your stomach produces hydrochloric acid in anticipation of digesting protein. If salad or bread hits your stomach first, the acid gets used up before you ingest meat, fish, or another protein. The protein then ferments and leads to gas and bloating.
Health food stores sell hydrochloric acid supplements that you can take to help you digest protein. These should be taken after the meal, so your stomach has the chance to produce as much acid as it can first.

, In order to properly digest your food, your digestive tract needs a good supply of healthy bacteria. Fermented foods supply your body with the type of bacteria it needs to break other foods down.


Try yogurt, kefir, and other cultured dairy foods. Make sure the label says that the product contains probiotics.
Kimchi, sauerkraut, and other fermented vegetables also have good probiotic properties.

, Health food stores carry enzyme tablets or pills that supply your body with enzymes it lacks to help you digest beans, fiber and fats. Taking these before or during your meals will prevent the production of gas.


Beano is the most common over-the-counter product engineered to prevent gas caused by beans.
Other supplements are geared toward preventing gas caused by carbohydrates and fats. Think about what foods in your diet seem to stimulate the production of gas, and buy the right type of supplement accordingly.
Activated charcoal is another over-the-counter gas treatment that can be taken both before and after meals.

"
"
Consider your symptoms.,
See your doctor.",How to Relieve Gas3," If you have gas every day, or if your gas pains are accompanied by nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headaches, or other severe symptoms, you might have a chronic issue beyond what can be treated by dietary changes or supplements.


Irritable bowel syndrome is a fairly common malady that causes chronic pain when certain foods are consumed.
Crohn's disease and celiac disease are gastrointestinal disorders that are irritated by the consumption of certain foods., If you feel it's a possibility that your symptoms go beyond the normal issues caused by eating beans and fiber, make an appointment with your doctor to get to the bottom of the problem. To prepare for your visit,


Keep a journal of your meals. Record every component of the meals you eat for the few weeks before your visit. Make a note of in what order you consume your food.
Be prepared to undergo some tests and answer questions from the doctor about your dietary and lifestyle habits."

Drink plenty of liquids and fluids.,
Drink a rehydration fluid.,
Gradually begin eating bland foods.,
Take a break from dairy products for a few days.,
Avoid foods that can trigger nausea or vomiting.,
Avoid consuming caffeine and alcohol.",How to Recover from Food Poisoning Fast1," If you're experiencing frequent vomiting and diarrhea, your body will quickly lose fluids which will result in dehydration. Drink as much liquid as you can to replace lost fluids. If you find it difficult to drink a lot, take several small sips frequently.If you cannot keep down liquids because you are too nauseous, contact a doctor immediately. You may need to be taken to the hospital for intravenous fluid provision.
Try drinking water, decaffeinated tea, or juice. Sipping broth or soup is also a good way to get nutrition and fluids.;
, These are powders that you mix into water and drink. They help to replace minerals and nutrients that your body is losing through vomiting and diarrhea. You can usually buy them from pharmacies.


To make your own rehydration fluid, mix 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon baking soda, and 4 tablespoons of sugar into 4 1/4 cups (or 1 litre) of water. Stir until the ingredients are dissolved before drinking., Once you're feeling a bit hungry and nausea has subsided, start nibbling BRAT foods: bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast.. These foods can calm your stomach and shouldn't trigger nausea or vomiting.


Saltines, mashed potatoes, and soft cooked vegetables are also gentle on an upset stomach.Remember, don't force yourself to eat or rush into eating too much.

, As your body fights against the food poisoning, your digestive system will experience a temporary state of lactose intolerance. Because of this, any dairy products that you consume--e.g., butter, milk, cheese, yogurt, etc.--will result in further complications. Avoid consuming dairy until you are sure that your body has returned to normal., Chances are these won't sound appealing if you already have food poisoning, but take care to avoid spicy or fatty foods which can be difficult for you to digest.You should also cut out high-fiber foods that can also be tough on your stomach. High-fiber foods include: citrus, legumes, whole grains, nuts, and produce with the peel., Caffeine and alcohol will both alter your body chemistry in ways that may make you more uncomfortable. They're also diuretics, which means that they will cause you to urinate more often. Frequent urination leads to dehydration, which can cause serious problems when combined with frequent vomiting and diarrhea.

Avoid holding gas inside.,
Use a hot pad or compress.,
Drink mint or chamomile tea.,
Have some garlic.,
Take over-the-counter gas relief medicine.",How to Reduce Bloating and Gas1," Many people force their bodies to hold gas in to avoid embarrassment, but passing gas is a necessary bodily function that occurs to help the release of a by-product of digestion. Preventing yourself from passing gas just leads to more pain and discomfort. Instead of holding it in, find a comfortable place to release it.


If you are in public when a bout of gas or bloating strikes, find a bathroom where you can stay until the pain has subsided.
If you find it difficult to pass gas, try adjusting your body positioning to allow the gas to be released. Lie down and relax your muscles until the pressure in your stomach and intestines is gone.
Moving around can help, too. Take a brisk walk around the block or walk up and down a set of stairs to help the gas make its way out. ;
, For quick relief of abdominal pressure caused by gas and bloating, lie down and lay a hot water bottle or warm compress across your stomach. Allow its heat and weight to help the gas leave your body and the pressure subside.

, Both mint and chamomile have properties that aid in digestion and help relieve stomach pains.Buy mint or chamomile teabags, or use fresh mint leaves or dried chamomile flowers. Steep the ingredients in hot water and enjoy for immediate bloating and gas relief.

, Garlic also has properties that stimulate the gastric system and help relieve gas and bloating. Garlic supplements are available at health food stores, but fresh garlic may provide faster relief.


Eat garlic soup, since the warm water helps deliver the garlic to your system quickly. Mince a few cloves of garlic and sauté them in olive oil on the stove. Add vegetable or chicken broth, let it simmer for a few minutes, and enjoy hot.
Avoid eating garlic with other foods that may cause more gas and bloating. For best results, consume it plain or in a soup.

, If you are already feeling gas and bloating pressure, medicines meant to prevent gas and bloating will not work. Choose a medicine meant to break up gas bubbles and reduce the pressure in your intestines and stomach.


Over-the-counter medicines that contain simethicone are meant to ease gas buildup.Activated charcoal is also said to help relieve gas. Activated charcoal is sold at health food stores and drugstores."

Don't drink milk.",How to Recognize the Symptoms of Stomach Ulcers," The pain can vary in severity and duration, lasting anywhere from a couple of minutes to several hours. It often occurs between meals as your stomach empties, and could be described as a burning, stabbing or aching pain.


Often pain caused by ulcers can be temporarily relieved by eating foods that buffer the acid in the stomach, or by taking an over-the-counter antacid medication.
If your stomach pain is caused by ulcers, flareups may occur at night and whenever you are hungry.;
, All of these symptoms don't occur for all people, but you may experience a combination of any of them.


An increase in the amount of gas and burping.
A feeling of fullness and an inability to drink a lot of liquids.
Being hungry a couple of hours after eating a meal.
Mild nausea, most common on first waking in the morning.
An overall feeling of being tired and not feeling well.
Loss of appetite.
Weight loss.

, If left untreated, ulcers can cause internal bleeding and other problems, leading to a medical emergency.


Vomiting, especially if blood is present, can be an indication of advanced ulcers.
Dark, tarry or pasty stool may also be a sign of severe ulcers.
Bloody stools.

, Ulcers are a serious condition that require medical treatment. Over-the-counter products may provide temporary relief, but they do not treat the condition.

, While stomach ulcers can present for any number of reasons, to most any individual, people most at risk to develop them include:


People infected by the H. pylori bacterium.
People who regularly take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, aspirin, or naproxen.
People with a family history of ulcers.
People who regularly drink alcohol.
People who have illnesses or diseases associated with the liver, kidney, or lung.
People older than 50 years of age.

, While most stomach ulcers will heal on their own, some severe stomach ulcers will needed to be diagnosed and treated with an endoscope. An endoscope is a small, lighted tube that is fitted down your esophagus. Only your doctor can perform this. In the meantime, try some of these quick fixes before you see your practitioner.

, An acid-blocking medication is sometimes recommended by doctors to see if symptoms improve. That is because stomach ulcers can be caused by an imbalance between the digestive fluids in the stomach and duodenum.

, Stop smoking, drinking, and taking NSAIDs. Smoking and drinking can both cause imbalances in digestive fluids, while NSAIDs can disrupt the balance if taken in high dosages. Discontinue all three while you are waiting for a diagnosis from your doctor.

, Drinking milk may provide temporary relief, but it's like taking one step forward and two steps back. Milk will coat the lining of your stomach wall for a short while. But milk will also stimulate the production of more stomach acid, which ultimately aggravate the ulcers even more.

A therapeutic wedge pillow or bed risers (regardless of material) is advisable. These aids ensure that the ideal height remains consistent every day. Here are your three main options:


The easiest way is to put a block of cement, bricks or books under the feet of your bed near the side of your head.
If that's not an option, you can invest in plastic or wooden bed risers that support bed posts or legs. There are also ""bed wedges"" that you can put between your mattress and box spring, or on your mattress under the sheets.
Alternatively, you can use a therapeutic wedge pillow to simulate an elevated bed. It's just what it sounds like -- a firmer, wedge-shaped pillow. These, however, may lead to neck pain.;
, The extent of bed head elevation should be measured meticulously. Most studies suggest that the ideal height of bed head elevation is at least 6-8 inches (15-20 centimeters). This height is medically proven to prevent acid reflux when lying down.In actuality, the more elevation, the better. However, you still have to be able to comfortably sleep. Most people find that 6-8 inches is that magic ideal.Using a wedge pillow secures your position as you sleep and prevents sliding down. Apart from possible neck pain, it's as effective as actually elevating your bed. People have a tendency to slide down from regular pillows; the wedge pillow keeps you elevated all night.

, The intersection between the stomach and esophagus is located approximately at the lower part of the shoulder blades. Therefore, the shoulder blades must also be elevated to prevent acid reflux.


If you don't also elevate your torso, you'll likely find that you not only still experience acid reflux, but that it's harder to get comfortable due to neck and back pain.

, Multiple pillows can place the head at an angle which compresses the stomach. This will aggravate acid reflux and just make it worse.


Try not to use regular pillows while sleeping because it can put extra pressure on the abdomen, pushing stomach contents up. You'll also likely slide down, defeating the purpose.

, Acid reflux is more common when lying down because the gravity does not oppose the reflux as it does in an upright position. The reduced effect of gravity also allows the acidic content to stay in your food tube longer and reach the mouth easily.


Bead head elevation drastically reduces contact of the lining of the food tube with acidic contents. It also reduces sleep disturbances of patients.

, Otherwise all your efforts may be in vain! Go to bed with an empty or dry stomach. Do not eat 3 hours before going to bed and do not drink 2 hours before going to bed. If you do, an episode of acid reflux will be even more likely.


Avoid lying down after eating, too. Wait for at least 3 hours before lying down after eating to make sure that food is digested already. It gives your body time to empty the stomach, too.

, Fatty foods, such as fried foods and fast food meals stay longer in the stomach and are generally heavy and difficult to digest. The longer stay and more content in the intersection between the stomach and food tube promotes acid reflux.


Chocolates are high in fat and caffeine, which is also bad for acid reflux. It is also high in cocoa which prompts more acid production in the stomach and acid reflux.
Fried foods, tomato sauce, alcohol, garlic, and onion are all known acid-reflux triggers.

, Chewing gum increases the production of saliva, nature’s gift for acid reflux patients. If you know you're about to consume something you shouldn't, bring a pack of gum with you to potentially offset the complications.


Be careful not to choose the mint flavour though. Mint promotes acid reflux by momentarily relaxing the muscle valves and increasing acid production in the stomach.

, When your clothes are tight, pressure is put upon your stomach. This added constriction of the abdominal area encourages stomach acid to work its way into your esophagus, leading to acid reflux.


If you're engaging in a heavy meal or eating foods that are known to trigger your acid reflux, be sure to stay away from tight clothes (including underwear) that may exacerbate the problem.

, Coffee keeps a person perky by injecting caffeine into the system. This caffeine also stimulates the acid production inside the stomach. Hyperacidity makes it easier for back flow of stomach contents. Anything that aids in acid production should obviously be avoided (like orange juice).


Orange juice and other citrus drinks are high in vitamin C or ascorbic acid. Ascorbic acid raises the acidity level in the stomach further and promotes acid reflux.
Caffeinated teas and sodas should also be avoided to lower acid production in the stomach.

, Physical activity will improve the symptoms of acid reflux by decreasing the compression of the stomach. The key is to get 30 minutes of physical activity a day. This 30-minue goal can be divided into multiple sessions. For example, 10-minute walking sessions can be done thrice a day.


Walking for 30 minutes every day will help accelerate fat loss. For people who find walking boring, other alternatives are gardening, swimming, walking the dog, and window shopping.

, Overweight and obese individuals complain of acid reflux because the extra fat in the tummy compresses the stomach. This increases the pressure inside the stomach and forces its contents to flow back into the food tube. To reduce your acid reflux, you may want to reduce your weight.Avoid overeating to not only watch your weight but to lessen the chance of acid reflux. Eat smaller meals more often to maintain a desirable weight and avoid overloading your stomach.

, Smoking is a known trigger of acid reflux. Over time, it can cause severe injury and cause esophageal cancer. Quit smoking now and feel immediate relief.There are a number of reasons you should quit smoking, apart from reducing acid reflux. If you do, you'll also reduce your risk of heart disease, diabetes, other cancers, and you'll see an improvement in your hair, skin, nails, and teeth.

, Antacids, such as aluminum hydroxide magnesium hydroxide (a liquid), neutralize the acidic content in the food tube and stomach. A cool, soothing relief is noticeable as the liquid form passes through your esophagus.


The daily dose is usually 2 to 4 teaspoons (10 to 20 ml) taken 4 times a day. It is best taken 20 minutes to one hour after a meal.Antacids may bring about side effects -- namely constipation or diarrhea.

, PPIs are one of the best ways to treat acid reflux. It works by turning off the pump that produces hydrogen, an important component of acid in the stomach. Less hydrogen production means less irritation to your esophagus. For maximum effect, PPIs are taken at least 30 minutes before breakfast.


The daily dose for different types of PPIs are:
Omeprazole 20 mg once a day
Lansoprazole 30 mg once a day
Pantoprazole 40 mg once a day
Esomeprazole 40 mg once a day
Rabeprazole 20 mg once a day
PPIs may present side effects of headache, stomachache, and an urge to vomit.

, H2 receptor’s sole purpose in the stomach is to produce acid. H2 receptor blockers antagonize this production of acid. These are an alternative to PPIs that your doctor may recommend.


The daily dose for different types of H2 receptor blockers are:
Cimetidine 300 mg 4 times a day
Ranitidine 150 mg twice daily
Famotidine 20 mg twice daily
Nizatidine 150 mg twice daily
H2 receptor blockers may give side effects of headache, constipation, and diarrhea.

, Medical therapy is a useful addition to home remedies in relieving acid reflux. The medicines act by either neutralizing acid or stopping acid production. Apart from antacids (available in any pharmacy or grocery store), your doctor will know which prescription option is best for you.


Acid is an important component of stomach immunity and digestive processes. Extended period of medical therapy may compromise the digestive system. The use of medicines for more than 4 weeks should be under the discretion of your doctor.

, Acid reflux or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a prevailing complaint in the general population. Recent studies in the United States conclude that 7% of the population complains of acid reflux daily. Moreover, 15% of individuals experience this symptom at least once a week.


That's not to say that there's no hope. With adequate treatment, this number could be a lot less. Plenty of people just don't bother to take action. In fact, acid reflux rates were 50% higher ten years ago., The esophagus is a food tube that connects the mouth and the stomach. Food is mixed with acid in the stomach to prepare it for proper absorption by the body. This where the ""acid"" in ""acid reflux"" comes in.


Normally, the stomach contents go down to the intestines once the contents are ready for digestion. The two valves, composed of muscle, at the top and bottom of the food tube prevent the back flow of acidic contents from the stomach into the food tube and mouth.Acid reflux is caused by the weakening of the muscular valves at the intersection between the food tube and the stomach.The acid from stomach juices and mixed food irritates the food tube. Worsening of the reflux allows the acidic content to reach the mouth.

, A number of things going on in your life can put you at risk for or be the cause of your acid reflux. The factors include the following:



Pregnancy. The ascending womb displaces the stomach and other abdominal contents upward and backward. Consequently, this sets up acid reflux.

Smoking. Smoking increases the acidity of stomach contents. Moreover, it weakens the muscle valves that prevent acidic contents from reaching the food tube.

Obesity. The extra fat in the abdomen compresses the stomach and raises its pressure inside. The acidic contents will force its way back into the food tube once the internal stomach pressure becomes too high.

Tight-fitting clothes . Constriction in the abdominal area increases the pressure within the stomach and causes reversal of flow of stomach contents.

Heavy meals. The stomach stretches in the upper part to take in the extra volume. Therefore, more acidic content is present in the intersection between the stomach and food tube.
Lying flat on the back. Lying flat on the back, especially after a meal, shifts the stomach contents nearer to the intersection between the stomach and food tube.


Diabetes. Untreated diabetes results in nerve damage including the vagus nerve, which is the one responsible for the stomach and the intestines., Some people aren't even aware that what they're experiencing is acid reflux. Here's what to look for:Heartburn. Heartburn is a warm, burning sensation in the middle portion of the chest. It is often felt in this area because the food tube lies underneath the heart.More saliva production. The body reacts to acid reflux by urging the salivary glands to increase its production. Saliva is a natural counter for acid.

Frequent throat clearing. Throat clearing reinforces the closure of muscular valves in the food tube. The food tube and mouth gets protection from back flow of acidic contents as a result.

Bitter taste in the mouth. Acid reflux, when serious, can reach the mouth. This will leave a very traumatic experience of a bitter taste in the mouth.Difficulty swallowing. When acid reflux becomes severe enough to injure the lining of the food tube, a patient will complain of difficulty with swallowing. The injuries make it painful for food to travel through the food tube.

Tooth decay. Severe acid reflux that reaches the mouth in a more consistent basis also damages the teeth.

Eat more foods rich in dietary fiber.,
Cut back on foods low in fiber.,
Discuss any dietary restrictions with your doctor.,
Drink plenty of fluids.,
Eat more yogurt.,
Add a fiber supplement.",How to Regulate Bowel Movements1," Dietary fiber is a portion of plant-based foods that your body can neither digest nor absorb. Fiber helps move material through your digestive tract and also adds bulk to your bowel movements, but of which can help regulate your bowels.Though your diet should include a solid mix of both, dietary fiber comes in two forms—soluble and insoluble.Soluble dietary fiber means that the fiber is water soluble, the mix of which creates a gel-like substance that can help promote the movement of material through your bowels. Since this fiber absorbs water, it also cuts down on runny stools by solidifying them. Foods rich in soluble fiber include oats, peas, beans (navy, pinto, black, kidney), apples, citrus fruits, carrots, barley, and psyllium.Insoluble fiber is not water soluble, so it helps add bulk to stool, which helps maintain regular movement of your bowels. Foods rich in insoluble fiber include whole wheat flour, wheat bran, nuts (pecans, almonds, Brazil nuts), beans, and vegetables (such as cauliflower, green beans, leafy greens, and potatoes).Your suggested amount of daily fiber depends on your sex and age. Men and women age 50 and under should aim for 38 and 25 grams per day, respectively. Men and women over age 50 should consume 30 and 21 grams per day, respectively.;
, Many common foods are very low in fiber. Relying on a diet too heavy in these foods can lead to irregularity, so you should always balance them with high-fiber options. Foods low in dietary fiber include:Cheese (and other dairy such as ice cream)
Meat
Processed foods such as fast food, hot dogs, or microwave dinners

, If you have any dietary restrictions due to a medical condition, then it is important to discuss these with your doctor. You may require a nutritional consult to ensure that you are following a balanced diet and to help keep you regular.

, You should aim to drink two to three liters of fluid each day.While most of your fluid should come from water, you can also include fruit and vegetable juices, as well as clear soup broths to meet your daily requirements.Some medical conditions (such as congestive heart failure) will require you to restrict your fluid intake.Consult your doctor regarding your acceptable level of fluid intake before making any changes if you have a condition where you fluids have been restricted.
Dehydration is also associated with a condition known as “retentive constipation,” especially in children.With this condition, initial constipation due to dry, hardened stool is worsened by stagnating in the colon/rectum where additional water is drawn out, hardening it even further. This can lead to a vicious cycle of irregularity.

, The lactic-acid producing bacteria (LAB) found in yogurt has been shown in studies to assist with regularity for some gastrointestinal conditions, including constipation and some diarrheal diseases.The most commonly studied strains of LAB are Lactobacillus and Streptococcus.Check the label on the brand of yogurt for the presence of these LAB strains.

, You can also purchase over-the-counter fiber supplements to help regulate your bowel movements. Some of the most common are products containing psyllium (such as Metamucil), which is a good source of soluble fiber."

Do not rely solely on vaccination.",How to Recognize and Prevent Typhoid Fever," The primary indication of typhoid infection is persistent, high fever in the range of 103° to 104° F (39° to 40° C).In general, symptoms develop within 1-3 weeks after exposure., Additional symptoms and indicators of typhoid fever include headache, general malaise or feeling of weakness, stomach pain, constipation or diarrhea, vomiting and loss of appetite.Some people also report developing a rash of flat, lightly pink-colored spots, as well as an abnormally slow heartbeat - usually less than 60 beats per minute.

, If you have a high fever and feel ill, get to a doctor immediately. Keep in mind that if left untreated, typhoid fever can become fatal and as many as 20% of those infected may die from complications related to the illness.If you are sick and may have typhoid fever, make sure to avoid contact with other people. Also, you should not prepare or serve food to other people.If you are traveling, you can usually get in touch with your consulate to get a list of recommended (and usually English-speaking) doctors.
You doctor will confirm the diagnosis through a clinical analysis of a stool sample or blood test in order to test for the presence of Salmonella Typhi.
In areas without a lab or where lab results would be delayed, the doctor may assess the size of your liver and spleen by pressing down and also tapping on your organs. Enlargement of the liver and spleen is often a ""positive"" sign for typhoid fever.It is important to confirm this diagnosis as the fever and additional symptoms that accompany typhoid fever overlap with other diseases common to developing regions like dengue fever, malaria, and cholera.

, When traveling to areas where infection with typhoid fever is a potential danger, one of the most important ways to protect yourself is to avoid certain foods and types of food preparation. Take the following precautions to ensure you are not ingesting foods that may be infected:Eat food that has been well cooked and is served steaming hot. Heat helps to kill bacteria.
Avoid raw vegetables and fruits and vegetables that don't have a peel. For example, vegetables like lettuce are easily contaminated because they're hard to wash well and have a lot of surface area and nooks and crannies where bacteria can hide.
If you do want to eat fresh produce, peel and clean fruits and vegetables yourself. Wash your hands first with hot, soapy water and make sure not to eat any of the peelings.

, Make sure to drink water from clean, untainted sources. Follow these guidelines:When you drink water, drink it from a sealed bottle or bring it to a boil for one minute before drinking it. In general, carbonated, bottled water is safer than uncarbonated water.
Even ice can be contaminated, so either do without it, or make sure the water used to make the ice was either from a bottle or boiled. Try to avoid anything made with water, like popsicles or flavored ices, which may have been made with contaminated water.

, It is difficult for food to be kept clean on the street and in fact many travelers report getting sick specifically because they ate or drank something purchased from a street vendor., You should wash your hands often. If both soap and water are not available, you can use hand sanitizer that has at least 60% alcohol to clean your hands. Don't touch your face unless your hands are clean. You should also avoid close contact (i.e. sharing eating utensils or cups, kissing, or hugging) with people who are sick., As designed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, learn the phrase: ""Boil it, cook it, peel it, or forget it."" If ever you have doubts about whether to eat something, think of this mantra. Remember it's always better to be safe than sorry!, If you are traveling to or through any part of the developing world where exposure to the disease is possible, particularly in Asia, Latin America, and Africa, then you should plan to get the typhoid vaccine before you leave on your trip. Visit your doctor or a travel clinic nearby to get the vaccine and discuss whether it is right for you. Keep in mind that if you've been vaccinated in the past, you should still consult with your physician to make sure that you don't need a booster shot. Typically, typhoid vaccines become less effective after several years.Two forms of the vaccine are available in the United States, one in capsule form which requires you to take 4 capsules (one every other day for a total of eight days) with a two-day break in between each capsule, and a one-time injection.Both vaccines are equally effective at preventing typhoid fever. However, the capsule provides protection for five years and the injection only for two years.Keep in mind as well that the treatment regime for the capsular requires completion one week before potential exposure, while the injection requires two weeks., For the injection, you should not vaccinate children younger than two years old, anyone will is ill at the time the vaccination is schedule, and anyone who is allergic to any component in the vaccine (consult your physician to confirm you whether you may be allergic).


For the oral capsule, there is a longer list of restrictions, including children younger than six years old, anyone with a weakened immune system or recent or current illness, HIV/AIDS patients, anyone with cancer or receiving radiation treatment, anyone who has taken antibiotics within three days prior, anyone on steroids, and any one with an allergy to any part part of the vaccine (consult your physician to confirm whether you may be allergic).

, Vaccination is only 50 to 80 percent effective at preventing typhoid fever, so make certain to take as many preventative measures as possible, namely by watching what you eat and drink.


Taking caution with what you eat and drink will also help to protect you from other illnesses transmitted through risky food and drinks, including hepatitis A, traveler's diarrhea, cholera, and dysentery."

, They can help restore the good bacteria in the intestines and speed up the recovery process. If you have a weak immune system, however, taking probiotics may not be the best treatment for you; consult your doctor before taking any., Another popular home remedy, apple cider vinegar may contain antimicrobial properties.To use it, mix two tablespoons in a cup of hot water and drink before eating any solid food. You can also drink the apple cider vinegar straight, if you prefer.

, Some herbs may have antimicrobial properties and several can alleviate the symptoms of food poisoning.Try drinking basil juice or adding a few drops of basil oil in water. Cumin seeds can also be eaten straight or brewed into a hot beverage.


Thyme, rosemary, coriander, sage, spearmint, and fennel are also herbs that may have antimicrobial properties, though more research is needed., Honey contains antimicrobial properties and can control stomach acid, while ginger can reduce stomach pain and indigestion.


Brew fresh ginger in hot water, then stir in honey and sip slowly. You can also drink ginger juice with honey mixed in.

Give your stomach a break.,
Take ibuprofen or paracetamol.Take the recommended dosage of ibuprofen or paracetamol if you're experiencing a slight fever or headache.It can also alleviate general aches and pains.,
Wash your hands frequently.",How to Recover from Food Poisoning Fast3," Don't go to work if you're experiencing food poisoning, especially if you work in food service. Give yourself plenty of time to recover before you return to work (usually 48 hours after your symptoms disappear).If you work in food service and begin experiencing food poisoning while at work, immediately notify your supervisor and leave the food prep area. Never handle food when dealing with food poisoning.

, It is likely that you will feel fatigued as your body fights to rid the toxins from your system. It is recommended that you rest as much as you can so that your body can use its energy to recover. Take frequent naps, which will also keep you from overexerting yourself.


Avoid strenuous activity. Participating in strenuous activities while fatigued can result in injury.

, Don't eat large meals or lots of solid food.Chances are these won't sound good anyway, but your body needs a chance to recover from whatever toxin or bacteria has made you sick. Avoid eating very much for the first day or two that you have food poisoning symptoms.


Instead, consume lots of liquids, broths, or soups. Wait several hours after experiencing nausea or vomiting before consuming more food.

,


Avoid taking anti-diarrhea medicine. While diarrhea from food poisoning can be inconvenient, it is a mechanism used by the body to quickly expel the toxins within. Therefore, it is recommended that you do not take any anti-diarrhea medicine.

, If you're experiencing vomiting or diarrhea, it's important that you wash your hands to prevent the spread of germs. Don't share towels or handle other people's food.It's a good idea to keep disposable cleaning wipes in the bathroom. Once you've used the bathroom, wipe clean any surfaces you touched.

Avoid foods that cause your body to produce excessive gas.,
Change the order in which you eat food.,
Chew your food well.,
Eat fermented food.,
Use digestive enzymes.",How to Reduce Bloating and Gas2," Gas forms when carbohydrates that are not digested in your small intestine are fermented by bacteria in your colon.Foods that cause this to happen affect some people more than others do. If you experience gas and bloating often, you might want to limit or avoid consuming these foods:


Beans and other legumes. Black beans, kidney beans, lima beans, peas, and other legumes are notorious for causing gas to form. They contain a sugar called oligosaccharide the body cannot break down; the undigested sugar stays intact through the digestion process and results in gas production in the small intestine.
Fibrous fruits and vegetables. Fiber has many health benefits, but it cannot be digested and it is one of the main culprits that cause gas and bloating. Try to figure out which fibrous fruits and vegetables give you the most trouble. Cabbage, broccoli, and other cruciferous vegetables tend to cause more gas production than salad greens.
Dairy products made from cow milk. Cow milk contains lactose, which disagrees with many people's digestion. Avoid milk, cheese, ice cream, and other dairy products made with lactose milk. Goat's milk is said to be easier for people to digest, so try it as an alternative.
Artificial additives. Sorbitol, Mannitol, and other artificial sweeteners cause many people to become bloated.
Soda and other carbonated drinks. The air bubbles in carbonated drinks lead to bloating, since the air stays trapped in your stomach.

, The body naturally produces hydrochloric acid, which breaks down protein, when you first start eating a meal. If you start a meal by eating carbohydrates, the hydrochloric acid gets used up before the protein you eat later in the meal hits your system. The under-digested protein then ferments and leads to gas and bloating.


Instead of starting your meals with bread and salad, take a few bits of your meat, fish, or other protein first.
If digesting protein continues to become a problem, consider taking hydrochloric acid supplements, sold at health food stores. Take them after the meal while you are still digesting your food.

, Chewing your food is the first part of the digestion, when your teeth and saliva start breaking the food down. Making sure you chew every bit thoroughly before swallowing creates less work for your stomach and intestines, reducing the chances the food will ferment and cause gas.


Try to chew each bite 20 times before swallowing. Put your fork down between bites to give yourself time.
Slowing down how you eat also prevents you from swallowing as much air as you do when eating quickly, so bloating and burping won't occur as often.

, Proper digestion requires a supply of healthy bacteria. People have been supplementing their bodies with bacteria-containing food for centuries.


Yogurt containing probiotics is a common source of bacteria that aids in digestion. Kefir is another cultured dairy product that is easy for the body to digest.
Sauerkraut, kimchi, and other fermented vegetables are also good alternatives.

, Digestive enzyme supplements can help your body break down the indigestible components of beans, fiber, and fats that might be causing your gas or bloating. Try to identify what food is causing the problem and choose the correct supplement.


If you have trouble digesting beans, try Beano, which contains the enzyme needed to digest oligosaccharides.
Digestive enzymes should be taken before the meal, rather than after, to so your body is ready to digest the food as it hits your system.

"
"
Be aware of the frequency and severity of your symptoms.,
Seek medical attention.",How to Reduce Bloating and Gas3," It is natural for gas and bloating to occur every once in a while, especially after eating one of the typical culprits, like beans or ice cream. If you have painful bloating or excess flatulence daily, though, the issue may extend beyond what you can fix by changing your dietary habits.


Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects your colon, and causes cramping and diarrhea when you consume certain foods.Celiac disease is a digestive disorder triggered by taking in of gluten, a protein found in bread and other food products containing wheat, barley or rye.Crohn's disease is a gastrointestinal disorder that can become severe if not treated effectively.

, If you have daily gas and bloating that causes pain or interferes with your daily life, call your doctor to discuss possible causes and solutions. Since gas and bloating are often directly related to what you eat, prepare to discuss your dietary and lifestyle habits with the doctor.

Check any medications you’re taking.,
Try over-the-counter laxatives or stool softeners.,
Ask about prescription options.,
Exercise regularly.,
Manage your stress.,
Consider taking probiotics.,
Improve the tone of your pelvic floor muscles.,
Consult your doctor about underlying conditions.",How to Regulate Bowel Movements2," Narcotic pain medications, some antidepressants, some anticonvulsants, aluminum-containing antacids, and some blood pressure medications are just a few examples of medications that commonly lead to constipation and irregularity.You should always consult your doctor before making any changes to a prescription regimen, but in some cases your doctor may be able to switch you to a drug without constipation as a side effect.


If you currently take narcotic pain relievers, then getting plenty of fluids and moving around frequently can help to promote peristalsis. Peristalsis is the wave like motions of your colon that helps to move waste through your body and promote bowel movements.
If you have recently has surgery and are taking narcotic pain relievers, then you may be encouraged by your surgical care team to take a stool softener along with the pain medication to reduce your chance of becoming constipated.

, Several varieties of laxatives and stool softeners are available over the counter. You doctor will likely recommend one of these options if a necessary medication has caused your irregularity. However, you can also use these options as directed even when a medication is not the cause. Just be sure to check with your doctor first if you have a chronic GI condition. OTC options include:Osmotic agents - These options (such as Milk of Magnesia and Miralax) help stool retain fluid usually absorbed by the digestive tract, easing the passage of bowel movements.
Stool softeners - These products (including Colace and Docusate) mix fluid with your stool to soften them and ease passage. Doctors especially recommend these options for those who strain during bowel movements or for women who suffer from constipation after childbirth.
Lubricants - Lubricants (such as Fleet and Zymenol) coat stool, helping it to retain fluid and move more easily down the lower digestive tract.
Stimulants - These options (which include Dulcolax and Correctol) contract the intestines, causing them to move stool more quickly through your intestinal tract. Though available over the counter, you should reserve stimulants as a last resort for severe cases, and you should avoid stimulants containing phenolphthalein., If OTC options have proven ineffective, you can also see your doctor and ask about prescription options. Chloride channel activators (such as Amitiza) increase the amount of fluid in your gastrointestinal tract to help with the passage of stool., Inactivity is one of the major lifestyle causes associated with irregularity. Studies have shown increased activity leads to a faster, more effective metabolism. Thirty minutes of aerobic exercise (that gets your heart rate up) three times a week is recommended. Jogging, swimming, biking, and power-walking are all good forms of exercise. However, even fifteen to twenty minutes of walking a day can help with bowel motility., Stress may also contribute to constipation, so it is important to do things to keep your stress under control.Try to set aside at least 15 minutes for yourself every day. During this time, use a relaxation technique to help reduce your stress. Some things you can try include:


Meditation
Yoga
Deep breathing
Progressive muscle relaxation

, Probiotics have not been proven to help with constipation, but there is some evidence that they may help to ease it. Probiotics may also be especially helpful for combatting digestive changes caused by antibiotics because probiotics can replenish the good gut bacteria that antibiotics kill along with bad bacteria.You can get probiotics just by eating yogurt once per day, or you can take a probiotic supplement. Talk to your doctor for recommendations and before starting any probiotic supplements.

, Especially for women who have been through multiple pregnancies, weakened pelvic floor muscles can lead to irregularity and even an overactive bladder. You can strengthen these muscles with different exercises either standing or laying down.


While standing, assume a squat position and pull in the muscles of your glutes.
While laying in your back, elevate your pelvis in the air with your knees flexed at 90° angles. Thrust your pelvis off the ground while clenching your buttocks.
For either exercise, do ten repetitions while holding each for five to ten seconds. Perform three sets daily.

, Irregularity is often a symptom of an underlying disease or condition. If basic lifestyle changes haven’t proven effective, then see your doctor to rule out other causes. These may include:Irritable bowel syndrome
Anorexia
Diabetes
Hypothyroidism
Multiple sclerosis
Parkinson’s disease
Spinal cord injury
Stroke
Colon or rectal cancer
Bowel obstructions

Get medical help if you’re jaundiced.,
See your doctor if you may have been exposed to Hepatitis A and feel like you have the flu.,
Evaluate your pains.,
Seek care if your urine and stool look different than usual.",How to Recognize Hepatitis A Symptoms1," Hep A has a discrete onset of flu-like symptoms such as fever, headache, malaise, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain and sometimes followed by jaundice, dark-colored urine and clay-colored stools. Jaundice is yellowing of the skin, mucous membranes, or sclera (whites of the eyes) that often appears two to three weeks after onset of flu-like symptoms and post resolution of an active illness. Jaundice is caused by excess bilirubin in the body. Bilirubin is a yellow-orange pigment in bile made by the liver when red blood cells are broken down. High bilirubin in the body indicates a problem with the liver.The easiest place to notice jaundice at home is yellowing of the whites of the eyes.;
, The incubation period for Hepatitis A is 15 to 50 days, with an average of 28 days, so you won’t feel sick until two weeks or longer after exposure to the virus.Some generic symptoms occur with a variety of illnesses, but if you experience these and are at-risk for Hepatitis A exposure, be suspicious of infection and see your doctor:


Rapid onset of fever.
Malaise or fatigue.
Low appetite.
Nausea or vomiting.

, Abdominal pain and joint pain can also occur as symptoms of Hepatitis A. See your provider if you experience these along with other symptoms or risk factors., Dark urine and clay-colored, pale stools are other symptoms of Hepatitis A that are less frequent in more common illnesses."
"
Understand which risk factors matter for you.,
Know where it’s risky to travel.,
Tell your doctor if you’re in a high-risk group.",How to Recognize Hepatitis A Symptoms2," The symptoms of Hepatitis A can be mild, lasting one to two weeks, to severe, lasting several months. Symptoms can also be non-existent (especially in the young children under six years of age), or they can more severe, especially in adults. There are risk factors that make some people much more likely to contract Hepatitis A than others. Know your risk factors and be better able to recognize Hepatitis A.

, Those who live in or travel to Africa, Asia, Central or South America, or Eastern Europe are most likely to come in contact with Hepatitis A, where there is intermediate to high prevalence of the virus. Therefore, if you plan to travel to the areas of the world where Hep A is endemic, get vaccinated. Two doses spaced six to 12 months apart are required. You can contract the illness even if you use good hygiene and stay in fancy hotels., Hepatitis A is contracted through person-to-person contact or by ingesting contaminated food or water.You are at higher risk and should inform your doctor if:


You live with or take care of someone with Hepatitis A, or adopted a child from a country with high incidence of the illness.
You are a man who has sexual contact with other men.
You use illegal drugs, injected or not.
You have a clotting-factor disorder such as hemophilia.
You have sexual contact with someone who has Hepatitis A.Your work puts you at risk for contact, such as a research lab or healthcare professional."
"
Ask your doctor if you should get the vaccine.,
Get tested immediately if you think you’ve been exposed.,
Let your doctor rule out more serious illnesses.,
Seek medical care immediately if you suspect a child is infected.",How to Recognize Hepatitis A Symptoms3," There is a Hepatitis A vaccine available for children over one year old, and a combined Hepatitis A and B vaccine available for adults over 18. There is no serious risk associated with getting the vaccine, and the most common side effect is tenderness at the injection site.Discuss risk factors with your provider to determine if you should be vaccinated to prevent Hepatitis A.

, If you may have encountered Hepatitis A and have not been vaccinated, your doctor can accurately diagnose you with a simple blood test for Hepatitis antibodies and immunoglobulins.


Your healthcare provider can give you a dose of Hepatitis A vaccine or immunoglobulin to limit the length and severity of the infection, but this only helps if it is within two weeks from exposure., Almost everyone recovers fully from Hepatitis A.In rare cases, however, untreated Hepatitis A can lead to permanent liver damage including fulminant hepatitis and acute liver failure. This is uncommon but more likely in adults over 50 years old and those with underlying liver disease.Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C can cause similar symptoms to Hepatitis A, and you cannot tell the difference just from how you feel. Hepatitis B and C can be more serious and chronic illnesses that require different treatment, so a correct diagnosis is important., Children under six years old are most likely to have an asymptomatic infection.If an unvaccinated child under six has been exposed to the virus, it is best they get tested.


The severity of symptoms worsens with increasing age. Adults over age 50 are at higher risk of severe symptoms and complications."
"
Follow all post-op care.,
Take all medications.,
Go to all follow-up appointments.,
Check the site of the surgery.,
Change the bandage.,
Be patient as you adjust to your stoma.,
Learn to care for your stoma.,
Check for signs of infection.,
Know how long the recovery process takes.",How to Recover from Crohn's Surgery1," After you have surgery for Crohn’s disease, your doctor will give you very specific instructions for care afterwards. These instructions should be followed exactly as outlined by your doctor for optimal recovery.Ask your doctor to clarify anything that is confusing or unclear. If you have questions, make sure to ask your doctor so you can follow the correct postoperative care.
You may need to have a relative, friend, or home healthcare nurse help you with post-op care.;
, You will more than likely be given various medications to take during your recovery. Your doctor may prescribe pain medication for the first days right after your surgery. You may also get antibiotics if you have an infection or there is a threat of infection at the surgery site. Anti-inflammatory medications may be prescribed to help reduce inflammation due to the Crohn’s disease.Follow all medication guidelines your doctor gives you. This includes how much and how often to take the medication, when to take the medication, and what foods and drinks you should or should not take with the medication. You should also find out how long you are supposed to take the medication.

, Due to the nature of surgeries for Crohn’s disease, there is a high possibility of complications stemming from the surgery or a recurrence of the disease. To make sure you are recovering properly, go to all scheduled follow-up appointments, even if you feel fine.You need to follow up with your gastroenterologist and the surgeon.

, Following the surgery, the doctor will monitor the incisions made during the surgery. When you go home, you will have to clean the surgery site properly and monitor it. You will watch it to make sure it doesn’t change to an abnormal color, like dark bruising or black skin.Keep the incision site as dry as possible.
You should also watch the wound site for any problems with the drainage. The wound may drain, but any abnormal amount of drainage or discoloration should be brought to your doctor’s attention.

, You will have to change the bandage on the incision site when you leave the hospital. To change the bandage properly, start by washing your hands. Remove the bandages by pulling them away by the edges. After throwing them away, wash your hands again. Open the new dressing by gently pulling open the top. Remove the bandages by grabbing only the edge of them; do not touch the inside or middle. Tape the edges of the bandages to your skin, then wash your hands.Don't rip open the package or touch the dressing. The dressing is sterile and should remain that way.
Your doctor or nurse will give you directions on how to clean the surgery site. Make sure to follow them. Never put any type of medicine or ointment on the incision unless instructed to by the doctor.

, Some Crohn's surgeries make it so that you have a stoma, which is an opening in your abdomen that allows waste to leave your body and be collected in a pouch.If you now have a stoma, it may take some getting used to. It often takes up to a year to get fully adjusted. During this time, you will work closely with your stoma nurse as you learn and adapt.At first, the waste from the stoma may be liquid and unpleasant smelling. This should change after a few weeks. There might also be some noises as gas passes through it, which should also lessen as time passes. You may feel like you have to go to the bathroom, but as your body adjusts to the stoma, that should change. You may experience some discharge from your anus at first.
You may have a one- or two-piece ostomy bag. Depending on where the stoma is located and the bag used, the bag may need to be emptied four to six times daily and changed twice a week, or they may be emptied about two to three times daily and changed each time they are emptied.Your doctor will give you specific instructions — make sure you follow them closely.
To help relieve pain, you may try to pass mucus produced by your rectum out of your anus. If the mucus doesn't get expelled, it can dry into hard balls inside your rectum. Sit on the toilet and gently contract your muscles like you are trying to go to the bathroom. This can help you pass the mucus. There may be exercises, medications, or other lifestyle changes to help your pain. Talk to your doctor about what is appropriate for you to do based on your condition., If you have had surgery where you now have a stoma and ostomy bag, you will have to learn how to care for it. You will have a stoma nurse at the hospital who will teach you the proper way of cleaning and changing your stoma and ostomy bag.Your stoma will be red in color, much like the tissue inside your mouth. It will be swollen right after your surgery, usually between six to eight weeks. There will be stitches around it which will naturally dissolve after a few weeks. It will also bleed a little after the surgery, which is normal. It is not normal if it bleeds heavily or fills your ostomy bag with blood.The hospital will provide you with your stoma and ostomy materials at first. By the time you leave the hospital, you will be able to change your ostomy bag normally. You will also be able to shower a few days after the operation.

, Your surgical site or stoma may get infected. Any abnormalities in the site, such as additional swelling, abnormal pain, or discoloration may mean that there is a problem.


Signs of infection at the surgical site include redness, swelling, abnormal pain, and increased warmth around the incision site. Drainage should be clear and slightly bloody and lessen each day. Any abnormal colored drainage, or more drainage than usual, may be a sign of infection. A fever of over 100.4°F (38°C) may also indicate infection.Abnormal signs that may point to infection or problems with the stoma include increased swelling, redness, or pain, or discolored or abnormal discharge from the stoma site., After you have surgery for your Crohn’s disease, you will probably have to stay in the hospital for a few days. Some surgeries require you to stay in the hospital for up to 10 days. When you go home, it may take one to two months to recover fully.Ask your doctor if you have to have surgeries in multiple stages. For example, a proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is generally done in two stages with two different surgeries.Multiple stage surgeries mean there will be a longer recovery time.

Eat a healthy diet.,
Consider choosing organic foods to limit your exposure to pesticides and other chemicals.,
Drink coffee.,
Exercise regularly.,
Quit smoking.,
Protect yourself from hepatitis.,
Moderate your alcohol consumption.,
Be careful when using acetaminophen (Tylenol).,
Use caution when taking prescription medications.,
Avoid exposure to other toxins.,
Learn to recognize the symptoms of liver disease.,
Learn to recognize the symptoms of acute liver failure.,
Request a Liver Function Test.",How to Protect Your Liver," One of the best ways to keep your liver healthy is to eat a balanced diet that is low in trans fats and fructose (as in ""high fructose corn syrup""). These substances are found in many processed foods, including chips, soda, fried foods, etc., and have both been shown to contribute negatively to liver function.


Processed foods also include a host of other chemicals to maintain freshness and appearance, which your liver has to work to filter out.
Your best bet for maintaining liver (and overall!) health is to minimize your consumption of prepackaged and processed foods, and prepare food from scratch using fresh ingredients whenever possible.;
, Organic food is produced using minimal pesticides in the case of produce, and minimal or no added hormones or antibiotics, in the case of animal products.This translates to less chemicals and additives that your liver has to filter out.


It is important to note that organic foods still may contain some residual pesticides, and the jury is still out on how much of a health benefit they provide. However, if you can afford to go organic, it certainly won't harm your liver, and you will be helping the environment, as well., A recent study published in Hepatology found that coffee drinkers, including those who drank decaf, were up to 25 percent less likely to have abnormal liver enzyme levels. Researchers do not yet know why this is the case, but drinking coffee may be helping your liver out., Regular exercise not only helps you maintain a healthy body weight, it does good things for your liver, as well. Studies have shown that just 150 minutes of activity per week (that’s just 1/2 an hour, five days per week) is enough to improve liver enzyme levels, and overall liver function. It can also reduce your chances of developing fatty liver disease., As if you didn't have enough reasons to quit already: numerous studies have shown that smoking drastically increases the risks of contracting both cirrhosis (scarring) of the liver, and liver cancer., Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver that is usually caused by a virus. There are three main types of hepatitis: A, B, and C, and all are contagious, however hepatitis C is usually only spread by sharing intravenous needles. Vaccines are available for hepatitis A and B.Practice good hygiene: remember to wash your hands after using the restroom or changing a baby's diaper.
Hepatitis B is commonly spread through unprotected sex, so always wear a condom.
Do not share drug needles with another person, or come in contact with another person's blood.
Get vaccinated for hepatitis A and B.

, When your liver processes alcohol, a number of toxic chemicals are released that can cause damage to your liver.Alcoholic liver disease is the result of the overconsumption of alcohol, and is responsible for up to 37% of all liver disease deaths. People who are especially at risk for developing alcoholic liver disease are those who are dependent on alcohol, females, people who are overweight, and people with a familial tendency to develop the condition. The routine consumption of alcohol can also lead to a condition called fatty liver disease. However, the good news is that the liver is able to regenerate itself better than any other organ in the body, and alcohol-induced liver problems can often be stopped, or even reversed! If you have been drinking a lot, take a break from alcohol altogether. Your liver needs 2 weeks alcohol-free to begin the healing process.
After this, try not to regularly exceed 3-4 units of alcohol per day (1.5 pints of beer) if you are a man, and 2-3 units per day (1 pint of beer) if you are a woman., Most people consider the over-the-counter pain reliever acetaminophen to be a safe, almost benign drug. However, acetaminophen overdose is a common cause of liver damage, and is responsible for the deaths of as many as 1000 people every year in the United States alone, most of which are accidental.Remember that acetaminophen is a drug, and use it only as directed!


Even a single overdose of acetaminophen can be enough to cause catastrophic liver failure.
Always consult with a pediatrician or pharmacist before administering acetaminophen to a child to make certain you have the correct dosage.
Avoid alcohol when taking acetaminophen, and check with a doctor before mixing acetaminophen with other medications.
Be extremely cautious when administering acetaminophen to children. Changes in labeling and dosage concentrations can be especially confusing. When in doubt, call your pediatrician or local pharmacist for precise dosing instructions.Be on the lookout for hidden acetaminophen. Many medications contain acetaminophen that do not bear the name ""Tylenol."" Multi-formula cold remedies, such as Nyquil, Alka Seltzer Plus, and even children's medicines like Triaminic Cough & Sore Throat all contain acetaminophen. Read labels carefully, and be sure not to double-up on medications containing the same active ingredient., All medications put some strain on the liver, as it must work overtime to metabolize the medication and filter out any excess toxins. However, some medications can put an undue strain on the liver, and cause damage, especially when mixed with other substances. Medications that have the potential to cause liver damage include statins (cholesterol medications), Amiodarone, and even certain antibiotics, like the commonly prescribed Augmentin.


Always take these and other medications as directed, and ask your doctor or pharmacist before mixing prescription medications with any over-the-counter medications, vitamins, supplements, or alcohol.Not all antibiotics carry the risk of liver damage, but it's still best to avoid alcohol while taking them so that your body can heal quickly. , Exposure to pesticides, heavy metals, and even environmental toxins found in polluted air and water can increase your risk of developing liver disease. Avoid any unnecessary exposure to these kinds of toxins, and use appropriate safety gear if you cannot.Use natural cleaning products in your home whenever possible to reduce your exposure to chemicals.
Consider using water and air filters in your home to reduce exposure to environmental toxins.

, Because the liver does its work quietly, many people fail to recognize that they are experiencing liver damage or disease until it has gotten quite severe. The following are some of the symptoms of liver disease, which often emerge gradually over time. If you experience some or all of these symptoms, especially jaundice, see a doctor and explain your concerns right away:Loss of appetite.
Nausea and vomiting.
Diarrhea.
Dark-colored urine and pale bowel movements.
Pain in the right upper quadrant of your stomach.
Jaundice: the yellowing of the skin and/or whites of the eyes.

, Acute liver failure can occur very rapidly in an otherwise healthy person, and is often not recognized until significant damage has taken place. If you or someone you know suddenly develops some or all the following symptoms, particularly jaundice (yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes), unusual tiredness, or unexplained disorientation or fatigue, seek medical care immediately.The symptoms of acute liver failure include:


Jaundice: the yellowing of the skin and/or whites of the eyes
Pain in the upper right abdomen.
Abdominal swelling.
Nausea.
Vomiting.
Malaise: a general feeling of un-wellness.
Disorientation or confusion.
Unusual sleepiness.

, Due to the gradual and quiet nature of liver symptoms, you might need to be proactive about checking your liver health. If you have reason to suspect that your liver has sustained damage due to alcohol abuse, medication overuse, possible exposure to viral hepatitis, a family history of liver disease, etc., schedule an appointment with your doctor and request a routine liver function test (LFT). It is a simple blood test that could save your life!"

Take it easy.,
Determine what activities are allowed.,
Slowly return to your normal activities.,
Find ways to occupy your time.,
Give yourself time before having sex.,
Allow yourself to experience all emotions.,
Join a support group.",How to Recover from Crohn's Surgery2," The recovery process can take awhile. This does not mean you are weak, sick, or having problems. Surgery for Crohn’s disease is a serious invasive surgery in which parts of your internal organs are removed, moved around, or rearranged together. This means your body will need time to heal.


Don’t try to do too much too soon. This can lead to complications or problems at the surgery area.
Be prepared for the fact that you will need to take it easy for a month or two after the surgery.

, Depending on which kind of surgery for Crohn’s disease you had, you may have certain activities restricted. The severity of the surgery and the number of invasive procedures used also determines what you can do after your surgery.Usually, the first few weeks after the surgery, you will not be allowed to do any type of strenuous activity. This includes heavy lifting and driving. After a few weeks, depending on your surgery and how well you are recovering, your doctor may allow you to start driving, walking, or doing other activities.
Most people cannot return to work for at least a month after the surgery. For some, they won’t be able to return for longer than that.

, When you first leave the hospital after your surgery, you will probably be tired and fatigued easily; however, the surgery should help reduce your Crohn’s symptoms, so you may start to feel better. Each day, with the approval of your doctor, you should start trying to do a little more than the day before.Your strength will slowly return to you as your body heals and you recover.
Go slow with trying to do things each day to make sure you don’t overdo it. Find the balance for yourself by paying attention to the way your body feels.
How long it takes to get back to normal activities depends on the type of surgery you had, your age, and your overall health.

, Recovering after surgery isn’t just about letting your body heal. You also need to take care of your mental state. Being out of work or school, unable to do what you did before, and having to take it easy may make you feel bad emotionally or lead to a more serious condition, like depression. Find ways to keep yourself busy so you don’t dwell on what you can’t do right now.


Try doing things you say you never have time for, like reading a book or catching up on movies and television shows.
Start a new hobby, like crochet or knitting, or do arts and crafts.
Play games with friends and family, or play video or computer games.
Spend time outside. Sit on your porch or deck. Put a chair in the yard and soak up some vitamin D in the sunshine. If you are able, take short walks.

, Most people can resume having sex following Crohn's surgery, though it may take a few months (or longer) before you are healthy enough to do so. For some men who have had operations on their rectums, impotence may be an issue. This often resolves on its own but, if not, medications and other aids may be considered. Speak with your doctor about these options.Pregnancy following surgery for Crohn's should not be an issue, though, depending on the surgery, you may need to have a Cesarean section.

, Because of the changes to your body due to your surgery, you may be feeling a lot of different emotions. You may be angry, sad, depressed, or scared. You may wonder how you are going to adjust to your new lifestyle, if you will be be “normal,” or even how you will look. It is okay to feel these emotions as your work through your recovery. Don’t try to repress them, but allow yourself to feel them so you can move past them.Talk to your IBD or stoma nurses if you are struggling to cope with things after the surgery.
If you find that your emotions are beginning to affect your everyday life, if you are unable to move past negative emotions, or feel depressed without being able to move on, you should look into seeing a therapist or psychologist. There are mental health professionals who help people dealing with medical issues.

, Recovering from Crohn’s surgery and learning how to adjust to your new life can be difficult. You may not feel like any of your friends or family understand what you are going through. You can join a support group to help you adjust to life after surgery.Support groups connect you with others who have Crohn’s disease and who have undergone similar surgeries. You can ask questions and get advice in a supportive, safe environment.
You can talk to your doctor or IBD nurse about finding a Crohn’s disease support group, or you can find online support communities, like Ostomates.

Eat regular meals.,
Try new foods slowly.,
Drink plenty of fluids.,
Reduce irritating food intake.",How to Recover from Crohn's Surgery3," As your recover, it is important to eat on a regular schedule. Do not be afraid to eat or skip meals because you think it will be better. Empty bowels lead to gas, which can cause problems after surgery. Consider eating smaller meals more often through the day.Chew your food thoroughly to help prevent large pieces of food from going through your system.

, You don’t have to give up all foods after your surgery; however, you should reintroduce foods slowly to see how your body responds to them. Some people have an easier time digesting some foods than others. Combine the food with foods you know you can digest as you experiment.For example, beans, cabbage, and dairy products may cause gas. Grains or bran, leafy greens, raw vegetables, and some spices may cause more frequent stools. Apple peels, corn, nuts, and citrus may cause a stoma obstruction. Try different foods and see how your body responds to them.

, You should drink plenty of fluids during and after recovery. You should have eight to 10 8-ounce glasses (2 to 2.4 liters) of fluids every day. Choose water, milk, and juice. Refrain from drinking with meals.You shouldn’t drink carbonated or caffeinated beverages. If you are going to drink them, limit how many you drink each day.

, There are certain foods that may cause more anal irritation or irritating side effects, like diarrhea. You should limit the amount of these kinds of foods in your diet, or test them out to see if they bother you.Simple sugars can make diarrhea symptoms worse.
Foods that can irritate include dried fruits, raw fruits, raw vegetables, nuts and seeds, and foods with spices.

Take notice of respiratory symptoms.,
Be aware of abdominal pain and nausea.,
Watch for bloody diarrhea.,
Look for chronic vomiting and weight loss.,
Take note of signs of malnutrition.,

Wait and see.,
Take anti-parasitic medication.,
Consider surgery as a last resort.",How to Recognize an Ascaris Infection," Although most people infected with Ascaris lumbricoides worms don't have noticeable symptoms, those with weaker immune systems often do. Sometimes the first signs of ascariasis are similar to mild-to-moderate cases of asthma or pneumonia, such as persistent cough, shortness of breath, wheezing and mild chest pain. You may cough up mucus (sputum) and see blood.These initial lung symptoms are related to the worm's life cycle.


After ingesting fertilized Ascaris eggs, they hatch in the small intestine and the larvae get absorbed into the blood and travel to the lungs, causing irritation and a type of allergic response.
After spending about a week in the lungs, the larvae eventually get coughed up the trachea and into the throat, where they are swallowed down the esophagus into the stomach and pass into the small intestine.;
, The Ascaris larvae leave the lungs and end up in the small intestine, where they mature into adult worms over the course of a few weeks and live there until they die (many months or a few years).The worms don't always cause symptoms in the intestine, but if enough of them are there, one of the first signs is vague abdominal pain and mild nausea.


The worms can block the intestine or bile duct and this causes abdominal pain.
The abdominal discomfort is difficult to pinpoint and can easily be mistaken for indigestion and bloating, but it's not relieved by passing gas or taking antacids.
In mild cases, the nausea comes and goes, but does not usually lead to vomiting.
Children who live in poor sanitary conditions and have weakened immune systems are much more likely to get infected and develop symptoms.

, If the body's immune system can't fight the worm infection, then more of them grow and increase the likelihood of uncomfortable symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain and diarrhea.As the diarrhea becomes chronic and the worms irritate the intestinal wall, blood can often be seen in the toilet.


If the blood is dark and looks like coffee grounds, then it signifies bleeding from the small intestine. If the blood is bright cherry red, it signifies bleeding from the rectum from too much wiping or a burst blood vessel from straining too hard.
In addition to blood in the stool, sometimes a visible Ascaris worm(s) can be seen in the toilet.

, In moderate-to-severe cases of Ascariasis, the worms can nearly completely block the small intestine, which leads to severe abdominal pain and nausea, and triggers bouts of vomiting.Once the vomiting becomes regular (daily) and chronic (for more than a few weeks), relatively rapid weight loss is seen.


Even if food is available, it's often not eaten due to loss of appetite and painful digestion.
Weight loss is most noticeable around the face, upper body and buttocks/thighs. The abdomen can still protrude due to the mass of worms and blockage of food and liquids.
Worms can often be seen in the vomit of people with severe Ascaris infections.

, As the symptoms of ascariasis progress, particularly in children, signs of malnutrition become more obvious and include: severe weight loss, stunted growth (short for age), weakness, fatigue, skin rashes, visual problems and intellectual/developmental disability. The most common nutritional deficiencies related to ascariasis are protein, vitamin A and vitamin C.A lack of protein causes muscle wasting and weakness, as well as a distended belly.
Lack of vitamin A leads to visual problems and potential blindness, as well as skin issues.Lack of vitamin C leads to skin issues, internal bleeding, hair and teeth loss, as well as fatigue and listlessness.

, Ascariasis can mimic a great number of other types of infections and diseases. When the Ascaris larvae cause symptoms in the lungs, it can be similar to asthma and upper respiratory viral infections, such as influenza, the common cold and pneumonia.When the growing adult worms affect the gastrointestinal system, then it can mimic other parasitic infections, food poisoning and viral gastroenteritis (stomach flu).


There's also some symptomatic overlap with gluten sensitivity, irritable bowel syndrome and Crohn's disease.
It's only when actual worms are found in vomit or diarrhea that Ascariasis is more obvious to doctors and patients, and easily distinguished from other infections or diseases.

, Ascaris worms thrive in soil that has human and animal feces (poop) in it. In many places in the world, fecal matter is intentionally used to fertilize crops, so be cautious when traveling in undeveloped countries, particularly rural farming areas. Children who live in these areas often become infected after putting their hands into their mouths after playing or working in contaminated soil.Eating uncooked food (fruits and veggies) grown in contaminated soil or irrigated with wastewater is another frequent cause of infection.
Always thoroughly wash produce at home before you eat, regardless of where you bought it from. Consider cooking all raw veggies before you eat them.
Soaking fresh produce in water with some iodine, hydrogen peroxide and/or white vinegar might help kill parasites, as well as some viruses and bacteria.

, In addition to washing your produce, washing yourself and practicing good hygiene is another method to help prevent Ascaris worm infection.Always wash your hands after going to the bathroom and before and after handling food. Ascaris worm larvae and eggs are spread in feces, either in soil, in water or from unwashed hands.


Wash your hands frequently with warm water and soap, especially if you're traveling and buying food in undeveloped countries in Asia and Africa.
When traveling, carry a small bottle of alcohol-based hand sanitizer with you and use it often to clean your hands.
If you're without soap and sanitizer, try using fresh citrus juice (from lemons, limes or grapefruits) on your hands to clean them.

, If you really want to reduce your risk of Ascariasis then the best advice is to avoid under-developed countries where the infection is most common, such as rural China, Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, India, Latin America, the Caribbean and parts of the Middle East.If you do need to travel to these areas for work or family reasons, take the sanitary precautions mentioned above. Wash your hands frequently, keep your hands away from your mouth, use only bottled water and avoid eating raw veggies.
In the U.S., ascariasis is most common in the Southeastern states, but not nearly as prevalent as it is in developing countries with warm temperatures year-round., Typically, only Ascaris infections that cause symptoms need to be treated, which is in the minority of cases.In many cases, the symptoms of ascariasis will flare up for a short period of time (a few weeks), then become unnoticeable for long stretches of time. In some cases, ascariasis completely resolves on its own due to a stronger immune system being able to defeat it.


In many parts of the world where ascariasis is endemic, the lack of nutritious food and clean water is more of a concern than parasitic infections.
Adults usually deal with ascariasis much better than kids. If a child is failing to thrive and losing weight, then it's time for a doctor's visit to see why.
A doctor will look at a stool sample for Ascaris eggs in order to make a diagnosis.

, Anti-parasitic (or anti-helminthic) drugs are considered the first line of treatment against ascariasis and most other parasitic worm infections.The most commonly prescribed medications to kill Ascaris worms are albendazole (Albenza), ivermectin (Stromectol) and mebendazole. Ascaris infections are typically treated for between one to three days with pills.


An effective single dose of albendazole is 400 mg; for mebendazole it's 500 mg.Albendazole and mebendazole are not recommended during pregnancy; pyrantel pamoate is the drug of choice for pregnant women.
These drugs effectively kill the adult worms and usually don't cause any side effects. People often carry larvae that aren't killed by drugs, so they need a follow-up treatment within six months.

, In cases of severe Ascaris infections and heavy intestinal infestation, surgery may be necessary to remove the mass of worms and repair the damage they've caused.The primary reasons for surgery include: intestinal blockage (obstruction) or perforation, bile duct blockage, pancreatitis, and/or an appendicitis flare up related to the infection.


Your doctor will likely take x-rays (abdomen and chest), ultrasound, CT scan and/or an MRI to determine the extent of your problem before recommending surgery.
Surgery is usually performed with an endoscope — a small tube with a cutting device and a camera on the end that's inserted either down the throat or up through the anus to reach the worms in the small intestine.

Use caution when buying foods that could transmit Salmonella.,
Monitor food recall notices.,
Refrigerate raw eggs and meat.,
Avoid raw food when you dine out.",How to Prevent Salmonella Poisoning (Salmonellosis)1," There are several types of food that can contain the Salmonella bacteria. Make sure you buy eggs and milk that have been handled properly and appear clean in their packaging. Do not buy meat that is not sealed or that appears old and moldy in the package.Make sure you always buy milk that has been pasteurized, as the pasteurization process helps to rid the milk of Salmonella. You should avoid buying eggs that are unpasteurized. Pasteurized eggs can be found at most grocery stores.
Do not buy cheeses or juices that are unpasteurized.;
, Some recall notices are spread through local news or on the shelves at grocery stores. You can also find information about food recalls through your local or national Food Inspection Agency, online or by contacting the agency directly. Do not buy or serve food that has been recalled, as it can contain Salmonella., Avoid letting raw eggs or meat, such as chicken, beef, or pork, sit out in room temperature. Put these items in your refrigerator as soon as you get home from the store and do not let them sit out on your kitchen counter or outside in your car.Salmonella is often found in raw food products that come from animals. Keeping these items refrigerated can prevent bacteria from reproducing. It can also make it safer for you to cook and consume these items if they have been kept at a cold temperature.

, Avoid ordering dishes that contain raw eggs, such as Caesar salad dressing, Hollandaise sauce, and tiramisu. If you do order dishes that contain eggs or meat, make sure the items are properly cooked. An egg that is undercooked or meat that is still a little raw can lead to Salmonella poisoning, so do not be shy about sending your meal back if you feel you are at risk of contracting Salmonella.If you do get food poisoning when you dine out and you believe it was due to Salmonella, you should report it to your local health department. Be sure to immediately write down what dishes you ate. A food diary helps the health department in their investigation.

Prepare your food properly for cooking.,
Cook meat and eggs to a safe temperature.,
Do not make food that contains raw eggs or meat.,
Keep pets out of the kitchen.,
Never prepare or cook food if you are ill. You should avoid going into the kitchen at all if you are ill, especially if you have diarrhea or you are vomiting.",How to Prevent Salmonella Poisoning (Salmonellosis)2," Get in the habit of always washing your hands with hot water and soap (scrubbing for at least 20 seconds) before you start cooking or preparing a meal. You should take special care to wash your hands well if you have used the bathroom before you start cooking, as you do not want bacteria from the bathroom to get into your food.If you have pets at home, such as birds, turtles, lizards, or fish, you should always wash your hands well after handling them. Make sure you wash your hands with soap and water after you have touched them so you do not get any of their bacteria in your food when you go to prepare a meal.
If you have a new baby at home, always wash your hands well after changing their diaper, especially if you plan to cook. This will prevent any feces or bacteria from getting into your food.

, Do not wash meat or eggs once you have taken them out of their packaging and are getting ready to cook them. Washing them can cause Salmonella bacteria to splash around in your kitchen and contaminate other surfaces or foods. Instead, try to cook them as soon as they come out of the package so the risk of Salmonella spreading is low.You should also thoroughly wash all fruits and vegetables under running water. Fruits and vegetables can contain Salmonella on their surface and should be cleaned as a precaution.

, When you are cooking food like meat and eggs at home, you should always make sure they are cooked to a safe temperature. Cooking these items properly will kill any Salmonella bacteria and ensure you do not get food poisoning from your food.Whole poultry should be cooked until it reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C).
Ground beef and pork should be cooked until they reach 165°F (74°C). Steaks and pork chops should be cooked until they reach 145°F (63°C).
Make sure your eggs are cooked until they reach 160°F (71°C) or until the yoke appears solid and the whites appear cooked.
Check that all fish and shellfish you prepare, such as shrimp or crab, has been cooked to 145°F (63°C). The flesh of fish or shrimp should appear pearly and opaque to ensure it is cooked.

, You should adopt a no raw egg or meat policy in your kitchen to reduce your risk of Salmonella poisoning. This means not preparing items like homemade ice cream, homemade eggnog, and homemade mayonnaise. You should also only eat your meat cooked and never raw in your meals.Never microwave raw food, such as raw meat or raw eggs, as the microwave is not hot enough to cook these items properly. Always cook your food on high heat on a stove top or a grill.
If you have a habit of licking the spoon of cookie dough before it goes in the oven, try to avoid doing this in the future. Cookie dough contains raw eggs, which can lead to Salmonella poisoning if consumed.

, If you have any reptiles, amphibians, or birds at home, you should try to keep them out of your kitchen. Place their water bowls in their enclosure or cage, never in the kitchen. You should also make sure you always wash your hands after touching your pets to avoid contaminating your food., You do not want bacteria or feces from your hands to get into your food. Try to have someone else prepare food for you if you are ill to limit the risk of spreading Salmonella and other bad bacteria to your food."
"
Use separate cooking utensils for cooked food and raw food.,
Keep raw and cooked food on separate plates.,
Wash your hands after you have touched raw food.",How to Prevent Salmonella Poisoning (Salmonellosis)3," Cross-contamination is when you contaminate cooked food or ready-to-eat foods with uncooked food. You should be careful to always use separate cutting boards, knives, and cooking utensils for raw food like meat and eggs. You should also make sure uncooked meat is in a separate area, far from produce and cooked food.If you must use the same cooking utensils for cooked food and raw food, make sure you wash all utensils thoroughly with warm water and soap before using them again. This will prevent Salmonella from getting into your food.

, You should make a conscious effort to keep raw food and cooked food on separate plates in your kitchen. If you use a plate for raw food, do not use it for cooked food until it has been washed thoroughly with warm water and soap.If possible, try to keep two sets of dishes out while you cook, one set for raw food and one set for cooked food. This will prevent cross-contamination from occurring.

, You should always wash your hands well once you have finished handling raw meat or raw eggs. Wash your hands after you drop a raw steak on the grill or a piece of raw chicken breast on a saucepan. Make sure you wash your hands after you crack an egg in a pan or when you are baking. This will prevent the spread of Salmonella and ensure your food does not become contaminated."

Be aware of who is most at risk.,
Recognize the symptoms of a hookworm infection.,
Prevent an infection by hookworm.",How to Recognize and Prevent a Hookworm Infection," Some people are more likely to come into contact with hookworm infection than others due to their work, play, or other habits. Those most at risk include:


People who come into direct contact with soil contaminated with human feces such as gardeners, builders, plumbers, etc.
Children who frequently play outside barefoot, or who play in contaminated soil.;
, There are varying stages of an infection, as follows:


A light infection may cause:

A rash and itching at the site where the skin was penetrated by the larvae.


A heavy infection may bring about:

Abdominal pains.

Anemia and weakness.
Decreased appetite.
Weight loss.

Diarrhea.
Difficulty breathing and tiredness.


Chronic infections can cause:

Abnormal growth development.
Impaired mental development.
Congestive heart failure.



, This is straightforward and achievable with these simple steps:


Do not walk barefoot; always wear shoes before walking outside.
Do not touch soil with your bare hands in areas where hookworm is prevalent.
Do not walk barefoot in, or touch soil in, areas where there may be fecal contamination.
If you don't know if there is contamination, err on the side of caution and wear shoes and don't touch without wearing a barrier such as gloves.

Determine which kind of kidney stone you have had.,
Determine your future risk.,
Consult your doctor.",How to Prevent Kidney Stones from Recurring1," Ask your doctor to identify your particular kind. It’s important to know which particular type you had so that you can work on specific ways to prevent it recurring. Make sure your doctor checks your parathyroid to rule it out as a possible mitigating factor in the formation of kidney stones.Calcium stones are caused by unused calcium being collected in the kidneys and not flushed out with the rest of the urine. It then combines with other waste material to form a stone. The most typical kind of calcium stone is calcium oxalate, and overall the most common. Calcium phosphate stones are not as common but they are more problematic because they tend to be both larger and harder, making them more difficult to treat.
Struvite stones can form after a urinary infection and are made of magnesium and ammonia.
Uric acid stones are caused by too much acid. Cutting back on meat will help stop the formation of these types of kidney stones. These are often associated with gout, and respond to similar treatments.
The formation of cystine stones is not common and tends to runs in families. Cystine is an amino acid and certain people inherit large amounts of it.;
, Because you have had a kidney stone, you are already at higher risk for reoccurrence. See if there are risk factors that you may not be aware of. Download the app at http://www.qxmd.com/calculate-online/nephrology/recurrence-of-kidney-stone-roks for a quick way to assess your risk. You can and should talk to you doctor more about your risk factors.

, Depending on the type of kidney stone you passed, your age, gender, and family medical history, your doctor should be able to help you develop a plan to reduce your risk of more kidney stones. Most will include dietary changes, lots of liquid intake, and in some cases, medication or even surgery (but only in very specific cases)."
"
Ask close relatives if they have had kidney stones.,
Watch your weight.,
Consider your age and gender.,
Think about other medical conditions you may have.,
Know the different kinds of kidney stones.There are four different kinds of kidney stones.",How to Prevent Kidney Stones1," You are at greater risk for developing stones if family members have experienced kidney stones.Studies show that kidney stones appear to be more common in people with Asian and Caucasian backgrounds than for Native Americans, Africans, or African Americans.;
, Research suggests that people with a high body mass index and larger waist sizes are at greater risk for the development of kidney stones.Body weight, not diet or fluid intake, appears to be the greatest risk factor for kidney stones. Eat a healthy diet and get plenty of exercise to reduce your weight and your risk.

, Men between 30 and 50 years old and postmenopausal women are the most likely to get kidney stones., Certain surgical procedures and medical conditions increase your risk of kidney stones.These include:Gastric bypass or other intestinal surgery
Urinary tract infections
Inflammatory bowel disease and Crohn's disease
Chronic diarrhea
Renal tubular acidosis
Hyperparathyroidism
Insulin resistance

, The first step in being able to prevent kidney stones is knowing what causes them. Different kidney stones are caused by different lifestyle factors and diet decisions.


Calcium stones. Calcium stones come in two forms: calcium oxalate stones and calcium phosphate stones. Calcium oxalate stones are the most common form of kidney stone. Calcium stones are often caused by high sodium intake.
Uric acid stones. Uric acid stones form when urine is very acidic, and are often because the patient has a diet high in animal protein (meat, fish, shellfish).
Struvite stones. These are usually caused by kidney infections. Staying free of infection can usually stop struvite stones.
Cystine stones. These are formed when cystine leaks into the kidneys, resulting in stones. Cystine stones are caused by a genetic disorder.

"
"
Drink more liquids.,
Avoid salt.,
Eat less meat.,
Consume more fiber.,
Be careful of your intake of oxalate if you have experienced calcium oxalate stones.",How to Prevent Kidney Stones from Recurring2," Liquids help flush out the substances that cause kidney stones to form. Water is your best choice. It helps prevent kidney stones by keeping the kidneys flushed out without adding any extra elements such as sugar, sodium or other ingredients found in other drinks. Drink at least ten 8 ounce glasses of water daily. Avoid caffeinated beverages, because they dry you out rather than hydrate you. You should aim to have two or more quarts of urine per day, and it should be a light, barely yellow color., One of the main causes of kidney stones is concentrated urine. Salt can dehydrate you, helping to create concentrated urine. If you do eat salt, you need to counteract its effects by drinking a big glass of water afterward., Animal proteins can cause concentrated urine, one of the risk factors for kidney stones. Waste from the proteins gets into the urine and can increase the possibility of forming kidney stones., Some research indicates that insoluble fiber combines with calcium in urine and is excreted in stools. This helps decrease the amount of calcium left in the urine. Good sources of fiber include:Whole grains like oatmeal, bran, or quinoa
Prunes and prune juice
Leafy greens like spinach, chard, or kale

, The best way to deal with your diet is to consume both calcium and oxalate at the same meal. This way the calcium and oxalate can bind together in your stomach, rather than waiting until your kidney begins to process it and possibly convert it into a kidney stone.Spinach, chocolate, beets, and rhubarb all are high in oxalate. Beans, green peppers, tea, and peanuts also contain oxalate.
Milk, cheese, calcium enriched orange juice, and yogurt are all good forms of calcium that you can combine with foods high in oxalate.

"
"
Take medication for calcium stones.,
Get a prescription from your doctor to alleviate uric acid stones.,
Take antibiotics for struvite stones.,
Shrink cystine stones through alkalizing urine.,
Control the formation of calcium stones with surgery.",How to Prevent Kidney Stones from Recurring3," The most typical prescriptions are a thiazide diuretic or a phosphate-containing preparation. Hydrochlorothiazide (a thiazide diuretic) decreases the amount of calcium released into the urine by helping retain it in your bones and helps reduce the chance of developing a calcium stone. This medication works best when you also curtail salt intake., Allopurinol (Zyloprim, Aloprim) keeps your urine alkaline and reduces the uric acid levels in both your blood and urine. Sometimes the allopurinol and some kind of alkalizing agent can be combined to completely dissolve the uric acid stone., Taking short courses of antibiotics can keep the bacteria from forming in your urine that causes the struvite stones. Your doctor will typically not want you to take antibiotics over a long period, but short courses can help significantly., This treatment typically involves a catheter and will inject an alkalizing agent into your kidney. The cystine stone typically will respond well to the treatment, particularly when coupled with drinking large quantities of water, both day and night.

, This is an option only if you have hyperparathyroidism, or kidney stones caused by the parathyroid gland. Calcium stones can be a risk if you have this disease. Removal of one of the two parathyroid glands in your neck usually cures the disease and eliminates the chance of kidney stones."
"
Drink plenty of water.,
Limit your intake of sodium.,
Minimize your intake of animal protein.,
Increase your citric acid consumption.,
Eat a “low-oxalate” diet.,
Use calcium supplements with caution.,
Eat a high-fiber diet.,
Watch your alcohol intake.",How to Prevent Kidney Stones2," You may have heard the “eight glasses a day” rule, but research suggests that you may actually need more than that. The Institute of Medicine recommends that men drink about 13 cups (three liters) of fluids per day. Women should drink about nine cups (2.2 liters) of fluids per day.If you’re sick or you exercise a lot, you’ll need to drink more.Water is the best choice. Drinking a half-cup of fresh-squeezed lemon juice daily raises the citrate levels in your urine, which can help reduce your risk of developing calcium kidney stones. Experts no longer recommend orange juice, as it raises oxalate levels.Be cautious with grapefruit juice, apple juice, and cranberry juice. Several studies have linked grapefruit juice to an increased risk of kidney stones, although not all studies agree.Apple and cranberry juice both contain oxalates, which are linked to the development of kidney stones. Cranberry juice may increase your risk for calcium oxalate and uric acid stones. However, it may help prevent the less-common types of stones, such as struvite and brushite stones, and it’s good for overall kidney function.Talk with your doctor about whether consuming these juices is a good idea for you.

, Consuming too much salt can cause kidney stones by increasing the calcium content of your urine. Read nutritional labels carefully and avoid processed foods, which tend to be high in sodium. Use the following sodium guidelines:Consume no more than 2,300 mg of sodium daily if you are a healthy young adult. According to the US Department of Agriculture, most Americans eat far more than that recommended allowance, 3,400 mg.Restrict your sodium to 1,500 mg per day if you are at least middle aged or you have certain conditions, such as high blood pressure or diabetes.
Look for “lower sodium” or “no salt added” labels on canned foods. Canned vegetables and soups often have high levels of salt. Luncheon meat, hot dogs, and frozen prepared meals often have extremely high levels of sodium, so check labels before you buy., A diet high in animal protein, especially red meats, increases your risk of developing kidney stones, especially uric acid stones.Limiting your animal protein intake to 6 ounces or less per day helps reduce your risk of forming all types of kidney stones.Red meats, organ meats, and shellfish are high in a substance called purine, which increases your body’s production of uric acid and can cause kidney stones.Eggs and fish also contain purines, although at a lower level.Substitute some of your animal protein with other rich sources of protein, such as nuts and legumes.

, Citric acid from fruits acts as a protective factor by coating existing kidney stones, making it difficult for them to increase in size. Your doctor may prescribe medications such as calcium citrate or potassium citrate; these are not dietary sources and work differently.Lemons and limes are the best source of citric acid. Drinking lemonade or limeade (especially low-sugar varieties) and squeezing lemon or lime juice on foods are excellent ways of increasing your citric acid intake.
Increasing your fruit and vegetable intake will help boost your citric acid consumption.
Some sodas, such as 7UP and Sprite, contain high levels of citric acid. While you should avoid high-sugar beverages, the occasional clear soda may be a good way to increase your citric acid intake., If you have a history of kidney stones made from calcium oxalate, the most common type of kidney stone, avoiding foods that are high in oxalate can help prevent future kidney stones.If you do eat foods that contain oxalates, eat them at the same time as foods that contain calcium. The calcium and oxalate will bind to each other, making them less likely to cause trouble for your kidneys.Limit oxalate to 40-50mg daily.
Foods that are high in oxalate (10mg+ per serving) include nuts, most berries, wheat, figs, grapes, tangerines, beans, beets, carrots, celery, eggplant, kale, leeks, olives, okra, peppers, potatoes, spinach, sweet potato, and zucchini.
Beverages that contain high levels of oxalate (more than 10mg per serving) include dark beer, black tea, chocolate-based beverages, soy beverages, and instant coffee.
Don’t over consume vitamin C. Your body may turn high doses — such as those from supplements — into oxalate., The calcium you eat from foods doesn’t affect your risk of developing kidney stones. In fact, diets that are too low in calcium may cause kidney stones to develop for some people. However, calcium supplements may increase the risk of developing kidney stones, so don’t take them unless your doctor has recommended them.Children between four and eight years old should get 1,000 mg of calcium daily. Children nine to 18 years old should get 1,300 mg of calcium daily. Adults 19 and older should get at least 1,000 mg of calcium daily. Women over 50 and men over 70 should increase their intake to 1,200 mg of calcium a day., Studies suggest that fiber-rich foods may help prevent kidney stones.Many high-fiber foods contain phytate, a compound that helps prevent calcium from crystallizing.


Beans and rice bran are good sources of phytate. While wheat and soybeans also contain phytates, they are also high in oxalate, so it’s recommended that you avoid them unless recommended by your doctor.

, Alcohol increases the level of uric acid in the bloodstream, which can contribute to kidney stones.If you do drink alcohol, choose light-colored beers or wine. These beverages don’t appear to increase your risk of kidney stones.Dark beers contain oxalate, which can increase kidney stones."

Ask about an examination for esophageal cancer.,
Set up future examinations if necessary.,
Accept that surgery may be a possibility.",How to Question Your Doctor About Heartburn," A heartburn severity scale is a way for people to measure their pain so that health professionals can help plan how best to control it. Mild symptoms are defined as symptoms that are hardly perceivable with only a slight impairment of general well-being; moderate symptoms are defined as clearly noticeable symptoms, but tolerable without immediate relief; and severe symptoms are defined as overwhelming discomfort with an urgent desire for immediate relief.;
, There are a lot of things you can do to avoid heartburn in the first place. They all mostly get down to what you put in your mouth. You want to avoid those foods that stimulate the production of acid in your stomach, avoid smoking, and limit your drinking of alcoholic beverages.

, The additional weight applies extra pressure on your stomach, the anti-reflux barrier can also be stretched out of shape resulting in increased chance of you suffering from acid reflux.

, If your heartburn is mild and infrequent you can usually manage it temporarily by avoiding certain foods or activities that cause symptoms or with over-the-counter treatments like antacids or H2-antagonists, also known as H2-blockers. Antacids neutralize the stomach acid already present and provide quick but short-term relief of heartburn symptoms. H2 blockers partially block the production of stomach acid. H2 blockers can be effective depending on the specific product or brand used and typically one dose can last from 6 to 12 hours. Unfortunately, standard antacids have at least two drawbacks. The first is called ""rebound"". Most antacids work by neutralizing the stomach acids so it doesn't ""burn"" if they get into the esophagus. Unfortunately, the stomach just responds by producing more acid, thus setting up a vicious circle. The second problem (with chronic use), while more minor, is that during the temporary ""successful"" period, your stomach's acid is lowered, possibly interfering with normal digestion of food as intended by nature. One European product also available in the US is Frutin, in which the chewed tablet forms a neutral foam which rises to the top of the stomach, keeping the acid in the stomach, allowing for acidity to continue without interference in the stomach, and allowing relief from acidity outside the stomach, the original condition disrupted by GERD. Do not be intimidated if your physician has not heard of any alternative to conventional over the counter antacids or has not even thought about the ""rebound"" problem and tries to minimize your concern. Politely explain why you prefer to use this type of alternative antacid (it can be found online via google and clicking on the top ""products"" tab to find online sources.

, Medicines that reduce the amount of acid that your stomach releases are commonly referred to as PPIs or proton-pump inhibitors. PPIs effect both the symptoms of heartburn and help heal the damage that GERD does to the esophagus. They are often recommended for people whose symptoms are not relieved by H2 blockers or who already have some damage to the lining of their esophagus.


Ask about side effects. Individual results vary but you may experience side effects like abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, dizziness, and/or headache.
The FDA have issued a safety warning on the long-term user of PPIs, they can result in weakening of the bones.

, There are other medicines that address heartburn from different angles, for example there are medicines that makes you feel full sooner.

, Anemia (low red-blood cell count), black stools, and vomiting of blood (obviously) are signs of bleeding.

, Humphrey Bogart died of esophageal cancer at the age of 57. Since the signs of esophagitis can be the same as for esophageal cancer it is a good topic to bring up with your doctor.

, Ongoing symptoms require ongoing exams if only to compare your current situation against your first visits.

, Surgery is occasionally required to treat esophagitis, especially if a hiatus hernia is present and when the above steps have been ineffective. Newer laparoscopic surgery has simplified this procedure.

As such, newborn babies should get their first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine very shortly after birth and get the other two shots by the time they are six-months old. The injections are given into the thigh muscles of newborns.


Babies born to mothers who have acute hepatitis B or have had the infection in the past should get vaccinated within 12 hours of birth.After three doses of the hepatitis B vaccine, at least 95% of infants, children and adolescents develop adequate antibody responses to the HBV and are immune to infection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The side effects from hepatitis B vaccines are usually not serious and typically include soreness at the injection site and mild flu-like symptoms.;
, If your child or adolescent wasn't vaccinated against HBV at birth, then make an appointment with your family doctor and ask about getting so-called ""catch-up"" doses of hepatitis B vaccine — which means getting their immune system caught up to speed in preventing the infection.This is particularly important if your child has a weakened immune system, needs frequent blood transfusions or has a serious liver or kidney disease. Furthermore, you should take your teenager for a catch-up shot if they are becoming sexually active. The deltoid (shoulder) muscle is the recommended site for hepatitis B vaccination in children and adults.


HBV is infectious, but it's not transmitted via saliva. It's only transmitted through contact with blood and other body fluids, such as semen.As such, you can't get a hepatitis B infection from sharing food or drinks, kissing or getting sneezed on.
The Recombivax HB vaccine has only a two-dose schedule (instead of three) for adolescents aged 11 through 15 years, so this may be more appropriate if your child has a big fear of needles.

, Even if you were vaccinated at birth for HBV, you should get a booster dose (three shots within six months) if you are considered at high risk for the infection. People at higher risk of hepatitis B infection include health care workers, frequent travelers (especially to developing countries), people who live in countries where the risk of hepatitis B is high, patients undergoing hemodialysis, sexually promiscuous people, people who have contracted an STD in the past, pregnant women, male homosexuals, recreational drug users, people in the correctional system, people who need frequent blood products or transfusions (hemodialysis patients), people with compromised immunity and people with chronic liver or kidney disease.The regular hepatitis B vaccine schedule (three doses) is only 75% effective in preventing infection or clinical hepatitis if you are aged 60 years or older.As such, talk to your doctor about possibly getting larger doses or more doses of the vaccine for better protection.
The most common ways HBV is transmitted include: unprotected sexual contact with someone who is infected; sharing contaminated needles, syringes or intravenous (IV) paraphernalia; accidental needle pricks while working as a healthcare professional; and infected mothers passing it to babies during childbirth., The exchange of body fluids (blood, semen, vaginal secretions) during sexual contact is the most common method of HBV transmission between adults. As such, know the HBV status of any sexual partner and always either wear a condom or insist that your partner does in order to prevent your risk of hepatitis B infection.Condom use does not completely eliminate the risk of hepatitis B infection or other sexually transmitted diseases, but it significantly reduces it.


Use a new latex or polyurethane condom every time you have a sexual encounter, even if there's no sexual intercourse involved.
The HBV can't penetrate latex or polyurethane, but sometimes condoms develop rips or tears or are used incorrectly.

, Some illicit drugs, such as heroin, are injected with needles and syringes, which not only negatively impacts your health in numerous ways, but it can dramatically increase your risk of hepatitis B infection if you share needles.Promising yourself that you won't share needles with other drug users is often not foolproof since the discomfort of withdrawal symptoms can make people do desperate and irrational things to get high. As such, the best advice is to stop using all illicit drugs. If you need help quitting, ask your doctor about addiction programs.


If you are an injection drug user, keep in mind that thoroughly cleaning your syringes (even with bleach) will not eliminate your risk of hepatitis B infection — so never share needles.Other drug paraphernalia may also have blood on it that's contaminated with HBV (like straws for snorting cocaine), so avoid sharing anything with other drug users — even razors and toothbrushes., Getting body parts pierced or tattooed are not high-risk activities for HBV infection or any other type of infection. However, because HBV is a blood born virus, there's some risk of infection if the person piercing or tattooing you doesn't sterilize their equipment properly, use disposable gloves and/or practice good hygiene.As such, only use shops that have good reputations and are willing to answer questions about how they reduce the risk of spreading infectious diseases, such as HBV.


Consider making your appointment for when the shop opens in the morning (so you're the first client of the day) and asking them if you can watch how they sterilize their equipment.
Explain that you're especially cautious of infectious blood-born diseases and that you're not questioning their professionalism, just wanting a high level of hygiene.

, For any type of infection (viral, bacterial or fungal), true prevention depends on a healthy and strong immune system. Your immune system consists of specialized cells that search for and attempt to destroy HBV, but when the system is weakened and malfunctioning, HBV proliferates in the blood and causes liver inflammation and damage.Thus, focusing on ways to keep your immune system strong and functioning properly is a logical and natural approach to preventing HBV and virtually all other infectious diseases.


Getting more sleep (or better quality sleep), eating more fresh produce, practicing good hygiene, drinking lots of purified water and regular cardiovascular exercise are all proven ways to boost your immune function.Your immune response will also benefit by cutting down on refined sugars (soda pop, candy, ice cream, most baked goods), reducing your alcohol consumption and refraining from smoking tobacco products.
Supplements that can boost immunity include vitamins A, C and D, zinc, selenium, echinacea, olive leaf extract and astragalus root., If you're not vaccinated against HBV and are nervous that you've been recently exposed to the virus (ie. poked with a used needle or unprotected sexual encounter), then talk to your doctor about a single injection of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) to help contain the infection.HBIG is recommended following exposure to HBV (preferably within 24 hours of exposure) because it provides immediate, short-term protection against HBV proliferation and infection.Along with a HBIG injection, a dose of hepatitis B vaccine is given at the same time for those not previously vaccinated.
A HBIG injection does not guarantee protection from HBV infection and it becomes significantly less effective beyond the initial 24-hour window from the moment of exposure.
Children born to mothers who are infected with hepatitis B should have a hepatitis B Vaccination and HBIG.

Learn why you need your tooth extracted.,
Make sure that you need your tooth (or teeth) removed.,
Provide a complete medical history to your oral surgeon.,
Get x-rays of the affected area.,
Arrange transportation to and from the surgery.,
Fast the night before surgery.,
Take any antibiotics your oral surgeon prescribes.",How to Prepare for Tooth Extraction1," There are a variety of reasons why you need tooth extraction surgery. Some of them include:Teeth are blocking others from coming in.
Baby teeth have not fallen out to give space for permanent teeth.
Tooth has decayed past the point of salvaging.
A decayed tooth presents a risk of infection to the rest of the mouth.
A need to create space before an orthodontic treatment.;
, If you are getting your adult teeth pulled, they will not grow back. Your oral surgeon should explain to you why tooth extraction is the best and only way to treat your problem.

, They will need to know all the vitamins, prescriptions, and over-the-counter medications you may be taking. These medications could impact the type of anesthetic they use when prepping you for surgery.Let your doctor know about any allergies or general health issues you may have, in particular any problems relating to your heart or blood.
Local anesthetics can sometimes cause reactions with certain medicines.

, Your oral surgeon should get local x-rays of the area where they will be operating. This provides them with the best plan to extract your tooth.


If you’re having your wisdom teeth taken out, the oral surgeon will take a panoramic x-ray, which takes a picture of all of your teeth. This is especially important if the wisdom teeth are impacted and may require delicate work around the jaw.

, Depending on the severity of your tooth extraction, you may be pretty out of it when you come to consciousness. This will severely impair your ability to drive, so it’s important to have transportation arranged beforehand. You may be able to get a friend or family member to drive you. If possible, find someone who can stay with you after the surgery. Getting a ride with a taxi or ride service is probably not the best option.

, You will likely need to fast the night before surgery. This reduces the risk of inhaling the contents of the stomach into the lungs while you’re out.The standard amount of time to fast before surgery is eight to 12 hours, but your doctor should let you know how long is necessary. At the very least, you should not drink or eat anything after midnight.
If you are diabetic or take any prescribed medicines, follow your normal routine. Verify this with your oral surgeon before doing so.

, You may be prescribed antibiotics if you have a weakened immune system or if you have an infection when it’s time for surgery.


If you have any illness up to a week prior to the surgery, tell your oral surgeon. They may want to reschedule your appointment until you are better.

"
"
Arrive early to your surgery appointment.,
Be prepared for the local or general anesthetic.,
Know about the different types of extractions.,
Expect blood clots after your tooth has been pulled.,
Get stitches if necessary to stop the bleeding.,
Prevent dry socket.",How to Prepare for Tooth Extraction2," The oral surgeon will want to make sure everything is ready to go for the tooth extraction. You’ll want to be comfortable and relaxed before your tooth extraction begins.

, Your oral surgeon may give you either a local or general anesthetic depending upon the time of tooth extraction. A local anesthetic will numb the place where the tooth extraction will take place, whereas a general anesthetic may put you to sleep.Local anesthetics are used when one tooth needs to be extracted, while general anesthetics are more common when multiple teeth are being removed.
The oral surgeon may give you an intravenous anesthetic, so wear short sleeves that can be easily rolled up.

, Depending on the severity of your problem, the oral surgeon may perform one of two different types of extractions. Each comes with their own challenges and preparation.A simple extraction can be done by your regular dentist, who removes a tooth that can be seen in the mouth.They loosen your tooth with a tool called an elevator and remove it with forceps.
A surgical extraction is done by an oral surgeon, though it can be done by your regular dentist. In this type of extraction, your tooth is either not above the gum line or has broken off. They cut into your gum and often remove some of the nearby bone to get to the tooth. These teeth sometimes have to be removed in pieces.

, Once the tooth has been extracted, a blood clot will form. The oral surgeon will have you bite down on gauze to slow the bleeding., Your oral surgeon may also give you stitches to stop any bleeding in your mouth. These stitches will likely be dissolvable and go away on their own.If your oral surgeon uses stitches that are not dissolvable, then you will likely have a follow-up appointment where they remove your stitches.

, Dry socket is a condition that occurs very rarely, but is where the blood clot becomes dislodged and the bone and nerves underneath are exposed to the mouth. It is more common in the following groups of people:People who smoke.
People with bad oral hygiene.
People getting their wisdom teeth extracted.
People who use birth control.
People with a history of dry socket.
People who do not follow the surgeon's post-op instructions.

"
"
Take it easy immediately after your tooth extraction.,
Control bleeding with gauze.,
Bite down on the gauze at your extraction site.,
Make sure a blood clot forms.,
Stay away from any strenuous activities.,
Clean out the tooth socket with salt water.,
Minimize swelling of your face.,
Take proper pain medication.,
Eat soft foods.,
Avoid smoking.,
See your oral surgeon with any problems.",How to Prepare for Tooth Extraction3," Give yourself plenty of time to recover immediately after the surgery. You'll still be under the influence of anesthetic and your mouth will be quite sensitive.

, Your mouth will bleed quite a bit after extraction. Change your gauze regularly so it can soak up the blood.

, This will help your blood clot form. Try to bite down on gauze for roughly 45 minutes to an hour.If heavy bleeding continues after you use the gauze a few times, contact your oral surgeon.

, It's important that a blood clot forms to protect your extraction site. Otherwise, you could wind up with a dry socket, which can be extremely painful. When you brush your teeth, be extremely careful around the extraction site. You don't want to dislodge the blood clot and cause dry socket.
Also, do not use straws, smoke, or do anything else that causes sucking, since this can also dislodge the blood clot.

, These could restart bleeding or possibly cause dry socket. Don't even blow your nose, as the change in air pressure could disrupt the healing process at the extraction site.


It's also important to keep your head elevated to help with the healing process. Sleep with your head above your heart, either by using stacked pillows or wedge pillows.

, After the first 24 hours, you'll need to clean out the tooth socket with salt water. Don't do this during the first day, since you can dislodge the blood clot.


Use 1/4 teaspoon of salt in an 8 oz glass of water. You can do this two to three times daily to help keep your mouth clean., Some swelling will happen, depending on the severity of your surgery. Apply ice for 20 minutes at a time directly to your face above the affected area.Swelling will likely not be at its worst until two to three days after surgery. Continue to apply ice to the affected area as long as it's needed.
Don't worry if you see any bruises in the swollen area. This is absolutely normal and they will go away in a few days.

, Your oral surgeon will prescribe you pain medication. Follow their directions and take only as many as is suggested. The worst pain will be in the first 6 hours; it should be significantly less after that.


If the pain medication causes nausea, tell your oral surgeon. They may be able to prescribe something different or have an over-the-counter suggestion.

, It may be useful to stick to a liquid diet at first, so to avoid irritating the your extraction site. Find meals that are easy to chew and do not tax your teeth.Stay away from hot and foods, since they can also irritate the extraction site. Stick to foods that are room temperature.
Small foods, such as rice, nuts, seeds, and popcorn can become lodged in the extraction site as well, so do not eat them while recovering., Smoking can cause dry socket, which can be extremely painful. Take a few days off from smoking until your oral surgeon says that you will not cause any damage to the extraction site.

, If anything unusual occurs, make sure to talk to your oral surgeon immediately. This is especially true if you any of the below problems:


Excessive bleeding
Swelling after three to four days
Persistent numbness
Issues with pain medication

Set up an initial consultation.,
Ask the right questions.,
Evaluate the office and staff.,
Consider technology and treatment options.,
Get a second opinion.,
Don’t rush a decision.",How to Pick an Orthodontist1," Before you decide on a particular orthodontist, you will want to set up an initial consultation with the doctor. Many orthodontists will offer a free, complimentary exam and you will not be charged for this initial consultation., You will want to make sure you ask all the necessary questions during your initial consultation with the orthodontist. Some important questions to ask the orthodontist include:From what accredited dental school did you graduate?
Where did you complete your Orthodontic Residency program?
What is the cost of the treatment plan?
How long will the treatment plan take?
What kind of post-treatment follow up is necessary?
Do you have patients I could contact for references?
Are you board certified by the American Board of Orthodontics?

, The office itself should be clean, modern, and well-lit. You should also consider how staff treated you before, during, and after the visit. Pay particular attention to the orthodontist's patient skills, and whether you felt like the orthodontist was prioritizing your care or rushing through your visit., You will want to consider whether or not the orthodontist is using newer technology and techniques, or whether their approach to orthodontics seems rooted in the past. Opt for an orthodontist who is using the most up to date technologies and treatments., It never hurts to get a second opinion when choosing an orthodontist and deciding on a treatment plan. If you are not happy with your first consultation, consider an evaluation by another orthodontist. You can then compare pricing and treatment plans before making a final choice., Sometimes patients will feel pressured to make a quick decision. This is unnecessary unless you are dealing with an orthodontic emergency. Take your time deciding on an orthodontist."
"
Create a list of orthodontists in your area.,
Determine which orthodontists accept your insurance.,
Choose a board certified orthodontist.,
Make sure the doctor is an orthodontist, not a dentist.,
Read reviews.",How to Pick an Orthodontist2," You will want to choose an orthodontist that practices in your local area. Ask your dentist, family, and friends if they have any recommendations. You can also search for orthodontists in your area on the American Board of Orthodontics’ website using their Orthodontist Locator search engine., If you have health care that covers orthodontics, you will want to make sure you pick an orthodontist who takes your insurance. Call the orthodontist’s office and ask if they accept your insurance. You should also check directly with your insurer., You should choose an orthodontist who is certified by the American Board of Orthodontics. Board certified orthodontists complete a two-year orthodontics residency after dental school to learn orthodontics. Verify the orthodontist is board certified at https://www.americanboardortho.com/portal/public/., There are many general dentists that practice orthodontics, but have no formal schooling. Avoid seeing a dentist for orthodontic work. Instead, choose an orthodontist who has completed a two-year orthodontics residency after dental school., It is important that you choose an orthodontist that has been rated favorably by other patients. Look at the orthodontist’s website and read patient reviews. You can also read orthodontist reviews on www.healthgrades.com."

Find an orthodontist.,
Get braces.,
Choose your type of braces.,
Wear your retainer.",How to Make Your Teeth Straight1," Orthodontists are dentists who specialize in diagnosing, preventing, and treating irregularities in your teeth.See your regular dentist and ask for a referral to an orthodontist. Your dentist can probably make helpful suggestions for finding a professional in your area. The orthodontist will evaluate your teeth, jaw, and gums and help you decide on the best treatment plan for you.

If you have health insurance that covers dentistry, call your insurance company and ask for a list of in-network orthodontists that they will cover.
Some dentists can do orthodontic work, whereas others will refer you to a specialist. Just ask!;
, Braces are a traditional way of realigning crooked teeth. You will have small brackets cemented to your teeth and connected by wires. The braces will apply pressure to slowly move your teeth into a straighter position over time. You will see your dentist or orthodontist periodically so they can appropriately tighten your braces.How long you have braces varies and depends on your teeth, but the normal range is between one and three years.
Braces now are more comfortable than ever before., Braces can be fun bright colors, or subtler tooth-colored brackets. Some braces can even be placed behind your teeth (lingual braces) so you don’t see them much – they’re nearly invisible, but may be less comfortable.Discuss your options with your orthodontist., Your dentist or orthodontist will probably give you a retainer after your braces are removed. This is a removable mouthpiece that keeps your teeth in their new position. You’ll wear it at night for a while, but not forever.Be sure to wear your retainer as directed by your dentist so your teeth don’t start to shift back to their previous position."
"
Get fitted for an aligner.,
Wear your aligner appropriately.,
Choose a reputable brand.",How to Make Your Teeth Straight2," Aligners are made of clear plastic or acrylic that you wear over your teeth every day. See your orthodontist to have an aligner specially made for your mouth. You will need to revisit the orthodontist for a new set every month or so. This process gradually moves your teeth into a straighter position., Because your aligner is removable, you’ll be responsible for wearing it correctly. Follow your dentist or orthodontist’s instructions about how long to wear your aligner each day. Take out your aligner before you eat or brush and floss your teeth., There are numerous brands of aligners available, such as Invisalign and ClearCorrect. Your orthodontist can help you choose the best kind for you. Some internet companies offer less expensive, mail-order aligners that you use without seeing an orthodontist. Having a full examination by a professional is a safer way to straighten your teeth and know if aligners are right for you."
"
Have surgery.,
Stay away from DIY methods.,
See your orthodontist if you’ve been trying to straighten your teeth at home.",How to Make Your Teeth Straight3," If your teeth are crooked because your jaw is misaligned, surgery can help. Surgery will not change the position of your individual teeth. It can change the position of your jaw if your upper or lower jaw sticks out and causes what dentists call a “bad bite.” This will improve the overall position of your teeth and can straighten your smile., The American Organization of Orthodontists strongly warns against using at-home remedies to straighten your teeth.Following “how-to” guides from the internet without an orthodontist’s supervision can damage your teeth and gums and cause lasting harm. It’s much safer and more effective to have a professional treat your teeth than to try to do it yourself. Do not:Wrap string or rubber bands around your teeth
Use paper clips
Bite on objects like pencils
Follow the advice of a youtube video or blog

, DIY tooth straightening methods can cause pretty severe harm to your teeth and gums. If you have been trying to fix your teeth at home using a “how-to” guide from the internet, stop right away and see your dentist or orthodontist. They can help repair and prevent further damage, and begin to straighten your teeth safely and appropriately.

Sometimes, damage from DIY methods can be irreversible.

Sleep on your back.,
Sit up properly at your desk.,
Avoid sucking on objects.,
Maintain good oral hygiene.,
Breathe through your nose.",How to Make Your Teeth Straight4," If you sleep on your stomach, you constantly apply gentle pressure to the side of your face and your teeth. Slow, gradual pressure over time is what causes teeth to move, so sleeping on your stomach may make your teeth shift out of alignment after a while.Get in the habit of sleeping on your back or your side., If you sit at a desk a lot, it’s easy to rest your chin in your hand throughout the day. This habit can shift your jaw and teeth subtly. When sitting, tilt your pelvis back so that you aren’t sitting on your tailbone. This creates an easier posture to help you avoid slumping forward and leaning your head on your hand., Thumb sucking and overuse of pacifiers commonly causes crooked teeth for children, whose teeth and gums are developing.Help your child have a healthy smile by eliminating these habits as early as you can. For adults, avoid habits that put consistent pressure on your teeth and gums like constantly chewing hard candy or sucking on objects absentmindedly., If your gums and teeth are healthy, your teeth are more likely to stay straight.Develop good oral hygiene habits to avoid gum disease and tooth decay and maintain straighter teeth.

Brush and floss your teeth twice a day.

, Breathing through your mouth all the time may cause your jaw to narrow and can shift your teeth out of alignment.Remember to breathe through your nose whenever possible. If you have sinus problems or difficulty breathing through your nose, talk to your doctor about solutions."
"
Explain your dental and medical history to your dentist.,
Make arrangements to get to and from surgery.,
Do not eat during the 8–12 hours before your surgery.,
Take all prescription medications as directed.,
Arrange things for your comfort.,
Plan to remain sedentary for two days following surgery.,
Ask a family member to keep you company.,
Purchase soft foods ahead of time.,
Arrive at the dentist at least 30 minutes before your surgery.,
Remain calm during the procedure.,
Follow any instructions the dentist gives you.",How to Prepare for a Tooth Extraction," This can happen in the first dental appointment prior to your surgery when you will have to complete a medical form about your past medical issues and your current situation. Once your dentist has thorough knowledge of your medical and dental history, they will be better able to prescribe necessary medications.Tell your dentist any medications that you’re currently taking, including over-the-counter medicine. Some medicines may interfere with others or have contraindications.;
, If you’ll be given general anesthesia during surgery, you’ll be in no condition to drive yourself home following the procedure. Talk to a friend or a family member, and ask if they’ll be willing to drive you to and from the dentist’s office.Alternately, if you’re comfortable driving yourself to the surgery and have a friend or family member in the area, ask if they’re willing to pick you up and drive you home in your own car.
If you’ll only be receiving a local anesthetic (numbing just the area of the tooth extraction), you should be able to drive yourself home.
Check with your dentist or oral surgeon beforehand, to find out what type of anesthesia you’ll be receiving.

, Although tooth extraction is not an invasive surgery, your dentist will still likely ask you to fast for at least the night before the surgery, especially if you are having a general anesthesia procedure. Local anesthesia does not require a fast.They will give you the precise number of hours that you should fast for.


If you’re diabetic, let your oral surgeon know ahead of time. You’ll likely be allowed to eat breakfast, in order to maintain blood-sugar levels.Local anesthetic contains adrenaline, which can elevate sugar levels leading to dizziness or nausea. That is why it is best to eat before. Your dentist may also opt for a non-adrenaline anesthetic
Although you won’t be eating the night before surgery, make sure to stay hydrated. Drink plenty of water—this will also fill your stomach and decrease your hunger.

, In preparation for your tooth extraction, your dentist or oral surgeon may prescribe you certain medications.Take these as directed, especially if you’ve been given a painkiller or a medication to alter the coagulation or thickness of your blood.


Check with your dentist ahead of time to make sure that medication you’re already taking will not react with any new prescriptions.

, After surgery, you’ll still be disoriented and potentially in pain. Before leaving for the surgery, figure out where you plan to spend time once you’ve returned. If you’d like to spend the rest of the day on the couch, lay out everything you’ll need (tissues, DVDs, books or magazines, etc.) ahead of time.

, It will take roughly 48 hours for the swelling to die down, and you may be in pain or discomfort for the first couple days. Take time off from work, and avoid strenuous activity or any effort required. Spend as much time as possible in bed or on the couch, but do not rest your head on the pillow on the extraction side as this can increase local heat.Since the anesthetic will affect your motor skills and ability to reason well, do not make plans to sign any legal documents during the day of your surgery.Also avoid driving, drinking alcohol, or operating machinery for the rest of the day.

, Should any complications from the surgery arise, it’s best to not be alone after your surgery. You may need assistance moving about your house or apartment, and a family member will be able to keep you safe.Ask them to keep an eye on you for the rest of the day, and preferably to be available during the night as well.


If you live alone, see if a friend or out-of-town family member can visit you and keep you company after surgery.

, After the tooth extraction, your mouth will be in no condition to eat hard or crunchy foods. Plan your diet ahead of time, and focus on eating very soft foods, such as soup and yogurt, mashed vegetables such as broccoli or potatoes or even puddings, for the first two days after surgery.It will take six to eight weeks for your mouth to fully recover enough to be able to eat hard, crunchy foods, such as carrots or pretzels.

, This will ensure that you’re prepared, on time, and will give you time to fill out any insurance-related paper work.


Wear comfortable clothing, as you may be in the surgery chair for a couple of hours.
Make sure you are well-hydrated before the procedure, especially if it is a more complicated one.
Bring a book or something to occupy your time while you wait.
Ask your dentist any questions that arise.

, It should be painless, and the dentist will usually talk you through what they are doing. The dentist or oral surgeon will first administer a local anesthetic to numb your gum and the root of the tooth. Then he or she will make an incision in your gum tissue, remove any blocking access to the tooth’s root, and finally remove the tooth itself, before cleaning up any bone fragments and stitching your gum back together.If your tooth extraction calls for more invasive surgery, your oral surgeon may give you a general anesthesia either by mask using protoxide or by vein where an anesthesiologist will be assisting the vital signs during the procedure. This means that you will be completely unconscious during the procedure. , Your dentist may give you gauze to take home with you, especially if your socket continues to bleed after the tooth has been extracted. If your socket continues to bleed, pack the gauze firmly into the hole and add pressure by closing your jaw. Change out the gauze as frequently as your dentist or oral surgeon suggests.Take any prescribed medications as directed.
Avoid spitting or gargling liquids shortly after the surgery, as these motions can dislodge the clot from your extraction site and encourage excessive bleeding."

Maintain a balanced diet.,
Cut food into smaller pieces.,
Eat slowly.,
Brush after meals.,
Carry a pocket mirror.,
Check your braces for food.,
Keep a napkin handy.,
Swish water in your mouth.,
Carry toothpicks.,
Purchase an interdental toothbrush.,
Pick soft foods.,
Avoid hard foods.,
Eat less sugar.,
Say no to sticky food.,
Drink sugar-free drinks.",How to Avoid Getting Food in Your Braces," One of the best ways to keep food out of your braces is to eat a balanced, healthy diet because this automatically eliminates a lot of problematic foods (like sticky candy).A balanced diet also means less sugar. Sugar causes plaque to form around braces, which can grab food while you eat.;
, A key to eating what you want without getting food stuck in your braces is to cut it up. Don’t bite into carrots or apples or corn on the cob (which can damage your braces anyway), but instead cut corn off the cob or cut uncooked produce into bite-size pieces.


Place these smaller pieces at the back of your mouth so that you can chew with your back teeth.Avoid tearing food apart with your front teeth, where any particles can easily get stuck.

, Eating slowly and carefully will not only alert you more quickly to food particles that snag on braces, but it will also prevent food from accumulating on your braces in the first place. Eating slowly allows you to get a feel for how the food is interacting with your braces., For the best oral hygiene, brush your teeth four times a day, once after each meal and once right before bed. Such frequent brushing is bound to get food particles out of your braces, especially the pieces that didn’t come off using other techniques like a toothpick.Carry a travel-sized toothbrush and toothpaste in your purse or pockets in order to keep up good oral hygiene while you’re out.
If you let plaque remain on your teeth by not brushing, it can leave stains on your teeth and cause inflamed gums, which may lead to spontaneous bleeding.Your dentist may also tell you to use a fluoride mouthwash to further break down plaque., If you’re going out to eat with other people, you’ll want to have a way to check your braces discreetly. It’s nice to have your own mirror in case you feel a piece of food, or someone points out something in your braces, so that you don’t have to leave in search of a mirror.


It’s also good to check your braces in the pocket mirror quickly before engaging in conversation after the meal.

, You can do a braces check for embarrassing food particles with a pocket mirror, your tongue, or your finger. All of these can be done discreetly and quickly to minimize social awkwardness.


Pull out your pocket mirror and glance down at it without drawing attention to yourself.
Run your tongue over your braces to feel for large food particles while someone else is talking.
Pull a napkin over your mouth and run one finger over the most visible parts of your braces to check for large food pieces.

, Every time you go out to eat, snatch a napkin and keep it on your lap. You can use it as a shield for discreetly checking your braces during the meal.


Hold the napkin up as a visual barrier with one hand and get food out with the other hand.

, Water can act as a rinse for your braces. Always order a glass of water with your meal. Then simply pull a gulp of water into your mouth and quickly swish it around while you eat.


Do this while someone else is talking so that the focus is not on you.
Swishing water around like this repeatedly throughout a meal will go a long way toward keeping food from sticking to your braces.
Some dentists recommend rinsing with warm water throughout the day., Toothpicks are an easy remedy for large, obvious food particles when you’re out with friends. Keeping a stash of toothpicks in a sealed bag on your person will help you quickly dig out stubborn pieces of food that you find during or after a meal.



Only use toothpicks to get food out from behind wires and do not apply too much force or you risk detaching the bracket. Be careful to avoid using the toothpick between teeth to remove food. This can damage your teeth.You can use a toothpick to clear blocked braces while sitting at the table by using a napkin as a shield.
Otherwise, go to the bathroom and use the mirror there to locate and eradicate food particles with a toothpick.

, Also called a proxabrush, this little brush is shaped like a tiny pipe cleaner and is much more effective than toothpicks. It fits easily into a purse or pocket. This more specialized tool can help you get more out of your braces than your finger as well.Use it to clear food particles out from behind wires.
You can find interdental toothbrushes at most big box stores.

, Soft foods help prevent damage to your braces, but they don’t get much food stuck in your braces, either. Saying no to hard foods like hard candy and whole apples will prevent a difficult cleaning session later in the day. Choose foods like these:Dairy —Yogurt, soft cheeses
Bread —Slices of soft bread, pancakes, soft tortillas
Grains —Pasta, rice
Meat —Cooked meats, lunch meat
Seafood —Most dinner fish like salmon and tilapia
Cooked vegetables
Mashable fruits —Bananas, applesauce
Soups

, Some hard foods are healthy, but that doesn’t mean you should eat them, at least not if you are looking to keep food out of your braces. Even apples and carrots should not be eaten whole when you want to keep food out of your braces. Unhealthy hard foods — like hard candy — should always be on your “no eat” list. Stay away from foods like these:


Nuts
Hard candy
Chips
Whole apples
Raw carrots
Hard crusty bread
Ice
Bagels

, Sugar gets stuck in your braces, even though it’s invisible. When it does, it causes tooth decay from plaque build-up around the braces, and the potential for further damage like staining.To help keep sugar from getting trapped in your braces, avoid sugary foods like these:


Candy
Chocolate
Baked goods
Sweetened yogurt
Sugary syrups

, One of the worst culprits for getting food stuck in your braces is sticky food. Not only does sticky food gravitate toward your braces, getting lodged behind the wires, it’s often also sugary and can spell a plaque build-up disaster for your teeth. Here are some sticky foods to avoid:


Toffee
Licorice
Hard candy
Caramels
Tootsie rolls
All gum (even sugar free)

, While you do need to take a big drink of something during a meal to keep food out of your braces, if that beverage has sugar in it, you’re just washing away food only to give your braces some bacteria-building material to hang onto. To keep your teeth free of decay-causing bacteria, follow every meal or snack with water.


If you absolutely have to, you may drink a sugary drink once a week if it is followed by water, which can pull any leftover sugar molecules away before they make purchase with plaque. #*Sugary drinks include: sweet tea, sports drinks, Kool-Aid, and soda.

See a doctor and get vaccinated.,
Wash your hands often.,
Use caution around infected people.,
Know when and where to be alert.,
Know when to call a doctor.",How to Prevent Hepatitis A," As is the case with many viral diseases, vaccination is the best way to prevent hepatitis A. Vaccination is a quick, easy way to get immunity for hepatitis A, so if you believe you may be exposed to hepatitis A in the future, it's a very good idea to get a vaccine as soon as possible. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has outlined the following vaccination protocols:


The recommended age for Hepatitis A vaccination in infants is 12-23 months.
Pre-teens and teens age 7-18 years old are recommended to take the Hepatitis Vaccine Series in the case of certain health conditions that may put them at higher risk for diseases (e.g., in the case of a sudden outbreak of disease that causes diarrhea).
For ages 19 and above, it is recommended to take at least two vaccines, especially if the patient didn't receive any vaccination when s/he was young. Two additional doses are needed for people who are pregnant, have a weak immune system, are HIV positive, or have diabetes, kidney disease and/or certain heart conditions.;
, Because hepatitis A is usually spread through the consumption of tiny amounts of fecal matter, carefully washing your hands can go a long way in terms of preventing infection. Be particularly careful and wash your hands thoroughly if you have recently come into contact with any of the following:


Public diaper changing tables
Portable toilets
Other areas where fecal matter may be present

, Be especially cautious when you are in close proximity to someone you know is infected with hepatitis A, as s/he can unintentionally give you the virus. Avoid close personal contact with people who have hepatitis. Also avoid:Consuming food and drink that has been handled by someone with hepatitis A.
Having sex with someone who has hepatitis A.

, Be aware of foods and water in countries where hepatitis A is common (often in the developing world). Also be alert in areas where the conditions are unsanitary or poor personal hygiene is prevalent. The foods and drinks most likely to be contaminated with hepatitis A are:


Vegetables
Fruits
Shellfish (from contaminated water sources)
Unclean ice or water (which, in undeveloped areas, can contain sewage)

, It's very important to know the signs and symptoms of Hepatitis A, especially in cases of sudden outbreaks of water borne diseases or when you are traveling in countries where the disease is endemic.

When you experience some or all of the following symptoms, contact a doctor immediately: fever, malaise, loss of appetite, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal discomfort, dark-colored urine, and a yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes called jaundice.
There is no specific treatment for hepatitis A. Recovery from symptoms may take several weeks or even months.
Supportive therapy for hepatitis A includes proper nutrition and fluid replacement from diarrhea.
Note: The usual incubation period of Hepatitis A is 14-28 days. If you develop hepatitis A, notify anyone you've had close contact with in the past month so they can also contact their doctor.

Speak to your orthodontist about colored bands for your braces.,
Wait at least one week until you try to kiss someone.,
Practice smiling with braces in the mirror.,
Use positive affirmations.,
Avoid whitening products.,
Use a mouthguard if you play sports or are active.",How to Be Happy with Braces1," Personalize your braces by using colored rubber bands. These rubber bands are made for braces and come in a variety of colors. Your orthodontist can provide these rubber bands, allowing you to get creative with your braces and change up your color combinations or create a color pattern that becomes your signature look.


These colored bands can help you become more comfortable with braces and embrace them, rather than try to hide them. Wearing colored bands can show you are not shy or ashamed about your new braces and are willing to show off the colors on your braces when you laugh, sing, eat, or smile.
Try to consider your braces as a fashion accessory and remember that after you are done wearing them you will have a perfect smile.;
, When you first get braces, your mouth will likely be very sore and irritated. Use dental wax on your braces to prevent the wires and brackets from scratching the inside of your mouth and practice good dental hygiene to help your mouth recover. It should take at least one week for your mouth to heal to the point where you might want to kiss someone or get up close and personal.


Kissing someone when you have braces can be tricky, so start with a closed mouth kiss to determine if your mouth is still too sensitive to pressure from someone else's mouth. Once you feel comfortable with a closed mouth kiss, move on to soft open mouth kisses. Move slowly and do not put unnecessary pressure on your mouth, as it could still be sore from your new braces.

, Get used to your new look by practicing your smile in the mirror, noting how you appear with your new braces. Exercise your facial muscles by practicing a simple smile: stretching the corners of your mouth and showing off your new braces. You can then move on to practicing a more natural smile and relaxing the corners of your mouth so you smile as you did before you had braces.Another option you can practice is smiling with your eyes in the mirror. Narrowing your eyes as you smile shows that you are giving someone a natural and sincere smile. Research has shown that looking at images of people smiling with their eyes, or doing a ""Duchenne smile"" can help you mimic and copy this type of smile effectively.

, If you are struggling with how to be happy and positive with your new set of braces, try saying at least five to ten positive affirmations out loud to yourself every day. Positive affirmations center on the phrase ""you are what you think"" and allow you to vocalize positive thoughts and manifest them throughout your day. Affirmations are effective methods of self improvement as they raise your level of feel good hormones and encourage positive thinking.Try to always phrase your affirmations with ""I can"", ""I will"", or ""I am."" For example: ""Today, I am brimming with energy and overflowing with joy."" "" I am a powerhouse; I am indestructible."" ""I can smile and be happy with my braces."" ""I will smile at someone at least five times today and show off my braces.""

, Though it may be tempting to skip brushing or flossing in favor of whitening products, using these products while you have braces can damage the brackets and wires. They can also leave variations in color on your teeth that may not look very attractive when you finally get your braces off.Wait until you get your braces removed to use whitening strips or any mouthwashes or toothpastes that contain whitening products. You can also get your teeth whitened at your dentist’s office if home whitening does not give you the results you want.

, Your orthodontist can provide a mouth guard made specifically for your mouth to protect your braces when you play sports or are doing intense activity.If you play a musical instrument that involves your mouth, you may have trouble adapting to playing with braces. Try using dental wax and rinsing your mouth with warm salt water often to help your mouth heal and to keep it moisturized. This should make it easier to get used to playing your instrument with braces.

Acquire a box of dental wax.,
Wash your hands.,
Shape a small ball of wax.,
Locate painful areas.,
Brush your teeth.,
Dry off your braces.,
Press the wax over the painful area.,
Rub it in place.,
Allow the wax to work.,
Reapply the wax regularly.,
Consider dental silicone.,
Contact your orthodontist if the pain persists.",How to Apply Dental Wax on Braces," When you first received your braces, it is likely that your orthodontist gave you a pack with some essential supplies. Dental wax should have been included in the pack.If you lose it or run out, you can easily buy another box from your local drugstore, or ask your orthodontist for some more.


You will probably find that your braces irritate the inside of your mouth most when you first have them, so they will require more wax.
Over time, the skin on the inside of your mouth may toughen up and you may find you require less wax.;
, Scrub your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, then dry them thoroughly. You don't want to bring any bacteria into your mouth, especially if you have a cut or sore.

, Pull off a little piece of wax from the pack and roll it with your fingers into a ball shape. You want it to be just big enough to cover the bracket or wire irritating your mouth.A blob the size of a popcorn kernel or pea will usually do the job.


Roll the wax for at least five seconds. The warmth from your fingers will soften it and make it easier to use.
Using too much wax may result in the wax falling off.

, Wax can cover up any area where sharp or rough metal is irritating your inner lips and cheeks. The most common places are the brackets on your front teeth, and the sharp wires at the far back of your mouth. Pull your cheek out and look for any bright red or swollen areas, or gently probe your cheek to find tender areas. You should protect all of these before they develop into cuts, or get infected.


If you're having trouble seeing, use a metal rod or small spoon to push out your cheek.

, This isn't completely necessary, but it may reduce bacteria buildup and keep the wax cleaner.At least remove any food stuck in the braces where you plan to apply the wax.

, Before you apply the wax, dry off your braces with a tissue.The drier the area is, the longer the wax will stick.

, Using your thumb and forefinger, press the ball of wax over the bracket or wire causing you pain. If the wire is at the back of your mouth, push as far as you can, then withdraw your thumb and use your forefinger and tongue to position the wax.


The wax is edible and non-toxic, so it doesn't matter if you swallow it., Rub your forefinger over the wax a couple times to stick it in place. The wax should still stick out a little, forming a small bump.

, Once you have applied wax to your braces, your mouth should heal itself quite quickly.The wax barrier stops the irritation and allows the mouth the time to heal any sore spots. As you become accustomed to your braces, you will find they cause less and less irritation and you won't have to use the wax as often.

, Keep some wax on you when you are out and about.Replace the wax twice a day, or whenever it starts to fall off. Do not leave it on for more than two days, as bacteria can build up in the wax.


The wax will pick up food as you eat. If the braces are too painful to let you eat without wax, replace the dirty wax after you finish your meal.
Take off the wax before brushing your teeth, or you'll get wax caught in your toothbrush., One common alternative to dental wax is dental silicone. This comes in strips that you apply to braces. The silicone is more resilient as it impervious to the saliva and enzymes in your mouth, which means that you will have to reapply it less frequently.The downside is that your braces must be completely dry before you apply it.If you want to try silicone, ask your dentist for a tester pack, or buy a small amount from the store and test it out for a few days.

, If you have tried wax and silicone and they haven't helped, get in touch with your orthodontist. Persistent irritation and sores can become infected and lead to more serious problems. If you are having a really tough time with your braces, don't be shy about getting in touch with your orthodontist. They will help make them more comfortable."

Rinse your mouth with warm salt water once a day.,
Ask your orthodontist for dental wax.,
Brush after every meal.,
Get a soft toothbrush that has round bristles.,
Use a floss threader when flossing.,
Fix any loose wires or bands at home.,
Take care of your lips.",How to Be Happy with Braces2," When you first get braces, your teeth will likely feel sore and irritated for several days to a week. Your lips, cheeks, and tongue may also become irritated or sore as they get used to the new metal rows in your mouth. Soothe any soreness by doing a salt water rinse of your mouth once a day. This old fashioned remedy is great for rinsing your mouth of harmful bacteria and will reduce inflammation.Dissolve one teaspoon of salt in a glass of lukewarm water. Gargle and rinse your mouth with the warm salt water for a few minutes in the morning before you start your day, or before bed. Try not to swallow any of the salt water, as this can lead to an upset stomach.
You can also add a half spoon of baking soda and mix it in with the saltwater until it dissolves completely. The baking soda will provide protection against acids and help your teeth remineralize.

, You can also buy dental wax at your local drug store. Dental wax can be placed over your braces and will act as a barrier between your braces and your lips. This can help sore or irritated skin your mouth to heal as you get used to your braces., This means even after a small late night meal or a quick snack from the vending machine. Food particles can get trapped in your braces after you eat, and the longer those particles remain trapped, the higher your risk of developing dental issues. It’s important that you practice diligent and consistent dental hygiene when you have braces to prevent staining, infection, and the development of cavities.Try to brush for at least two minutes after every meal to ensure you remove any food in your braces and keep your braces clean.

, You will likely need to replace your toothbrush more often, as your braces can wear out your toothbrush rather quickly. You may want to invest in an electric toothbrush, as these are very efficient at cleaning your teeth. Your orthodontist may recommend a Waterpik, which can make brushing around your braces easier.


Use toothpaste that contains fluoride. Your orthodontist may also recommend a fluoride rinse that you can use once a day as part of your brushing routine.Rinse your mouth with water before you brush to loosen any food particles that are stuck in your braces. You can also use an interproximal brush, which is designed to fit under the wires of your braces, to remove plaque and food particles in your braces.Brush for at least two minutes total, taking care to brush each tooth at the gum line, as well as below and above the brackets. Start with your gum line first. Hold the toothbrush at a 45-degree angle and carefully make small circles along your gum line. Then, clean the brackets by moving the brush at a downward angle on the top of the brackets. Finish brushing the top of your brackets by holding the brush at an upward angle from the top of the brackets and moving the brush in small circles.
You can also try using an electric toothbrush for general cleaning and then use a manual toothbrush with soft bristles and a small head (such as a child’s size toothbrush) for a more detailed cleaning.
Rinse your mouth with water to remove the toothpaste. Then, rinse your mouth with mouthwash that does not contain any whitening products.
Check that your braces and mouth are well brushed by confirming your braces appear shiny. Dull looking metal on your braces means your braces are still covered in food and/or bacteria.

, Another key element of good dental hygiene is flossing at least once a day. It can be tricky to floss when you have braces, as you should floss between your braces and under the wires of your braces. Make flossing easier by using a floss threader or an orthodontic flosser. You can buy these products at your local drug store or ask your orthodontist for a sample.Use waxed floss, rather than unwaxed floss, as it is easier to slide between your teeth and less likely to snag on your braces. The floss threader works by allowing you to attach the floss to a threader, making it easier to slide the floss under your braces and reach your teeth.
Always floss well along and under your gum lines. It may take practice to master flossing with braces, but be patient and take your time. Use gentle pressure while moving the floss back and forth between your teeth. Move the floss along the front and back of teeth as well. Keep in mind that if your gums bleed a little while you are flossing, this normal. It is a sign of inflammation.
If you have spaces between your teeth, use the interproximal brush to go between these spaces when flossing.

, Occasionally, a wire or band may come loose on your braces. In most cases you can carefully push the wire under the arch wire so it does not poke your mouth. Use the clean eraser of a pencil to push the wire so it slides back into the arch wire. You can also place dental wax or wet cotton on the wire or band if it continues to irritate your mouth.If the wire continues to bother you, schedule a checkup with your orthodontist. You should see your orthodontist right away if you notice any broken or damaged brackets or wires on your braces so they can be fixed properly.

, Your lips may get dry due to your irritated mouth, so keep them happy by applying lip balm regularly throughout the day. Avoid licking your lips when they are dry, as this only dries them out more.Be sure to apply lip balm before and after your orthodontist appointments, as your lips will likely chap due to keeping your mouth open for a long period of time.

Start with soft foods that are easy to chew.,
Avoid sticky, crunchy, or hard foods.,
Limit foods high in sugar and artificial flavors or colors.,
Curb your fingernail chewing or pen chewing habit.",How to Be Happy with Braces3," When you first get braces, you should avoid irritating your mouth by eating softer foods. Create a first week diet of mashed potatoes, applesauce, milkshakes, soft pasta, and soup. You can also eat soft cheeses, eggs, soft fruits like bananas, and fruit smoothies.Over time, you should be able to eat many of the foods you enjoyed previously. Be careful with hard or sticky foods, as they can damage your braces and can be difficult to get out of your braces once they get stuck.

, Biting down on crunchy or hard foods can actually break a bracket in your mouth or damage the wires on your braces. Sticky food can be hard to remove from between your teeth and your braces, even after many brushings and flossings, leading to possible infections, dental issues, and even stains which will be hard to remove after the braces are removed.Avoid hard and crunchy foods like hard candies, ice, nuts, chips, beef jerky, peanut brittle, and popcorn.
Avoid chewy foods like gum, bagels, granola, and hard rolls or pieces of bread.
You should also remove corn from the cob before eating it and remove meat from the bone.
Over time, you can introduce crunchy or hard foods into your diet, preferably hard fruits or vegetables like apples, carrots and cucumber. Cut any hard fruits or vegetables into bite sized pieces before you eat them to prevent damaging your braces.

, Though it may be tempting to maintain a diet of soft treats, like ice cream, pudding, jello, and hot chocolate, avoid over indulging on sweets. Too much sugar can lead to the development of dental issues like cavities, which can be more difficult to treat due to your braces.Cut down on known cavity causers in your diet and try to only eat treats or sweets occasionally. Always brush your teeth well after eating foods high in sugar and artificial flavors or colors so these products do not remain on your teeth for a long period of time.

, If you tend to chew your fingernails or nibble on a pen out of habit, try to cut back on these activities. Unnecessary chewing on objects can damage your braces and you may get things stuck in your braces that are very difficult to get out.These habits can also have a negative impact on your entire treatment and they may lead to pain, especially in your front teeth.

Prevent mouth breathing.,
Discourage thumb sucking.,
Correct stress-related teeth problems.",How to Avoid Getting Braces1," If your child breathes through his mouth frequently, this may lead to misalignment of his teeth that will eventually need correcting with braces. Take measures to make sure mouth breathing does not occur with frequency.


Ideally, the tongue should rest just inside the upper teeth. When a child breathes through his mouth, his tongue is pushed down and outside pressures are exerted on the teeth. This can result in teeth becoming crooked over time. The upper teeth and the upper maxilla (the jaw) make a triangular, pyramidal shape and braces may be necessary.Oftentimes, nasal problems (usually nasal polyps), allergies, and asthma may be the reasons your child is breathing through his mouth. Make an appointment with a pediatrician to figure out the physical cause behind his mouth breathing and find ways to keep his nose clear to correct the problem.Children may breath heavily through their mouths or snore during sleep. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including enlarged tonsils. If you notice your child breathes through his mouth during sleep, make a doctor's appointment to determine the cause and correct the problem.;
, Bad oral habits, like sucking the thumb or fingers, can cause a misaligned bite that will require braces. If your child sucks his thumb, fingers, or a pacifier, find ways to discourage the habit.Thumb sucking is a reflex found in young infants that fosters feelings of security. Thumb sucking often continues into toddlerhood and beyond. Usually, thumb sucking is not a concern until your child's permanent teeth come in, which should happen around the age of 5. At that point, intervention may be necessary to make sure it does not affect how a child's teeth line up.It may also affect a child's bone structure and may be hard to correct, even with braces.
Positive reinforcement helps. Try praising your child when he is not sucking his thumb with small rewards like a piece of candy or a trip to the park.Identify any triggers for thumb sucking. Children may suck their thumbs in response to stress. Reassuring your child with soothing words or a hug when he seems stressed may prevent him from sucking his thumb.If you see your child thoughtlessly sucking her thumb, gently ask her to stop. Small, gentle reminders can discourage the behavior over time. You should avoid yelling or scolding, as this may increase your child's stress and lead to further thumb sucking., Bruxism is a periodical contraction of muscles in the face while sleeping that's often accompanied by behaviors like teeth grinding. While sometimes genetic, bruxism is often caused by stress. If you believe your child may be grinding his teeth due to high anxiety, finding ways to help him cope can lessen the habit and help him avoid braces in the future.Children cope with stress in a variety of ways. While some children may be easygoing by nature, many children have trouble dealing with even small stressors and may cry, throw tantrums, or run and hide in response to pressure. Many parents falsely believe children are unaware or unbothered by stressful factors in their own lives, such as problems at work or health concerns. Try to understand even if your child does not know exactly what's going on, he can be affected by stress as much as you are.Talk to your child about stress. Help him understand the physical signs of stress, such as tightened chest, increased heartbeat, etc. Having a word and explanation for such problems can make them less scary. It's often the unknown that's most frightening to children. Help him understand stress is normal and something everyone experiences to some degree.Providing physical support, like hugs, pats on the back, and kisses, can help a child relax when stress comes on. You should also provide emotional support through open communication. Allow your child to explain to you what is causing him stress and why, and you can help by listening, understanding, and reassuring him. Remember, young children often find it difficult to explain their emotions so your child may explain stress in abstract, bodily ways. He might explain a body part, like the heart or the head, hurts.If there are major life events occurring, such as a divorce or the death of a close family member, your child may need a therapist or counselor to help him cope. Many therapists work with children and you can try asking your pediatrician for a recommendation.

Evaluate how ready the tooth is to come out.,
Encourage your child to press their tongue against the loose tooth.,
Let your children handle their own teeth.",How to Painlessly Pull Out a Loose Baby Tooth1," Baby teeth loosen gradually, and often take two or more weeks to loosen enough to be removed from your child’s mouth. Although children are often excited to lose their baby teeth, it can be painful if the tooth is not sufficiently loose. Inspect your child’s tooth, and see if it’s ready to come out. If the tooth is only connected by a small flap of gum tissue, encourage your child to loosen it further until the tooth falls out.The root of a baby tooth is slowly resorbed by the growth of the permanent tooth underneath. If this process is not complete, pulling out the tooth can cause pain and bleeding.
Unless a tooth is extremely loose (literally hanging by a thread), avoid yanking it out of your child’s mouth.Yanking a tooth can be painful for your child, and can damage their gum tissue.;
, Most kids help their teeth fall out this way, by painlessly rocking the teeth back and forth with their fingers.Encourage your child to use these tactics to work loose teeth on their own, which most kids are happy to do.


It’s also important to remind your children that this process takes time. If a tooth is too tight to fall out, let them know that it may be several days before the tooth comes out on its own.

, As parents, it can be tempting to pull your kids’ loose teeth for them. However, it’s better to let your children wiggle and loosen their own teeth themselves. Often the loose teeth will come out on their own after being incessantly handled by the child.


Rather than needlessly pulling on your child’s tooth, let them loosen it over time. Your child will be able to gauge their own pain (or lack thereof) and can tell when and if the tooth is being pulled on too hard.Have your child wash their hands first to help prevent infection from any dirt or bacteria on their hands.

Do not forcefully brush your gums.,
Use a toothbrush with soft bristles.,
Avoid scraping your gums when you floss.,
Rinse your mouth with mouthwash daily.,
Stop smoking immediately.,
Reduce stress in your daily lifestyle.,
Eat a nutritionally healthy diet.,
Be attentive to discomfort or changes in your mouth.,
Keep plaque from building up on your teeth.,
Visit your dentist regularly.",How to Prevent Bleeding Gums," While brushing your teeth is an important part of dental hygiene, your gums themselves are made of fairly delicate tissue. When you brush, be sure to avoid scrubbing your gums, as will damage the tissue and result in bleeding gums.Most people use a fast back and forth motion when brushing their teeth, which can be very harmful for your gums.


When brushing teeth in the front of your mouth, use a gentle circular motion.If you brush from the bottom of your tooth upwards, you risk damaging your gums or causing them to recede. Place the bristles on your gums and brush those gently as well.
When brushing, put gentle pressure on your teeth; the bristles should bend around the surface of your tooth, but you should not scrape your teeth on the plastic base of the toothbrush.
Brush your teeth for at least two minutes, at least twice a day. Brush once in the morning (or after your first meal) and once in the evening (or after your last meal).;
, To prevent gum damage or inflammation, select a toothbrush that has soft bristles with blunted, nylon ends. Medium or hard toothbrushes may result in swollen or bleeding gums, and can also damage your tooth enamel leading to high sensitivity problems and even cavities.Follow the same guidance if you use an electric toothbrush. Look for brush heads marked “soft,” as these will be gentler on your gum tissue.
If your toothbrush bristles become worn or frayed (leaning out to the sides of the plastic base) within two or three months, you’re brushing too hard. Your toothbrush should last from 3-4 months., Flossing daily is an important part of dental hygiene, as it will remove food and plaque from areas that a toothbrush cannot reach. When you floss, be gentle on your gums: do not mash the floss hard between your teeth, but curve the floss around each tooth, and carefully slide it up and down. Avoid excessive contact between the floss and your gums and don't rush. Check in the mirror to see if you are doing it properly until you get used to flossing.If you haven’t flossed in a while, your gums may bleed lightly the first few times you floss. This is normal, and a sign that your gums are tender from the lack of flossing. However, after a few days of regular flossing, your gums will toughen up and stop bleeding.

, Regular mouthwash use will keep your teeth and gums clean and prevent the buildup of plaque, and will also kill the bacteria that buildup to cause gum disease.Because mouthwash that contains rubbing alcohol can dry out your gums and actually increase their likelihood of bleeding, look for mouthwashes that don’t contain alcohol and that contain an antibacterial ingredient called chlorhexidine.Alternately, rinse your mouth with salt water or hydrogen peroxide. These do not contain alcohol, but will still clean your gums and teeth, eliminating any debris or plaque that can cause inflammation of the gums and pain.

, Even if you have great dental hygiene, smoking puts you at risk for gum disease and can cause your gums to bleed regularly. Unhealthy chemicals from the tobacco smoke can leave toxins on your gums and teeth, and these toxins are hard to remove through brushing and flossing.Given time, toxins and irritants can cause frequent gum bleeding. Nicotine also causes the blood vessels to contract, which weakens the antibacterial barrier between your teeth and gums.


Chewing tobacco can also have disastrous results for your gums and teeth, so avoid this habit as well.
To quit smoking, slowly wean yourself off of cigarettes using nicotine patches or gum.
Also, try to replace smoking with another, healthier habit—if you want a cigarette, eat a light snack (such as a carrot stick) instead.

, A high-stress lifestyle can have a negative effect on the health of your gums, as stress will increase inflammation throughout your body, including your gum tissue, and stress can also raise your blood sugar, which can also lead to diabetes.This inflamed tissue is likely to bleed. Stress also weakens the body’s immune system. This can increase your risk of gingivitis. To decrease stress in your daily life:Spend less time watching television and using your phone in the morning and evening.
Spend time outdoors daily, even if it’s just a short walk around the block.
If you work in an office, avoid eating lunch at your desk. Get outside and move around.

, Eating well will keep your gums healthy and strong. Remember to eat at least one serving of fruits or vegetables daily.Also, eat foods with plenty of vitamin C, as this can directly affect the health of your gums. Lack of vitamin C causes bleeding, swollen gums, and periodontitis leading also to less protection against bacteria. Vitamin C is found in foods including:


Leafy greens and bell peppers.
Citrus fruits and berries.
Vegetables like broccoli and tomatoes.

, Since there is no pain associated with gum disease, you’ll need to track other symptoms.Bleeding gums are the primary symptom of gum disease, and nearly always accompany both gingivitis and periodontitis. Visit your dentist promptly if you notice frequently bleeding gums or any of the following symptoms:


Frequent bad breath or a bad taste in the mouth.
Shifting or loose teeth—especially if they move or fit together differently in your mouth.
Empty pockets forming between your teeth and gums that may leak pus.

, Bleeding gums and gum disease are most frequently caused by long-term plaque buildup along the base of your teeth and gum-line.This can be prevented by correct dental hygiene habits (brushing and flossing). Gum disease is a progressive illness; although it starts out mildly, it can quickly become severe. After the bone is affected, there are different stages of evolution in which periodontitis can be very aggressive and lead to complete loss of your teeth if not treated properly.


Gingivitis is the early stage of gum disease. Gingivitis is relatively mild, and at this point, the gum disease can still be reversed through gum-disease treatment.Once gum disease worsens, it moves past gingivitis and becomes periodontitis, which seriously weakens your gums and jaw bones. Periodontitis cannot be reversed, and often leads to tooth loss., Your dentist will be able to examine your gum tissue and let you know if you are experiencing gum disease. Gum disease itself is not painful, so diagnoses may be unexpected. For this reason, it’s important to schedule an appointment with your dentist twice a year, roughly every 6 months.In addition to offering potential diagnoses, your dentist will also thoroughly clean your teeth, including removing the plaque from hard-to-reach areas around and beneath your gums.
Gum disease is relatively common—more than 75% of adult Americans over the age of 35 suffer from gingivitis."

Try a retainer.,
Ask about clear aligners.,
Try veneers.,
Use accelerated orthodontics.",How to Avoid Getting Braces2," For a variety of reasons, wearing braces may be difficult for you. In this case, you may want to look into alternatives. A retainer, a removable device used to correct crooked teeth, may be an option.


Typically, retainers are used after braces are removed to correct crooked teeth. However, if you only need a small amount of correction, ask your dentist or orthodontist about the possibility of a retainer instead of braces.Retainers are typically inexpensive and sometimes only need to be worn during certain parts of the day; you typically wear them for long periods of time, such as while you sleep. Your dentist might recommend a special toothpaste or mouthwash to clean and rinse your retainer., Clear aligners, such as invisalign, are clear and removable braces that need to be worn for certain intervals. They are a popular alternative to braces for adults.Clear aligners can correct major structural issues and also minor crookedness. If you need a tooth gap corrected, aligners are a good option as correction is minimal.For your first pair, you'll have to wear them 20 hours a day for two weeks. After this, you'll be fitted with a different pair. Your dentist will tell you how long you need to wear your new pair determined on the problem you're correcting., Veneers are primarily used to treat gaps between teeth, cracks, chips, or even severe discoloration. They are porcelain caps inserted into your teeth, onto the ""vestibular surface,"" or the area of your teeth that is visible when you smile, to correct damages and imperfections.Your dentist will remove a thin layer of tooth enamel and then fix veneers to your teeth.Veneers are often considered cosmetic rather than medical, so your insurance may not cover them., There are ways to fast track orthodontic treatment that can minimize the time you have to wear corrective devices like braces.


Most fast-tracking treatments use a system called micro-osteoperforation that weakens your bones to the point your teeth move under pressure. This allows braces and other devices that to remold your teeth to work faster.This can easily be used with other braces alternatives, such as retainers and clear aligners. The treatment, however, can be quite expensive and may not be covered by insurance."

Brush your teeth twice daily.,
Floss.,
Understand braces may be inevitable.",How to Avoid Getting Braces3," Caring for your teeth, before or after remodeling treatments, is important. You want to make sure you avoid needing further treatment after braces, aligners, or retainers are removed. You should brush your in the morning and before bed.


Use a soft bristle brush and gently brush your teeth on all sides, using circular motions. Use a fluoride toothpaste. In addition to your teeth, brush along the gum line and on your tongue.If you have arthritis or conditions that limit motion in your hands, try a battery operated toothbrush., You also need to floss your teeth each day with dental floss. This will remove plaque between the teeth that cannot be otherwise removed. Flossing also prevents gingivitis and gum disease. Floss until you reach the gums, but do not dig into your gums with floss until they bleed or become sore., While you might not like the prospect of getting braces, sometimes alternatives can be too expensive or will not work for you given the level of correction needed. Crooked teeth are also dependent on genetic factors, so even if you brush and floss regularly braces may still be necessary.

Apply an oral analgesic to the gums surrounding the tooth.,
Gently wiggle the tooth to loosen it.,
Pull the tooth firmly until it comes out.",How to Painlessly Pull Out a Loose Baby Tooth2," The analgesic will take 2–3 minutes to numb the gums. While you wait, reassure your child that the process of removing the loose tooth will be painless.If your child is apprehensive about the pain, you can also give them a child-sized dosage of an over-the-counter painkiller, such as ibuprofen.


You can purchase oral analgesic or ibuprofen at your local drugstore or any pharmacy. Analgesics do not require a prescription.Consult a pediatric dentist before doing this so you can make sure you give the right dosage.

, Rather than yanking on the tooth, lightly wiggle it back and forth, and left and right, if possible, to help loosen more fibers. The tooth should be very loose at this point—if the tooth is still firmly attached to the gum, it is not ready to be pulled yet. Once the tooth has been loosened, you can begin to gently pull it out of your child’s gum.Before putting your hands in your child’s mouth, first put on a pair of latex gloves, or use a clean cotton cloth to touch the tooth.

, A tooth should be very loose before you attempt to pull it.Even so, avoid yanking or tugging on the tooth, as these motions are more likely to cause your child pain and tear their gums. Exert a steady, gentle pressure on the tooth, or even twist it slightly until the last fibers connecting the tooth to the gum snap.


After you remove the tooth, clean it off with a small piece of gauze. You can also press some gauze onto the spot where the tooth was in your child's mouth to stop any bleeding.
Once the tooth is clean, show it to your child. Children are often curious about the teeth that have come out of their mouth. Let them hold the tooth and put it under the pillow for the tooth fairy.

Give your child hard or chewy foods to eat.,
Ask your child to floss daily.,
See a dentist if the tooth refuses to come out.",How to Painlessly Pull Out a Loose Baby Tooth3," The firmness of hard foods will either cause the tooth to get stuck in the food and pulled from your child’s gums, or else just dislodge the loose tooth.Only do this when the tooth is very loose; otherwise it may cause your child unnecessary pain and swelling which may require a visit to the dentist. Examples of hard foods that can knock the tooth out include:


Crunchy carrots.
Crispy apples or peaches.
Caramel or gum to chew.

, Of course, you child should already be flossing daily, but remind them that flossing is important. Often the fibers of the floss will catch in or under the loose tooth and pull it painlessly from your child’s mouth.Only attempt this when the tooth is already very loose. If you child attempts to use floss to remove a tooth that is not ready to fall out, the process will be painful and your child could end up tearing their gums.

, If your child has a persistently loose tooth that does not come out on its own, or is uncommonly painful for the child, take him or her to the dentist.A dentist can assess if the tooth is healthy, or if it’s falling out prematurely, perhaps due to a cavity or other infection.


A pediatric dentist will also be able to tell you if your child’s permanent adult teeth are coming in correctly.

Stop any bleeding by pressing clean gauze to the wound.,
Check the child’s gums for baby tooth fragments.,
Keep an eye on the wound to prevent infection.",How to Painlessly Pull Out a Loose Baby Tooth4," Once the tooth has been removed from your child’s gums, it may leave behind a few spots of blood. This is common, and no reason that you or your child should be alarmed. To clean the blood, press gauze or a clean cotton cloth to your child’s gums, or explain to them how to bite on it for one minute without talking or looking at it and tell them they will get a reward.If your child is uncomfortable with blood, distract them by focusing on how grown-up it is that your child his or her first baby tooth.
If you have told your child about the tooth fairy, explain that, if your child leaves the tooth under the pillow, the tooth fairy will pay a visit and leave a dollar under the pillow., Baby teeth generally come out in one piece, and do not leave broken fragments behind. However, if the tooth was fractured or broken by the process of removal, there may be bone fragments left behind in your child’s gums.Attempting to remove tooth fragments yourself could prove painful for the child, especially if the fragments are still embedded in the gum.
If tooth fragments are present, make an appointment with your child’s dentist to have them removed as soon as possible.

, Removing a tooth from your child’s mouth will leave an open wound in their gums hat will heal fast if it's not too deep. Since the mouth naturally contains bacteria, the small wound will be at risk of infection. Although infection is unlikely, take a look in your child’s mouth every day for a week or two to make sure an infection is not developing from where the tooth was removed.Make sure that the tear in the child’s gum heals completely, or that an adult tooth has begun to poke through within a week of pulling the baby tooth.
If the gum shows signs of infection, take your child to see a dentist as soon as possible.

Eat soft foods for the first few days.,
Eat cold or frozen foods like ice cream.,
Avoid acidic drinks and foods.,
Avoid hard or sticky foods.",How to Alleviate Orthodontic Brace Pain1," The bulk of orthodontic brace pain will happen in the first 24 to 72 hours after braces are put on your teeth. During the first few days, eat very soft foods that don’t require much chewing until you are more accustomed to eating with braces. Foods like soups, applesauce and mashed potatoes are good choices.;
, Ice cream will give your mouth relief by offering numbing comfort. You can also suck on ice cubes. Put an ice cube in your mouth next to the area that is experiencing the most discomfort. The frozen cube will help numb your mouth and reduce any inflammation that may be occurring.A lot of braces are heat-reactive, which means eating hot foods causes the braces to tighten, causing you pain.


Alternately, you can freeze a baby teething ring and chew or rest it in your mouth. This will also provide some relief.
Do not chew the ice or ice cubes; hard foods can damage brackets and weaken their hold on your teeth.
You could also try drinking icy cold water.

, Acidic foods and drinks that contain citrus, for example, can aggravate mouth sores or other discomfort in your mouth. Avoid these to eliminate the possibility of further irritating your mouth.

, Do not eat certain kinds of foods so that your braces do not break, causing some irritation and additional cost. Hard and sticky foods, such as chips, jerky, nuts and taffy, can be damaging to your braces.Do not chew on other hard objects, such as pens, pencils or ice cubes.

They will explain the procedure to you and help you handle your anxiety.
They can also suggest ways to reduce your nervousness.;
, This will provide a distraction for you and it can help to reduce your anxiety. If you are more relaxed, you are less likely to be in a lot of pain.
Breathe in slowly through your nose.
Pause before exhaling slowly.
Keep breathing slowly and steadily in a rhythm. Concentrate on this and you will be distracted from what the dentist is doing.

, Bring an iPod, phone, or music player with you and listen to music or a podcast. Choose music that is calming, rather than something jarring and energetic.
Alternatively, listen to an audiobook.
Bring earbuds so other patients can't hear your music.
Make a playlist ahead of time so you have enough music to last through your appointment.
Some dentists or orthodontists may have televisions for you to watch during the procedure or music playing in the background to distract you.
Some dentists' offices now have 3D virtual reality glasses, which you can wear to distract and entertain yourself during your entire procedure.

, Caffeine can make you more nervous and jittery. It can also keep your dental anesthetic from working as well, so it might be more difficult for your gum and teeth to become numb.


Drinks that contain caffeine include coffee, tea, sodas, and energy drinks.
Do drink plenty of water before your appointment.
Make sure to avoid any sugary drinks or foods before your appointment too.

Take an over-the-counter pain reliever.,
Use a topical anesthetic to numb the pain.,
Rinse your mouth with salt water.,
Rinse your mouth with diluted hydrogen peroxide.,
Apply orthodontic wax to your mouth.,
Wear the rubber bands that came with your braces.",How to Alleviate Orthodontic Brace Pain2," Pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) can offer some relief from the discomfort of braces. Take a dose of acetaminophen (usually two tablets) every four hours.


Follow the instructions on the label to ensure proper dosage.You can also take ibuprofen (Advil) instead of Tylenol, although some dentists and orthodontists discourage ibuprofen because it can slow down the process of your teeth moving. At the very least, do not take both kinds of medication – choose one!

, There are a number of over-the-counter medications available that can numb mouth discomfort that you are experiencing. These are typically anesthetic, meaning that they numb the pain for a few hours, and they come in mouthwashes, rinses and gels. Products such as Orajel and Colgate Orabase can provide some relief.


Follow the instructions on the package for proper application. Some people experience allergies when using these products, so you should be sure to consult the instructions before proceeding.

, Salt water will soothe your mouth and treat any sores that may have developed because of the braces rubbing against your cheeks. To make a salt water rinse, put a teaspoon of table salt into a glass of warm water. Stir to dissolve all of the salt. Put a mouthful of this mixture into your mouth and gently swish it around for about one minute. Spit it out in the sink.Repeat several times a day, particularly in the first few days and whenever you are feeling more pain than normal.

, Hydrogen peroxide is an antiseptic and can reduce inflammation that irritates your mouth. Mix one part water with one part 3% hydrogen peroxide in a glass. Put a mouthful of this mixture in your mouth and gently swish it around for about one minute. Spit it out in the sink. Repeat a few times a day.


There are hydrogen peroxide-based products available at grocery and drug stores that are geared toward treating mouth sores and offering relief, such as Colgate Peroxyl Mouthwash.
The taste of hydrogen peroxide might be off-putting to some people, as is the foam that will inevitably generate from swishing it in your mouth.

, Orthodontic or dental wax is used as a barrier between your braces and the inside of your mouth. It is readily available at drug stores; your orthodontist may have given you some when you got your braces.


To apply the wax, break off a small piece of wax and roll it into a little ball about the size of a pea. This will also warm up the wax and make it easier to apply. Use a piece of tissue to dry the area of your braces where you would like to apply the wax, and press it directly onto the wire or bracket. Repeat as often as necessary.

, These mini rubber bands are hooked around your braces, helping to align your braces and jaw in a certain way. They can help in reducing the amount of time needed to straighten your teeth, so wearing them is definitely to your benefit. Your orthodontist will likely instruct you to wear them as much as possible except when eating or brushing, and to replace them frequently.


These rubber bands can often cause discomfort, especially in the first few days after you got your braces. But they can cause more discomfort if you are not used to wearing them. If you only wear them a couple of hours per day or a few times a week, you will experience more discomfort than if you wear them all the time.

If, however, you are still experiencing intolerable pain after a few weeks, you may want to visit your orthodontist to check in and ask questions.

, If the pain from your braces is too intense, it is possible that they are too tight. Having tighter braces does not necessarily mean that they will work better or that your teeth will straighten faster.Ask your orthodontist’s opinion about the tightness of the braces.

, Sometimes, there are short ends of wires on the braces that will protrude and rub against the inside of your cheek. These can be extremely uncomfortable and cause mouth sores. If you have these, ask your orthodontist to snip the ends off of these wires, and you should feel immediate relief.

, Your orthodontist might be able to prescribe a stronger dose of ibuprofen for you if regular over-the-counter medications don’t seem to be working.

Try to eat less highly acidic foods.,
Avoid spicy foods.,
Try to stay away from foods that are rich in fat.,
Drink less carbonated drinks.,
Cut back on your consumption of alcohol.,
Cut caffeinated beverages out of your diet.",How to Prevent Heartburn1," There are certain foods that have a higher concentration of acid than other foods. When you eat too many acidic foods, the acid in your stomach can splash up into your esophagus, causing a burning pain. If you experience heartburn frequently, or are hoping to prevent yourself from ever experiencing it, try to limit the amount of acidic foods that you consume. While you do not have to cut these foods out of your diet entirely, you should try to limit your intake of them.


Dairy products: Milk, cottage cheese, milk shakes, and sour cream.
Fruits: Oranges, lemons, cranberries, grapefruits, and tomatoes.
Meat products: ground beef, pork meat, chicken nuggets and Buffalo wings.;
, Spicy foods can cause your stomach to become upset. These spicy foods contain capsaicin, which can trigger heartburn. Because of this, keep the amount of spicy foods you eat to a minimum.Spicy foods include:


Peppers, chili, and hot sauce.

, Fat can be very challenging for your stomach to digest. Because of this, your stomach is forced to produce more acid in order to break fatty foods down. In addition to this, fatty foods can occupy a larger space in your stomach, which in turn can force the acid into your stomach up and into your esophagus, leading to heartburn.Examples of fatty foods are pork meat, butter, tallow, suet, lard, cheese, nuts and seeds, chocolates, processed meats, fried snacks and food, high fat dairy products, and others.

, When you drink carbonated beverages, like soda, you are swallowing both water and air. These air bubbles reach your stomach, burst, and expand. This causes an increased pressure in your stomach that can trigger heartburn.In addition to this increased pressure, most carbonated drinks are acidic.

, Avoid alcoholic drinks. While not all alcoholic drinks are acidic, they do have a tendency to relax the esophageal sphincter, which is the valve that separates your stomach (and your stomach acid) from your esophagus. Because of this, when you drink alcohol, the acid in your stomach is more likely to travel up into your esophagus and cause heartburn.In particular, try to avoid drinking alcohol when you are going to consume acidic or heartburn-causing food.

, Like alcohol, caffeine can also relax your esophageal sphincter, which in turn makes it more likely that your stomach acid will be regurgitated back up into your throat. Beverages that contain caffeine include:


Coffee.
Black tea.
Energy drinks.

Understand what is happening inside your body when you eat.,
Understand that flatulence is the gas that is generated when the solid waste is separated in the large intestine.",How to Prevent Flatulence1," Undigested once food gets sent to the large intestine, where gas enzymes break it down and produce flatulence. The process is described in depth below:


First, you place food in your mouth where saliva and chewing break down the food into small, manageable pieces. The food travels from your mouth through your esophagus. The esophagus does little to break down food, merely serving as a ""pusher"" moving the food down to your stomach.
Next, your stomach breaks the food down into a liquid mess. What it can break down is usually absorbed through the stomach walls such as sugars and energy.
Third, the food travels into your small intestine where it is further broken down and the rest of chemicals and compounds are absorbed into your bloodstream.
Finally, whatever is left over — at this point, waste — moves into your large intestine and is essentially sorted into liquid and solid waste, ready to be expelled from the body.;
, Enzymes break down the food on a molecular level, creating gas as a by-product. Over time, this gas will build up and must be expelled as it will not absorb into the body."
"
Eat small, frequent meals.,
Try to avoid eating heavy or rich meals two to three hours before you go to bed.,
Walk or sit for 30 to 45 minutes after eating before you lie down.,
Quit Smoking.,
Try to lose some weight if you are overweight.,
Avoid tight clothes and belts that constrict your waist.,
Keep a heartburn diary.",How to Prevent Heartburn2," When you eat a large meal, you put pressure on your stomach that could lead to heartburn. This is because having a lot of food in your stomach makes your stomach produce more acid. To avoid this, eat small, frequent meals throughout the day, rather than three large meals.


Eating small meals throughout the day can help to keep your stomach working efficiently without the production of extra acid. It also makes it less likely that gastric backflow will occur because your stomach will not contain us much contents after each meal.

, Laying down puts your stomach at almost the same level as your esophagus. When you eat too much, or if the food your do eat is too rich, the food may press down on your esophageal sphincter with the aid of gravity. This can cause the contents of your stomach, as well as you stomach acid, to flow back up into your esophagus.


If you must lie down within two to three hours after you have eaten, prop yourself up so that your upper body is at a 45 to 90 degree angle with the lower half of your body. You can prop yourself up like this with pillows. Propping yourself up will decrease the chances of the contents of your stomach flowing back up into your esophagus.

, When you get a little bit of exercise after a big meal, you can help your body to digest the food you have eaten more efficiently.

, Smoking is a trigger of heartburn. Stopping smoking can help you to prevent heartburn, while also making your healthier in general. The ways that cigarettes increase your chances of getting heartburn include:


Cigarette smoking decreases your production of saliva. Saliva is basic, which means that it can neutralize acidic substances. Saliva acts as a defense against the acidity of your stomach, but if you do not have any saliva, it cannot protect you.
Cigarette smoking also increases the production of acid in the stomach.
Cigarette smoking has a relaxing effect on the esophageal sphincter.
Cigarette smokers have slower gastric motility. This leads to an inefficient emptying of the stomach.

, Being overweight can increase the pressure placed on your abdomen and stomach. This happens because fat is stored around your belly and chest, which causes the stomach to become squeeze. This squeezing action not only decreases the space within the stomach, but it also increases the pressure put on the stomach. The increased pressure will force some gastric content to move back up into your esophagus.


In order to lose weight, you will have to create a healthy eating plan for yourself.
You should also try to exercise regularly.

, Anything that puts pressure on your stomach can act as a catalyst for heartburn. Because of this, you should try to wear loose-fitting clothes and keep your belt wearing to a minimum. Clothes that can lead to heartburn include:


Slenderizing undergarments.
Tight-fitting belts.
Tight pants.

, When and if you do experience heartburn, write down everything you ate that day. Doing this may help you to determine the foods that are irritating your stomach. This diary can also help you to determine what sort of lifestyle changes you need to make.


For example, if you ate a stomach-friendly salad but were wearing slimming tights and experienced heartburn, writing this down may help you to realize that you should probably stop wearing tights.

Try taking Milk of Magnesia.,
Begin taking Maalox concentrate.,
Try other stomach-soothing medications.",How to Prevent Heartburn3," Milk of Magnesia can combat acidity in your stomach because it has a very basic pH. Magnesium is a mineral that helps with the function of your body’s muscles and nerves. It can also help to increase the amount of water or basic fluid in your stomach, thereby diluting your gastric acid.


Try taking 5 to 15 milliliters (0.17 to 0.51  fl oz) of Milk of Magnesia. You can take this supplemental medication one to four times a day, depending on the intensity of your gastric acid.You can also take Milk of Magnesia in tablet form.

, Maalox is an antacid, which means that it can help to suppress the acidity of your stomach. The dosage for Maalox is generally 300 to 800 mg taken by mouth. You can divide this dosage up so that you take Maalox two to four times a day.However, do not take more than 800 mg within a 24 hour period.

, You can also try taking several other over-the-counter antacids. These medications work to decrease the amount of acid your stomach produces, thereby helping to prevent heartburn symptoms. Some examples of these over-the-counter drugs include:


Ranitidine (Zantac). This is available in 150 mg doses to be taken every 12 hours.
Cimetidine (Tagamet). This is available in 200 mg doses to be taken every 12 hours, 30 minutes before eating.
Famotidine (Pepcid). This is available in 10 to 20 mg doses to be taken every 12 hours, 15 to 60 minutes before eating.

Learn to avoid classes of foods that create excessive amounts of gas in your system.,
On occasion, stay away from other gas-producing foods.,
As a rule, be cautious of carbs.,
Learn to replace gas-causing foods with ones that aren't gas causing:


Probiotics: This type of food includes a special acid that is more easily digested and breaks down simply.,
Take digestive enzyme supplements if adjusting your food intake doesn't help or isn't doable.,
Chew slowly and don't chew gum.,
Stop smoking.",How to Prevent Flatulence2," These include (but are certainly not limited to):


Starches: potatoes, wheat, corn, and most noodles. Rice is the only exception in this area.
Beans: In this case, jokes about beans causing excess gas is true. It has been determined that soaking beans for several hours before cooking can reduce this effect, but such a process also rids the beans of many nutrients.
Carbonated beverages: Most carbonated beverages — drinks that have carbon dioxide forced into the liquid to make it fizzy — cause gas because you are actually consuming gas in small bubbles. Just drinking one glass of a carbonated beverage isn't usually enough to cause major problems, but consuming large quantities of carbonated drinks can cause excessive gas.

, In addition to starches, legumes, and carbonated beverages, the following foods might also be avoided in order to prevent gas, although wholesale rejection of these foods is not advised, because they can be extremely healthy:


Vegetables including artichokes, asparagus, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, cucumbers, green peppers, onions, peas, and radishes
Fruits like apricots, bananas, melons, peaches, pears, prunes, and raw apples
Eggs
Milk and other dairy products, like yogurt
Fried foods

, Some carbs are bad for you (simple) and others are good (complex). But all carbs tend to produce flatulence, because carbs ferment easier than, say, proteins. If you're going to eat carbs, stick with unprocessed carbs.Our bodies prefer unprocessed carbs, which translates to less flatulence.

, Examples of probiotics include soy sauce, yogurt, and pickles (and other pickled vegetables).
Fermented foods: This has marginal effects, and greatly reduces the nutritional values of certain food. Beans, for example, can be fermented with alcohol, but their nutritional value is lowered.

, Popular brands include Activa (prescription) or Beano (over-the-counter).

, If you're famished of you're a fast eater, tone it down a little bit: people who chew slowly produce less gas because they're not swallowing as much air. The same thing goes for gum. The act of chewing stimulates the digestive enzymes, and air that gets caught in your stomach has to go out one of two ways; if it doesn't get burped up, it has to come out the other way.

, Air gets sucked into the body, along with smoke, and swallowed.If you needed another reason to finally quit, here's a compelling one.

Avoid saturated fats.,
Include unsaturated fats in your diet.,
Get plenty of fiber in your diet.,
Drink plenty of water.",How to Prevent Gallstones Naturally1," Gallstones are composed of about 80% cholesterol. A saturation of cholesterol in the bile leads to solidification, which causes gallstones.A diet high in saturated fats is associated with higher cholesterol levels. Therefore, you should cut saturated fats out of your diet to reduce your chances of forming gallstones. Some foods you should keep to a minimum are:Red meats like beef
Sausages and bacon
Whole-fat dairy products
Pizza
Butter and lard
Fried foods;
, Although saturated fats contribute to the formation of gallstones, poly- and monounsaturated fats help prevent them. These are usually known as ""good fats.""Good fats help keep the gallbladder empty, which reduces the formation of gallstones in bile. Include foods high in good fats in your diet to help prevent gallstones.Olive oil. This is a source of good fats, and helps reduce cholesterol. Some studies indicate that regular consumption of olive oil- about 2 tablespoons daily- reduces the risk of gallstones.
Avocado. Not only is avocado a great source of good fats, but it also helps your body absorb other nutrients more effectively.
Seeds. Pumpkin, sunflower, and sesame seeds especially help lower cholesterol.
Nuts. Nuts such as walnuts deliver beneficial fats to your body, and can also help lower cholesterol.Fatty fish. Fatty cold-water fish such as salmon, tuna, and mackerel contain high levels of polyunsaturated fats and omega-3 fatty acids, which promote overall health.

, Studies show that people with high-fiber diets are at less risk of developing gallstones. Fiber is also beneficial for your overall digestive health because it keeps food and waste flowing smoothly through the GI tract. Include the following foods in your diet for a boost to your digestive health.Fresh fruits. Leave the skin on all the fruit you eat, as this will give you the highest amount of fiber. Berries with seeds (raspberries, blackberries, strawberries) are especially high in fiber.
Vegetables. Leafy and crunchy vegetables usually offer the highest amount of fiber. For potatoes, leave the skin on to get the most fiber.
Whole grains. White or ""enriched"" products have been bleached and lack many of the nutrients found in whole grain products. Switch to whole-grain bread, pasta, cereal, and oatmeal to easily increase your fiber intake. Barley, steel-cut oats, and whole wheat pastas are good choices. In addition to containing fiber, whole grain products help reduce your body's cholesterol level.
Beans. You can easily incorporate beans into soups and salads to get a high dose of fiber. Split peas, lentils, and black beans are very high in fiber.
Brown rice. Like white bread, white rice doesn't offer many nutrients. Convert to brown rice to add more fiber to your diet.
Seeds and nuts. In addition to being sources of ""good fats,"" sunflower seeds, almonds, pistachios, and pecans are good sources of fiber.

, Water is an essential nutrient that hydrates your body and helps flush out toxins in your system. There are various recommendations for daily fluid intake, but the 8 eight-ounce glasses rule remains popular. Your fluid intake should be enough to keep your urine light yellow or clear."

Look at a color wheel.,
Pick meaningful colors.,
Pick colors that work well with your skin.,
Pair your braces with your outfits.,
Eliminate the “ugly” colors.,
Consider darker colors.,
Notify your orthodontist of your choice.,
Practice regular upkeep.,
Consider changing the color.,
Ask about Invisalign.,
Select ceramic braces.,
Select clear braces.,
Avoid white braces.,
Rule out gold or yellow.",How to Choose the Color of Your Braces," Ask your orthodontist, or whoever is handling your braces, if they have a color wheel. A color wheel is a list of colors that you can use for braces. Do this before you get the braces so that you won't have to choose the colors on the spot.Study the shades on the color wheel. Keep in mind that the colors will look a bit lighter on your braces.
Look at a color wheel online if you get a chance. Type in ""braces color wheel"" in a search engine and look for an interactive color wheel that lets you put the colors onto a picture of a mouth with braces. Experiment with different colors you might want to wear. Keep in mind that the colors you find online might not be offered by your orthodontist.;
, You can pair colors together, so you could consider using your braces to make a statement of some sort. Consider different combinations of colors, such as: Your national colors. Red, white, and blue for America; red, white, and green for Mexico, etc.
Your school colors.
Your favorite sports team's colors.
Holiday colors. Red and green for Christmas; black and orange for Halloween, etc.
Colors of the rainbow (not always available).
Your favorite color(s).

, Consider colors that work well with your natural skin type and/or hair. Your skin type and hair color will have a big impact on the way your braces look. Choose colors that will work well with you, not colors that will clash with your hair or your skin type. Darker skin tones and hair colors might look good in gold, dark blue, turquoise, orange, anise green, pastel blue, fuchsia, pink, or violet, although colors may depend on the person.Lighter skin tones and hair colors might look good in petrol blue, vermilion, bronze, caramel, salmon, green khaki, raspberry, bluish red, plum, blue-green, and royal blue, although colors may depend on the person., Consider colors that would work well with clothes you often wear. If your wardrobe features a lot of primary colors, getting braces in another primary color might be a good idea. If your clothes feature a lot of neon colors, getting braces in a neutral color (clear braces, for example) might be a good idea. Don't be afraid to think ahead! , Rule out unsatisfying colors, strange colors, or your least favorite colors. Braces in bands that are black can look like little pieces of food stuck in your teeth. White seems like it would be a great choice, but, in fact, makes teeth look more yellow. , Darker colors, such as dark purple and navy blue, make your teeth look whiter. So it may be wise to choose dark colors to offset from the natural color of your teeth., Wait for your orthodontist to finish applying your braces then admire your braces in a mirror. Don’t worry if you don’t love the color pattern immediately. It may grow on you. If it doesn’t, you can change colors the next time you see your orthodontist., The color of your braces really doesn’t matter if you don’t keep them clean. Keep your braces looking great by practicing good oral hygiene. Oral hygiene means taking care of your mouth, gums, and teeth. Brush your teeth after each meal. If you're at school, consider bringing a small portable toothbrush with you to brush after snack and lunch. Try to hit all the teeth in your mouth; consider using a timer to time yourself so that you end up brushing for long enough. Floss your teeth at least once a day. Flossing gets between the teeth where the toothbrush won't reach, promoting healthier gums. Flossing with braces, however, can be a real pain. Use a floss threader to get the floss in between the gums, and then work in between each pair of teeth. Use mouthwash at least once a day. Mouthwash will help kill all the harmful bacteria that live in your mouth and contribute to tooth decay. Swishing mouthwash is easy, quick, and gives you great breath. , Change the color(s) of your bands every time you get your braces tightened. If you end up not liking the colors you chose, don't fret. You can change the color of your braces every time you have an appointment to get them tightened. Most orthodontists schedule appointments like this every 6 to 8 weeks., Depending on the problem your braces are intended to fix, you may be able to choose Invisalign braces. These are clear trays that fit over your teeth, making it appear as if you are not wearing braces at all. If your goal is to eliminate the appearance of your braces, these are the ideal choice., Ceramic braces work the same way as metal braces, but are designed to blend naturally with the teeth, using a tooth colored ceramic and clear rubber bands. Next to Invisalign braces, which may not be possible for you, these are the next best option for keeping a low profile., Metal braces can be paired with clear rubber bands, minimizing the appearance of the braces against your teeth. If your goal is to minimize the appearance of your braces, you may choose no color at all rather than trying to select a creative or personalized color scheme., White might seem like the obvious choice, since your teeth are white. However, white braces not only make your teeth look yellow; they also get dirty fast. Especially if you drink dark drinks, like cola or coffee, white colors could change quickly to a less satisfying off-white., Yellow and gold braces can intensify the natural yellow color of teeth. So try to avoid yellow or gold unless your teeth are vibrantly white."

Exercise regularly.,
Maintain a healthy weight.,
Avoid crash-dieting.,
Eat regularly.",How to Prevent Gallstones Naturally2," Exercise, especially endurance-based exercises, can reduce your risk of forming gallstones by helping you maintain a healthy weight, reducing one of the risk factors for gallstones. , Studies show that being overweight puts you at a greater risk for gallstones. Talk with your doctor and find out what your ideal weight would be. Through proper diet and exercise, aim to stay as close to this ideal as possible., Although maintaining a healthy weight is important for reducing your risk of gallstones, do not lose weight too quickly. Crash diets, which are characterized by consuming drastically reduced calories, and weight loss surgeries actually increase your risk of gallstones -- the risk of gallstones in crash-dieters is 40% to 60%. If you're trying to lose weight, do so gradually. Aim to lose 1-2 pounds a week. This is more beneficial for your overall health., Skipping meals results in sporadic bile production, which can increase your chances of forming a gallstone. It is healthier to eat at regular intervals and avoid skipping meals. Stick to your usual meal schedule as closely as possible to reduce your risk of gallstones."

Learn the symptoms.,
Visit the doctor and get tested.,
Discuss your options with your doctor.",How to Prevent Gallstones Naturally3," Even with good diet and lifestyle, it is possible for a gallstone to form. If this happens, you'll want to know what signs to look out for. Although not all gallstones show symptoms and some are harmless, there are a few signs to know. If you experience the following symptoms, you should visit the doctor for an evaluation.Sudden and rapidly intensifying pain in the upper right portion of your abdomen. This would usually be right under where the ribs end, which is where the gallbladder is located.
Pain may also be in the center of the abdomen, under the breastbone, or in the back between the shoulder blades.
Nausea and vomiting.
Intestinal discomfort like bloating, gas, and indigestion.
Some more serious symptoms include jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), intense pain, and a high fever. If you experience these symptoms, seek medical attention right away.

, If you are showing symptoms of a gallstone, make an appointment with your doctor. If your doctor examines you and suspects you may have gallstones, there are a number of tests she may perform to confirm her suspicions. Most often these tests consist of a blood test, ultrasound, CAT scan, and/or an endoscopy.If these tests confirm that you have gallstones, she will recommend the most effective course of treatment for you.

, If your doctor finds that you have gallstones, there are three primary treatments she will suggest.Watchful waiting. It is estimated that between one third and one half of people who experience gallstones will never have another problem with them. Your doctor will probably initially take a ""wait and see"" approach and follow up with you in a few weeks. In all likelihood, the stone will dislodge itself and you won't need any further medical attention. If not, your doctor will take more active steps to treat your gallstone.
Non-surgical treatments. There are a variety of non-invasive treatments your doctor may recommend to remove your gallstones. They include dissolving the stones with bile salt or the drug Actigall, and using high-frequency sound waves to break up stones. Keep in mind that these treatments won't prevent future gallstones, and you may experience further problems in the future.
Gallbladder removal. If gallstones are a persistent problem, your doctor may suggest you undergo surgery to remove your gallbladder. This is a common surgery, and it is estimated that nearly 750,000 Americans have their gallbladders removed annually. You can live a healthy life without your gallbladder and the risk of complications is usually fairly small.If gallstones are causing you a lot of trouble, this may be your best option for relief, but you should always consult with your doctor before resorting to surgery.
In some cases, gallbladder removal may cause diarrhea, which is often temporary but may sometimes last for longer periods. Your doctor may have you treat this diarrhea by using anti-diarrheal medications or medications that block your body's absorption of bile acids."

, Make sure to consult your digestive health specialist for more information about your Crohn’s and gallstones. Based on your medical history, they will be able to offer you guidance about the best way to avoid gallstones or gallbladder disease.


Share with your doctor any symptoms that might suggest gallbladder disease such as intense pain in your upper right abdomen, back pain between the shoulder blades, or pain in your right shoulder.
Stay in touch with your digestive disease specialist so they can manage your Crohn’s and help you prevent the occurrence or reoccurrence of gallstones.
Make sure all your doctors – general practitioner and digestive disease specialist – are in communication., Your doctor can monitor a variety of vital statistics that provide information about whether you may be at risk of developing gallstones. Many of these indicators can be measured through simple blood tests. Some include:


Blood sugar levels
Blood pressure
Cholesterol levels
Triglyceride levels
HDL cholesterol levels, Removal of the gallbladder is a relatively common event for people who have a history of gallstones. If you are considering gallbladder surgery to treat your gallstones, make sure that your doctor understands your history of Crohn’s disease so that you will be able to work together to minimize potential complications., By eating consistently, you’ll better manage your Crohn’s and make sure your body and gallbladder are processing food regularly. If you binge eat or starve yourself, your gallbladder and other digestive organs won’t function as efficiently as they should.


Try not to engage in binge eating. For instance, moderate yourself at buffets or during the holidays.
Do not engage in crash diets. A rapid decrease in your caloric intake will jolt your gallbladder and digestive system.
Avoid low calorie diets. Always make sure you are consuming more than 800 to 1200 calories every day.
Talk to your doctor about the number of calories you should consume every day and how Crohn’s impacts your consumption., Alcohol is a toxin that causes problems for the digestive systems of people with or without Crohn’s disease. While small amounts of alcohol may reduce the risk of gallstones, drinking more may harm your digestive system and increase the risk of developing gallstones.


Most adults should not drink more than 1 or 2 drinks every day.
Consult your digestive disease specialist, as alcohol consumption might aggravate your Crohn’s or conflict with your medications., Foods with a lot of saturated fat are associated with the formation of gallstones. Limit the amount of these foods you consume. Some examples of foods that are high in saturated fat are:


Sausage and fatty meats
Dairy products like butter, cream, and milk
Products that contain palm or coconut oil
Fried foods., While trans fats and saturated fats can contribute to your chance of developing gallstones, the consumption of healthy fats (monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats) may help prevent the development of gallstones. Thus, focus on healthy fats when you can. Foods with healthy fats include:


Nuts
Seeds
Avocadoes
Fish, Studies show that Crohn’s patients can benefit from a committed cardio routine. Not only will exercise help you feel good, but it will strengthen your metabolic system and help your body process saturated fats and other things that contribute to the formation of gallstones.


Know that a sedentary lifestyle – where you are not very active – may contribute to the formation of gallstones.
Dedicate yourself to a moderate and low-impact routine. For instance, don’t overexert yourself and try to run a marathon every day.
Try to spend at about 30 minutes, five times a week exercising.
Some cardio exercises include running, cycling, and swimming., By committing to a weight training program, you’ll work out your cardiovascular system, help your body process fats, and improve your overall health. Ultimately, a weight training program will strengthen.


Consider lifting weights 3 or 4 times a week.
Try not to over exert yourself.
Think about exercises like presses, lifts, squats, and more., Obesity offers an increased challenge to the digestive systems of people with Crohn’s as it taxes their body’s ability to process food. Ultimately, the best way to prevent gallstones is stick to a healthy weight.


Talk to your doctor about setting a healthy weight target.
Quick weight loss may contribute to the formation of gallstones.
Avoid gaining weight quickly, as your gallbladder and digestive system might be unable to keep up with increased consumption of food."

Keep your hands clean.,
Wash fresh fruits and veggies.,
Drink clean water.,
Cook perishable food thoroughly.,
Avoid foods that can trigger diarrhea.,
Steer clear of dairy if you're lactose intolerant.,
See your doctor if diarrhea is a common problem for you.,
Ask your doctor about antibiotics.,
Try taking over-the-counter medications.,
Consider taking herbal remedies.",How to Prevent Diarrhea," The most common cause of acute bouts of diarrhea is infection from some sort of microorganism — either viral, bacterial or parasitic.Infections are often transmitted into the body from contaminated hands, so washing your hands often and well with clean water and soap is a simple way to prevent diarrhea.


Wash your hands before every meal and after using the bathroom. You should also wash your hands after changing diapers, playing with pets, and handling money.
Spend at least 20 seconds lathering your hands with soap before rinsing, and don't forget to scrub under your fingernails.
Viruses that commonly cause diarrhea (especially in kids) include rotavirus, norovirus and adenovirus.Common bacterial causes of diarrhea include salmonella, campylobacter, shigella, E. coli. and C. Difficile. Protozoa such as cryptosporidium, giardia, and entamoeba can also cause diarrhea.Don't overdo it with the alcohol-based antibacterial hand sanitizer because it can create highly resistant bacteria called super-bugs, which can cause more serious infections.;
, The surfaces of fresh produce (fruits and veggies) are very commonly contaminated with bacteria (such as E. coli) and parasites — mainly from manure in the soil and insect larvae, respectively.Wash all fresh produce before you prepare it and/or consume it.


Try letting your produce soak in warm water for 30 minutes, scrubbing it with a clean brush and some baking soda, and then rinsing it well.
More natural disinfectants appropriate for cleaning produce include white vinegar, diluted iodine, citric acid, fresh lemon juice, salty water and colloidal silver.
Fresh produce can sometimes transmit certain strains of pathogenic (disease causing) E. coli that produce diarrhea-inducing toxins once they're in your intestines. These bacteria (called enterotoxigenic E. coli or ETEC) are a common cause of ""traveler's diarrhea."", The tap water where you live may not taste very good, but virtually all municipal sources in the United States are disinfected with chlorine and other chemicals, so it's unlikely to transmit an infection to you. However, sanitation of drinking water in developing and tropical countries is a different story, so avoid consuming tap water, making ice cubes with it or brushing your teeth with it when traveling to such places.Instead, when traveling abroad, always use bottled water purchased from stores (not street vendors).


Water can still be contaminated in developed countries. Be careful using well water if you live in a rural area. Well water can be contaminated with animal or human feces or other waste material that contains bacteria.
If you are concerned with the quality of your tap water at home, buy a multi-stage reverse osmosis water filtration system. These systems are able to filter out particulate matter and parasites, as well as many harmful chemicals that can lead to stomach upset and diarrhea.

, Bacterial contamination of food (usually called food poisoning) is another common cause of diarrhea.Hamburger can be particularly risky because many parts of the cow (including intestines that contain bacteria) are combined together to make it. Cook your hamburger, steak, poultry, seafood and eggs thoroughly and with high heat so as to kill any bacteria that may be lurking within.


Cooking with a microwave is not an effective or reliable way of killing bacteria — pressure cookers, fry pans, woks and well-scrubbed BBQs are better options for cooking.
Have a separate cutting board exclusively used to prepare raw meat and disinfect it frequently.
Salmonella is a type of food poisoning caused by the Salmonella enterica bacteria, which is a common contaminate of beef, poultry, raw milk and eggs.
Always wash your hands before and after preparing all foods, particularly raw food that you intend to cook.

, Some foods have a tendency to create some stomach / intestinal irritation or spasms, which can trigger short-term bouts of diarrhea, especially in those who have sensitive GI systems or have digestive issues such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).Foods to watch out for include deep-fried fatty food, spicy sauces with cayenne pepper, too much insoluble fiber (such as the skins of fruits or veggies), high-fructose foods and sweet baked goods.Mixing many different food groups together during the same meal can also trigger diarrhea in some people. Food mixing seems to cause issues because some types (meat for example) need more digestion time than others (such as fruit), so the stomach has to release either partially under-digested or partially over-digested food into the intestines when you mix your food together.
Eating different courses (meat, pasta, veggies, fruit) with some time in between for digestion can be helpful to prevent GI upset and diarrhea.
Gluten can also trigger intestinal irritation and diarrhea, so people who are gluten sensitive (celiac disease, in particular) should avoid grains such as wheat, barley and rye.
Beverages that can trigger diarrhea include coffee, caffeine-rich drinks and carbonated sodas with artificial sugar (aspartame or sorbitol).

, Lactose intolerance is the inability to produce enough enzyme (lactase) needed to properly digest milk sugar (lactose). Undigested lactose ends up in the large intestine and provides food to the friendly bacteria there, which produce gas as a byproduct. Symptoms of lactose intolerance include flatulence, bloating, abdominal cramps and diarrhea.Reduce or avoid dairy consumption if you suspect a lactose intolerance problem, particularly milk, cream, ice cream and milkshakes.
The ability to produce lactase enzyme drops off rapidly after childhood, which means there's an increased risk of lactose intolerance as you age.If you want to continue to enjoy dairy products without the risk of diarrhea due to lactose intolerance, then buy some lactase capsules from a pharmacy and take one or two before each meal — they will help with lactose digestion.
Be cautious with drinking unpasteurized milk and eating some soft cheeses because there is a higher chance of them containing unfriendly bacteria that can trigger diarrhea.

, The occasional bout of diarrhea is normal, but there may be a problem if you experience diarrhea on a regular basis. Talk to your doctor if you:have has diarrhea for more than two days
are having severe pain in your abdomen or rectum
are dehydrated
have a fever of 102 degrees Fahrenheit or higher
notice blood or pus in your stools or stools that are black and tarry looking

, Antibiotics can both trigger and help prevent diarrhea, depending on the cause. On the one hand, over-use of antibiotics can kill off the ""friendly"" bacteria in your large intestine, which creates imbalances and digestive problems that often lead to diarrhea.On the other hand, if you have a bacterial infection that's impacting your GI system and triggering chronic diarrhea, then short-term use of antibiotics can be helpful in helping you fight the infection. Antibiotic use is a thin line to walk when it comes to preventing or causing diarrhea, so follow your doctor's instructions carefully.


Food poisoning usually resolves itself within a few days (a week at the most), so antibiotics are typically not prescribed unless a person has a weakened immune system.
If responsible antibiotic use is still triggering diarrhea, then consider supplementing with probiotic supplements (containing strains of healthy bacteria normally found in your large intestine) while you're on the medication and even continuing for a week afterwards.Other medications that commonly trigger diarrhea include laxatives, blood pressure drugs, chemotherapy, weight loss drugs and antacids (those containing magnesium)., Over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medications, such as loperamide (Imodium A-D) and bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol, Kaopectate), may help reduce the incidence of or outright prevent diarrhea, although they are not recommended for infants and children. Loperamide combats diarrhea by slowing down how fast food and liquid move through your intestines, which allows more water to be absorbed and more solid stool to form. Bismuth subsalicylate works by directly absorbing water and toxic compounds in the bowel, and impeding the growth of certain bacteria and viruses.Bismuth subsalicylate has some anti-inflammatory and antibiotic properties in addition to its water absorbing ability.However, it should not be used by those who are allergic to aspirin.
Anti-diarrheal medications may make some bacterial and parasitic infections worse because diarrhea is sometimes the body's strategy of getting rid of the microorganisms and their toxins.

, Natural medicines made from plant products are often a good alternative to pharmaceutical preparations in preventing and treating diarrhea, and they usually create far fewer side effects in the body. For example, certain plant leaves are rich in tannins — astringent compounds that help absorb water and calm intestinal spasms — such as blackberry, blueberry and raspberry leaves.Herbal tea can be helpful for preventing or combating diarrhea. Black tea leaves, such as Earl Grey, are also rich in tannins, but the caffeine content may be counterproductive for preventing diarrhea. Other herbal teas that can act as a safe diarrhea remedy include chamomile, ginger and fennel.
Do not eat lots of fresh berries at one time because they are rich in fructose sugar and fiber and may make your diarrhea worse.
Keep in mind that some herbs can trigger diarrhea, such as senna, turmeric and aloe vera.

Wash your hands regularly.,
Dispose of fecal matter away from habitations, crops, and water sources.,
Don’t let children play in contaminated soil.,
Keep your fingernails short.",How to Prevent an Ascaris Infection1," Washing your hands is one of the best ways to prevent the spread of infections. Ascaris infection is frequently spread through ingesting larvae and eggs which may get on your hands. Washing your hands is critical to prevention, especially after going to the washroom and before eating. Wash your hands with soap and water, while scrubbing for at least 20 seconds in order to remove unwanted parasites and bacteria. Sing happy birthday twice while scrubbing to make sure you wash them long enough.
Rinse hands and dry using a clean towel.;
, Ascariasis is most often transferred after soil becomes contaminated with fecal matter. As a result, it is important to ensure that all fecal matter is disposed of in an isolated area and will not come into contact with any crops or water that may be consumed. Once eggs are in the environment they persist for a long time. It is very important to ensure that they do not enter the environment in which you are living.

, In some countries, due to poor sanitation, fecal matter is able to mix with local water and soil sources. Often children will then play in the mud allowing eggs to transfer to the children’s hands. Teach your children the importance of washing their hands regularly and not putting their hands in their mouths without washing. The majority of those suffering from an Ascaris infection are children under the age of 10.

, Fecal matter can get trapped under fingernails and may be difficult to remove while washing your hands. By keeping your fingernails short you may be able to prevent eggs from getting trapped and later ingested. "

Avoid fruits and vegetables that may have been grown in contaminated soil.,
Wash fruits and vegetables.,
Peel and cook raw vegetables.",How to Prevent an Ascaris Infection2," In some parts of the world human feces are used as fertilizer on crops. Ascariasis can be spread by ingesting fruits and vegetables that come in contact with roundworm eggs while growing or being harvested. It is best to avoid using human excrement as fertilizer.

, It is always a good idea to wash fruits and vegetables before eating especially if they may have come in contact with Ascaris eggs at some point., Peeling off the outer skin and cooking vegetables can also help ensure that ascariasis does not spread to humans. Typically eggs will be removed in the peeling process or killed while being cooked. This is of particular importance if you are eating crops that may have been in contact with soil contaminated with human fecal matter, often in the form of fertilization. "
"
Try preventative treatments.,
Visit your doctor or pediatrician.,
Remove the worms via surgery.",How to Prevent an Ascaris Infection3," If you live in or are traveling to an area where Ascaris infection is common, you may want to take preventative medications, such as the deworming medications mebendazole and albendazole. Periodic treatments of certain high-risk groups can help prevent worms from taking hold and reproducing in the intestines.Consult with your doctor or public health officials prior to taking any deworming medications. Preventive campaigns using medications to treat high-risk groups are typically led by local public health authorities.
Some side effects of deworming medications include fever, stomach and abdominal pain, nausea, dizziness, and blood in the stool. If you notice any of these side effects, consult your doctor immediately.Read the directions provided with the medication to familiarize yourself with all potential side effects.
Preventive medication is not generally recommended for travelers from developed non-tropical countries going to tropical regions., Consult with a doctor if you notice symptoms of an Ascaris infection. Treating an Ascaris infection most often involves taking an antiparasitic mediation such as albendazole and mebendazole. These medications are prescribed by a doctor and should typically be taken for 1 to 3 days. Your doctor may want to examine a stool sample in order to ensure there are no traces of eggs, larvae, or worms remaining after treatment. , In some severe cases surgery may be necessary to remove the parasite. This typically only occurs if the intestines have been blocked or an abdominal infection has developed. Your doctor will advise you as to whether surgery is needed."

Know the signs and symptoms of Cholera.,
Identify the source of the disease.,
Isolate victims and provide medical care.,
Create sanitary conditions in areas where a cholera outbreak is possible.,
Get the Vaccine.",How to Prevent Cholera1," Mostly they are diarrhoea and vomiting of clear-like fluids.


These usually start about 1-5 days after bacteria ingestion.
Fevers aren't common, but sometimes indicate a secondary infection. Blood pressure is also low do to about 10–15 liters (3–4 US gal) of water being expelled per day.
Kussmaul breathing(deep and laboured) can be indicators, also muscle cramping and weakness.
In the severe cases the patient turns blue from lack of a large amount of fluids.;
, Cholera is usually spread through unsanitary drinking water supplies and facial contamination, so this would be a reasonable first choice to investigate.


Check the condition of waste disposal methods at the location of a possible cholera outbreak. Making sure that sewage discharge is adequately treated and disposed of will decrease the potential for spread of the disease.
Cholera in the developed world is usually due to food, more specifically the seafood plankton and shellfish.

, Although cholera is not as communicable as some other diseases, keeping those suffering from the disease from contact with the general public will reduce the chance of spread.


Use PPE when in contact with them and dispose of their faeces properly to stop more infection.
People with medical training should have access to the person to give them proper medical care.
The person should be told to drink water and fluids. Babies should be breastfed or given a bottle even if the person is travelling for treatment.

, Even if only rudimentary latrines are utilized, keeping the waste contained and out of potential water sources is of the utmost importance.


Everything that is suspected for contamination or that was in contact with a person with Cholera should be sterilized or disposed.
Use sterilized water, bottled water, or water from another trusted source if possible during a cholera outbreak. Boil water if you have to.
Wash your hands and peel vegetables.
Food should be cooked well, especially seafood and meats. Food should be hot all the way through before ready and all food should be covered until you are ready to eat.

, The Cholera vaccines take weeks to work and thus should not take over the above methods. They also have incomplete protection over a short time.


Dukoral is licensed by the WHO and in 60 countries. Is 52% effective in the first year and 60% in the second.
Shanchol is licensed in India and pending licensing by the WHO.
Defecation should be buried at least 30 meters (98.4 ft) from every water source or use a latrine.

Avoid fatty foods.,
Avoid acidic foods.,
Reduce your chocolate intake.,
Cut back on garlic and onions.,
Stay away from spicy foods.,
Drink fewer carbonated beverages.,
Eat smaller meals.,
Eat low-acid foods.",How to Prevent Acid Reflux1," Fatty foods are hard for your body to digest, which means that they stay in the stomach for longer. When foods slow down your digestive system, they are more likely to come back up your esophagus as reflux increases. Avoid foods such as::


Full-fat dairy products like butter, regular cheese, sour cream, and whole milk
Animal fat like lard or bacon fat
Fried foods like French fries, onion rings, and fried chicken
High-fat snacks that don’t have much nutritional value like potato chips, candy, or ice cream;
, Acid reflux can be brought on by acidic foods. Citrus fruits are some of the most acidic foods. That doesn’t mean you should cut them out of your diet entirely, but you should monitor how often you eat foods like:Tomatoes, salsa, tomato sauce, oranges, grapefruits, pineapples, lemons, and limes
Additionally, vinegar is an acidic condiment used in seasonings and can exacerbate acid reflux.

, If you are concerned about acid reflux, you may want to reduce the amount of chocolate you eat. Chocolate contains an ingredient called methylxanthine, which will relax the muscles in your esophagus.When the bottom of your esophagus stays open, there is a significant chance that food from your stomach could come back up.

, Garlic can give you an upset stomach and make you bloat. Both of these things can then lead to reflux. Many people with acid reflux have also found that their symptoms get worse when they eat raw onions., Researchers debate whether spicy foods actually cause acid reflux. Regardless, many people find that spicy food upset their stomachs.Examples of spicy foods include jalapenos, banana peppers, and hot sauce (tabasco, sriracha, etc.).
If you are prone to acid reflux, you will want to keep your stomach as happy as possible. This means avoiding foods, like spicy meals, that upset it., Carbonated drinks are filled with bubbles. They might look nice in the can or bottle, but it's important to remember that those bubbles will keep on fizzing in your stomach.


The carbonation can make pressure build up inside your stomach. This can push the contents of the stomach back up your esophagus, causing reflux., When you limit yourself to small portions, your stomach has an easier time digesting what you put into it. A stomach that doesn’t have a lot of pressure put on it to digest quickly is much less likely to push food back up your esophagus.


If you get hungry when you make your portions smaller, consider eating six small meals a day rather than three larger meals. Aim for each small meal to contain roughly 300 to 400 calories., A good way to reduce acid reflux is to eat small meals made up of low-acid foods. Acid you eat will add to the acidity of your stomach. Some good examples of low-acid foods are:Leafy greens
Melons
Bananas
Oatmeal
Tofu
Fennel
Parsley
Rice

Watch what you eat while breastfeeding.,
Switch to a different formula.,
Give your baby probiotics.,
Burp the baby after feeding.,
Breastfeed the baby in an upright position.,
Make sure the baby is not swallowing air when bottle feeding.,
Warm the milk before feeding the baby.,
Avoid drinking beverages that contain caffeine.,
Feed the baby in frequent, small amounts.",How to Prevent Colic1," Mothers are encouraged to watch what they eat while they are breastfeeding. You should avoid eating foods that are not easily digested.


This includes cruciferous veggies like cauliflower and cabbage, chocolate, and allergenic foods like soy, wheat, peanuts, eggs, fish, tree nuts and dairy.
This is because these foods are not easily digestible and they may irritate the digestive system of the baby that is still immature.;
, If your baby is suffering from colic, it's a good idea to try switching the baby's formula, as the current feed may be irritating the baby's tummy.


Consider swapping from the standard formula containing cow’s milk to one that does not contain the cow’s milk.
Studies have shown that colicky babies benefit from hypoallergenic formulas because they decrease the symptoms of colic.

, Studies have shown that some infants who suffer from colic benefit from probiotics.Probiotics are natural bacterium that are found in the digestive system which help to promote good health.


It's possible to buy artificial probiotics which mimic the effects of natural probiotics. These can be added to the formula of the baby, as they are sold in powder or drop form.
Studies have shown that babies who were treated with a probiotic called lactobacillus reuteri cried much less.The probiotics should be given according to instructions of the manufacturer.

, It is important that you burp the baby after every feed as this helps to remove any wind that is trapped in the digestive system.


This is done by holding the baby over your shoulder, sitting her upright on your lap or placing her tummy-down, across your lap. The baby is then gently patted or rubbed on the back to help in bringing up the wind.
It is also advisable to massage the tummy gently using clockwise movements, as this helps to move any wind or stool that is trapped in the intestines.

, When breastfeeding the baby, it is a good idea to hold the baby in an upright position as much as possible. This helps to reduce wind that is likely to make the baby uncomfortable and increase colic.

, When the baby is fed from a bottle, it is important to ensure that the baby is not swallowing air.


This can be done by ensuring that the baby is in an upright position during feeding. It is also important to tilt the bottle so that the milk covers the entrance to the teat.
A bottle with a fast flow teat is better than a bottle with a very small teat. Fast flow teats help to reduce the chances of the baby swallowing air as they feed., Since the baby has an immature digestive tract, it is important to warm milk before feeding to prevent stomach upset and irritation due to the cold temperature.

, If you are breastfeeding your baby, it's important to avoid drinking beverages that contain caffeine (coffee, tea, energy drinks) as caffeinated drinks aggravate colic due to their acidic component.


The stimulating effects of caffeine can also be passed on to the baby, which can be irritating for them.

, It is best to feed your baby smaller amounts of milk more frequently. Small feedings are recommended in order to avoid too much wind inside the baby’s stomach.


To determine the right amount of milk feeding to your baby, multiply your baby's weight by 150mL. For example, if your baby weighs 3kgs, she will need 450mL of milk in a 24 hour period.
You can divide this into 6 to 8 small feedings per day, given at regular time intervals.

Lose weight.,
Quit smoking.,
Avoid lying down immediately after you eat.,
Keep your head and shoulders elevated when you sleep.,
Wear loose clothing.",How to Prevent Acid Reflux2," Obesity is one of the main risk factors in developing acid reflux.If you are overweight or obese, you should losing some weight if you want to prevent yourself from getting reflux. Eating healthy and exercising are the two main paths to weight loss.



Stick to a healthy diet. Try to eat the five basic food groups (fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole wheat, and low-fat dairy products) every day. Avoid bad fats found in fried foods, candy, and other empty-calorie items.

Exercise regularly. Doctors recommend that you get at least 30 minutes of exercise four to five days a week.If you exercise consistently, it can help you lose weight. Try walking, running, biking, swimming, or hiking. You can also go to your local gym and speak to a fitness trainer. A trainer can help you develop an exercise plan that's right for your needs.

, Aside from other health problems it causes, smoking can play a part in the development of acid reflux. This is because cigarette smoke damages mucus membranes in your body.Smoking also increases the amount of acid your stomach makes. Further, it relaxes the muscles that keep food from traveling back up your esophagus.

, When you eat, your food travels down your esophagus and passes into your stomach. Gravity keeps the food in your stomach, making it harder to come back up in the wrong direction. When you lie down, you take away that gravitational pull.


This makes it much more likely for food to go the wrong way and travel back up into your gullet, causing heartburn and reflux.The best thing to do after you eat is actually to go for a walk. A short walk will help your stomach start to digest.

, If you are concerned that you might develop acid reflux, you might want to go prop your head and shoulders up when you lie down.


Keeping your upper body elevated above your feet will help food stay in your stomach until digested, rather than coming back up., When you wear tight clothes, the fabric, waistline, or belt can put added pressure on the stomach. This squeezes it while its trying to digest.The added pressure might be a little too much for your belly, and your food might work its way back up your esophagus.

Try over-the-counter antacids.,
Take H2 blockers before each meal.,
Talk to your doctor about trying a proton pump inhibitor.,
Strengthen your esophagus with prokinetic medication.,
Consider surgery.",How to Prevent Acid Reflux3," This medication acts as a neutralizer in your stomach. It reduces the acid by combating it with basic (the opposite of acidic) properties. You can get antacids without a prescription and can take them when needed.


Common antacids include Mylanta, Tums, Caltrate, Maalox, and Mi-Acid., H2 blockers reduce the amount of acid that your stomach creates to help it digest food. It may sound like a bad idea to do that, but H2 blockers actually don’t have much of an effect on your digestive system. They do reduce acid reflux.Pepcid, Axid, and Zantac are some of the most common forms of H2 blockers.Taking these over-the-counter medications shouldn’t do any harm if you take them as directed and you do actually have acid reflux. They will not be helpful if you are suffering from another condition you have mistaken for acid reflux.
If this is your first experience with acid reflux, consult a doctor before taking these medications. The concern here is not negative side effects or possible harm. Rather, it is to determine if you are choosing the best medication for your problem.

, This medication, like H2 blockers, keeps your stomach from developing too much acid. When your stomach has a lot of acid in it, you have a better chance of developing acid reflux.


Omeprazole (Prilosec), lansoprazole (Prevacid), and pantoprazole(Protonix) are some of the most common proton pump inhibitors.If your doctors believes you have acid reflux, her or she likely prescribe omeprazole. This is usually the first-choice for medication, often prescribed before any additional testing. If your reflux gets better after taking this medication, this confirms the diagnosis. If you continue to have problems, further investigation and alternative treatments may be necessary.

, This drug can help strengthen your lower esophageal sphincter. This is the little valve in the end of your esophagus that keeps food in the stomach. Prokinetic medication also helps your stomach to empty more quickly. This decreases food regurgitation.If other treatments haven't been effective, your doctor may try adding this medication to the mix to create a combination of effects. Your doctor will come up with the right combination and regimen that works for you.You may be prescribed medications like bethanechol (Urecholine) or metoclopramide (Reglan or Maxeran).Prokinetic medications may have severe, serious side effects. These include fatigue, sleepiness, depression, irregular heartbeat, anxiety, and problems with physical movement (such as muscle spasms)., If medication doesn't work or your suffer from esophageal damage due to chronic reflux, you may be a candidate for surgery. The main procedure is called fundoplication.


This surgery entails wrapping the upper part of your stomach around your the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). This helps in preventing reflux through the LES.Generally, patients can leave the hospital within 1-3 days and can go back to work within 2-3 weeks.Patients requiring proton pump inhibitors for over 10 years should consider surgery as a more cost-effective solution."

Give the baby a massage.,
Keep the baby as active as possible.,
Wrap the baby in a warm blanket.,
Give the baby a warm bath.,
Know when to seek medical help.",How to Prevent Colic2," Giving your baby a massage can be very soothing for them. This can be done by placing the baby on their tummy and gently rubbing their back.


The arms, legs and belly can be gently stroked as well. It can also be helpful to apply pressure to the baby’s tummy, as this can help to release any trapped wind.
To apply pressure on the tummy, the baby can be placed face-down on the lap or upright with the tummy against the shoulder of the guardian.

, You are encouraged to keep your baby active, as some colicky babies respond well to movement.


Walk the crying baby around in their carrier or take the baby outside while placed in their stroller.
You can also try holding the baby in your arms and rocking them gently from side to side, or even dancing with them.

, Try swaddling your baby in a warm blanket that you've just taken out of the dryer. The combination of feeling secure and warm helps to increase comfort and reduce the crying.

, Some babies can be soothed by a warm bath in a warm room. This helps to relieve any tension in the baby's body and make them more comfortable.

, Although colic is relatively normal and is not usually not a cause for concern, there are certain situations where it's advisable to seek medical help:


If the baby cries constantly for more than 3 hours. This may indicate the baby is in distress or intense pain.
If the baby’s belly is hard and she cannot be comforted (provided you have tried all means of comforting her).
If the baby has a fever over 100.5º F (38ºC). This indicates that the baby may have an infection and needs to be treated right away.
If you are unsure of how to care for the baby and you are afraid you might cause additional pain seek help right away.

Distract the baby with white noise.,
Play some soothing music.,
Create a calm, peaceful home environment.,
Dim any bright lights.,
Avoid smoking around the baby.",How to Prevent Colic3," One technique that sometimes works to soothe a colicky baby is using white noise to distract the baby. This can be the noise of a vacuum cleaner or a dryer.


It is important to note that the baby should not be placed on the dryer in their carrier seat as this is not safe.

, Try playing some soothing music for the baby, like classical or lullabies.


The crying baby is also likely to respond to quiet singing in the background or a lullaby that has melodic strains. Other babies may also enjoy listening to the sound of nature.
It is advisable to experiment with different music and sounds in order to find out what helps to calm the baby and what they like.

, Try to create a calm and a quiet environment for the baby. Some babies experience colic as a result of a noisy, stressful environment. A lot of activity in the house can over-stimulate the baby causing her to cry., Bright lights can also over-stimulate the baby, as they may be unable to stop gazing at them. Any bright lights in the house should be dimmed, as this will help the baby to relax and settle down.

, It is advisable to avoid smoking near the baby or in the house. Studies have shown that second hand smoke can cause health issues in babies, including colic. In cases where one of the parents is smoker, it is advisable to smoke outside the house.

Keep your toothbrush clean.,
Brush your teeth twice a day.,
Choose the right floss.,
Floss your teeth regularly.,
Use a mouthwash.,
Try using a water pick.,
Ask your dentist about other cleaning tools.,
Rinse your mouth with water.,
Avoid smoking.",How to Whiten Teeth Naturally1," Toothpastes are a key part of your oral hygiene routine as they help remove food debris and plaque from your teeth and gums.Toothpastes can come in a gel, paste or powder form and while they may have similar ingredients, there are different kinds of toothpastes that are made for individual needs.


Fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral found in water. Toothpastes with fluoride help prevent tooth decay by strengthening your tooth enamel and fighting away bacteria that cause cavities. Fluoride toothpaste is also recommended for toddlers and children but in a lower percentage. Too much fluoride can weaken the enamel. For children younger than three years, an amount equal to a grain of rice is enough. For children aged three to six years, use a pea-sized amount of fluoride toothpaste.
Whitening toothpastes usually contain mild abrasives that are typically mineral compounds such as magnesium carbonate, hydrated aluminum oxides and calcium carbonate. These help remove surface stains that cause yellowing and help you to achieve a brighter tooth surface. Whitening toothpastes also often contain a small percentage of hydrogen peroxide, a bleaching agent that helps remove stains.

Whitening toothpastes that contain hydrogen peroxide, which is effective, but it can cause sensitivity. You can ease the sensitivity by alternating between a whitening and sensitivity toothpaste every day.


Desensitizing toothpastes are best for people who have sensitive gums and teeth. These contain compounds such as potassium nitrate and potassium citrate with soothing effects to reduce sensitivity. To improve the effectiveness of these products, leave them on for at least two minutes before rinsing with water.
For people with fluoride sensitivity, toothpastes with natural ingredients such as xylitol, green tea extract, papaya plant extract, citric acid, zinc citrate and baking soda are also effective in whitening and thoroughly cleaning teeth.;
, Both manual and electric powered toothbrushes can effectively clean teeth.People who have difficulty using a manual toothbrush may find powered toothbrushes easier to use but you will still need to learn how to use it properly to avoid gum recession over time. Your dentist can help you decide which type is best suited to your needs.


A soft bristled toothbrush is best for people with sensitive teeth and gums.

, Make sure to replace your toothbrush every three to four months. Avoid storing it in a closed container, as bacteria can accumulate between the bristles over time, leading to plaque, enamel wear, and mouth infections.Do not share your toothbrush with anyone. This can also spread germs, viruses if there is even a small amount of blood on the toothbrush, and disease-causing bacteria into your mouth.
Wash your toothbrush before and after every use to keep bacteria from accumulating on the bristles.
Once every two weeks, you can also soak your toothbrush in a cup with chlorhexidine mouthwash for 15 minutes to make sure it is germ free.

, Brushing your teeth is the most important part of your dental care routine.For a healthy mouth and teeth, experts recommend that you brush your teeth twice a day for two minutes with a soft-bristled toothbrush. To use a proper brushing technique:


Place your toothbrush at a 45 degree angle to the gums.
Gently move the brush back and forth in short, tooth-wide strokes. Brush the outer surfaces, inner surfaces and chewing surfaces of the teeth.
Clean the inside surfaces of the front teeth. Tilt the brush vertically and make several up-and-down strokes. For the chewing surface of your molars, start with a back and forth motion, and then continue with a repetitive circular movement.
Brush your tongue to remove bacteria and keep your breath fresh.

, Flossing is one the most important steps in your dental care routine besides brushing.Commercial floss is made from synthetic nylon or plastic filaments. It is often treated with flavoring agents, such as mint or lemon, artificial sweeteners and sugar alcohols, such as xylitol and mannitol, to make flossing more pleasant. They may also be waxed with beeswax or plant-based wax for ease of use. Keep in mind, however, that there is no difference in the effectiveness of waxed or unwaxed floss.


Organic flosses made from silk are still available online and in certain drugstores for people who want to avoid artificial sweeteners, plastic filaments or fluoride, but these may cost more than regular floss. Both organic and vegan flosses are packaged in plastic containers that are required by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Never use string or any other fabric to floss your teeth, as you can severely damage your teeth and gum tissue. Only dental flosses that are approved by the ADA (American Dental Association) have been tested for safety and effectiveness.

, Flossing at least once a day helps remove plaque from the areas between your teeth where your toothbrush can’t reach as plaque that is not removed eventually hardens into tartar and can lead to gum disease.Keep in mind that flossing may cause some discomfort at first but should not be painful either. If you floss too hard, you can damage the tissue between your teeth. With daily flossing and brushing, the discomfort should ease within a week or two. It may take a while to get used to flossing but it should slowly turn into a habit. If your pain persists, talk to your dentist. The proper steps to flossing your teeth are:


Break off about 18 inches of floss and wind most of it around one of your middle fingers. Wind the remaining floss around the same finger of the opposite hand. This finger will take up the floss as it becomes dirty.
Hold the floss tightly between your thumbs and forefingers.
Guide the floss between your teeth using a gentle rubbing motion. Never snap the floss into the gums.
When the floss reaches the gum line, curve it into a C shape against one tooth. Gently slide it into the space between the gum and the tooth.
Hold the floss tightly against the tooth. Gently rub the side of the tooth, moving the floss away from the gum with up and down motions. Repeat this method on the rest of your teeth. Don’t forget the back side of your last tooth. Once you’re finished, throw the floss away. A used piece of floss won’t be as effective and can reintroduce bacteria into your mouth.
You can easily inspect the floss and see the plaque collected on it. That part should be replaced with a new piece by simply rolling your fingers.
Children should start flossing their as soon as they have two or more teeth. However, since most children younger than 10 or 11 years are not able to floss properly, they should be supervised by an adult.

, Just like toothpaste, there are different types of mouthwashes that help take care of your individual oral care needs.Over-the-counter mouth rinses can help freshen your breath, strengthen enamel, loosen plaque before brushing or kill bacteria that cause gingivitis.


For your daily oral care routine, swish one fluid ounce of mouthwash in your mouth after brushing and having meals for two to three minutes, and then spit it out. Ask your dentist or hygienist to recommend the mouthwash that is best suited to your individual needs. In some cases, your dentist might prescribe a stronger fluoride or antibacterial rinse for you.
A cup of lukewarm, distilled water is an effective homemade mouthwash for people with sensitive teeth and gums to help kill bacteria and wash away food debris.
If you need to avoid alcohol, read ingredient labels carefully as many over-the-counter mouth rinses contain high amounts of alcohol and use it as the main ingredient.
When buying from a store, check the ingredient list to avoid sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS). SLS is an artificial detergent that can cause sensitivity and mouth ulcers. It is used as a foaming agent in many toothpastes also. Instead, choose a mouthwash with a natural emulsifier like vegetable oil, sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), or sodium chloride (salt). Plant extracts such as peppermint, sage, cinnamon and lemon help freshen your breath.

, A water pick is pressure washer for the mouth, helping to blast stuck-on food from the surface and between the crevices of the teeth and gums. It's an excellent and healthy way to cleanse the mouth after meals.

, Your dentist and hygienist may suggest other cleaners to supplement your dental care routine, such as:Interdental cleaners work better than floss for people who have large spaces between their teeth. They can look like tiny brushes or like three-sided, wide toothpicks. These cleaners also work well in people who have braces or missing teeth, and in people who have had gum surgery. You can find them at most grocery stores and drugstores.
Oral irrigators are electrical devices that pump water in a steady or pulsating stream to flush out food and debris in pockets between teeth, or in braces. They also are used to deliver medicine to hard-to-reach areas. For example, prescription rinses can be sprayed into gum pockets with an oral irrigator. You can also use an oral irrigator with a diluted mouthwash, which is helpful for those who have dental implants or bridges.
Interdental tips are flexible rubber nibs used to clean between the teeth and just below the gum line. Plaque and bits of food can be removed by gently running the tip along the gum line.

, Rinsing with water after meals or drinking caffeinated beverages will help remove any leftover food or residue from your teeth will help prevent stain and decay. This method is especially useful if you’re away from home and don’t get a chance to brush or floss after eating. Drinking water throughout the day and rinsing with clean water after meals is the most underrated method of overall oral health.


Always avoid brushing right after very acidic foods, which can weaken your enamel. Instead, rinse with water.

, Cigarettes and chewing tobacco are harmful to your oral health as they can cause stained teeth, gum disease, oral cancer, slow healing after a tooth extraction or surgery which increases the risk of dry socket, a dulled sense of taste and smell and bad breath.Quitting is the only way to decrease your risk of these and other-tobacco related health problems.


Talk to your dentist or doctor to make a treatment plan that can help you quit smoking.

Dip your toothbrush into a sea salt mixture.,
Try oil pulling.,
Use a strawberry paste.,
Make a baking soda paste.,
Try apple cider vinegar to remove surface stains.,
Fight plaque with coconut oil and mint leaves.,
Give hydrogen peroxide a try.,
Chew a piece of gum.",How to Whiten Teeth Naturally2," Instead of using toothpaste, dip your toothbrush into a sea salt mixture for 3–5 minutes, made by dissolving ½ teaspoon of salt in 1 fluid ounce of water, and brush your teeth with it.The salt temporarily increases the pH balance of your mouth, turning it into an alkaline environment in which germs and bacteria cannot survive.


You may feel that your gums hurt for a little while and this is absolutely normal because the salt is hygroscopic, meaning it attracts water. Salt can also be abrasive so try using this method no more than once a week.
A salt water mouth rinse after meals can also help keep your mouth and throat clean while soothing and healing mouth sores.

, Oil pulling is an Ayurvedic remedy in which you swish oil in your mouth to remove harmful germs and bacteria from your mouth.Vegetable oil contains lipids that absorb toxins and pull them out of saliva, as well as stopping cavity-inducing bacteria from sticking to the walls of your teeth.


Take a spoonful of oil and swish it in your mouth for one minute to gain the benefits. If you can, try to swish the oil longer for 15 to 20 minutes. To make sure the oil absorbs and detoxifies as much bacteria as possible, aim to do this with an empty stomach.
Spit out the oil and rinse out your mouth well, preferably with lukewarm water.
Buy organic, cold-pressed oil. Sesame oil and olive oil can work. Coconut oil is the most popular because of its taste as well as its richness in natural antioxidants and vitamins, such as Vitamin E.

, The malic acid in strawberries is a natural emulsifier that helps removes surface stains and plaque.To make your own whitening paste, simply mash two to three strawberries in a cup and add ½ teaspoon of baking soda. Clean your teeth with this paste a few times per week.


Since the malic and citric acid in strawberries can erode enamel, use this remedy in conjunction with a fluoride toothpaste.

, Baking soda help whiten teeth and promote overall oral health.Take a teaspoon of baking soda and mix it in two teaspoons of water to make a paste. Brush your teeth with this paste a few times per week.


Baking soda can also be used as a mouth rinse after meals by dissolving one teaspoon of baking soda in a cup of water and swishing it in your mouth for two to three minutes. This creates an alkaline environment in your mouth, which prevents the action of bacteria and neutralizes any dangerous acids.

, Apple cider vinegar is a multipurpose household product that also has natural teeth whitening properties.Although results may not be instant, using apple cider vinegar in conjunction with baking soda can help remove surface stains and whiten your teeth.


To make your own teeth whitening paste, mix two teaspoons of apple cider vinegar with ½ teaspoon of baking soda, which can be used a few times per week.
You can also simply use apple cider vinegar as a mouthwash along with your daily oral care routine.

, Coconut oil is a natural emulsifier which helps clean your teeth, reduce stains and fight off plaque and cavity causing bacteria.Mix a small amount of mashed peppermint or spearmint leaves (approx. 1–2 grams) with two to three tablespoons of coconut oil to use as a whitening paste or mouthwash. The peppermint leaves help keep your breath fresh throughout the day.


Since coconut oil is gentle and non-abrasive, it can be used daily. It is also safe for people with sensitive teeth and gums.

, Many commercial mouthwashes and toothpastes have a 1.5% concentration of hydrogen peroxide, a powerful bleaching agent with a chemical composition that is incredibly close to water. This can help whiten your teeth.Hydrogen peroxide also helps kill bacteria, wash away debris and is especially useful to prevent gingivitis.


As some side effects can occur with prolonged use, ask your dentist about proper usage instructions for your individual needs.

, Studies show that chewing sugar-free gum that contains xylitol for 20 minutes a day following meals can help prevent tooth decay.Chewing gum increases saliva production which in turn washes away food debris, neutralizes acids produced by bacteria, strengthens tooth enamel, and provides disease-fighting substances throughout the mouth.


Sugary gum also promotes saliva production but can increase plaque bacteria, so this type of gum should not be used.
Don’t let chewing gum replace brushing and flossing, as these are the most important steps of your oral care routine.

Eat more crunchy fruits and vegetables.,
Avoid high fructose corn syrup.,
Drink fluoride-rich water.,
Drink tea in moderation.,
Eat calcium-rich foods.,
Take calcium supplements.,
Get enough Vitamin D. Vitamin D helps your body absorb and use calcium.",How to Whiten Teeth Naturally3," A big part of keeping your teeth clean involves eating the right foods.Naturally crunchy foods contain fiber, which helps increase saliva production in your mouth, removing many of the sugars and chemicals that can cause tooth decay. About 20 minutes after you eat something, your saliva begins to reduce the effects of the acids and enzymes attacking your teeth. Additionally, saliva contains traces of calcium and phosphate, which can also restore minerals to areas of teeth that have lost them from the bacterial acids.


Avoid sticky, chewy, sugary foods. Instead, eat fresh, raw, crunchy fruits and vegetables to help clean your teeth. Cucumbers, carrots, broccoli, celery, and raw nuts are great choices to eat to keep your teeth clean.
Limit your intake of fruits that contain citric acid, such as oranges, lemons, berries and tomatoes. Too much citric acid can cause enamel erosion.However, don’t completely avoid these fruits unless you have a digestive condition or allergy. These fruits contain many nutrients that are essential for bodily functions and contribute to creating a strong immune system.

, High fructose corn syrup is commonly found in many processed snacks and beverages, and it is the leading cause of tooth decay. Always read the nutrition label before buying foods. Regularly drinking carbonated beverages can also cause discoloration of teeth and enamel wear.

, Fluoridated drinking water helps wash away food debris and bacteria and increase saliva production, while the fluoride helps strengthen tooth enamel thus preventing tooth decay.However you should test yourself before this, as fluoride in high concentrations can be poisonous. People with sensitive teeth especially benefit from drinking cool, fluoridated water, since it also reduces inflammation in the gums.


Aim to drink at least eight ounces of water every two hours. The recommended daily amount for the average adult is two liters of water.
If you consume caffeinated beverages, drink one liter of water for every cup of caffeine. Not getting enough water can also lead to dehydration.
You can safely use fluoridated water to prepare infant formula. However, prolonged exposure and intake of fluoride during infancy may cause mild fluorosis, which actually weakens enamel. Fluorosis only occurs with baby teeth but it can also affect the development of permanent teeth and lead to white spots on teeth, so consider ways to minimize your baby’s exposure to fluorosis until they begin to grow permanent teeth such as using distilled, demineralized or purified water and giving your child calcium-rich foods and beverages. Since fluoride isn’t an essential mineral for the body, you do not need to worry about any deficiency.

, Both green and black tea contain antioxidant compounds known as polyphenols that either reduce or kill plaque bacteria. This means that they can prevent the production of acids that cause cavities and erode enamel.Depending on the type of water you use to brew your tea, a cup of tea can also be a source of fluoride.
Adding milk to black tea can also boost your calcium intake, making your teeth stronger and resistant to bacteria.
Keep in mind that drinking too much tea can also cause stains and, in some cases, dehydration, so try to limit your intake to two to three cups of tea per day.

, Calcium is essential to forming healthy teeth and bones.Calcium is especially important for children who have just started forming new teeth and for older people who have weaker teeth and bones. The best way to get more calcium is through food. Cook foods in a small amount of water for the shortest possible time to keep more calcium in the foods you eat. The richest food sources of calcium include:


Cheeses such as parmesan, Romano, Swiss cheese, white cheddar, mozzarella, and feta
Low-fat or skimmed milk and butter
Yogurt: This is also a good source of probiotics, which are bacteria that help boost the body’s immune system.
Tofu
Blackstrap molasses
Dark leafy greens such as spinach, kale, turnip greens, Swiss chard
Almonds, hazelnuts and Brazil nuts

, Calcium is essential to forming healthy teeth and bones. The two most popular forms of calcium supplements are calcium citrate and calcium carbonate. Taking vitamin D and magnesium supplements with calcium can help your body absorb and use the calcium more efficiently. Calcium supplements should be taken in very small doses, no more than 500 mg at any given time, in divided doses with six to eight cups of water to avoid constipation.Talk to your healthcare provider before giving a child any nutritional supplement, including calcium.
Calcium citrate is more easily absorbed and digested by the body. It should not be used if you are taking any antacids or blood pressure medications.
Calcium carbonate is less expensive and contains more elemental calcium required for bodily processes. But it needs more stomach acids in order to be absorbed. So take this supplement with a glass of orange juice.
Calcium supplements derived from oyster shells, dolomite, and bone meal are best avoided as they may contain lead, which can cause anemia, damage to the brain and kidneys, raise blood pressure and cause poisoning. Calculus (tartar) on your teeth may also increase while using these supplements, so visit your dentist for a cleaning whenever you feel the deposits on your lower front teeth.

, It is also beneficial for boosting your immune system to fight against bacteria, viruses and free radicals that can erode teeth.Getting enough vitamin D can help you maintain a healthy smile, strengthen bones and even help prevent various types of diseases and cancers. Here are some ways to make sure you get enough vitamin D:


Get more exposure to sunlight. Your body naturally makes vitamin D when exposed to sunlight. People with light skin should try to get at least 10 to 15 minutes of sunlight, while people with dark skin should get at least 30 minutes of sunlight exposure daily. Clouds, smog, clothing, sunscreen and window glass all reduce the amount of sunlight that actually reaches the skin.
Natural food sources of vitamin D include cod liver oil, eggs, fatty fish such as salmon, juices and dairy products fortified with vitamin D.
Dietary supplements are also available at most pharmacies for people with low vitamin D. Children under 12 months of age need at least 400 IU of vitamin D. Children over 1 year and most adults need at least 600 IU, including pregnant and breastfeeding women. People above the age of 70 may need up to 800 IU of vitamin D. Ask your doctor before giving vitamin D supplements to an infant or child.
Always ask your doctor before taking any dietary supplements. Taking too much vitamin D supplements can cause side effects such as dehydration, poor appetite, weight loss, fatigue, sore eyes, itchy skin, muscle and bone pain, vomiting, diarrhea and constipation.

, Your dentist can help you find the right whitening product or procedure to help you get a brighter smile.Whiteners may not correct all types of discoloration, especially if you have brown or gray hued teeth. If you have had bonding or tooth-colored fillings placed in your front teeth, the whitener will not affect the color of these materials, and they will stand out in your newly whitened smile. You may want to investigate other options, like porcelain veneers or dental bonding. Some other ways to get a whiter smile are:


In-office bleaching is a dental procedure in which dentist applies either a protective gel to your gums or a rubber shield to protect the oral soft tissues, which is followed by a bleaching agent. This procedure can be done in one visit to the dentist’s office.
At-home bleaching with products containing hydrogen peroxide is useful for some people. There may be potential side effects, such as increased sensitivity or gum irritation, so speak with your dentist before using any whitening products.
Whitening toothpastes help remove surface stains and reduce discoloration over the long term with a proper oral care routine.

, A dental x-ray can help your dentist detect any signs of damage or disease in your teeth that may not be visible during a regular check-up, which may be the cause of teeth discoloration.If you frequently experience toothaches or bleeding gums, an x-ray can help your dentist understand the cause better.


If you are a new patient, your dentist may recommend getting an x-ray to determine the current status of your oral health. A new set of x-rays may be needed to help your dentist detect any cavities, analyze your gum health or evaluate the growth and development of your teeth.
Tell your dentist if you are pregnant to use a special apron that protects you and your child from any radiation exposure.

Know if you are at higher risk.,
Practicing good hygiene and avoiding contaminated water is the most effective way of preventing Crypto.,
Avoid sexual practices, such as oral-anal contact, that bring you in contact with fecal matter.

",How to Prevent Cryptosporidiosis (Crypto)," For some people Crypto can be a serious, even fatal infection. The following is a list of those who may be at higher risk:


Those with inherited diseases that affect the immune system
People with AIDS/HIV


Cancer patients
Organ transplant patients
Anyone who is taking immunosuppressive drugs
Infants and young children;
, To help prevent the infection, follow these steps:


Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water, especially after changing diapers, using the toilet, and/or before eating or preparing food.
Avoid swallowing water that may be contaminated. This may include:

Recreational water sources
Water from untreated shallow, unprotected wells
Unfiltered, untreated water from oceans, lakes, rivers, streams, and ponds
Untreated water (or ice) in countries where the water supply may not be safe


Avoid food that may be contaminated. This is especially important when traveling outside the U.S. where the potential for contamination is higher. It is best to avoid the following foods at that time:

Unpasteurized milk or dairy products
Raw fruits and vegetables
Food items purchased from street vendors

Wash your hands often.You should wash your hands at least twice when cooking: once before and once after preparing food.,
Cook your meat all the way through.Each kind of meat needs to reach a specific temperature in order to eliminate bacteria that thrive within it.,
Wash all your dishes thoroughly.Dishes -- including plates, cutting boards, pots, and pans -- need to be placed in the sink and scrubbed thoroughly with hot water and antibacterial soap.,
Keep your sponges clean.Sanitize your sponge every other day to prevent campy from getting a foothold in your sponge and sink.,
Avoid rotten meat and produce.,
Drink only clean, treated water.,
Avoid unpasteurized milk.Pasteurization is the process in which milk is heated, killing 99% of all bacteria within it.",How to Prevent a Campylobacter Infection1," Use an antibacterial soap and scrub thoroughly. Lather for at least twenty seconds, and be sure to scrub the backs of your hands and the webbing between your fingers, not just your palms. Rinse your hands and pat dry.


Be sure to dislodge any grime under your fingernails.
Make sure that children wash their hands carefully and frequently to reduce the risk of spreading the infection.;
, Make sure that the meat is cooked all through. It should not be pink inside, and any juice that comes out should be clear.


Some standard temperatures you should cook meat to include:
at least 160°F (71°C) for beef
at least 165°F (73.8°C) for poultry
at least 145°F (62.7°C) for fish

,


Other surfaces that have come into contact with raw meat like counter tops should also be disinfected with antibacterial soap and wiped down with a damp disposable towel or a disinfectant wipe.
Use separate cutting boards for meat. Thoroughly clean all cutting boards and utensils with soap and hot water after preparing raw meats and poultry.

, Sanitizing your sponge is simple. Just get your sponge damp, then toss it in your microwave for one minute.


Change your sponge once every week or every other week.
Don’t wipe up blood or juice that comes out of meat with a sponge.Instead, use a disposable towel or disinfectant wipe.

, Only eat fresh food. Use your senses to evaluate if food has spoiled.Look at the surface. If it’s slimy, moldy, or has an unusual taste or odor, do not eat it. Refrigerate your leftovers within two hours of eating. Use a resealable container to store food properly in your fridge. Eat leftovers within two or three days.


Do not eat raw meat that has been refrigerated for more than a day or two.
Do not eat anything with a broken seal.
Do not eat canned foods that are bulging or dented -- this could indicate the presence of bacteria.

, Campylobacter is common in the developing world. Therefore, if you travel to a foreign country make sure that your water comes from a treated source.


Wells can also sometimes become infected with campylobacter. If you have a well, then have your well water tested regularly to ensure that it is safe.If you are not sure if the water is safe to drink, then only drink bottled water.

, Raw milk, however, is not pasteurized, and therefore puts you at higher risk for campy infection.


Unpasteurized milk can become contaminated if the cow has a Campylobacter infection in its udder, or if the milk is contaminated with manure.

"
"
Do not drink untreated surface water.Infected feces from cows or wild birds can contaminate mountain streams and surface water.,
Use caution when handling feces.If you have a pet or infant, you might be picking up poo.,
Use caution when traveling through developing countries.Developing nations have a higher rate of campy infection than developed nations.",How to Prevent a Campylobacter Infection2," Avoid drinking directly from lakes, streams, and other bodies of water without purifying them.


If you wish to purify your water, simply heat the water until it reaches a rolling boil. Wait for at least one minute while the water boils, then remove it from the heat. Let it cool about ten minutes before drinking.

, Wear disposable gloves when handling poo or changing diapers. Once you’re done, dispose of the gloves in the trash. Wash your hands vigorously with an antibacterial soap.

, If you can see your food being prepared, ensure the cook washes his or her hands and uses all appropriate food safety precautions.

Look for diarrhea.,
Watch for cramping.Cramping or stomach pain might be constant, but it might also be intermittent.Any sharp pain or wrenching sensation in your gut can be considered cramping.,
Note any nausea.,
Check for a fever.A fever is defined as any temperature above 99-99.5°F (37.2-37.5°C).",How to Prevent a Campylobacter Infection3," Diarrhea is runny or liquid stool. In extreme cases, the stool might be bloody, too.If you have diarrhea, try to eat several small meals or snacks throughout the day instead of three big meals. You should also eat salty foods like soup and pretzels, and potassium-rich foods like bananas and potatoes.


A dangerous secondary symptoms brought on by diarrhea is dehydration. If you are suffering from diarrhea, be sure to drink plenty of water. Eight to ten glasses each day is the recommended amount.
If you or anyone else has diarrhea, disinfect the toilet once your infection has passed. ,


Cramps are often accompanied by diarrhea.

, If you feel nauseous, you might have a campy infection. Following feelings of nausea, you might actually vomit.Keep a trashcan nearby if you feel nauseous, and vomit into it if necessary. After vomiting, rinse your mouth out with water, then spit the water into the sink.

, Don’t take your temperature after you’ve been working out or exposed yourself to a significant source of heat (such as a hot oven, sauna, or a hot summer day). In children, the criteria for a temperature depends on how you’re measuring the child’s temperature. Look for a temperature of:


100.4°F (38°C) if measuring rectally
99.5°F (37.5°C) if measuring orally
99°F (37.2°C) if measuring under the arm

Use supportive treatment measures.,
Find out if antibiotics are warranted for your case.,
Try to connect your infection to a specific instance.,
Know when to call your doctor.Usually, people infected with Campylobacter recover after about one week.,
Get tested.,
Wait it out.If you are healthy, you should recover from your infection within a week.,
Fight the infection with antibiotics.",How to Prevent a Campylobacter Infection4," Treatment of campylobacter is focused on management of acute dehydration, electrolyte status, and nutrition.


Begin rehydrating immediately and maintain hydration through the appropriate fluid intake.You can drink water or sports drinks as well as commercial rehydration products such as Pedialyte or Rehydralyte.
Resume a normal diet as soon as you can tolerate it.

, In some instances, campylobacter treatment may include an antibiotic.A doctor may base the decision of whether or not to use an antibiotic with suspected Campylobacter on a test of your feces.


The decision to use an antibiotic should be carefully weighed against unintended and potentially harmful consequences such as development of super antimicrobial-resistant infections, and worsening diarrhea as the normal flora of the stomach gets eradicated.

, The symptoms of a campy infection often don’t develop immediately. Your symptoms can start anywhere from one to seven days after infection.When you develop the symptoms, try to connect your infection with something you ate, drank, or did that might have brought about the infection.


If you later consult a doctor, he or she might want to know the origin of your infection, and any information you can offer will help them make a better diagnosis.
Knowing where your infection came from can also help you make better choices in the future to prevent another infection.

, However, there are several cases where you should call your doctor for treatment, including:


if you have a fever of 101°F (38.3°C) and above, accompanied by diarrhea.
if your condition deteriorates and your symptoms become more frequent and intense after five to seven days.
if you’re seriously dehydrated. Serious dehydration is characterized by feeling lightheaded, thirsty, and dizzy.
if you have diarrhea and have recently traveled to a foreign nation.
if you see blood in your stool.
if your diarrhea does not become less frequent after five days (or after two days for children).

, If your symptoms are significant enough that you feel talking to a doctor is necessary, he or she will need to run tests to confirm that you have campy. Because many other infections can cause the same symptoms, Campylobacter must be tested for by a doctor. This usually consist of a stool specimen culture. The doctor might also do a blood cell count, with special attention to your white blood cell count.White blood cells are important because they help stop infections.

, In the meantime, drink plenty of fluids. If you are older or immuno-compromised, however, you should seek medical attention.

, If the infection is more severe, a doctor may prescribe antibiotics to shorten the length of your infection. The most common prescription antibiotic is amoxicillin.


There are several natural antibiotic compounds that you might use to reduce the impact of your infection. For instance, cinnamon, garlic powder, oregano, allspice, and onion powder could help you recover."

Fleas multiply fast and the worst an infestation is, the harder it is to treat.Regularly run your hands through your pet's coat to check for the presence of fleas and ticks. This is especially important if your pet goes outside frequently.
If you brush your pet regularly, make a point of checking for fleas and ticks during brushing sessions.
Fleas are very small and slender with tiny wings. It may be difficult to see a flea with a naked eye unless you're looking closely at your pet's coat.;
, If your cats and dogs go outside, or live with animals that do, they are always at a risk for fleas and ticks. It's a good idea to use a preventative flea and tick product. Products such as Frontline, for example, are used to repel fleas and ticks to keep your animals safe from an infection.Such products are usually applied somewhere on the back of a pet's neck, where they're unable to lick the products off.
Make sure you choose the right product for your pet's age, size, and species. It should specify on the package what type of animal a product is safe for. You should never use flea and tick products for dogs on cats or vice versa.
With dogs especially, an animal's weight affects the product you need to use. Smaller dogs will require different spot-on products than big or medium sized dogs. The product's label should say somewhere what weight ranges the products are intended for.

, Fleas can live in furniture, so vacuum frequently if your pet has been exposed to fleas. You should make sure to vacuum furniture, especially in cracks and crevices, as well as carpeting. Do so multiple times a week while an infection persists.You should also wash all your pet's bedding at high heat, as that has likely been exposed to fleas.

, Even indoor cats can be at risk for fleas if debris get inside the home. Wipe off your shoes carefully before entering your house. Sweep out leaves and dirt from outside. Keep the door closed at all times, especially windy days where debris may blow inside., In the event you notice fleas or ticks in your home, there are some commercial sprays you can use to repel fleas and ticks. Such sprays are usually applied around your home or outside your home to keep fleas from entering. They are not meant to be used directly on humans or pets. Make sure these sprays are safe to use if you have young children. Follow directions closely when using sprays.You may have to keep the sprays out of reach of children or pets, and only spray areas where children and pets cannot reach.
You should talk over sprays with your vet ahead of time. Depending on strength of the topical ointments you're applying directly to dogs and cats, your vet may not think sprays are necessary. Fleas are repelled by most flea and tick treatments and will die off if they can't find a host. A solid topical ointment can sometimes repel fleas without the need for other sprays around your home.

, Less grass means bugs like fleas and ticks are less likely to hide in your lawn. Animals running in tall grass may be more likely to become infected with fleas and ticks. Keeping your lawn mowed can help repel bus.

, In addition to mowing, remove weeds and rake any stray leaves regularly. While you cannot completely eliminate bugs in your backyard, you can keep them in check through regular maintenance., If your pets have fleas or ticks, or are infested with tapeworm, wash your hands after handling them. You should encourage young children to do the same. This reduces your risk of contracting tapeworm yourself., As worms are often found in feces, it's important not to leave animal droppings around your house or backyard. This could increase the risk of other pets becoming infected, making household members vulnerable to infection as well.Wear gloves while cleaning up the feces and seal them in a plastic bag.
Dispose of feces in the trash or bury them.

, The main way humans could contract tapeworm is accidentally swallowing a flea. This is fairly unlikely, but in rare cases you may accidentally ingest a flea in your sleep. To prevent this from happening, do not let pets sleep in your bed. This is especially important if you know your pets are currently infected with fleas and ticks., Areas like public parks and dog parks may have a lot of animal feces present. To prevent tapeworm infection, protect your feet when walking in such areas. Always wear close-toed shoes., To prevent an infection from spreading, quarantine animals with fleas and ticks. Keep them in an area away from other dogs and cats. You should also minimize how much physical contact you have from these animals at the time.You can keep your pet in a separate room or, if possible, a crate somewhere outside. You should maintain a normal feeding schedule, but minimize physical contact with your pet.
Wash your hands after handling a pet that's been infected with fleas.

, The easiest way to check your cats and dogs for a tapeworm infection is to check around their anus or in their feces. Look for small white particles that look like grains of rice or sesame seeds.These are tapeworm egg packets. If you see these particles in your pet's feces or around their anus, then they probably have a tapeworm infection and will require a visit to the veterinarian.


You will need to bring a fecal sample to your pet's veterinarian for analysis and diagnosis.

, Tapeworm usually does not have symptoms in humans. It is also very rare to be infected from tapeworm from a pet. However, it may cause symptoms like nausea, weakness, vomiting, loss of appetite, and fever.In rare cases, tapeworm migrate to a host's intensities and cause more serious, invasive infections. These infections cause symptoms like fevers, bacterial infections, lumps or cysts, and seizures.

, In the event a dog or cat does come down with a tapeworm infection, treatment is fairly easy. Tapeworms rarely causes serious health problems in animals, and usually one or two rounds of an oral medication fixes the problem. Your vet will decide which medications are right for your pets depending on their age, size, and breed.Tablets are available for both dogs and cats. Cats also have the option of a spot-on or injectable treatment.

, Humans can also generally treat tapeworm with simple oral medications. Tapeworm rarely causes complications in humans and usually clears up easily with this simple treatment.Praziquantel (Biltricide), Albendazole (Albenza), and Nitazoxanide (Alinia) are the most common medications used to treat tapeworm in humans.
Your doctor will decide which medications work for you based on your age, medical history, current health, and other factors.

, In very rare cases, a tapeworm infection can become invasive. This can lead to cysts developing in the body. To treat this, you may need more intense medications to shrink the cysts.Your doctor may have you undergo ultrasounds to make sure the cysts are shrinking in size.

, In very rare cases, cysts can cause complications that require intensive treatments. If you're experiencing complications, your doctor will go over intensive treatment options with you.If cysts cause seizures, you may need anti-epileptic therapy.
In rare cases, too much fluid may build up in the brain as the result of tapeworms. Your doctor may need to place a tube in your head, called a shunt, to drain the fluid.
Some cysts may need to be removed surgically.

Be financially prepared.",How to Prepare for Gastric Bypass Surgery," If you are interested in gastric bypass surgery, the first thing you will need to do is visit your doctor to find out whether this is a viable option for you. Your doctor will discuss the advantages and risks associated with the surgery, and will assess your need for the surgery.You will also have to have testing done to ensure that you are a good candidate for the surgery.
Discuss alternatives with your doctor. Committing yourself to a healthy lifestyle is the least invasive and least risky way to lose weight.
There are other alternatives to gastric bypass. For example, there is the gastric sleeve, which works in a similar way to gastric bypass, but is a much less-invasive outpatient procedure.;
, Ask for a referral to a specialist in bariatric surgery. Your doctor may set up the specialist consultation for you, or you may need to contact them yourself.Ask your specialist about what pre- and post-op resources the hospital offers to its bariatric surgery patients. The more support you have, the better.
Ask your specialist how experienced they are with the surgery. Just because a surgeon has less experience doesn’t mean they are not a good surgeon. However, more experienced surgeons may know how to deal with complications better.
Ask about complication rates. Find out how many of your specialist’s patients ended up dealing with complications after the surgery. The national average for complications related to gastric bypass surgery is 3.6%. Ideally, your specialist’s complication rate will be below that percentage.
Ask about your surgeon's board certification and if their hospital is a Bariatric Center of Excellence.
Ask your specialist about the expected weight loss and in what time period. You should also ask about the recovery period more generally., A big part of getting gastric bypass surgery involves learning how to live your life after the surgery is complete. The size of your stomach will be much different than it was before, and this will mean you have to change how and what you eat. Nutritional counseling will help you learn how to deal with these changes.For example, you will learn that, as a result of the surgery, your body will not be able to absorb all the calories from the foods you eat. Thus, you will have to make sure that you are eating the right foods to keep you healthy. You will also learn that your meals will need to be smaller.
You might also learn that eating too many carbohydrates and/or sugary foods is likely to make you sick after your surgery., You may need to have a psychological evaluation conducted preoperatively. This is to find out if you are emotionally prepared for the life change required by this type of surgery. If it is not required by your doctor, it may still be a good idea to search for a counselor to help you prepare.Receiving counseling may also be helpful for figuring out reasons behind your obesity. For example, if you believe that you are an ""emotional eater"" a counselor might be able to show you healthier ways to cope with stress. 

, If you are a smoker you should plan to quit several weeks before you get the surgery. If at all possible, you should plan to quit forever. Smoking will make it more difficult for your body to recover, with an increased rate of postoperative complications, including wound infections and pneumonia.Quitting smoking is not easy to do, but it will be a good step towards living a healthier lifestyle.
If you are interested in quitting smoking, talk to your doctor. They can offer you different ideas about how to successfully quit. You can also enlist the support of friends and family, who can help keep you on track. If you have tried quitting in the past, try a different method of quitting than the ones you have used in the past., Tell your doctor about any and all medications you are taking, and ask which ones you should continue taking and which ones you should stop taking. Make sure you also know when you should stop taking them, and when you will be able to start taking them again after surgery. Additionally, your doctor will likely instruct you to switch to a liquid diet about two weeks before your scheduled surgery.Tell them about everything you are taking, no matter how insignificant it may seem. Don’t forget about any vitamins and herbal supplements you take.
Some medications can make it more difficult for your blood to clot, which can be dangerous when you are undergoing major surgery.
If you are asked to switch to a liquid diet, your health care team will likely provide you with a list of liquids that you can consume during this time. If they don’t, be sure to ask what is OK and what is not.
Switching to a liquid diet will help your body prepare for what your diet will be like in the weeks following the surgery.

, When you get home from your surgery you will probably be tired and in some pain. The day before your surgery, make sure you prepare everything you will need so that you can relax and rest when you return.


If you have stairs in your home, you may want to make sure that you have everything you need to live downstairs for the first couple of weeks. It may be painful to walk up stairs for awhile, so having everything you need downstairs might be a good idea.
For example, make sure that the bed where you will rest is made up with clean sheets. Make sure that the TV is set up and ready to watch and that you have lots of movies to keep you entertained. 
You may want to put your laptop, e-reader, or tablet by your bed and make sure the battery is charged, and have the charger plugged in as well.
Make sure that you have plenty of the liquids that have been approved by your doctor ready to go. For example, make sure you have fat-free milk, fruit drinks, and clear high protein soups.The last thing you will want to do is go shopping after you leave the hospital.

, Your doctor will instruct you when to stop eating and drinking, but typically you will need to fast starting at midnight the day before surgery.If you have any medication you have been instructed to take on the day of surgery, take the medication with a small sip of water. You are not allowed to eat or drink because you will be receiving general anaesthesia. This is what puts you to “sleep” during the surgery. There is a risk of vomiting during surgery at the induction of anesthesia, which could cause any food or liquid to go into your lungs and cause lung damage and infection., If your hospital allows it, you may be able to bring some of your own clothes from home that you can wear during your recovery in the hospital. If you can, and want to, pack a bag with everything you will need in the hospital.Stick to loose, pajama like clothing. Comfortable sweat pants, loose t-shirts, and a comfy bathrobe may help you feel a little more like yourself during your recovery.
Don’t forget to pack toiletries, such as a toothbrush and comb. Your hospital may have these on hand, but it can be nice to have some of your own things. 
You will be encouraged to do a bit of walking after your surgery, so pack a pair of non-slip slippers if you want to.
Don’t forget to pack something you can use to entertain yourself. Bring along a book, an e-reader, crosswords, or even a coloring book with some crayons so you have something to do if you get bored.

, Talk to your close family and friends about why you are having the surgery.  Be honest with them about why you feel you need it, and what the benefits and risks are.


You can say something like, “I’ve discussed it with my doctor and we have agreed that having gastric bypass surgery is a good option for me. I have tried to lose the weight in other ways, but I haven’t been successful. I want to live a long and healthier life, so I’m going to have the surgery. I hope that you will be able to support me through this journey.”
Having a strong support system after the surgery will be very beneficial to you and your recovery.

, You will spend a few days recovering in the hospital, but most of your recovery will happen at home.  If you live alone, ask a close friend or family member if they can come over a few times a day to check on you and/or help you out around the house.Talk to your doctors and nurses about what you can and shouldn’t do in the first days after going home. They will provide you with information on how to care for your surgery wounds, what you can eat and/or drink for the first days and weeks.You can then stock your home with everything you will need so you don’t need to go out shopping for awhile.
Don’t forget to arrange a way to get home from the hospital. Ask a friend or family member, or arrange a taxi that will come pick you up. 

, You will probably receive very explicit instructions about what to do on the day of surgery, but it is always better to be too early than too late. Therefore, plan to arrive at least 2 hours before your surgery is scheduled. Showing up well before your surgery is scheduled will help you take care of everything you need to with as little stress as possible.Don’t forget to factor in commute time. If you are driving to the hospital remember to think about what time of day you will be travelling. For example, consider whether or not you will need to go to the hospital in the middle of rush hour traffic. If so, plan to go even earlier to beat the traffic.

, Having surgery can be very scary, but do the best you can to stay relaxed and calm in the hours before your surgery. If you have any questions, be sure to get them answered now. Spend time enjoying the company of any family/friends who have accompanied you to the hospital.


If you are feeling really nervous try doing something to help yourself relax. For example, you could meditate quietly, read something you enjoy, or watch television. Do whatever helps you relax.

, Gastric bypass surgery is done to help people struggling with obesity to lose weight. Typically, this option is only available to those whose life is being threatened by their obesity and who have tried to lose weight using less invasive methods.Generally, you must have a body mass index (BMI) over 40. People with a BMI between 35 and 39 might be eligible if they are also suffering from an obesity-related life-threatening illness (e.g. type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, or high blood pressure).
There are two methods for conducting the surgery. The preferred method is called laparoscopic surgery, and involves conducting the surgery through 5 or 6 small abdominal incisions. The second kind, open surgery, is less common, and involves making a larger incision into the abdomen to perform the procedure.The laparoscopic method is the preferred method because it reduces pain and recovery time. In some cases, perhaps because of previous surgeries, it may not be possible to perform the surgery this way. Don't go into surgery without knowing which method your surgeon plans to use, but be aware that a laparoscopic operation may have to be converted to an open operation to complete the surgery or deal with complications.

, Gastric bypass is not a fix-all for obesity. Though it will help you deal with your obesity, you must also make significant changes to your lifestyle in order for the procedure to be successful.For example, you will need to commit yourself to eating healthy and exercising. Additionally, you will have to commit yourself to long-term health monitoring. This might include regular health checks to make sure you are getting enough nutrients and sticking to a healthier lifestyle.

, Your insurance may or may not cover the costs of the surgery so be sure to check with your health insurance provider. Remember that you will probably need to take time off from work to recover from your surgery so make sure that you will be able to do so.In some cases your insurance may not cover the costs of the surgery. If this is true in your case, talk to your doctor’s office about payment plans.

Make sure your vaccines are up to date.,
Get plenty of sleep each night.,
Stop smoking.,
Wash your hands often.,
Control your blood pressure through medication, diet, and exercise.Your blood pressure may have adverse effects on your immune system, which can cause more serious complications.By controlling your blood pressure and supporting your immune system you can reduce your chances of infection.,
Eat a well-balanced diet with fruits, vegetables, and meat.,
Pay attention to your fluid intake.,
Keep in mind that you will need to wait for the catheter site to heal before you may begin dialysis.,
Find a support group to help you cope with the changes.",How to Prepare for Kidney Dialysis1," Whether you are using peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis, all people with end stage kidney failure should be up to date with their vaccinations to help reduce the potential for infection and illness.


End stage renal disease affects your immune system. The mortality rate is as high as 20% per year for people undergoing dialysis and the major causes are cardiovascular disease and infection.The dysfunction of the immune system is induced by uremia, or higher levels of urea in the blood system.Talk with your doctor about vaccinations for the flu, hepatitis A and B and the pneumococcal vaccination for pneumonia to help prevent these illnesses.;
, Dialysis works best when you are well rested because sleep assists your body in removing waste products. Make sure that you sleep for eight hours each night to support the removal of waste products from your body and brain.If you have any trouble sleeping after starting dialysis, let your doctor know as soon as possible.

, Tobacco increases your white blood cell count, keeping the body under stress fighting the inflammation and damage caused by the chemicals. Nicotine also causes a constriction of the blood vessels, decreasing the level of nutrients and oxygen available to the cells. Tar and other chemicals will also make the immune system less effective in fighting off infections. That means that you will be more likely to get sick and more vulnerable to autoimmune disorders.If you are a smoker, talk to your doctor about getting help to quit. There are many free smoking cessation programs and other treatments that your doctor can tell you about.

, It is important to wash your hands well before and after cooking, after using the bathroom, after being in public or after touching your nose or blowing your nose. Wash your hands after being with other people or with anyone who is sick or appears to be ill. Doing so will help to protect you from getting sick or developing an infection.,


High blood pressure will reduce the amount of oxygen which is delivered to the kidneys and other organs. Although your kidneys have failed, high blood pressure may impact your sight and trigger heart disease.

, You may need to make some changes to your diet depending on your condition. Reduce your carbohydrate and salt intake to reduce the waste products necessary to be removed by dialysis.Speak with your physician about the specific diet he wants you to follow, based on your individual medical requirements.


The National Kidney Foundation recommends eating a high protein diet that is low in salt, potassium and phosphorus. Foods naturally high in protein includes beans and meat.
Avoid processed foods as these are often high in sodium.
Limit your salt intake. Try using herbs and spices to enhance the flavor of your food.
Avoid foods that are high in potassium and phosphorus, such as dark leafy greens, bananas, avocados, squash, potatoes, yogurt, and fish.

, Your doctor may decide to put you on a fluid restricting diet and may even ask you to keep track of the amount of fluids that you consume. Make sure that you discuss your individual needs with your physician., The catheter site will take about two weeks to heal before it may be used for dialysis.After the site has healed, you will receive training on how to prepare your peritoneal dialysis bags and machinery, how to connect and disconnect, how to dispose of the fluid, and when to seek medical attention., Beginning dialysis requires major life adjustments that may be difficult to cope with on your own. Consider joining a support group to help you cope with the changes in your life from kidney failure. You may also benefit from seeking counseling with a therapist, psychologist or pastor.

Anticipate some discomfort.,
Be aware of the cardiovascular risks of dialysis.,
Note any physical discomfort.,
Tell your doctor if you are having trouble sleeping after the procedure.,
Know that anemia is a potential side effect.,
Report any changes in mood.,
Consider the long-term effects of hemodialysis.",How to Prepare for Kidney Dialysis2," Hemodialysis is not a painful procedure. However during the process you may experience nausea and vomiting. If you become nauseated let your nurse know as you may be able to take medication to reduce the discomfort. This will depend upon your medical condition.


During the procedure some people find they are tired and will sleep. This can also help relieve feelings of nausea. Depending upon your medical condition you may also find that you can read a magazine, work on your computer or watch a show on your smartphone. Because your appointment for dialysis will be on the same days and times each week, many patients make friends with the other individuals there for dialysis.

, Dialysis has the potential to cause some serious cardiovascular effects. These effects include low blood pressure, high blood pressure, and pericarditis. Your doctor will monitor you for these conditions, but it is good to be aware of the risks as well.Low blood pressure. Low blood pressure or hypotension, may be a side effect of dialysis, especially for those who have diabetes. This can be accompanied by abdominal cramping, vomiting and shortness of breath. Report feeling these symptoms to your dialysis nurse immediately so changes can be made to the settings on your dialysis procedure.

Increased blood pressure. Taking too much salt or fluid between treatments can increase your blood pressure and your risk of heart disease, heart attack and stroke. Based on your individual medical needs your physician may recommend sodium and fluid intake limits.

Pericarditis. If the hemodialysis is not effective it can lead to pericarditis or an inflammation of the membrane that surrounds the heart. This reduces the efficiency of the heart muscle and can lead to stroke or heart attack.

, Even though dialysis is not a painful treatment, it may be uncomfortable at first. Symptoms such as muscle cramps and itchiness are common complaints during and after hemodialysis.Muscle cramps. Although the exact reason why is not known, adjustments to your sodium intake between and during the treatment can help to reduce muscle cramps.

Itchy skin. It is common to experience itchy skin during and after hemodialysis.

, Talk with your physician if you have trouble sleeping immediately after hemodialysis. You may be experiencing sleep apnea or restless legs from the process. People who use peritoneal dialysis do not appear to have this side effect., Anemia is a common side effect of both kidney failure and dialysis. The hormone erythropoietin is responsible for the production of red blood cells but is made in the kidney. Your doctor will most likely want you to have regular blood tests to check your iron levels.Talk with your physician if you experience fatigue, shortness of breath, or believe that you may have anemia.

, Changes in mood are common for people going through dialysis, but there are treatments to help with this side effect. Tell your doctor right away if you experience sadness, depression, or other disruptive mood changes.Changes in mood can be related to biochemical changes from the dialysis and kidney failure or from the experience.
Support groups and counseling with a therapist or pastor can help when the mood changes are related to the experience you are going through and not just from biochemical changes in your blood.

, After approximately five years on dialysis, your risk of developing amyloidosis increases. When proteins in the blood are deposited in the joints and tendons it causes pain, stiffness and fluid retention in the joint areas.If you believe you are experiencing these symptoms, discuss your options with your physician. They will depend upon your kidney function, overall health and dialysis prescription.

Recognize the symptoms of and triggers for kidney failure.,
Watch for later symptoms of kidney failure.,
Identify the signs of end stage kidney failure.,
Ask your doctor about peritoneal dialysis.,
Discuss hemodialysis with your doctor.",How to Prepare for Kidney Dialysis3," When kidneys start to fail, symptoms related to fluid balance, electrolyte balance, clearing waste products, and production of red blood cells. The early symptoms may also mimic other illnesses, which can be confusing. If you experience these symptoms and they don’t resolve within a few days or there does not seem to be another cause, see a doctor.Symptoms to watch for include:


Appetite loss
General feelings of fatigue
Headaches
Itchy, dry skin
Nausea
Weight loss (when you are not trying to lose weight)

, Later symptoms occur when kidney function has gotten much worse and the kidneys can no longer filter waste products from the blood. Symptoms of later kidney failure include:Skin color changes
Drowsiness or problems with concentration and thinking
Muscle twitching and cramps
Bone pain
Numbness or swelling of the hands and feet
Blood in the stool
Frequent hiccups
Excessive thirst
Amenorrhea (in women, menstrual periods stop)
Sleep difficulties
Shortness of breath
Vomiting (more often in the mornings)

, End stage kidney failure is the result of damage done to the kidneys. The final stage is called End Stage Renal Disease or ESRD, in which the kidneys are no longer able to filter enough waste products from the blood. At this point your body will either need kidney dialysis or a kidney transplant to keep working. Two of the most common reasons that ESRD develops is diabetes and high blood pressure or hypertension. Other conditions that may increase the potential for ESRD are:Birth defects of the kidneys, such as polycystic kidney disease
Injury to the kidney
Kidney stones and infections
Problems with the arteries that supply oxygen and nutrients to the kidneys
Certain medications used to treat cancer or pain can damage the kidneys and cause failure
Some toxic chemicals
Autoimmune diseases such as scleroderma or systemic lupus erythematosus
Reflux, or when urine flows back from the bladder to the kidneys and damages the organ
Other kidney diseases

, Peritoneal dialysis does not require large machines, so you can undergo this form of dialysis at home. Before you can have peritoneal dialysis, a surgeon will need to place a special catheter (tube) into your abdominal cavity. Using this tube, a special dialysis solution, called dialysate, will be administered. This solution pulls waste products from your blood supply which is then filtered through the tissue in your belly. There are two forms of peritoneal dialysis: Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) and Automated Peritoneal Dialysis (APD).Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis. Three times per day, you will deliver about two quarts of fluid into your belly through your abdominal catheter. This will be followed by an overnight ""dwell,"" i.e. fluid that remains in the peritoneal cavity overnight. Afterwards, the fluid will need to be drained and thrown away. Both insertion and drainage are done using gravity.

Automated Peritoneal Dialysis. While you are sleeping, a machine at cycles fluid in and out of your belly. You will spend 30 minutes hooking up the dialysis solution and machine prior to going to sleep. In the morning it can take approximately 10 minutes to unhook the machinery and remove the solution. You will save the filters and return those to the dialysis center each week, where you will pick up another set of filters to be used the following week.

, Hemodialysis must be done at a hospital or dialysis center. This process uses special machinery to pull blood from your body, filter the waste products and return the blood back to your body. During hemodialysis two filters are used. One will filter your blood for waste products and the second is used to filter the fluid used to wash the blood.The machine filter is sometimes called an artificial kidney or dialyzer. Prior to your first dialysis a surgeon will place an access port in your body. There are three types of ports which may be used.Fistula. A fistula is an access made in surgery by joining an artery and vein in the arm. This access supplies both arterial and venous blood to the machine.

Graft. A graft may be used with a catheter to join an artery and vein in the arm.

Catheter. A catheter may be placed into a large vein in your neck if immediate access is required during acute kidney failure. This catheter is not a permanent solution, but used for temporary immediate access.

There are two types of catheters. Non-tunneled catheters, which are for temporary use, are easy to insert either in the neck (internal jugular vein), under the collar bone (subclavian vein) or in the groin (femoral vein). Tunneled catheters are tunneled through the skin and fat tissues into the vein, usually under the collar bone, and can be used as long-term vascular access for dialysis in patients who cannot have a fistula or graft.

Avoid contact with infected fecal matter.,
Prevent infection in your animals.,
Ensure that all human and animal waste is properly discarded away from water or food sources.,
Practice good hand hygiene.",How to Prevent a Dwarf Tapeworm Infection1," Because dwarf tapeworm eggs are transmitted through human and animal feces, you should try to avoid contact with fecal matter as much as possible. This is especially important for those working in fields, such as healthcare, child care, or waste management, where exposure to human waste is a possibility.;
, If you work with, or own livestock or pet animals (especially rats, or other mammals such as dogs), ensure that they are treated with de-worming medication so that they cannot become infected and pass tapeworm eggs along to you. , Tapeworm eggs are transmitted through their hosts' fecal matter, so proper disposal will help ensure that any existing tapeworm infections are not spread.

, If you do come into contact with your own, or others', feces (when working with livestock, changing an infant's diaper, using the toilet, etc.), immediately wash your hands with antibacterial soap and running water for at least 60 seconds to ensure that no tapeworm eggs survive to accidentally be ingested by you later on. If soap and water isn't available to you, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer can be used. Always wash your hands before preparing food.


Frequently washing your hands not only prevents you from accidentally ingesting, and becoming infected by, tapeworm eggs; it also ensures that, even if you've already become infected, you won't pass on the infection to others, or re-infect yourself."

Avoid contaminated water.,
Be mindful of contaminated soil.,
Inspect all potentially contaminated food for pests, or their droppings.,
Clean and prepare vegetables properly.,
Cook meat and fish properly.,
Freeze meat and fish for storage.",How to Prevent a Dwarf Tapeworm Infection2," Water which has been exposed to infected fecal matter can transmit tapeworm eggs into your system if you accidentally ingest it by drinking, cooking, or bathing with the contaminated water. If you live in, or are visiting, a part of the world where water is not commonly sanitized, be sure to boil, filter or otherwise sanitize any water you intend to drink or use for bathing or food preparation. , Foods can become contaminated with dwarf tapeworm eggs when they are grown or exposed to soil contaminated by livestock. pay attention to the presence of such soil, and wash any food you suspect may have become contaminated thoroughly before cooking., Rats and pest insects are among the most common carriers of tapeworm eggs, and you should be wary of food which may have come into contact with such critters., Be sure to wash, peel or thoroughly cook them before eating (making sure that any water you use has been treated, and is safe for consumption) to ensure that no tapeworm eggs or infected soil remain. , Meat and fish which has come into contact with tapeworm-carrying pests can become infected, and pass tapeworm eggs along to you when you consume it. Any potentially infected meat or fish should be cooked through to a temperature of at least 66C (150F) to ensure that no tapeworm eggs survive. Smoking or drying meat and fish is not sufficient to kill tapeworm eggs.

, Freezing to for 24 hours will reliably destroy any tapeworm eggs. Because tapeworm eggs and their pest carriers can't survive low temperatures, this will also ensure that your meat and fish is not infected during storage."

Pick the best stall.,
Gather your supplies.,
Find some privacy.,
Try squatting.,
Wipe thoroughly.,
Tidy up the area.,
Wash your hands.,
Consider anxiety.,
Avoid public restrooms.,
Talk to your doctor.",How to Poop While Standing up at a Toilet," If you have to poop and find that a public restroom with multiple stalls is your only choice, you can at least pick the stall that will best suit your purposes. First and foremost, make sure that the stall you are in has a functioning lock. The last thing you want is to be interrupted midway through defecating. If cleanliness is a top priority, choose one of the stalls closest to the door. There is research indicating these are used less frequently, so they are typically cleaner.;
, You will need toilet paper. Before starting to relieve yourself, check to make sure that the stall or room has plenty of toilet paper and that you can easily reach it. Try placing a small amount of toilet paper in the toilet before you poop. This will help you to avoid having an excessive amount of water splash back up as you do your business.Consider having some hygienic wipes in your pocket or in your purse. You'll find them useful during the cleaning process.
Take some paper towels into the stall with you. They will be more effective than toilet paper in helping to clean up any resulting mess.
If you know that you are going to be in a situation where you need to poop standing up, try to make it easier on yourself by choosing your clothing wisely. Ladies, a skirt would be the easiest for you. Simply gather it up and hold it around your waist. Gentlemen, avoid wearing your best pair of dress slacks. This option can potentially be messier than if you choose to sit on the toilet, and you don't want to soil your good clothes.

, Some people become nervous before using a public restroom. If this applies to you, there are some steps you can take to make the experience as private as possible. Try to scope out a restroom that is not near the entrance or lobby of a building. These will likely have less traffic, and you will have a better chance of being in the restroom by yourself. Hopefully, that will help ease any tension.


If you are using this method at a friends house, you might be concerned that someone will overhear your bathroom activities. Try running water in the sink as you use the toilet. This will create a sound barrier and you might have an increased sense of privacy.

, You will actually need to poop squatting, not standing straight up. This will help you make sure that you are aiming properly, and help ensure that you hit the toilet. Squatting will also provide stability, so you will be less likely to wobble.Bend your knees slightly, and lean forward a little bit to squat. You can also try using your hands to spread your cheeks. This might make the process a little faster and easier for you.

, It is possible that pooping while standing (or squatting) makes it a little harder to control exactly where your bowel movements go. For this reason, it is especially important that you make sure to wipe your bottom properly and thoroughly. Make sure to always wipe from front to back.Be gentle, but firm as you wipe.
If possible, wet a piece of paper towel or toilet paper (very slightly) to help clean yourself.
Consider carrying sanitary wipes with you. Make sure they are not perfumed, or they may irritate your genital region.

, If you have caused any splashing, use a paper towel, toilet paper, or sanitary wipe to mop up the mess. You should also consider wiping the toilet seat if you left any residue. If you used a seat cover, make sure to dispose of it in the toilet or trash receptacle., Thoroughly washing your hands is one of the best ways to avoid spreading germs. Use hot, not scalding water, and soap. Rub your hands together briskly under the water for at least 20 seconds.Dry your hands thoroughly, using a clean towel or hand dryer.
If a sink is not available, you can substitute hand sanitizer.

, Consider the reasons that you want to use a standing method to go to the bathroom. Are you nervous about germs that are in public restrooms? Do you fear picking up a disease? While these fears are common, there is very little chance that you will become ill from a public toilet. Try to find ways to address your anxiety.If you feel that your fears are interfering with your day to day life, ask your doctor for advice. He can provide you with tips on dealing with anxiety, and if necessary, can refer you to a mental health specialist.
Take deep breaths. This will help your body and your mind relax.

, Before heading to work or to a social event, give yourself time to go to the bathroom at home. Build this activity into your schedule. For example, if you typically have a bowel movement early in the morning, try waking up a bit earlier or leaving for work a little later to allow enough time. Don't rush yourself out the door., If your bowel movements are unpredictable, talk to your doctor. Most people find themselves needing to poop on a fairly regular schedule. If you're having trouble predicting when you need to go, you might be suffering from irritable bowel syndrome or another ailment.Don't be afraid to talk to your doctor in detail about your bowel movement. The more descriptive you are, the more likely it is that he will be able to offer a diagnosis and a treatment.

Be courteous.,
Avoid conversation.,
Don't linger.,
Avoid reading materials.,
Find a different restroom.,
Muffle the sounds.,
Clean up after yourself.,
Ask for air-fresheners in the stall.,
Make sure there is enough toilet paper.",How to Poop at Work," Don't talk about other people's bathroom habits. If you happen to recognize someone in the restroom, don't mention it.Don't make jokes at anyone's expense, and don't draw attention to someone in a stall.;
, Don't try to talk to someone in the stall next to you. While you may have a great work relationship with someone, they may not want to have a conversation between the stalls.Be considerate of others using the restroom.

You should always wash your hands after using the restroom., If you're embarrassed about the smells that come from the stall, ask your supervisor to buy some spray air freshener for each stall.If you can't convince your supervisor to invest in any air fresheners, you could bring your own from home, or carry a book of matches. Lighting a match can often help eliminate bad smells., If you notice the toilet paper in your stall is running low, refill it. If you don't have access to refilling it, let the person who maintains the restroom know that it needs attention."

Understand that some stones are easier to pass naturally than others.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Add lemon to your diet.,
Limit your salt and protein intake.,
Increase your fiber intake.,
Skip the soft drinks.,
Stay active.,
Reduce stress.",How to Pass a Kidney Stone1," How readily a stone responds to home treatment mostly depends on the size of the stone.


Home treatments are usually effective on stones less than 1/10-inch (3 mm).
Once kidney stones reach about 3/10-inch (8 mm), they are only 20 percent likely to pass on their own with home treatment.
Stones that are 2/5-inch (1 cm) almost always need professional medical treatment.;
, Water assists your kidneys by flushing them out, so you should increase your water intake to as much as 2 to 3 quarts (1.9 to 2.8 liters) daily.You should drink enough fluid to produce clear or nearly clear urine each time you make a bathroom visit. Water is the best option.

, Occasionally squeeze a lemon into your water or consume foods made with lemon juice.


Lemon is high in citric acid, which is thought to be effective at breaking up calcium-based kidney stones. As the stones break down, they become easier and less painful to pass.Try to consume 1/2 cup (125 ml) of pure lemon juice daily.Note that other juices are far less effective. In fact, cranberry juice, apple juice, and grapefruit juice may increase your risk for developing kidney stones rather than helping you to break the stones up.

, Reduce your sodium intake to 3 g or less per day and consume meat protein in moderation.


Salt increases calcium in the urine, which can complicate calcium-based kidney stones. Some studies suggest that sodium also increases urate, a substance that triggers kidney stone formation.
Protein increases levels of uric acid, calcium, and oxalate in the urine while decreasing citrate. Meat protein is especially problematic since it has a higher content of sulfur, thereby producing more acid than vegetable protein.

, Consume more whole grains and fresh vegetables while attempting to pass a kidney stone.


Many fiber-rich foods contain phytate which can help prevent and reduce the crystallization of stone-causing calcium salts. This compound is found in legumes, wheat, and rice bran.

, On the other hand, coffee and tea is generally considered acceptable, especially if it is decaffeinated.


Soft drinks with phosphoric acid reduce citrate levels in the urine, complicating the condition. Those that contain citrate may be acceptable, however.
Note that water is still the best beverage to drink for kidney stones, even if coffee and tea are considered safe.
Avoid caffeine as much as possible. Some sources indicate that caffeine is safe while others suggest that the dehydrating nature of caffeine can cause complications. Opt for caffeine-free beverages to play things safe.

, Regular physical activity can help keep the kidney stones moving, so mild to moderate exercise is recommended.


Since kidney stones can be so painful, you may not be able to get much exercise in. Try light exercise, like walking, and rest as needed to reduce pain. You need to keep moving, but you can and should rest when the pain becomes too hard to bear.

, Some connection may exist between kidney stone formation and stress. While it is not clear that reducing your stress will help you to pass existing stones, it will at least help prevent the formation of new stones, thereby preventing further complications with existing stones.

Take an alpha-blocker.,
Ask about cause-based medications.",How to Pass a Kidney Stone2," Alpha-blockers relax smooth muscle in the body and are often used to treat kidney stones, prostate problems, and high blood pressure.Alpha-blockers can be used to treat all types of kidney stones. Other medications are prescribed specifically depending on the cause of the stone.
The most commonly prescribed alpha-blocker might be Tamsulosin. Additional alpha-blockers include Alfuzosin, Doxazosin, Silodosin, and Terazosin.

, Some prescription medications are only used to treat stones caused by certain problems.While some medications may help you to pass a kidney stone, others are primarily used for kidney stone prevention.


Calcium-based stones are the most common type of kidney stone. Medications used to treat them include thiazides, potassium citrates, and orthophosphates.
Uric acid stones account for 5 to 10 percent of kidney stones. Potassium citrate, sodium bicarbonate, and allopurinol are used to treat these.
Cystine stones are much rarer and usually treated with potassium citrate, penicillamine, tiopronin, or captopril.
Struvite stones come about as the result of frequent kidney infections and can be difficult to treat with medication. Your doctor will likely prescribe an antibiotic to treat any current infection and may prescribe urease inhibitors.

"
"
Try shock wave lithotripsy.,
Ask about a ureteroscopy.,
Go in for percutaneous nephrolithotomy.",How to Pass a Kidney Stone3," Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL) is used to treat 80 to 90 percent of large kidney stones unless they are located in the lower third of the ureter.


With ESWL, the patient lays under a machine called a lithotripter. This machine sends high-pressure sound waves through the patient's body. The shock waves are strong enough to break large stones into smaller pieces, which can then be passed normally through urination.

, This procedure can be used to break up or remove large kidney stones.A long, tube-like instrument called a Ureteroscope is inserted through the urethra and bladder to the ureter, where kidney stones usually form and get stuck.
A special tool may be used to remove the stone, but if it is too large, a laser will be used to break the stone into smaller pieces that can pass through urination.

, This procedure is similar to a ureteroscopy, but it is slightly more involved and generally used for more serious stones.


A tube is inserted directly into the kidney through an incision in the back. A probe sends shock waves through the stone to break it up, and a small tube called a nephrostomy tube is inserted into the kidney to drain urine and residual stone fragments.
The patient usually stays in the hospital for two or three days following the initial procedure.

Avoid simple carbohydrates.,
Eat seeds.,
Consume garlic.",How to Perform a Parasite Cleanse1," Parasites often feed on sugar; you need to cut off the parasite’s food supply to weaken it in your body.Try and avoid these carbohydrates for at least a week to be effective.


Simple carbohydrates are the sugars naturally or unnaturally in food. Some examples of simple carbs include brown sugar, syrup, raw sugar, corn syrup, fruit juice concentrates.Simple carbs can also be found in non-whole-grain breads.
Try and consume more complex carbohydrates; these are carbs with more dietary fiber than sugar. Foods high in complex carbs include barley, brown rice, oatmeal, and seeds.;
, Seeds from pumpkins, flax, and papaya are natural and effective ways to weaken and remove intestinal parasites.. Studies have shown that, over a period of a week, eating raw seeds benefits patients.Flax seeds have been categorized as a “super food” in aiding certain digestive ailments.Certain raw seeds, like pumpkin, can even be beneficial in helping remove parasites in pets.Always talk to your vet before trying this.

, Garlic, another superfood, also helps weaken parasites by boosting your body’s immune response.It is recommended to take two garlic tablets three times a day at meals for ten days to see results."

Try herbs or other more natural ingredients.,
Fast with fermented drinks.,
Eat more fiber.",How to Perform a Parasite Cleanse2," Combining natural ingredients will kill the parasite in your body and can be flushed out naturally in your waste.Combine these three natural ingredients together (which can often be purchased in capsule form) to kill adult parasites and their eggs.


Black walnut shells (can be purchased in tincture form)
Wormwood (200-300 mg capsule)
Cloves (500 mg capsule)

, Experts recommend a 3-21 day low-calorie fast with fermented drinks such as fermented whey, fermented ginger, or coconut kefir, or apple cider vinegar, to help rid the body of parasites.

, Once the parasite has been killed, it needs to be flushed through your body and through your waste. Eat foods high in fiber to help expedite this process.High fiber foods include:


Lettuce
Swiss chard
Carrots
Spinach
Legumes
Broccoli

Network.",How to Overcome Hepatitis C," You need to see an accredited medical practitioner for this. You can see your own doctor or seek out some information regarding the medical/health centers in your district if you don't wish your ""family"" doctor to be aware of your testing or results. Hepatitis C testing is done on blood and must be specifically tested for; it will not appear during a non-specific screen of your blood, such as a hemoglobin count or blood sugar test., A positive diagnosis of Hepatitis C is not the end of testing. You will also be tested for genotype and liver function. Other tests may also be performed to determine how much of HVC virus is in your blood.There are six different types of hepatitis C and some respond differently to treatments, so determining the genotype may help your doctor to decide on the best course of treatment.After your blood test, you may also need to have a liver biopsy to determine the extent of the damage to your liver., Your medical identity is private and there are strict laws which doctors and medical staff must abide by concerning your confidentiality, which is why results must be passed on to you in person, rather than over the phone. So make sure you schedule and attend a follow-up appointment to get the results and discuss them with your doctor., Take this opportunity to ask as many questions about your condition as you can. Find out what you need to do regarding your options and alternatives for treatment or management of your condition and support organizations. You will usually find a group in your area or online that supports sufferers of your condition and their friends and families. Tap into the resources if you feel that they will help. You may wish to ask:How much of the HVC virus is in my blood?Do I have any other viruses, like Hepatitis B, affecting my liver?What are my treatment options? What are the benefits and drawbacks of each option?Do I need treatment or will the virus go away on its own?Can I spread the HVC virus? What should I do to avoid this?Do I need to come back for follow-up visits? If so how often?Arm yourself with information about your condition, but avoid becoming obsessive or reading everything written by everyone- especially on the internet. Facts and figures and forums will not help you cure or manage your condition, but good information just might., Find a doctor who you feel comfortable talking to about your condition. It will make a huge difference in the way you see your own role in managing your condition or seeking a cure.If you do not feel comfortable with your current doctor, then start looking for a new one.

, It is possible to treat and effectively clear your blood of Hepatitis C with proper medical care and monitoring. There are medications available and yo will also need to be vaccinated against Hepatitis A and B.In most patients, Hepatitis C does not present in physical symptoms until the disease has progressed to a later phase. That is why it is critical to catch this disease in its early stages.The earliest manifestations of acute Hepatitis C usually occur around one to three months after infection, but even these symptoms don’t occur in all patients. Things to look for include:Chronic or excessive fatigue
Dwindling appetite and frequent nausea
Stomach pains
Yellow discoloration of the eyes and skin
Fever and joint pain
Dark or cloudy urine

, However, these symptoms are quite serious and are related to damage the disease is doing to your liver. The advanced symptoms to look for are:Easy bruising or bleeding
The accumulation of fluid in your abdomen
Itchy skin or swelling in the legs
Excessive weight loss, drowsiness and slurred speech
The appearance of “spider-like” blood vessels on your skin
If the disease is left untreated for a long time, it can lead to scarring of the liver, decreased liver function, and, ultimately, liver failure. This usually doesn’t occur until decades after the initial infection.

, The symptoms you will deal with are not set in stone. Different people experience the symptoms of Hepatitis C differently and at different times. Therefore, you will want to treat your symptoms individually as they occur and in consultation with your doctor.First and foremost, Hepatitis C only presents acute symptoms in 25% of all infections. Therefore, it is statistically likely that whatever symptoms you may be experiencing are actually the result of another, unrelated medical problem. Be sure to consult your doctor regarding any and all symptoms that you think may be related to Hepatitis C, because they may not be in reality.When fighting physical fatigue, your doctor may be able to recommend supplements that give you energy and revitalize you. Also you need to stay positive and try to get as much exercise as you can. A positive mental attitude, even when you're body is feeling run down, can really help your energy levels. Also, exercise is a great way to naturally boost your energy levels. So work through the fatigue and you may begin to feel better.In cases where you are feeling mentally run down, often described by Hep-C sufferers as a ""brain fog"", you should try doing puzzles, crosswords, or mind exercises on a daily basis.Excessive nausea and lack of appetite are both treatable symptoms. Try eating small portions more frequently throughout the day. Also, you can loading more nutrients and vitamins into more easily digestible meals, like casseroles or soups. Try adding beans and eggs, both high in protein, to your next dish. Also, try eating simple foods with spreads on them. If you are having pancakes, spread some butter or peanut butter on them and so on. These activities may help you gain back weight and keeping a consistent eating schedule can help reduce nausea. If you find that problems persist, ask your doctor to suggest a dietary expert.Joint pain and muscle aches can be managed with simple measures, like taking a warm bath, getting a massage or taking a OTC painkiller like aspirin or ibuprofen.Any chronic symptoms of Hepatitis C, such as jaundice, liver damage or liver failure, will need to be treated with prescription medication or actions (like surgery) that must be carried out by a medical professional., Contrary to popular belief, sexual intercourse is not the primary cause of Hepatitis C infection. Hepatitis C is transmitted through direct contact with infected blood. Taking some simple precautions can help you not put others at risk of contracting the disease. Some of these precautions are:Don’t share personal hygiene products, like razors or tweezers.Don’t get a tattoo or piercing.Don’t use intravenous drugs. You probably shouldn’t do this anyways, but if you do use intravenous drugs, never share a needle.Never tend to another person’s wound without taking protective precautions (i.e.wear gloves and make sure your hands are free of cuts)Keep in mind that you can still kiss, hug, hold hands, share silverware, and breast feed without worrying about passing on the disease.

, Drinking alcohol will accelerate the progress of your hepatitis C, so do not drink alcohol at all. This may be difficult, especially if you are dependent on alcohol or if drinking is a big part of you social life, but it is necessary to prevent further liver damage.If you cannot stop drinking on your own, talk to your doctor. You may need to go through a treatment program to stop drinking.
Many medications and other drugs, including marijuana, can damage your liver as well. Do not try to replace alcohol with drugs, prescription or otherwise.

, Being overweight and consuming fatty and/or greasy foods puts more strain on your liver. Stick to a low fat diet and do your best to lose weight if you are overweight or maintain a healthy weight.A healthy immune system is critical to fighting off Hepatitis C, so eat well, sleep well and exercise. The stronger your immune system is, the better chance you have of kicking Hepatitis C to the curb., Always remember, your illness, disease, or medical condition is not your identity. It is something you have, not something you are. Never let the disease define you and keep a positive mental outlook., As stated above, most people operate under the impression that Hepatitis C is a sexually transmitted disease or directly related to intravenous drug use. While having a STD or a drug problem really shouldn’t cause shame or embarrassment, some segments of our society still stigmatize people with STDs and drug problems. When you encounter people who are misinformed or uneducated about Hepatitis C, you may want to take some time to explain the realities of the disease and its transmission to them., You may have to eliminate some regular activities or take some extra precautions in your work or personal life to avoid worsening your condition or spreading the disease. You don’t need to make an announcement about your medical condition every time this happens. Also, your medical history and condition are your business and no one else’s, so don’t feel forced to disclose anything to anyone.Remember, choosing not to tell others about your condition should not make you feel ashamed or guilty of the condition itself.
You need to tell any medical professionals you are seeing about your condition, especially dentists, because it is spread by blood and they need to take proper precautions.
While sexual intercourse is not the primary cause of Hepatitis C infection, it is probably wise to disclose your condition to sexual partners because the disease can potentially spread through unprotected sex. This will allow you and your partner to take necessary precautions.

, There are local, national and international support groups for people who are coping with Hepatitis C. Interacting with these support groups can rejuvenate your outlook on your condition, teach you useful coping mechanisms, and can provide you with a safe space to discuss Hepatitis C with people who can commiserate.Many of these support groups are found online. Try looking at hepatitisccentral.com or hvcsupport.com for some examples."

Add 1/2 cup of virgin olive oil, then replace the lid and shake the jar vigorously to combine.
Drink this grapefruit and oil mixture (through a straw if necessary) and then go to bed and lie down immediately — this is important for the cleanse to work property.
Lie on your right side with your right knee tucked up towards your chest. Try to sleep.

, The next morning, drink another 3/4 cup of the Epsom salts immediately upon waking, then drink the final portion 2 hours later.


After another 2 hours, you can transition back to drinking fruit juice and to solid food two hours after that — just make sure that whatever you eat is light and healthy.
You can expect to have one or more bowel movements the morning of the liver cleanse. You may see round, green stones in your waste — these are gallstones. Having gallstones in your waste is completely normal and means that the cleanse has worked well."

Allow your body to recover from the cleanse.",How to Make a Liver Cleanse2," This detox is used to cleanse the liver and colon, clearing out toxic waste in order to eliminate bloating, increase energy levels and aid weight loss efforts.


To perform this cleanse, you will need unsweetened cranberry juice, cinnamon, ground ginger, nutmeg, 2-3 oranges, 2-3 lemons and several packets of stevia (a natural sweetener).

, Before you perform this cleanse, it's essential that you prepare your liver by following a healthy diet in the 7 days running up to the cleanse. This will help you to avoid feeling tired and sluggish on the day of the cleanse.


Eat lots of green leafy vegetables (lettuce, cabbage, kale), cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts), citrus fruits, sulfur-rich foods (eggs, garlic and onions) and liver-healing foods (asparagus, beets, celery).
Also make sure to drink plenty of water (72 fluid oz per day) and avoid any high fat or processed foods, refined carbohydrates or gluten products. You should also cut out alcohol, caffeinated beverage and any non-necessary medications.

, On the morning of the cleanse, prepare the cranberry drink. First, dilute the unsweetened cranberry juice to a quarter of its original strength with filtered water, to make 72 fluid oz of liquid. Add this cranberry water to a saucepan and bring to a low boil over a medium heat.


Add a teaspoon each of ground cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg to a tea ball and place in the boiling cranberry water. For a stronger infusion, place the spices directly into the liquid. Allow the cranberry water to simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, then take off the heat and allow to cool.
Once cooled, squeeze the oranges and lemons and add the juice to the cranberry water. Taste the liquid and add a couple of packets of stevia for sweetness, if desired.

, On the day of your cleanse, drink the cranberry water one 8oz glass at a time.


Alternate between drinking the cranberry water and drinking regular, filtered water throughout the day, until you have consumed at least 72 fluid oz of each. Be forewarned — you will need to pee a lot!
You should also take a colon-caring supplement (such as 2 teaspoons of powdered psyllium husks or 2 tablespoons of ground flaxseed) twice throughout the day — once in the morning and once in the evening.

, For the three days following the cleanse, you should follow the same dietary guidelines as required for the week before the cleanse, otherwise the results won't be as good.


You should also try to incorporate some healthy bacteria into your diet, from organic, raw sauerkraut or plain yogurt containing live, active cultures."

However, it also has an array of other benefits, such as aiding digestion, promoting weight loss and clearing acne.
Keep in mind that apple cider vinegar will only work as a liver detoxifier if combined with a healthy balanced diet.

, Be certain to buy organic unfiltered apple cider vinegar, as this contains a higher nutritional content.


Shake the bottle before pouring to distribute the thicker, hazier-looking layer at the bottom — this is known as ""the mother"" and is the most nutritious part of the vinegar.

, Apple cider vinegar can be used to detox your liver on an ongoing basis and doesn't require any fasting.


All you need to do is add 2 to 3 teaspoons of the vinegar to an 8oz glass of water and drink it before every meal.
Alternatively, you can add 1 or 2 tablespoons of the apple cider vinegar to a large glass of water and drink it first thing in the morning, on an empty stomach.

, Alternative ways to add more apple cider vinegar to your diet include:


Making a tea by adding a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar to hot water and adding honey to sweeten.

Drink detoxifying teas.",How to Make a Liver Cleanse4," Garlic is a great addition to your diet when you're trying to cleanse your liver, as it activates enzymes in the liver that help to clear out toxins. It also contains two natural compounds called allicin and selenium which support healthy liver function., Green, leafy vegetables such as spinach, kale, arugula, dandelion greens and chicory provide a multitude of liver-cleansing benefits -- they eliminate heavy metals, pesticides and herbicides (which wreak havoc on the liver) and increase the production and flow of healthy bile.

, Grapefruit contains a special protein called glutathione which attaches itself to toxins before eliminating them from the body. Enjoying a whole grapefruit or drinking a glass of freshly-squeezed grapefruit juice with breakfast aids the liver cleansing process along with boosting your bodies vitamin C, pectin and antioxidant content.

, Avocados are also high in glutathione, a compound which protects the liver from toxins and ensures proper liver function. Some research has suggested that eating just 1 to 2 avocados per week for a minimum of 30 days could help to reverse liver damage., Walnuts contain glutathione, an amino acid called l-arginine and omega-3 fatty acids, all of which help to detoxify the liver and lower ammonia — high levels of which are responsible for many diseases. Try munching on a handful of walnuts as a snack, or sprinkling them over a salad., Turmeric is something of a liver-cleansing superfood — it protects the liver from toxins and helps to regenerate damaged liver cells. It also boosts bile production and supports the healthy function of the gall bladder, another purifying organ. Try adding turmeric to lentil curries and stewed vegetable dishes to take advantage of its detoxifying benefits.

, There are certain foods and ingredients that work against the liver, overloading it with toxins and hindering its proper function. Such foods include processed, fatty foods like preserved meat (sausages, corned beef), deep fried food, margarine and hydrogenated oils, and any food that contains artificial colors and flavors.

, There are many natural supplements which can help to detoxify the liver and promote liver health. Some of the most popular include malic acid, burdoc, dandelion root and milk thistle. These can be found at the pharmacy or health food store and should be taken according to the instructions on the packaging., Certain herbal teas are believed to flush toxins and fat deposits from the liver, while also increasing hydration levels. The best teas for liver cleansing include ingredients such as dandelion root, ginger, clove, burdock root, chamomile, cinnamon and horsetail. Try to drink at least two cups of herbal tea per day and sweeten with honey if necessary.

Brush with water and rinse.",How to Use Disclosing Tablets," While anyone can use disclosing tablets to improve their brushing habits, their use is particularly necessary for people with certain dental conditions.Braces and other orthodontic appliances can make brushing and plaque removal very difficult around the wires. Disclosing tablets will help identify these areas for spot cleaning.
If you have any form of gum disease like periodontitis or gingivitis, disclosing tablets are excellent idea for determining the level of plaque around your gum line. Even a small amount of plaque left over can aggravate your condition.
If you are at a high risk of tooth decay, then your dentist may also instruct you to use them to ensure that you are properly brushing in the colored areas.
Implants, bridges and dentures can make plaque removal more difficult and cause serious oral health problems if not cleaned properly. Use disclosing tablets to find your problem areas.
Children are excellent candidates for disclosing tablets both because it will help them develop better brushing habits and may make brushing more fun for them. The dye is made of vegetable concentrates so it’s perfectly safe for kids of all ages.;
, Although many people use disclosing tablets at their dentist’s recommendation, they do not require a prescription. The tablets are available at any major retailer or drug store. The packages vary in size and the smaller packages typically cost as little as $5., While the tablets are very effective, there are other disclosing products that will serve a similar purpose.


Disclosing swabs can be used to wipe the surface of your teeth.
Disclosing solution can be swished around like mouth wash.
Disclosing floss can be used like regular string floss. It is the best way to disclose plaque between teeth.

, The dye from disclosing tablets will not fade very quickly and can last for several hours, even after brushing and rinsing repeatedly. Because of this, you’ll want to wait until you’re able to stay home for the remainder of the day before using them. Otherwise, you’ll look quite strange in public with brightly colored dye on your teeth.Beware of staining clothing or bath linen. The dye can leave lasting stains so move any towels out of the way before you start. You may want to take off your shirt as well and clean the sink immediately after you rinse to prevent stains.

, Brush and floss as you normally would before using the tablets.

, Chew up the tablet so that it’s completely dissolved. You can use your finger to spread it around on your teeth.


If you don’t color all of your teeth with the first tablet, chew another one with the teeth that aren’t colored.

, Take a moment to examine your teeth and identify the areas that you aren’t adequately cleaning with your normal regimen.You may want to purchase a dental mirror so you can get a good view of the rear side of your teeth. They can be purchased at any major retailer or drug store and typically cost less than $5.

, Take particular care to brush the problem areas identified by the dye. You should be able to remove the largest chunks of plaque and dye by concentrating your brushing in those areas.


You may want to invest in a waterpik that can provide water pressure and precision cleaning for your problem areas. It can also provide a good gum massage, which is helpful against inflammation and preventing bleeding.

, Rinse off your toothbrush and use it to brush a third time. This will remove most of the remaining dye. Then rinse your mouth out with water and/or mouthwash. Try to swish around a lot.As mentioned above, you won’t be able to completely remove the stains right away. After brushing and rinsing a few times, the dye will disappear on its own after a few hours.

Visit your dentist regularly.,
Monitor your teeth at home.,
Recognize visible symptoms of erosion.,
Pay attention to sensory symptoms of enamel loss.",How to Treat Tooth Enamel Loss1," Diagnosis of the early stages of wear is very difficult so it's important that you keep a close eye on the condition of your teeth and have regular check-ups with your dentist. Patient symptoms are the most important thing in the diagnosis of erosion so having your teeth checked will give you the best chance of an early diagnosis.;
, As well as visiting your dentist, you should take time to monitor your teeth at home and look for signs of erosion or decay. In order to prevent enamel loss you need to stick to a good dental hygiene regime, brushing and flossing twice daily.If you get into good oral hygiene habits you will be more aware of your teeth and it is more likely that you will spot signs of erosion earlier.


The most common place for wear to begin is on canine teeth in most cases. It's the best place to see the beginning signs of wear or in this case, grinding.

, There are a number of symptoms of erosion and decay that you can see by observing the appearance of your teeth and their outer surface. As the enamel erodes and more of the dentin is exposed, your teeth may suffer discolouration and appear more yellow.


When you grind your teeth, the edges of your teeth may become rougher, jagged or appear more irregular, with cracks and chips.
You may notice indentations appear on the surface of your teeth. This is known as cupping and can be a symptom of erosion.
If your teeth appear very smooth and shiny this could be a symptom of grinding.A few other signs of grinding are tori (similar to callouses) formed on the outside of the upper teeth, in the gum region, and on the inside of the lower teeth in the gum region. Abfraction lesions on the sides of the teeth, linea alba (lines on the sides of the cheeks) and scalloped tongue (undulations on the sides of the tongue) are also signs that grinding occurs.
Research shows the cause of nocturnal grinding (and wearing) of the teeth is from obstructive sleep apnea, and the grinding is a sign of OSA, rather than stress.

, You should also pay close attention to the potential sensory symptoms. If your teeth ache, are sore or especially sensitive, don't ignore it, as it could be a symptom of a more serious dental problem. In the early stages of enamel erosion you may experience somewhat increased sensitivity when you consume certain foods and drinks.


If sweets or hot and cold drinks cause a twinge of pain, this could indicate the early stages of of erosion at the gumline of the teeth, also known as abfractions.
In the later stages of enamel erosion, this sensitivity and pain increases significantly and your teeth may become highly sensitive to temperatures, especially cold.If you notice this twinge, act quickly and make an appointment with your dentist to try and prevent the erosion from accelerating.

Talk to your dentist about treatment.,
Purchase a soft bristle toothbrush.,
Use fluoride toothpaste.,
Use a desensitizing mouthwash and toothpaste.",How to Treat Tooth Enamel Loss2," If you have lost tooth enamel you need to visit your dentist to discuss treatment options with them. Enamel cannot restore itself naturally, so if you have experienced erosion you need advice from a professional on what action to take. The treatment will depend on your particular condition, but some of the options include covering the tooth with a crown or a ceramic veneer.Dental crowns can be applied to your teeth so that they regain their original shape and strength.
Dental fillings can be used to fill and repair cavities. They reduce the sensitivity of your teeth and smooth out any damaged surfaces.
If your condition is less severe, your dentist may suggest you use a remineralizing tooth cream, or using fluoride gel to strengthen your teeth.

, Although you cannot treat tooth enamel loss yourself, there are steps you can take to reduce the risk of it occurring. Some dentists believe that one the many causes for enamel loss is brushing your teeth too hard. This practice can also lead to gum recession. Pair that with a hard bristle toothbrush and you have recipe for tooth enamel loss. Instead, use a soft bristle brush to gently brush your teeth.Ensure you have a good brushing technique. Brush your teeth up and down, using a vertical rolling motion to get every part of your teeth.
Brush twice a day for around two minutes each time., You need to have strong healthy teeth to ensure that you do not suffer from enamel loss. Fluoride works to strengthen your teeth against the threat of decay, so when you buy toothpaste ensure that is a fluoride toothpaste. These are widely available in your local store and will often state that they contain fluoride prominently on the packaging.


If you have a history of cavities or other problems to do with tooth decay, your dentist may suggest daily fluoride treatments.

, Using a desensitizing mouthwash or toothpaste can reduce the pain you feel caused by your enamel loss. Use the toothpaste as you would any other toothpaste. Use the mouthwash to rinse your mouth for 30 seconds, twice a day, after brushing. You can find many brands of toothpaste and mouthwash for sensitive and damaged teeth in your local drug store, pharmacy or dentists."

Cut down on acidic drinks.,
Rinse your mouth with water after eating and drinking.,
Chew sugar free gum between meals.,
Understand the environmental factors.",How to Treat Tooth Enamel Loss3," One of the main causes of tooth decay and enamel erosion is a bad diet, or excessive consumption of some particular damaging substances. Limit your intake of carbonated drinks and fruit drinks. Whenever possible, drink soft drinks and alcoholic drinks with a straw so as to minimize damage to the teeth. Straws help to keep the soda from directly hitting the teeth.Although you might think they are healthy, some fruit drinks contain highly erosive acids which can contribute to loss of enamel. Also try to avoid drinks with a lot of added sugar.A high intake of herbal teas may have an erosive potential that is greater than acidic orange juice., Water helps to rinse away any enamel-eroding substances that your food or drinks might have contained. If you have been eating or drinking something that is acidic, take a few moments to rinse your mouth out afterwards. The faster you can rinse away these substances, the healthier your teeth will be.The mouth is acidic for a few hours after consuming foods high in sugar and starches.
If you don’t have any water handy, promoting saliva protection also works well.
Saliva acts as a neutralizer that combats any acidic substances you might have consumed.Drink more water throughout the day if you have a dry mouth or low saliva., Another way to neutralize the acids in your mouth after eating and drinking is to chew sugar free gum after meals. Chewing gum can dramatically increase the amount of saliva your produce, to up to ten times the normal amount. The minerals in saliva help to strengthen your teeth and wash away the acidic remains from food and drink.


Be sure the gum is sugar free and with the ingredient Xylitol.
Limit your chewing to avoid potential problems with your jaw joints and grinding teeth., Friction and general wear and tear both contribution to enamel loss and erosion. Grinding your teeth causes friction, and abrasion can occur when you brush your teeth too hard. Other common causes of wear and tear are biting and chewing on hard objects, such as pens, pencils and fingernails.Chewing on these hard objects can scrape away the enamel on your teeth, so try to get out of the habit of chewing on pen lids.

Clean the scraper after use.,
Consider tongue size.,
Think about your comfort.,
Look for efficiency.,
Consider material.,
Think about tongue scraping as part of your oral hygiene.,
Know that tongue scraping can improve taste.,
Consider possible digestive benefits of tongue scraping.",How to Use a Tongue Scraper," You'll want to open your mouth as wide as is comfortable, but not so wide that it causes discomfort. This makes your tongue more accessible and increases the ease of scraping.;
, The goal here is to comfortably increase access to your tongue, so stick your tongue outside your mouth as far as you are able.


Avoid pointing your tongue, as this decreases surface area and makes scraping less effective.

, Holding the handle of the tongue scraper, place it on the rearmost part of the tongue. How far to place the scraper is entirely reliant on your comfort. Just remember that the farther back it is placed, the more surface area that is scraped. If you feel a tickle or a gagging sensation, that's too far.


After many scraping sessions, you may be able to place the scraper further back into your mouth than you were in your initial session.

, Apply firm pressure to the tongue scraper. In one slow, smooth motion, pull the scraper from back of your tongue to the front. The rough edge of the scraper will rub against the tongue surface and remove any coating or residue.Scraping should involved firm pressure, but never discomfort or abrasion to the skin. When you begin scraping, it is best to err on the side of lighter, rather than heavier strokes and gently increase pressure until the right amount is achieved.
A maximum number of four to eight movements should be enough for the day.
Never move the scraper in a backwards direction. Always remember to move your scraper from the back of your tongue to the tip. Going backwards spreads the scrapings back over your tongue and requires you to repeat the scraping.

, The scraper pushes the coating it removes to the tip of the tongue with every stroke. It may be advisable to rinse the scraper and your mouth after each stroke.


You can also dip the scraper in a small cup filled with chlorhexidine mouthwash, as the antibacterial substance will destroy almost entirely any bacteria on the scraper.

, Rinse the scraper under the faucet after use, removing any debris or saliva. Ensure that your tongue scraper stays clean and dry between sessions, storing it in a drawer or medicine cabinet.

, If you have a large tongue, a wide profile, u-shaped scraper is the most efficient way to clean your tongue. Children or people with smaller tongues may want to choose a y-shaped scraper.

, If you have a very sensitive gag reflex, consider this when choosing your scraper.


Some people opt for a tongue brush, which combines elements of a toothbrush and a scraper. This type of tongue scraper is narrower than the u-shaped scraper but does have a taller profile, which may also trigger discomfort. A good rule of thumb is to consider how comfortable you'd be placing your toothbrush near the back of your mouth. If that's problematic, opt for a y-shaped tongue scraper. These are smaller and usually have bent sides to accommodate sensitivity.

, If sensitivity is less of a concern, get a scraper with multiple blades. Multiple blades expedite the removal of debris. These can be y-shaped, usually with dual blades; however, there are narrower versions with four to five blades that have a similar size-profile to a toothbrush.

, Tongue scrapers are typically made of stainless steel, copper, or plastic. A metal scraper can be kept long-term and periodically disinfected by boiling in water. Plastic scrapers are cheaper; however, they are intended to be disposable and must be replaced every three to four months.

, By itself, tongue scraping cannot ensure good oral hygiene; however, as part of a regimen including brushing and flossing, it has proven benefits.


Halitosis is caused by bacteria that act on residual food particles in the mouth. These bacteria release volatile sulphur compounds (VSCs), which produce a bad smell.Tongue scraping can remove food particles and bacteria on the tongue and provide a 75% reduction of halitosis symptoms, 30% more than just brushing alone. Tongue coating is a common symptom of smoking, dry mouth, and yeast infections. It is unsightly and contributes to halitosis. By scraping this coating off the tongue, patients report better overall oral hygiene and personal comfort.Research indicates that, by removing food particles and bacteria from the mouth, tongue scraping can reduce plaque buildup and cavities., Research indicates that tongue cleansing generally exposes tastebuds and, after two weeks, patients noted improved sense of taste. These results were substantially enhanced by including a tongue scraper in cleansing sessions., The Ayurveda, a holistic medical text that originated in ancient India, argues that the ""toxic residue"" of bacteria and dead cells that forms on the tongue can actually have a negative impact on the digestive system."

Know where to look in your mouth.,
Feel behind your second molars with your tongue.,
Be alert for gum or jaw tenderness.,
Look for redness and swelling.,
Watch your wisdom teeth grow in.,
Learn what an impacted wisdom tooth is.,
Don't ignore severe pain and inflammation.,
Be aware of signs of infection.,
Know when to see a dentist.",How to Tell Between an Erupting and Impacted Wisdom Tooth," Your wisdom teeth are the last molars on each row of teeth — the uppers and lowers on both sides. They are meant for grinding food. You don't need them to chew properly, but they pop up (erupt) when your jaw grows and elongates during your late teen years. Open your mouth wide and use a penlight to see the back of your mouth. They are considered the third set of molars, which are situated five spots behind your incisors or canine teeth.Look to see if there is enough space for another molar to erupt there. Wisdom teeth don't always erupt if there isn't enough space in your jaw.
If your teeth are already crowded and/or crooked, then the chances are good that your wisdom teeth will not erupt completely.;
, Once you know where the wisdom teeth erupt, take your tongue and feel along the gum line. When wisdom teeth (or any teeth) begin to erupt, they begin by poking through the gums. The top part of the tooth, called the cusps or crown, pokes through first.Before the cusps erupt through the gum tissue (gingiva) and cause discomfort, you should be able to feel a hard bump develop in the gums behind your second molars.


If you tongue isn't long enough to extend to the back of your gums, then use your index finger to feel around. Sanitize your finger before putting it in your mouth.
Your tongue has a tendency to naturally gravitate to any sharp edges or tenderness in your mouth subconsciously, especially if they are new.

, When wisdom teeth do erupt, you can expect at least some mild discomfort as the cusps cut through the sensitive gum tissue. Be alert for at least some short-term mild pain, pressure or dull throbbing in the back of your gums or in the nearby jaw bone.The pain can be more severe if your wisdom teeth erupt crookedly due to a crowded jaw. On the other hand, symptoms may be almost unnoticeable if the wisdom teeth come in straight and well-positioned in relation to your other teeth.The pain from erupting wisdom teeth will be worse at night if you habitually clench your jaw and/or grind your molars while sleeping.
Chewing gum or eating hard, crunchy food can also aggravate the erupting wisdom teeth and lead to worse symptoms.

, Wisdom teeth can also trigger redness and inflammation within the sensitive gum tissue.You may be able to feel the inflamed gums with your tongue or see it when your mouth is opened wide. Use a penlight if you need to see better. Red and swollen gum tissue is called gingivitis. Inflamed wisdom teeth make it more difficult or uncomfortable to chew food. In fact, they may cause you to bite your cheek and/or tongue more often because they can crowd your mouth.


You might also see some blood around the erupting wisdom tooth (or your saliva may be red colored). This is not common, but it happens.
You might also see a ""gum flap"" over your erupting wisdom tooth — it's called a pericoronal flap.
While your gums are swollen, it might be difficult to open your mouth to eat food. This is especially common with the lower wisdom teeth, as the resulting inflammation affects the masseter muscle, which is involved in the opening of the mouth.As such, you may need to drink blended food and beverages for a few days (do not use a straw, as this can lead to dry sockets).

, Once the cusps of the wisdom teeth break the surface of the gums, they'll continue to push up until they reach the level of your other molars. This process takes a few weeks or even months and you'll be able to see if the teeth are coming in straight or not. If they do not come in straight, they'll likely crowd the other molars, which can put pressure on and misalign other teeth in the front of your mouth that are visible when you smile.Wisdom teeth that erupt crookedly can create a ""domino effect,"" which eventually affects other teeth, making them twisted or uneven looking.
If you think your front teeth are suddenly getting crooked, compare your current smile to older photographs of yourself.
Once wisdom teeth are removed (extracted), crooked and twisted teeth can slowly realign themselves naturally after a few weeks or months.

, Impacted wisdom teeth either don't erupt at all (and remain within the jaw bone underneath the gum line) or they don't erupt normally.They can get stuck under the gum flap or grow in at an extreme angle — sometimes even horizontally instead of vertically. It's important to remember that impacted wisdom teeth don't always cause problems or symptoms, and don't always need to be removed by a dentist.


It's common to have a combination of fully erupted, partially erupted and impacted wisdom teeth within the same mouth.
The longer your wisdom teeth stay in your mouth, the more developed the roots become, making them more difficult to remove if they cause symptoms.

, Impacted wisdom teeth are not always symptomatic, but when they are, the pain and inflammation tend to be severe.Unlike the mild discomfort that sometimes accompanies normally erupting wisdom teeth, the impacted teeth usually produce severe throbbing pain (in the gums and jaw), swelling, headache, neck stiffness, ear ache and/or reduced ability to open the mouth. If you experience these symptoms, it's not a normally erupting wisdom tooth — see your dentist immediately.


Symptoms that distinguish erupting from impacted teeth is typically a matter of degree. The latter involves more pain and swelling that lasts longer and doesn't usually get better until the tooth is pulled.
The discomfort from an erupting wisdom tooth only lasts while the cusps first push through the gum line, whereas impacted teeth cause pain well afterwards or even without being seen.
If your wisdom tooth is not erupting vertically in the normal position, you may feel a constant pain or discomfort spreading all over the jaw up to the middle line.

, Partially erupted or impacted wisdom teeth greatly increase the risk of an infection, which is called pericoronitis.Impacted wisdom teeth can create little spaces underneath the pericoronal flap where bacteria collect and proliferate. Bacteria can eat away at enamel, bone and gum tissue. Common signs of an infected wisdom tooth are: lots of inflammation, severe pain (sharp and/or throbbing), mild fever, swollen lymph nodes in the neck and along the jaw, pus around the inflamed gingiva, bad breath and an unpleasant taste in the mouth.Pus is a grayish-white color and made from white blood cells. These specialized immune cells destroy surrounding bacteria, then they eventually die and form pus.
Bad breath is a product of the bacterial waste products, pus and blood that seeps from an infected wisdom tooth.

, Experiencing severe symptoms that last for more than a few days or noticing any of the signs of infection warrant an emergency trip to the dentist. Your dentist will take x-rays, administer some anesthesia and extract the symptomatic impacted wisdom tooth. Antibiotics may be prescribed before the extraction to prevent the spread of the infection in the bloodstream. Wisdom teeth removed before the age of 20 years often have better results because their roots are not fully developed.Complications of an infected wisdom tooth include: an abscess of the tooth or gum, cysts and septicemia (bacterial infection of the blood).
The American Dental Association recommends all teenagers between 16–19 years of age get their wisdom teeth evaluated by a licensed dentist."

Remember that you did not cause your UC.,
Recognize that you may experience “flare-ups” followed by periods with few symptoms.,
Take comfort in knowing the vast majority of UC sufferers live normal lives.",How to Manage Ulcerative Colitis1," While scientists do not understand what causes UC, this disease appears to have a genetic disposition that may be triggered by factors in our environment. Think of UC as being like hay fever. If you have hay fever, you have a genetic disposition that will cause you to develop itchy eyes and a runny nose if exposed to pollen. If you’re never exposed to pollen, you’ll never develop the symptoms. If you are, you will. You certainly didn’t cause the pollen, or the genetic disposition! The same principle applies to UC., Some people will go months or even years without suffering any symptoms of UC. Proper treatment will extend these periods of remission. Only five to 10 percent of UC patients experience UC symptoms all the time, and fortunately even acute sufferers have treatment options., You’ll likely spend most of your life in remission. Properly treated, this is not a life-threatening illness. You can expect to enjoy relationships, marriage, children, a career, and other joys of life."
"
Keep a food journal.,
Consider a “low residue” diet.,
Stay hydrated.,
Eat several small meals throughout the day.,
Beware of common irritants.",How to Manage Ulcerative Colitis2," While all UC sufferers must cope with sensitivity to certain foods, the specific sources of your sensitivity can greatly vary. As a result, there is no one “UC diet.” Keep track of the foods you eat and how they make you feel. Use this information to develop the diet that works best for you.


Try to eat a balanced diet whenever possible. If you find yourself unable to consume certain types of foods, consult your doctor about vitamin supplements to help you replace key nutrients.
Note any preparation tweaks that make foods easier to consume – steaming vegetables, for example, or consuming low- or non-fat dairy products., Many UC patients experience relief during flare-ups when they maintain a diet that produces less “residue,” or leftover waste. Essentially, following a “low residue” diet means you’ll have smaller and fewer bowel movements, and consequently less diarrhea, cramping, and pain. Bear in mind that if you can handle higher “residue” foods such as whole grains, you should eat them. When you’re struggling with your UC symptoms, however, try:


Grain products including refined white bread; plain crackers; Melba toast; cooked cereals such as cream of wheat, farina, or grits; cold cereals such as corn flakes or puffed rice; white rice; noodles; and refined pasta.
Soft fruits with any skin or seeds removed, including bananas, soft cantaloupe, honeydew, canned or cooked fruit, and avocado.
Well-cooked fresh or canned vegetables without seeds, including asparagus tips, beets, green beans, carrots, mushrooms, spinach, squash (remove seeds), pumpkin, and tomato sauce.
Potatoes without skins.
Milk products in moderation, as long as you are not lactose intolerant.
All meat, as long as the cuts are tender, soft, and lean. Eggs are also okay.
Many condiments, including butter, vegetable oil, ketchup, mayonnaise, sour cream, smooth sauces, soy sauce, clear jelly, honey, and syrup.
Decaffeinated coffee or tea, decaffeinated carbonated beverages, milk, strained vegetable juices, and fruit juices made without seeds or pulp such as apple juice., Drink plenty of fluids each day. Water is best. Alcohol and beverages containing caffeine stimulate your intestines, which will increase your discomfort. While carbonated drinks are allowed under a “low residue” diet, they can often produce gas – an uncomfortable addition to your already-problematic symptoms.Plan to carry a bottle of water with you to make it easy to stay well hydrated.

, Your body may find it easier to digest small amounts of food throughout the day rather than coping with three larger meals. When developing a diet plan, think about snacks that you can easily take along when you’re out and about., Seeds, nuts, and coconut; whole-grain products; raw or dried fruits; raw vegetables; beans, lentils, and tofu; tough or cured meats; crunchy peanut butter; chunky jams or marmalades; pickles and other preserved foods; pop corn; and fruit juices containing pulp or seeds may all cause problems for UC sufferers. Note that many of these foods are exceptionally healthy under other circumstances. Again, experimentation is key. If you find you can tolerate some of these foods, you should certainly continue eating them. Eliminate ones that cause you distress.While dairy products contain no fiber, many UC patients also suffer symptoms of lactose intolerance. Your food diary should help you determine whether you are able to tolerate dairy products."

Control your stress.,
Exercise regularly.,
Help yourself by helping others.",How to Manage Ulcerative Colitis3," Stress does not cause UC, nor does it increase the inflammation that produces your symptoms. Stress does, however, impact your digestive system in other ways.If you are already suffering from diarrhea associated with UC, you’ll want to avoid the additional bowel movements that stress can produce!



Reduce your stress levels with meditation or pursue other relaxation and breathing techniques. Take a few moments during the day to close your eyes and focus on something peaceful and relaxing. This will help to relieve stress and calm your bowels.
Use a biofeedback machine to reduce muscle tension, slow your heart rate, and decrease your stress.Take up yoga or tai chi.

, Even mild exercise will reduce your stress levels, relieve depression, and help improve your bowel function. Consult your doctor to develop an exercise program that is right for you.While hydration during exercise is important for everyone, if you have UC it is especially important to consume adequate water before and during exercise., Chronic diseases can be difficult to cope with because they are life-long conditions. Not everyone is interested in becoming an advocate, and if you’d prefer to deal with your illness in private that is perfectly fine. Some UC patients find strength and comfort in working to educate others, support fellow UC sufferers and raise money for UC research. If you believe you would benefit from such activities, research the Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation or other advocacy organizations."

Consume more turmeric.,
Increase your intake of fish oil.,
Add probiotics to your diet.,
Take a folic acid supplement.,
Consider N-acetyl glucosamine supplements.,
Pursue herbal treatments.,
Consider acupuncture.",How to Manage Ulcerative Colitis4," Studies have found that the curcumin in turmeric, a spice often used in curry, has anti-inflammatory properties. While more research is needed, one study found that patients who consumed foods containing turmeric reduced their symptoms and their need for other medications.


Many curries containing turmeric can be quite spicy; use care to avoid irritating the lining of your colon.
People with gallbladder disease, gastrointestinal reflux, hormone-related cancers, or those on blood-thinning medication should not consume turmeric., The omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil may reduce UC symptoms and flare-ups. Some studies indicate that fish oil in combination with medications such as sulfasalazine can be effective. Note that study results are mixed, and that sometimes fish oil may actually cause diarrhea.


Refrain from taking fish oil if you are currently on blood-thinning medication., Our intestines contain good bacteria that keep bad bacteria from causing problems. Frequent diarrhea reduces the population of good bacteria. Foods such as yogurt contain “live cultures,” or probiotics – good bacteria – that can repopulate your intestines, reducing UC symptoms., Many people who have UC also have low levels of folic acid in their bodies. Common UC medications can exacerbate this problem. Consuming adequate folic acid helps counter UC patients’ increased risk of developing colon cancer.


Note that folic acid can camouflage a vitamin B12 deficiency. Consult your doctor about a dietary regimen that will allow you to consume adequate quantities of both nutrients., Some research suggests supplements or enemas containing this substance can improve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease. More studies are needed to determine whether glucosamine is useful in treating UC.


As with many treatments, N-acetyl glucosamine can negatively interact with blood-thinning medications., UC patients have found relief using a variety of herbal treatments. Consult a trained health care provider to determine which varieties would be best for your system. Note that many of these herbs interact with other medications.


Psyllium seeds may help lengthen periods of remission when taken in combination with other medication. This insoluble fiber may exacerbate symptoms during flare-ups, so be sure to talk with your doctor before taking it. Some UC patients may do better with soluble fiber such as flax seed or oat bran.
Boswellia has anti-inflammatory properties, and some studies indicate it can work about as well as the prescription medication sulfasalazine.
Slippery elm is a demulcent, which means it can protect irritated tissues and promote their healing, but should never be taken by pregnant women.
Marshmallow is also a demulcent. Avoid marshmallow if you are diabetic or take other medications, including lithium.
Chamomile is often brewed as a tea to soothe the digestive tract. Avoid chamomile if you have a ragweed allergy. This herb can also have estrogenic properties, so use caution if you have any history of hormone-related disease., Some studies have shown acupuncture can produce relief from UC symptoms. Acupuncture also works as a stress reliever, magnifying its useful qualities for UC patients."
"
Consult your doctor about anti-inflammatory drugs.,
Talk to your doctor about immune system suppressors.,
Use over-the-counter medications to help manage UC symptoms.,
Talk to your doctor about surgical treatment.,
Pursue regular colon cancer screening.",How to Manage Ulcerative Colitis5," These drugs are usually the first step in treating UC and other inflammatory bowel diseases.


Aminosalicylates such as as sulfasalazine can effectively reduce UC symptoms. This medication can produce a variety of side effects, including digestive distress and headaches. Other medications in this family include mesalamine, balsalazide, and olsalazine. These medications are available in oral and enema or suppository forms.
Cortisteroids, including prednisone and hydrocortisone, are generally used when moderate to severe UC does not respond to other treatments. They are delivered orally, intravenously, or via enema or suppository. Steroids can produce many side effects, so they are not usually a long-term treatment., These drugs reduce inflammation too, but they do so by targeting the immune response that produces the inflammation. Sometimes they are used in combination with a cortisteroid.


Azathioprine and mercaptopurine are the immune system suppressors most commonly prescribed to UC patients.
Infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab are “biologics,” or immune system suppressors that operate by neutralizing a protein that your immune system produces. These medications are generally prescribed to moderate or severe UC sufferers.
Vedolizumab was recently approved for patients who have not responded to other types of immunosuppressant drugs., Always talk with your doctor before beginning a new medication regimen. Doctors will often recommend one or more of the following in addition to prescription medication:


Antibiotics, especially when a flare-up is causing you to run a fever.
Anti-diarrheal medications, especially if your diarrhea has become severe.
Acetaminophen for mild pain relief. Note that ibuprofen, naproxen sodium, and diclofenac sodium can all worsen UC symptoms and should therefore be avoided.
Iron supplements to combat anemia, especially if you are experiencing bleeding., Between 20 and 30 percent of people with UC will eventually need to undergo a colectomy (removal of colon) or proctocolectomy (removal of colon and rectum) due to massive bleeding, severe illness, rupture of the colon, or cancer risk. Surgery does usually eliminate the disease altogether. Your surgeon will create an internal pouch from a portion of your small intestine that empties into your anus, allowing you to expel waste relatively normally.Note that sometimes it is not possible to construct an internal pouch. If this is the case, your surgeon will create a permanent opening in your abdomen (a colostomy), through which stool is collected in an attached bag., UC does increase your risk of colon cancer, so it is important to go in for a surveillance colonoscopy every one to two years."

Regulate what you eat and drink.,
Improve your nutritional intake.,
Include fluoride and enamel-hardening toothpaste or mouthwash in your oral hygiene routine.,
Chew sugar-free gum.,
Add remineralizing treatments to your oral hygiene routine.",How to Strengthen Tooth Enamel1," Avoid the sugary, starchy, and acidic foods and drinks are those most likely to create the bacteria on your teeth that becomes acidic and attacks tooth enamel. This bacteria can cause the discoloration, sensitivity, and roughened teeth that are hallmarks of enamel loss.;
, Your body can strengthen weak enamel itself if given the necessary nutrients and minerals. Dark leafy vegetables, dairy, and protein-rich foods contain necessary nutrients. Drink water rather than soda or fruit juice. , Fluoride can be in the form of drinking fluoridated water (most drinking water in the U.S. contains fluoride). It could also be in fluoridated toothpaste or mouthwash.Brush your teeth properly with a soft-bristled toothbrush in a brisk circular motion for 2 minutes.

, The gum promotes saliva production, without the sugar that makes weakened enamel worse. Gum with the natural sweetener xylitol doesn't feed the bacteria that weakens your enamel, and xylitol has actually been shown to strengthen tooth enamel. , Remineralizing gels with calcium phosphate and fluoride have been scientifically proven to help remineralize tooth enamel. Some dentists offer in-office remineralizing treatments or you can do it at home. You can brush remineralizing gel on your teeth if it comes in a pen or you can put it in teeth whitening trays and apply it to your teeth. This is the best way to cover all surfaces of your teeth."
"
Explore whether tooth bonding would work for you.,
Inquire about veneers.,
Ask your dentist if you need a crown.",How to Strengthen Tooth Enamel2," Tooth bonding might be necessary if your teeth are very rough and discolored. This procedure will smooth and whiten the teeth. This helps them blend in with the teeth around them. Tooth bonding is easier and less costly than getting either a veneer or a crown on your tooth to repair it. , Applying veneers are another option for rough and discolored teeth. A dentist will create a custom-made shell, or veneer, to cover the front of your tooth. The veneer is then bonded to the tooth itself, creating a smooth white surface to repair the affected tooth. , Fitting a crown might be necessary to cover and seal the entire tooth to save it if you are suffering from extreme enamel loss. Crowns, like veneers, are custom-made for the patient's tooth. The crown will cover the exposed dentin to prevent infection and act as the enamel did, smoothly protecting the tooth.

Make sure you are producing enough saliva.,
Monitor stomach-related illnesses.,
Check to make sure your teeth are not under stress.",How to Strengthen Tooth Enamel3," Dry mouth can lead to weakened tooth enamel. Saliva helps prevent demineralization, and chronic dry mouth is caused by reduced saliva production. Even if you do not suffer from chronic dry mouth, antihistamines, medication, and even wine reduce saliva production. Components in saliva actually maintain and repair your enamel, so dry mouth can be damaging to tooth enamel. An autoimmune disease called Sjorgren's disease is frequently associated with having a dry mouth. If you frequently have a dry mouth and dry eyes, see your doctor to get you checked for Sjorgren's disease. You might also have joint pain, swelling, and stiffness; swollen salivary glands; skin rashes or dry skin; vaginal dryness; dry cough; and fatigue., Acid reflux, bulimia, and celiac disease all put you at increased risk for tooth enamel loss. Acid reflux causes stomach acid to travel up your esophagus and even into your mouth. Those who suffer from bulimia make themselves vomit, subjecting their teeth to stomach acid. In both cases, the acid burns away tooth enamel, so make sure any acid reflux condition is under control whether through diet or medication. The reasons for tooth enamel problems among those who have celiac disease are still unclear, but the majority of those with the illness have accompanying tooth enamel problems. , Grinding and biting can create an enormous strain on your teeth, leading to the possibility of enamel loss. Many people grind their teeth as they sleep and do not even realize it. A night guard for your teeth may help prevent the wear and tear caused by grinding. "

Determine what is bothering you.,
Listen to your boyfriend’s complaints.,
Research local dentistry options.,
Encourage him to have good dental practices.",How to Tell Your Boyfriend He Needs to See a Dentist1," There may be one or several things wrong with your boyfriend’s teeth or mouth. Noticing these symptoms can help you learn about the potential causes and consequences of the problem. This can help you convince your boyfriend to see a dentist. Some common problems include:


Bad breath
Black or rotting teeth
Dark receding gums
Yellow teeth;
, There are some problems that you will not be able to identify by sight alone. If your boyfriend comments about any of these issues, take notice. When talking to him about going to the dentist, you can remind him that he had complained about these issues. Some issues might be:


Dry mouth
Sore gums
Tooth pain or sensitivityIf you notice your boyfriend wincing while eating or holding his cheek, you might ask, ""Is there anything wrong? Are you feeling all right?""

, While some people are afraid of the dentist, there are many techniques that help people relax as they get work done on their mouth. These procedures can reduce pain while making the dentist less of a scary experience. You can let your boyfriend know about these options to encourage him to go.


Some dentists offer various forms of sedation, such as laughing gas, pills, or general anesthesia. These help relax patients with anxiety. In many cases, the patient will not remember much of the actual procedure.Some people have had luck controlling pain, fear, and a gag reflex using hypnotherapy during dental visits.You might introduce this topic by suggesting that someone recommended or told you about this new form of dentistry. For example, you can say, ""My friend recently went to this dentist who sedated her during her visit, and she didn't feel a thing. Isn't that amazing?""

, As a way to ease him into the conversation, you can start encouraging good practices around him. Not only will this improve his dental health but it may make the dentist less intimidating. You can try carrying dental floss with you, brushing teeth together at night, or buying him dental supplies such as mouthwash, tongue scrapers, and toothpicks.


Try offering these things to him as you use them yourself. For example, after a meal, you can pull out some dental floss for yourself. As you do so, you might say, ""Do you want any?""
When buying him supplies, you might frame it as a suggestion. You can say, ""Oh, I love this mouthwash. You should try it. It makes your mouth feel so clean and nice.""

Start by complimenting him.,
Tell him the problem directly.,
Explain that you are not criticizing him.,
Find out why he doesn’t want to go.,
Inform him of the consequences.",How to Tell Your Boyfriend He Needs to See a Dentist2," The conversation should begin on a positive note. Sit down with your boyfriend, and assure him that you care for him. Remind him of his good qualities before stating that you want to talk about his health.You can say, “Honey, you know that I love you, and I think you are an amazing person with so many good qualities. Which is why we need to talk about your health. I think you need to see a dentist.”

, It is best to state the issue outright. Do not dance around the subject or try to mask it. Let him know that you have noticed the problem and that for his own health, he needs to take care of it.


You can say, “You have been complaining about tooth pain for weeks now, and I can see that one of your teeth is turning black. It’s time for you to get it checked out by a dentist.”
You might even say, “Your bad breath is starting to become a problem. It’s hard me to want to kiss you when it is so strong. I think you might have an underlying problem that you need to have checked out.”

, Your boyfriend might become defensive. Perhaps he thinks you are criticizing him or maybe he is insecure about his teeth. Either way, you should assure him throughout the conversation that you are concerned about his health first and foremost.


You can say, “I still love and care about you. I just want what’s best for you.”
You might also say, “I’m concerned about your wellbeing. I don’t want you to be in pain because of this problem.”

, Many people are afraid or anxious about visiting the dentist. Your boyfriend may be scared or uncomfortable. He may also be concerned about the cost of dental care, or he may simply think that it is a frivolous visit. Be sensitive to his reasons. Ask him gently why he does not want to go.


You might say, “Is there any reason in particular you don’t want to go?”
If he is nervous about visiting the dentist, you can find him a dentist that will give him sedation during the visit.
If he is worried about the expense, you can say something like, “It is far more expensive to have an emergency root canal than to fix a cavity” or “We will work something out to afford it. I will chip in to help cover the cost.”, Some people believe that dental visits are just for cosmetic purposes, but there are real dangers to neglecting your mouth’s health. You should emphasize what could happen if he does not take care of his problem. This logical approach might work best in convincing him to go.You might inform him that:


Cavities or cracked teeth that are neglected can spread down to the root of your tooth, requiring a painful and expensive root canal. The tooth may also have to be removed.Sensitive teeth could be a sign of a fractured tooth.The first stage of gum disease (called gingivitis) is reversible, but once it develops into periodontal disease, it becomes a lifelong condition that can cause your teeth to fall out.Bad breath could be caused by many medical conditions, including gum disease.Dental health might be connected to other health problems, such as diabetes and heart disease."

Let him choose the dentist.,
Offer to make the appointment for him.,
Go with him.,
Give him music.",How to Tell Your Boyfriend He Needs to See a Dentist3," Your boyfriend might be anxious about a dental visit. Letting him pick the dentist might help ease his anxiety. If you are worried about him forgetting to do this, you can sit down together to research local dentists together.


You can use a review site, such as Yelp or Health Grades, to find a highly rated dentist in your area.
You can call your general practitioner or local oral surgeons for dentist referrals as well., To make sure that he actually follows through, you can offer to call the dentists’ office for him. If he agrees, he should give you some times and dates when he is available. Once the appointment is made, he is much likelier to actually go.


You can say, ""Would it help if I set up the appointment for you?""
If he wants to make the appointment himself, gently remind him every few days. You can say, ""When is your appointment for the dentist?"" or ""Have you made that appointment yet?""
Do not make an appointment for him without his permission first.

, Ask your boyfriend if he wants you to tag along during the visit. If he has a dental phobia, your presence can help him relax. Some dentists may even let you into the suite to hold his hand during the cleaning and check-up.You can offer, “Do you want me to come with you to your appointment? I can be there with you and make sure everything is all right.”

, Another way to help calm him during his visit is to give him relaxing music to listen to. Load his music player with his favorite music. When he is sitting in the chair, he can listen to it through his headphones."

Continue to brush and floss.,
Let it fall out on its own.,
Use over the counter pain medication or a topical gel.,
Make sure you're eating well.,
Take care of adult teeth grow that in irregularly.",How to Take Care of Your Loose Teeth1," Even though it’s tempting to slack on oral hygiene when you have loose baby teeth, it’s important to take care of both your old and new teeth. Continue a normal brushing and flossing routine, and use mouthwash to rinse away any food particles that might get caught underneath your loose tooth. Otherwise, you run the risk of letting bacteria grow between your teeth and in any gaps under the loose tooth. This could lead to painful infections, or cause your adult tooth to decay as it grows under your loose baby tooth.It’s good to be extra gentle about brushing around the loose tooth or teeth, especially if your gums are sore. If you have a really loose tooth, then you can even harm the inner ligaments of your tooth if you use too much pressure.
You don’t need to be too careful with baby teeth, however. They’re meant to fall out when the time is right, so you don’t have to baby them too much. If you are concerned, then you can always check on the age ranges for when a baby tooth is supposed to fall out, such as by asking your dentist or searching the internet.;
, You should encourage the tooth to come out on its own by wiggling it and going about your normal routines. However, you don’t want to force it out, so don’t yank it out or chomp right down on really hard food. Your baby tooth will come out when it’s ready once the root holding it in has completely dissolved leaving room for the permanent tooth to come out.Removing a baby tooth before it’s ready can lead to infection, pain, and bleeding. It can also lead to eruption disorders of the permanent teeth. There could still be some root left and bacteria will grow in it.

, Losing baby teeth is usually painless, but sometimes they can have sharp edges that dig into gums as they wiggle. Adult teeth can also cause sore gums as they erupt. If you’re experiencing sore gums or any discomfort as your baby teeth fall out and your adult teeth grow in, ask a parent for kid-friendly pain medication.Ibuprofen or a gel that gently numbs your gums can help with teething pain, but if it gets worse you should go to a pediatric dentist.

, Chewing food when baby teeth are loose and with adult teeth growing in can be uncomfortable or painful. Even if you have a sore mouth, it’s important to keep up a good, well-balanced diet. Try eating vegetable soups, pureed fruits, and drink plenty of milk so your body stays strong while your teeth grow.Get more calcium in your diet, such as by drinking milk and eating yogurt and cheese. However, don’t worry about supplementing with fluoride as long as you use a fluoride toothpaste two times a day. This will prevent any enamel defects such as hypomineralization or fluorosis.

, Sometimes, adult teeth grow in behind baby teeth before they fall out, making a double row of teeth. This isn’t a major cause for concern, just make sure you take extra care to brush between the two sets of teeth. This will help remove plaque and bacteria that can grow in the space between them.Visit a dentist if you don’t lose the baby tooth or teeth in front of the adult tooth after three months.

Maintain oral hygiene by gently brushing, flossing, and gargling.,
Eat soft foods and avoid sugary food and drink.,
Quit smoking.,
See your dentist.",How to Take Care of Your Loose Teeth2," If a permanent tooth or teeth is loose, the most likely cause is gingivitis or periodontitis. These are gum diseases that weaken the tissues that hold your teeth in place. It’s very important to keep brushing, flossing, and using mouthwash if you have loose teeth, or your condition will worsen.Be very gentle when brushing around loose teeth. Use the softest tooth brush you can find. Look for one with a small, circular head.Try to carefully remove any buildup of plaque that might be growing in pockets where your gums have started to pull away from your teeth.
Consider using a dental pick, which is a tool that’s designed to remove plaque buildup in between teeth., Avoid hard or crunchy foods that can dislodge your loose tooth or teeth. Steer clear of sugary items, like candy (especially sticky candies), soda, and alcoholic beverages. It’s still important to keep up a well-balanced diet, so go for softer healthy foods like soups, oatmeal, fruit purees, yogurt, and smoothies.Be aware of heat or cold sensitivities as well, and avoid food and drink that are either too hot or too cold.

, Smoking irritates gums and encourages plaque buildup, which is the main cause of gum diseases that result in loose teeth. In addition, once you see a dentist, they might apply medications to your gums to prompt healing and new growth. Smoking can interfere with these medications., You should see a dentist as soon as you notice a loose tooth or teeth. A dentist can remove plaque and tartar that are at the root of gum diseases. Your dentist can also recommend any further treatments that might be necessary, refer you to a periodontist for specialty care, and determine if your brushing techniques need improvement.Your dentist can offer you bite guards or tooth splints, which are similar to braces, if your loose tooth or teeth greatly interfere with your daily routines or prevent tissues from regenerating.
In severe cases, your dentist might recommend surgical treatments, like bone or gum grafts to preserve and restore the affected tissue.
A dentist might recommend pulling a tooth or teeth if they are not viable. Ask them about options for implants, braces, or bridges to keep other teeth from shifting out of place.
Ask your dentist or their hygienist to dye your plaque, so that you can see it. This is a common way dentists and dental hygienists teach people to brush and floss more effectively.

Avoid scrubbing or scraping.,
Put the tooth back in its socket.,
Store in milk, mild saltwater, or saliva.,
See a dentist immediately.,
Visit the dentist if a tooth is knocked loose.",How to Take Care of Your Loose Teeth3," If your tooth falls out while brushing or during other oral care, eating, or after an impact, be sure to handle it carefully by its crown or top. Closely inspect it, but don’t scrub or scrape away any debris. If you mishandle it, you’ll risk damaging the root and tiny fibers that’ll be vital to successfully putting it back in place.Make sure the tip of the root is intact and the tooth is not fractured.


Gently rinse it off by dipping it in a mild saltwater solution or milk. Don’t hold it under running water, as this could kill the root cells.
Use a quarter teaspoon of salt to one quart of water if you use a saltwater solution.

, After rinsing the tooth in saltwater or milk, carefully put it back into its socket in the correct position, but you need to move fast because the socket needs to be free of blood clots. Try to manually put it all the way back into place. If you are unable to get it into the socket, try biting down on wet gauze or a moistened paper towel., If you aren’t able to place the tooth back into its socket, store it in milk or saltwater. Once again, use the ratio of a quarter teaspoon salt to one quart of water to make a mild saltwater solution. If milk or salt aren’t available, storing it in your own saliva is preferable to storing it in water.Don’t hold it in a dry napkin or cloth, as this will cause the root to dry out and prevent its successful replacement.

, As soon as you have the tooth back in its socket or appropriately stored, go to the dentist. Time is essential, so don’t make any delays and find a dentist as soon as you can. The tooth will not successfully re-implant without professional care.The dentist can inspect the tooth to see if the pulp or root has been damaged, and can offer you treatments to spur tissue regrowth.
You will likely need a root canal even if the tooth is salvageable, but getting it back in place will prevent the need for a dental implant or bridge.
Go to the closest emergency room if seeing a dentist isn't an available option.

, You should still see a dentist if a tooth is knocked loose due to an impact, but you’re otherwise in good oral health. Before going to the dentist’s office, try your best to shift the tooth back into its normal position. This will help save the root and encourage the fibers that keep it in place to regrow.Your dentist needs to inspect your loose tooth and make sure the root and pulp are intact. You will probably need to have an Xray to check the bone and any other fractures.
After several days, a dentist can tell if you’ll require a root canal. In the meantime, they can offer you a temporary cap or tooth stints to help keep the tooth in place and promote healing.
A dentist can also apply medications that will encourage the root and connective tissues to heal.

Learning the causes can help you prevent further decay.Acidic drinks, including citrus juices and sodas can contribute to enamel erosion.Diets high in starches and sugars can also lead to enamel erosion.Medical conditions like acid reflux disease (GERD), dry mouth, inherited genetic conditions, low salivary flow and gastrointestinal problems may cause your teeth to erode.Medications, including aspirin and antihistamines, can contribute to enamel erosion.Mechanical factors such as wear and tear, grinding, friction, brushing too hard, brushing when tooth enamel is softened.Poor oral hygiene can cause enamel erosion.;
,


Your teeth are yellowing. This is a result of the dentin showing through from behind worn tooth enamel.
Excessive sensitivity to temperature and sweet foods and drinks.Chips and cracks in your teeth.Pits or indentations on the surface of your teeth.Visible staining on the surface of your teeth., Fluoride can make teeth more resistant to acid, and may even help reverse early decay. Brushing your teeth twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste may help restore enamel or prevent further loss of it.You can get fluoride toothpaste at most pharmacies or grocery stores.
Ask your dentist about using fluoride. Too much fluoride can sometimes lead to more problems, such as enamel fluorosis, especially for children.
Your dentist can also prescribe stronger fluoride toothpastes than what you would get over the counter., If you find fluoride toothpaste too harsh, consider gargling with a fluoride mouthwash. This can help restore enamel or prevent further enamel loss.You can get fluoride mouthwashes at most pharmacies and some grocery stores.
Your dentist may be able to prescribe a stronger fluoride mouthwash if an over the counter version doesn’t work sufficiently., The most effective application of fluoride can be done by your dentist, either in the form of a varnish that is painted onto your teeth or a fluoride tray.Your dentist may also prescribe you a fluoride gel you can use at home. It can help to protect your teeth from losing more enamel, prevent cavities, and can promote general oral health.Fluoride treatment can help to strengthen your enamel, furthering the life of your fillings and restorations., Add regular remineralizing treatments to your oral hygiene routine. This may help restore enamel and reverse decay.Eating healthy fats, including cultured butter and coconut oil may help remineralize your teeth and promote enamel restoration.Bone broth may be another good option.Taking Vitamin D and calcium supplements may help restore enamel.Adding a ½ cup of coconut oil to your daily diet may help restore enamel., If home remedies aren’t helping to restore your enamel, consult your dentist about other options. Her treatment suggestions will depend on the level of erosion and presence of cavities, and can include dental crowns, fillings, or veneers., Dental crowns can cap the teeth and restore them to their original shape. The crowns are custom-fitted to cover your original tooth and may help prevent further decay and enamel loss.Your dentist will drill away decayed tooth and enamel and place the crown over the area.Crowns come in gold, porcelain, or resin., Dental veneers, also called onlays and inlays, are glued to the front of your teeth. Dental veneers cover eroded, cracked, broken or chipped teeth and help prevent further erosion., Dental fillings can repair cavities, which contribute to enamel erosion. This can help prevent further enamel decay and promote the overall well-being of your teeth.Fillings are made of tooth-colored, gold or silver amalgam or composite material designed to smooth out surfaces and decrease tooth sensitivity., A dental sealant coats the deep groves on molar and premolars and can protect them from decay. Have your dentist or hygienist apply a sealant to your molars for up to 10 years of protection from acid and other types of wear and tear to your teeth., You may have to return to the dentist several times to complete enamel restoration. Follow your dentist's instructions as to treatment, upkeep and suggestions for your dental hygiene.

, Brushing and flossing every day and after meals can maintain the health of your teeth, restorations, and gums. A clean environment may help you avoid further enamel erosion as well as unsightly stains.Make sure to brush and floss after meals if you can. If you have food stuck in your teeth, it promotes an environment that is rife for further damage to your enamel. If you don’t have a toothbrush, chewing a piece of gum can help., Sugary and acidic foods and beverages may contribute to enamel erosion, and controlling your intake of them can lead to better oral health. Brushing your teeth after consuming these foods may help prevent enamel erosion.Eat a healthy and well-balanced diet of lean protein, fruits and vegetables, and legumes can help with your overall well-being, including oral health.Even some healthy foods are acidic, including citrus fruits. Continue eating these, but limit how much you consume and consider brushing your teeth when you’re done.
Examples of sugary and acidic foods and beverages to avoid are soft drinks, sweets, candies, and wine.

, Mouthwashes and toothpastes that contain alcohol can decrease the durability of enamel or even stain it. Use non-alcohol colored toothpaste or mouthwashes to avoid these problems.You can find toothpastes and mouthwashes without alcohol at most grocery and drug stores or online retailers.

, Most tap water in the United States is treated with fluoride to help decrease tooth decay and strengthen enamel. Unless bottled water specifically states that it contains fluoride, the processes of distilling, filtering, and reverse osmosis remove any naturally occurring fluoride from the water. In fact increased consumption of bottled water may be connected to a resurgence of cavities in children.Grabbing bottled water instead of drinking from the tap may contribute to any loss of tooth enamel you may experience.


In addition, many bottled waters are actually acidic, which can be harmful to your teeth as well.
You can contact the manufacturer of your preferred bottled water to find out if their product contains fluoride., If you have a bad habit of clenching and grinding your teeth, you may damage your enamel and teeth. If you're a tooth-grinder, ask your dentist about using a mouth guard.Grinding wears restorations and can cause sensitivity and damage including small chips and cracks.Nail biting, opening bottles or holding objects with your teeth are also bad habits. Try and avoid these habits so that you don’t damage your teeth or fillings.

, Regular checkups and cleanings are an integral part of maintaining oral health. See your dentist at least twice a year, or more often if you’re having any issues with your teeth or enamel decay., Chewing gum increases saliva production, which can help prevent tooth decay. Xylitol has been shown to reduce bacterial activity and tooth decay, so consider a gum with Xylitol in it.

Undergo bone grafting to reverse bone loss.,
Get an osteogenesis-type bone graft to promote the regrowth of bone.,
Investigate osteoconduction bone grafts to provide a scaffold for bone growth.,
Try osteoconduction to promote stem cell growth.,
Undergo deep scaling to get rid of an infection causing bone loss.,
Have estrogen replacement therapy to prevent osteoporosis.",How to Reverse Dental Bone Loss1," It is very difficult to grow back dental bone that has already been lost. At present, the only way to completely reverse dental bone loss is to undergo bone grafting. When you undergo a bone grafting procedure, you can expect the wound to heal within 2 weeks.


Your dentist might tell you that you will have to wait for 3-6 months before seeing the result of the bone grafting procedure.
Bone grafting to reverse dental bone loss can be divided into three main types of procedure, discussed below.;
, In this procedure, bone will be taken from a source (an area of your jaw, mandible, etc.) and transferred to the area where you have dental bone loss. The bone cells that were transferred will start to multiply and create new bone to replace the bone that had been lost.


Taking bone from one place in your body and implanting it into the site where there is bone loss is the gold standard in bone grafting.
This technique allows your body to readily accept the new bone cells because it recognizes them as its own.
The transplant of bone marrow is often used in osteogenesis.

, In this process, a bone graft is implanted to the site where there is bone loss. These implants will serve as a scaffold where bone-forming cells (osteoblasts) can grow and multiply.


An example of a scaffold material is bioactive glass.
Together with the bone grafts, bioactive glass is transplanted to the area where there is bone loss, to regenerate dental bone.
These bioactive glass serve as scaffold on which the bone grafts can grow and lay down bone. They also release growth factors that make the bone-forming cells more effective in laying down bone.

, In this technique, bone grafts, such as Demineralized Bone Matrix (DBM), from cadavers and bone banks are transplanted to the area where there is dental bone loss. DBM grafts will cause stem cells to grow where there is missing bone, and these stem cells will transform into osteoblasts (bone-forming cells). These osteoblasts will heal the bone defect and will form new dental bone.


The use of DBM grafts from cadavers is legal and safe. Before the transplant occurs, all of the grafts will be sterilized thoroughly.
After making sure that it is safe for transplant, the bone graft will be tested to see if it suits the body of the recipient.

This is important to make sure that the transplant will not be rejected by your body.



, Deep scaling or non-surgical root planing is a deep cleaning technique, often needed if you are diabetic. During this procedure, the root area of the teeth is cleaned thoroughly to remove parts of the root that have been infected by the bacteria that is causing bone loss. Usually after deep scaling, gum disease will be controlled and no further dental bone loss will occur.


If you have diabetes you may have impaired healing and require additional dental precautions like antibiotics and antibacterial mouth rinses.
You may be prescribed doxycycline 100mg/day for 14 days. This compensates for your impaired immune system.
Chlorhexidine rinses can also be prescribed to kill the bacteria responsible for severe gum diseases. You will be asked to rinse with 10 milliliters (0.34  fl oz) of 0.2% chlorhexidine (Orahex®) for 30 seconds for 14 days., Estrogen can help prevent osteoporosis and maintain the mineral content of your bones, by slowing down your bone loss. Hormone replacement therapy can also reduce your risk of heart disease and bone fractures. There are a few ways to get estrogen replacement therapy, of which the following are the most common:


Estrace: 1-2 mg daily for 3 weeks
Premarin: 0.3 mg daily for 25 days
The following are estrogen skin patches that are also used in estrogen replacement therapy. These patches are worn on the stomach, below the waistline:

Alora
Climara
Estraderm
Vivelle-Dot

Apply a cold compress to the gums.,
Change your toothbrush and brushing technique.,
Be careful when flossing.,
Avoid alcohol-based mouthwashes.",How to Stop Bleeding Gums1," As an immediate solution for bleeding gums, you can apply a cold compress to the area.This helps to slow the blood flow to the area, resulting in less blood loss.
Make a cold compress by wrapping an ice cube in a clean piece of paper towel. Hold it against the bleeding gum, applying gentle pressure.;
, Bleeding gums are often caused by using a toothbrush whose bristles are too hard, or by brushing your gums too vigorously.Although you might think that harder brushing will result in cleaner teeth, this is actually not the case. Brushing too hard can damage tooth enamel (the protective surface on teeth) and irritate sensitive gum tissue, causing redness, swelling and bleeding.
Buy a toothbrush with soft nylon bristles that have blunted (rather than pointed) ends. When brushing, use a gentle circular motion to brush all sides of the teeth, almost as if massaging the teeth. Brushing your teeth vertically starting from the gum line and moving over the tooth surface removes the highest percentage of bacteria compared to other movements. Most people tend to use a vigorous back-and-forth motion, which is incorrect. This can lead to gum recession and erosion, which can make your teeth look longer and stained.
It's a good idea to invest in an electric toothbrush with a rotating and oscillating head. These toothbrushes are gentler on teeth and gums, but still more effective at removing plaque. Look for toothbrushes that are approved by the American Dental Association.For more information on the correct method of brushing your teeth, go to this article.

, Flossing is an essential part of maintaining good oral hygiene and should be done at least once a day.However, many people make the mistake of ""snapping"" the floss between the teeth, which can irritate the gums and cause inflammation and bleeding.
It's important to be gentle while you floss. Slowly and carefully slide the floss between your teeth, following the curve of each tooth.Hold the floss so that it forms a U-shape around the tooth, slide the floss below the gum line, then move it firmly up and down to remove plaque.
Even though it can be a little awkward, don't forget the teeth at the back.
Even though it can be a little awkward, don't forget the teeth at the back. For more information on how to floss correctly, see here.
You can also use an oral irrigation device (known as a ""water pick"") which attaches to the tap in your bathroom to shoot a small but forceful jet of water at your gum line, helping to clear debris. Buying a professional water pick is also a good choice if you have dental implants, bridges, or even periodontitis.

, Using mouthwash is a great way to freshen breath and eliminate bacteria from the mouth. However, alcohol-based mouthwashes are very drying, which can be irritating for swollen gums and cause them to bleed.Instead of alcohol-based mouthwashes, rinse out your mouth with hydrogen peroxide or salt water. These will keep your mouth clean and fresh, without irritating the gums."

Get feedback.,
Ask for a consultation.,
Get a second opinion.,
Try a dental school.,
Visit a non-profit.,
Consider payment plans.",How to Save Money on Dental Treatments1," Ask your friends, family, and coworkers if they have a dentist that they can confidently recommend. Explain that you are looking for effective, affordable dental care. Just like everything else, different dentists have different prices. When you are looking for a dentist, you should consider their qualifications, their reputation, and their pricing.Gather as much information as possible about your prospective dentist. Look at their website or call the office to find out if they accept insurance plans from your provider.;
, After you have chosen a dentist to try, phone the office and ask for a free initial consultation. Most dentists are willing to provide this service. During the consultation, you want to make sure that the dentist is competent, the office is clean, and the dentist thoroughly explains the procedure you need. This is also the right time to ask about costs.Get a clear estimate of how much the work proposed will cost. The office should be able to tell you how much of the cost your insurance will cover. This is a great time to ask if they have a sliding scale for payments, or offer any type of first time patient discounts.

, Don't be afraid to repeat this process with a second dentist's office. It might turn out that the work you need is actually less extensive than was originally suggested. Or you might find an office willing to do the work at a reduced cost. No one loves going to the dentist, but in this case, it is worth your time to do some extra research.


You also want to make sure you find a dentist who makes you feel relaxed and confident that you will get the desired results. There should be a friendly atmosphere between the doctor and patient.

, Contact your local universities to find out if they have a student dental clinic. Often times, dental students will perform procedures on patients to get clinical experience. The school will charge a lot less than your typical dentist's office.Students will be supervised while they perform your procedures, so you will still be receiving professional-level care at a dental school.

, There are several reputable non-profit organizations that offer free dental care. Typically, these services are offered to those with income below a certain level, so be prepared to show your financial information. Search online, contact your state’s dental association, or reach out to your local branch of United Way., Many dental providers will allow you to use a payment plan to cover your treatments. This is good because you don't have to provide the full amount of money upfront; however, it is important to find out all of the details of the payment plan.For example, find out the interest rate on the payments. You should also ask about the penalties for late payments.

Run it under hot water.,
Massage the bristles.,
Try soaking it in vinegar.,
Buy a softer toothbrush.,
Rinse and store your brush after use.,
Give your toothbrush a deep clean.,
Replace your toothbrush regularly.",How to Soften a Toothbrush," Holding your toothbrush under hot water is one of the most effective ways to soften your bristles.As the water heats the bristles and gets absorbed in the fibers, it will soften them and make them more pliable.


Hold the handle of the toothbrush so you won't burn yourself.
Let your tap water get hot, then put the bristles under the tap.
You can also try soaking your toothbrush in a glass of hot water, but be aware that the water will cool down fairly quickly. It may be less effective, unless you replenish the hot water periodically.
Be aware that while hot water will soften your bristles, it could render your toothbrush less effective. Hot water is also more likely to pick up metals and other harmful chemicals from your water tank or municipal pipes.;
, Some people find that massaging the bristles of a brush can make them softer and more broken in. This is commonly done to soften the bristles on a hair brush, but can easily be applied to a toothbrush.Hold the handle of the brush in one hand, and rub the bristles against a clean finger or the palm of your other hand.
Apply pressure with your finger or palm against the bristles in one direction while gently pushing the brush in the opposite direction with your other hand.
Switch directions. If you were previously pushing up with your palm and down with the brush, start pushing down with your palm and up with the brush.
Work the bristles side to side against your palm and move it with a circular motion. Try to massage the bristles equally in both directions.
Aim to massage the bristles about 20 times. This should adequately soften the bristles on its own, but you can also run the toothbrush under hot water first to further break it in.

, A common trick for softening paintbrushes can also be applied to softening a stiff-bristled toothbrush. Warm vinegar is an excellent way to remove dried-on paint and soften the nylon bristles of a hand-held paintbrush, so it's no surprise that some people might try this trick with a stiff toothbrush as well.Pour enough vinegar into a glass or mug so that the bristles will be completely submerged.
Warm the glass up in a microwave, ensuring that you use a microwave-safe container. It doesn't need to be boiling, just warm to the touch — try checking it after 20 to 30 seconds.
Submerge your toothbrush upside down in the glass of warm vinegar. Make sure the bristles are completely covered.
Let it soak for about 30 minutes.
When you're finished, rinse the toothbrush under hot water to remove any excess vinegar. You may also want to try massaging the bristles for increased effectiveness.
Vinegar can also have a slight antibacterial effect, which is good for any plaque left in the tip of the brush.
If the bristles still taste like vinegar, try soaking them overnight in a cup of mouthwash. If you use mouthwash regularly, you won't mind the minty taste on your toothbrush.

, Toothbrushes are generally available in a number of grades, ranging from ultra soft, soft, medium, and hard. Though ultimately a matter of preference, most dentists recommend using a soft or ultra-soft brush for both adults and children.Stiff bristles can be more effective at removing plaque and scrubbing out stains, but over time those hard bristles can actually damage your teeth and gums and you may develop problems such as enamel loss, dentin erosion or gum recession.
Try a soft or ultra-soft brush for a more gentle experience on your teeth enamel and gums.
Check your toothbrush's packaging for the American Dental Association's (ADA) Seal of Acceptance. This indicates that the toothbrush meets the ADA's guidelines of having safe bristles that aren't sharp or jagged and won't fall out with regular use., If you put your toothbrush away immediately after using it, you run the risk of your toothbrush harboring bacteria, mold, or fungus. Wet things put away in dark places tend to be breeding grounds for these microorganisms, and if there is any residual toothpaste or food particles on your bristles there's an even greater chance that something will grow.


Thoroughly rinse your bristles under tap water after brushing. If you're concerned about your toothbrush harboring bacteria, you may want to use hot water to clean it more effectively.
Store your toothbrush in an upright position to let the water drip out of the bristles. Allow the brush to air dry before you use it again — keep it in an open space, but not too close to the toilet or shower.
Do not cover a toothbrush or store it in a closed container. This is more likely to encourage microorganism growth than an open-air environment., Because bacteria naturally coats the inside of your mouth, you may want to periodically give your toothbrush a deep clean. This doesn't need to be done very often, but it's important to do any time you recover from an illness, especially if you suffer from an immune disorder.In most cases, deep cleaning once every month or so is probably sufficient.


Soak your toothbrush in antiseptic/antibacterial mouthwash. Simply fill a small cup with enough mouthwash to submerge the bristles, and leave your toothbrush soaking in it upside down.
Try putting your toothbrush through the dishwasher. The extreme heat and soap that run through your dishwasher will leave your toothbrush clean and free of bacteria, but it may melt your handle if you do this too often. Make sure you rinse the bristles to remove any soap residue.
Some people soak their toothbrush in vinegar once a week to kill bacteria. Others periodically soak toothbrushes in a 3% solution of hydrogen peroxide, or by mixing two teaspoons of baking soda into one cup of warm water., The ADA recommends replacing your toothbrush at least every three to four months; however, you may need to replace the toothbrush sooner, as the bristles will become frayed over time.Stop using a toothbrush immediately if it hurts your teeth or gums, or if the bristles have become mangled and damaged.
Discard old toothbrushes in the trash and buy a brand new replacement. You can buy a toothbrush at virtually any pharmacy, corner store, or general dry goods retailer.
Look for the ADA Seal of Acceptance on any new toothbrush that you purchase.

Prevent dental bone loss by maintaining excellent oral hygiene.,
Visit your dentist regularly to have thorough teeth cleaning done.,
Use fluoride toothpaste when brushing.,
Increase your intake of calcium to support bone health.,
Make sure you get enough vitamin D to absorb your calcium properly.",How to Reverse Dental Bone Loss2," To avoid having to undergo expensive bone grafting procedures, prevent dental bone loss from occurring. Preventing it is fairly easy, provided you take the necessary steps. All you have to do to maintain excellent oral hygiene is follow a few simple steps:


Brush your teeth thoroughly every after meal - Brushing your teeth at least twice a day can prevent gum diseases. Brushing removes the plaque that is responsible for gum diseases and dental bone loss.
Floss after brushing. Flossing gets rid of plaque that isn't removed by brushing. It is imperative that you floss after brushing because there might be plaque that remained in your teeth that were not reached by the bristles of your brush.

, Tooth decay is one of the leading causes of dental bone loss. Tooth decay can be prevented by regular visits to your dentist to receive a thorough cleaning and comprehensive dental care.


To preserve your dental bone, you must also keep all your teeth healthy.
Visit your dentist every six months for routine cleaning, a must in order to maintain excellent oral hygiene.
Regular consultation with your dentist enables him/her to monitor your oral health and prevent developing gum problems.
X-rays can be taken to clearly reveal areas of dental bone loss.
If you miss your routine dental check-ups, you may only find out about bone loss at a stage when it might not be reversible.

, Fluoride toothpaste can protect your teeth and gums from bone loss by, providing necessary minerals to your bones and tooth enamel.


Excessive use of fluoride other than toothpaste is not recommended, as it may lead to other health problems.
Use fluoride-based toothpaste once a day to brush your teeth, otherwise use normal toothpastes.
Do not use fluoridated toothpaste in kids below the age of 10 years.

, Calcium is a critical nutrient to the health of all your bones, including your teeth. Calcium-rich foods and calcium supplements make sure your system receives the adequate amount of calcium needed to build up and strengthen your bones and teeth, increasing your bone density and reducing your risk of dental bone loss and bone fracture.


Foods like low-fat milk, yogurt, cheese, spinach and soy milk are rich in calcium and are important for the maintenance of strong teeth and bones.
Calcium is also available in supplement tablets.

Take 1 tablet (Caltrate 600+) after breakfast and 1 tablet after dinner. Should you miss one dose, take it as soon as you remember it.



, Take a vitamin D supplement or get some sun to ensure that you have the proper levels of vitamin D in your body. Vitamin D helps increase your bone density by helping your body absorb and retain calcium in your system.


To determine if you are suffering from insufficient vitamin D, ask your doctor if you could have a blood test to measure the amount of vitamin D in your blood.

A result of less than 40ng/mL indicates insufficient vitamin D in your blood.
The recommended amount of vitamin D in your blood is 50 ng/mL.
Take 5,000 IU of a vitamin D supplement daily.

Recognize the signs and symptoms of dental bone loss to address it effectively.,
Understand that severe gum disease is a leading cause of dental bone loss.,
Know that diabetes contributes to an increased risk of bone loss.,
Be aware that osteoporosis contributes to general bone weakness and bone loss.,
Remember that getting teeth removed can lead to bone loss.",How to Reverse Dental Bone Loss3," Dental bone loss in its early stages is difficult to detect just by looking at your teeth. Dentists usually need radiographs or a CT-Scan to see if your bone is shrinking. If you haven't consulted with your dentist for a long time, chances are you'd only realize that you have dental bone loss during its more severe stages.


You can observe some changes if you are suffering from bone loss. These changes happen because your bone is shrinking and supporting your teeth less effectively. Note that these changes only develop over time:
Flaring of teeth
Formation of spaces in between teeth
Teeth feel loose and can be moved from side to side
Tilting of teeth
Rotating of teeth
Your bite feels different compared to before

, Periodontitis or severe gum disease, caused by the bacteria found in plaque, results in dental bone loss. The bacteria present in plaque inhabit your gums and secrete toxins that cause your bone to shrink.


Additionally, your immune system can contribute to bone loss as it is in the process of killing bacteria. This is because your immune cells secrete substances (e.g., matrix metalloproteinases, IL-1 beta, prostaglandin E2, TNF-alpha) that can also promote bone loss.

, Diabetes is a disease that is caused by the impairment of insulin production (Type I) and resistance to insulin (Type 2). Both types of diabetes have effects on oral health. People suffering from diabetes often have severe gum problems that can result in dental bone loss.


People with diabetes are hyperglycemic, or have elevated blood sugar levels that promotes the growth of bacteria responsible for bone loss.
People with diabetes have impaired host defenses because their white blood cells are weakened, making them more prone to infection.

, Osteoporosis is a disease often seen in women over the age of 60, wherein bone density decreases. This decrease is due to an imbalance in the calcium-phosphate equilibrium that helps maintain the mineral content of bone, combined with decreased estrogen levels.


A decrease in overall bone density also affects dental bone, putting it at risk for bone loss.

, Dental bone often shrinks as soon as you lose your teeth. After teeth removal, a blood clot will form and white blood cells go to the site where your tooth was previously located to clear the area of bacteria and damaged tissue. A few weeks after, new cells will go to the area to continue this clearing process. These cells (osteons) can promote bone formation.


However, these cells will only do so in the presence of teeth, because they demand bone for support. Since there are no teeth, there won't be any function for the bone and these cells will not create new bone.

Brush and floss daily.,
Eat a healthy diet.,
Quit smoking.,
Minimize stress.,
See your dentist at least twice a year.",How to Stop Bleeding Gums2," Although many people's response to sore, bleeding gums is to cut back on brushing and flossing until the irritation dies down, this is the worst thing you can do. The only way to get your gums back to a healthy condition is through good oral hygiene, which involves systematic brushing and flossing.Although dentists typically recommend brushing twice a day, people with gum disease should brush more frequently, preferably after every meal or snack.
You may also want to use a gum stimulator, which promotes constant blood flow to the gums and prevents inflammation.
You should also floss at least once a day, making sure to floss below the gum line on every tooth, to remove the maximum amount of plaque.
You should also floss before you brush, so any bits of food or bacteria that you dislodge from between your teeth will be brushed away, not left to sit in your mouth.
Also remember to brush your tongue, as this is a major breeding ground for bacteria.

, Eating a balanced diet is important for healthy teeth and gums, and can help to prevent gum disease.Try to eat lots of whole grains, vegetables and fruit, as these will provide you with the vitamins and minerals you need to stay healthy and ward off disease. Fruits and veg high in Vitamin C, such as bell peppers, kale, broccoli, berries and citrus fruits, are particularly important.Dairy products such as milk, yogurt and cheese provide calcium and they are important for strong teeth and healthy gums, particularly in children and should be consumed instead of soft drinks or any other acidic beverages. They help to clear sugars from the mouth, thus preventing bacteria build-up and plaque.Avoid eating foods full of sugar or processed carbohydrates, as these contribute to plaque and can be damaging to teeth. Also avoid snacking too much between meals and eating before bedtime., In case you weren't aware, smoking is bad news when it comes to the health of your teeth and gums.Toxins in cigarettes and tobacco make your gums more prone to inflammation and disease. They also negatively impact your body's immune response, making it harder to fight infection.Smoking also interferes with blood flow because nicotine constricts blood vessels reducing blood flow to your gums. This leaves your gums undernourished, causing them to become fibrous and swollen.Smokers are six times more likely to develop gum disease than their non-smoking counterparts, and tend to develop more serious gum disease which often requires tooth extraction, as smoking lessens the success rate of other treatments., When you are stressed out, your body produces more of a hormone called cortisol, which negatively affects the health of your teeth and gums.More specifically, cortisol decreases inflammation creating vessel constriction which increases blood pressure. It also affects the immune system, making it harder for your body to ward off disease.Stress also increases adrenaline and glucose blood levels, which can contribute to diabetes.
You can reduce your stress levels by getting better-quality sleep, by exercising more often and by spending time with your friends and family., You should visit your dentist at least twice a year, or more if you have pre-existing teeth or gum problems.Only your dentist can perform a professional and thorough cleaning by using instruments that clean the parts of your mouth that cannot be reached simply by brushing and flossing.
Don't let the cost put you off; catching a gum disease or other tooth problems early will help save money in the long run as you will require less extensive treatment.
Once you're there, you can ask your dentist how often she recommends you get a cleaning."

Identify the cause of bleeding gums.,
Understand the consequences of a gum disease.,
Visit your dentist.",How to Stop Bleeding Gums3," Bleeding is a sign of unhealthy gums and may be caused by a gum disease or other medical conditions. It is important you understand the cause of bleeding in order to take the appropriate steps to prevent it. Bleeding gums could be caused by:


Poor oral hygiene. Irregular brushing or flossing, or performing these actions incorrectly, can lead to gum disease such as gingivitis and periodontitis, which are common causes of bleeding gums.Brushing too hard with a toothbrush older than three months. Being too vigorous with your brushing or using an old toothbrush can inflame delicate gum tissue and cause it to bleed.Hormonal changes. Hormonal changes caused by pregnancy, menopause or menstruation can increase blood flow to the gums, making them more prone to bleeding.Medical conditions. Bleeding gums can be a symptom of many medical conditions, such as bleeding or clotting disorders, conditions of immunodeficiency, diabetes, heart disease, cancer and scurvy.Certain medications. Blood thinning medications can make your gums more likely to bleed, as can several other medications, such as antiepileptics or contraceptive medication, which dry out or thicken your gums.Vitamin K deficiency. This vitamin helps in aiding your blood to clot properly. Thus, vitamin K deficiency can cause gums to bleed.Hereditary factors. People with certain genetic markers are more predisposed to developing gum disease than others, making them more prone to bleeding gums.Unbalanced bite. Having an unbalanced bite due to crooked or crowded teeth, clenching or grinding can lead to excess pressure in certain areas of your mouth, inviting gum disease and bleeding., It is estimated that in the United States, gum disease affects about 3/4 of adults over the age of 35.The main cause of bleeding gums is gingivitis, a condition characterized by inflammation and swelling of the gums.
Gingivitis is caused by excess bacteria in the mouth. The bacteria come from the fermentation of carbohydrates. This leads to inflammation, which is a protective response of the gums. Bacterial growth usually develops due to poor oral hygiene. Luckily, gingivitis is often reversible, provided good oral hygiene practices are introduced and maintained.If left untreated, gingivitis can lead to a more serious form of gum disease called periodontitis. Periodontitis significantly weakens the gums and bone that hold teeth in place, which eventually leads to tooth loss.Research links gum disease with higher instances of health complications, such as heart disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, pneumonia, osteoporosis, cancer and preterm birth. Therefore, it is very important to catch and treat gum disease early., If you notice that your gums are bleeding and suspect that you might have gum disease, it's highly recommended that you make an appointment with your dentist immediately.


Your dentist can confirm the presence of gum disease and come up with a plan to reverse or treat the damage.
Your dentist can give your teeth a good professional cleaning and instruct you on how to properly care for your teeth and gums at home.
If the gum disease is more advanced, your dentist may recommend scaling and root planing treatments to remove stubborn plaque and help gums to heal.Medications may also be prescribed in order to reduce the amount of oral bacteria.In serious circumstances, tooth extraction, laser treatments or dental surgery may be required in order to halt the progression of periodontitis."

Try to obtain dental insurance.,
Maximize your benefits.,
Use government benefits.,
Create a budget.",How to Save Money on Dental Treatments2," Many employers these days offer dental insurance as part of a comprehensive benefits package. If you do not currently have a job that provides dental insurance, you might want to consider trying to find a position that offers such benefits. Even some part-time jobs now offer dental coverage.If you do not have dental insurance through your employer, you can purchase a stand alone dental insurance package. Do some research on the Affordable Care Act and what it means for you.Understand your plan. If you have insurance, make sure you understand which treatments are covered and which are not. You should also make sure to know how much your co-pay is for each procedure. If the insurance is through your employer, you can ask your Human Resources representative to explain your benefits. If you have a stand alone policy, you can call the customer service center for your provider and ask for clarification on any questions.

, Once you understand your policy, make sure that you are taking advantage of all of your coverage. For example, if your policy covers one cleaning per year, make sure to schedule it before the end of the calendar year. You should also find out whether any of your funds ""roll over"" to the next year.You might also be able to put funds into a Flex Spending Account for medical purposes. This money can help you cover the costs of any treatments that are not fully covered by your insurance., The government provides many resources for those who are unable to afford necessary healthcare. This includes dental treatments. This is especially true for the elderly and those living below the poverty line. You can check with your local social services office to get more information about these programs and to see if you qualify.The government offers special programs for children's dental care.

, Once you have gathered information about how much your treatments will cost, you can account for that money in your monthly budget. Take a look at your spending and figure out some areas where you can save money. Try using an online budgeting tool to help you figure out creative ways to save."

Learn about the procedure.,
Practice good oral hygiene.,
Prevent oral health problems.",How to Save Money on Dental Treatments3," When you are told that you need a dental treatment beyond a standard cleaning or cavity repair, it is time to do some research. Make sure that you understand why the procedure is necessary and how it can affect your oral health. Ask questions about the cost, the recovery process, and the lasting impact.Ask about the pros and cons of a procedure and what other options may be. Ask also about the advantages of more expensive materials which may be used. Remember that good, quality dental work will help you save more money in the future, so it is sometimes better to spend a little more now and save down the line.
Ask friends and relatives if they have ever had a similar procedure. As you gather information, ask them about their experience and if they have any advice.

, Keep in mind that oral hygiene does not just matter in terms of your teeth. Taking good care of your mouth is important for your overall health. For example, gum decay has been linked to certain cancers and heart problems.Brush at least twice a day using a dentist recommended toothpaste. Brush firmly, but gently, taking care to clean your gums as well as your teeth.

Floss daily. Flossing is crucial for the health of your gums. Make sure to clean between each of your teeth once a day.

, Preventative measures can help you avoid costly dental treatments. In addition to brushing and flossing, you should make sure to eat a balanced diet. Also, do not smoke, as it greatly harms you mouth."

Brush your teeth.,
Floss your teeth.,
See you dentist.,
Get evaluated by the dentist.,
Follow your dentist's suggestions.",How to Remineralize Your Teeth Naturally1," You need to brush your teeth at least twice a day with a soft toothbrush. Teeth can be damaged by brushing too hard or using toothbrushes with hard bristles. Leave the toothpaste in your mouth without rinsing. You should spit out the extra foam, but don’t rinse your mouth out with water. You want to give the minerals some time to be absorbed onto your teeth.


Don’t forget to brush your tongue.;
, You need to floss your teeth daily. Use about 18 inches of floss. Wind most of the floss around the middle finger of one hand and the rest around the middle finger of the other hand. Hold the floss firmly between your thumb and your forefinger and gently guide the floss between all your teeth using a gently back and forth motion. You need to curve the floss around the bottom of each tooth.


Once the floss is between the teeth, use a gentle up-and-down motion to rub each side of each tooth. When you are done with one tooth, unwind more floss and move on to the next tooth., Before you go through the steps for remineralization, make sure you actually need to. Make an appointment with a dentist to check the health of your teeth. After you start the process, you will need to continue seeing your dentist to make sure these methods are helping. This can only be determined by a dental examination.


You should see your dentist regularly. This will keep your teeth healthier. You should also get your teeth professionally cleaned as much as is recommended by your dentist.

, When you visit the dentist, she will evaluate your dental health and assess how well you are caring for your teeth and gums. The dentist will also determine if there is a risk for cavities. This will involve a teeth exam and some X-rays. She may also ask you to swish a fluoridated remineralization solution in your mouth for a few minutes.


The dentist will also look for any signs of cancer or jaw problems.

, The dentist will let you know if your teeth need remineralization. If your teeth do need remineralization, discuss your plans with the dentist so they know about them. Only a dentist can confirm your teeth are remineralized.

Use fluoride dental products.,
Buy fluoride-free remineralizing paste.,
Make your own remineralizing toothpaste.",How to Remineralize Your Teeth Naturally2," Fluoride is put into toothpaste and dental rinses to replace the calcium component in the enamel compounds with fluorapatite, a substance that is resistant to demineralization by acids. Fluoride toothpastes help remove bacterial plaques and can strengthen tooth enamel. Fluoride ions replace calcium ions, which strengthens the enamel. Fluoride can also help the process of remineralization in part because it is anti-microbial, killing off the oral bacteria that often is an underlying cause for teeth to lose their enamel.If your teeth are sensitive, use a toothpaste for sensitive teeth. These types of toothpaste can help reduce gum inflammation as well.There are some tooth remineralization toothpastes, liquids, and powders. Ask your dentist for her recommendations. You should also only use a fluoride toothpaste with a seal from the American Dental Association.
You can also use a special toothpaste meant to rebuild enamel, such as Squigle Enamel Saver toothpaste, which has fluoride in it.

, Fluoride is helpful but not necessary for remineralization. It makes the teeth stronger, but teeth don’t actually contain the substance the toothpaste puts back into them. Because of this, there are ways to remineralize without fluoride. Toothpastes without fluoride reduce the bacteria in your mouth. They do this with xylitol, a sugar alcohol that reduces the adherence of plaque-forming bacteria to your teeth.


These toothpastes also replace the calcium and phosphate used in your tooth enamel.Common toothpastes without fluoride Redmond Earthpaste, Dr Collins Restore toothpaste, Apagard Premio toothpaste, and Tom’s of Maine Cavity protection.

, Instead of buying over the counter toothpaste, you can make your own at home. Use 4 tablespoons (59.1 ml) of calcium carbonate powder. You get this powder from crushing calcium carbonate tablets or by buying the calcium powder in bulk. Add to it 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) baking soda, ½ to 1 packet of stevia, and 1 teaspoon sea salt. Mix together. To that, add enough coconut oil to make a paste. Once it is a paste, add a few drops of peppermint oil until it is minty enough for you. Mix completely. Dip your toothbrush into the paste and brush.


You can make a larger batch of this at any time, just seal it in a jar and keep it in the refrigerator to keep it from spoiling.
If you want to whiten your teeth or have stubborn stains, add 2 teaspoons of 3% hydrogen peroxide. It will cause some foaming and perhaps some tingling, but don't worry. That is normal. Hydrogen peroxide is antibacterial and works as a bleaching agent. Don’t use anything stronger than a 3 % solution because higher concentrations can burn and irritate the gums and mouth."

Avoid all forms of sugar.,
Moderate certain fruits.,
Increase saliva production.,
Take a mineral supplement.,
Eat foods high in Vitamin D. When you are trying to remineralize your teeth, you need to increase your intake of Vitamin D. You can do this by eating foods rich in the vitamin.,
Get Vitamin D other ways.,
Drink lots of water.,
Try oil pulling.",How to Remineralize Your Teeth Naturally3," Tooth demineralization is associated with a number of dietary habits. If you want to remineralize your teeth, avoid all sugar. You should also avoid all processed starches, which affect your teeth the same way as sugar. Bacteria grows quickly in the presence of sugar, so you want to minimize how much you feed these bacteria. You should avoid all processed and pre-packaged food such as breads, cookies, cakes, chips, and crackers.You should also avoid soda and any other sweetened drinks. These tend to contain a lot of added sugar. They also are acidic and can damage the enamel that way as well.
If you are not sure what is in a food, read the label. If sugar, high fructose corn syrup, cane syrup, or another sweetener is listed, avoid it.If you enjoy sweets, try to limit the sweets you eat to honey, which is anti-bacterial, and stevia, an herb that is 200 times sweeter than sugar. Stevia also has the added benefit of being calorie free.Artificial sweeteners like aspartame are chemically very different from sugar, but they essentially fool the brain into thinking that something is sweet., When trying to remineralize your teeth, you should limit the amounts of citrus fruits you eat. If you do eat citrus, you should rinse your mouth out with water to decrease the amount of acid.


The sugar in fruit is another type of sugar that is not as popular with bacteria. This means you do not have to limit the intake of non-citrus fruits such as apples, pears, or peaches.

, Stimulating the production of saliva naturally helps remineralize your teeth. When you eat, you should chew every bite completely. Chewing promotes the production of saliva. You can also chew mint flavored sugar free gum or eat sugar free hard candy to help promote saliva production in your mouth.


Sour foods also tend to increase saliva production, but sour foods are acidic, so be careful with have much of these foods you eat., There are multiple kinds of mineral supplements you can take. You can take a multivitamin, but make sure it includes minerals such as calcium and magnesium. Any daily supplement you take for your teeth should contain at least 1000 mg of calcium and at least 3-4000 mg of magnesium. These minerals help rebuild tooth enamel naturally.


Men older than 71 and women older than 51 should get 1200 mg every day.Children have different mineral needs, so make sure you consult a doctor or use a children's multivitamin to decide on the right amount per day., These foods include fish, soy milk, coconut milk, cow’s milk, eggs, and yogurt., If you want to get Vitamin D in ways other than food, you can take a supplement or get it from the sun. Adults and children should get about 600 IU of Vitamin D every day, so find a supplement that has this much Vitamin D in it per dose. You can also get extra Vitamin D by spending about 10-15 minutes every third day in the afternoon sun without sunscreen. You should expose the arms, legs, and back if you can.Adults over 70 years should get 800 IU of Vitamin D every day.
You should take Vitamin D, calcium, and magnesium together to increase your chances of teeth remineralization.

, You should drink 6-8 eight ounce glasses of water without minerals a day. You should drink water to stay hydrated, since other beverages will not hydrate as well because they contain ingredients such as sugar, caffeine, or protein. Hydration also increases saliva production, which helps remineralize and protect your teeth.


You don't have to drink water with minerals in it. For the most part, you can get your minerals from eating well.
Tap water will also contain minerals, though the amount and what sort depend on where you live. You can check the mineral content of your local water online., Oil pulling is a method where you hold and then swish oil around your mouth once a day. There have been small studies using coconut oil or sesame oil that show this method can reduce bacterial plaques and gum inflammation. In the morning, put 1 tablespoon of sesame oil into your mouth before any food or liquid is taken. With your mouth closed and your chin tilted upwards swirl the oil around your mouth, moving it around your mouth and in between your teeth. Also move your mouth as if you were chewing as you swirl around the liquid. Continue for 15-20 minutes, then spit out the oil.After you spit the oil out, you should brush your teeth and wash out your mouth. You also should drink 2-3 glasses of water.
Do no gargle the oil like you would other mouth rinses.

Watch for discoloration.,
Look for a change in shape.,
Check for cracks or chips.,
Pay attention to any tooth sensitivity that develops.,
Pay attention to your biting force.,
Check your teeth for cavities.",How to Recognize Tooth Enamel Loss1," When your enamel breaks down there are many ways in which your teeth physically change. From the color to the shape, the loss of enamel can cause your teeth to look drastically different.


Dentin is the yellowish layer of your tooth located under your enamel. As the enamel wears down and the dentin gets thinner and a thinner layer of enamel covers the dentin, it becomes more transparent and your teeth will appear more yellow.How yellow your teeth are is a good indication of how thin your enamel is; the less enamel you have, the more yellow your teeth will be.If you're uncertain as to whether your teeth are yellow from stains or due to enamel loss, try having them whitened. Artificial stains will come off.;
, Another way in which your teeth physically change when enamel loss occurs is a change in shape. Your teeth may appear to be rounded and short.


When you lose enamel your teeth may take on a rounded shape and can also cause your teeth to look shorter than normal.If you have a tooth filling, you may notice that your tooth seems to have shrunk around the filling. This shrinkage is caused by the loss of tooth enamel.

, Teeth that have lost a good deal of enamel may develop fractures or chips.Even if your teeth haven’t developed fractures yet, you should see a doctor as soon as you notice that your teeth are looking brittle and thin. This is a sign that they might fracture soon.

, When enamel wears down the dentin layer underneath is revealed. Not only does this make your teeth yellow, it also makes them very sensitive to pain.


This sensitivity may arise when you eat hot or cold foods and occasionally sweet foods, or when you inhale cool air.
In severe enamel and dentin decay, the pulp, which is the innermost part of the tooth, could also become damaged, leading to a lesion called pulpitis. If this is the case, you will experience severe pain when you eat., When enamel and dentin begin to thin your teeth may appear shorter and you may find it more difficult to chew.


The chewing surfaces of your teeth become flattened, which causes you to bite and chew your food with difficulty.
Aside from it being more difficult to chew, you might also experience pain when you take a bite of food.

, Enamel loss makes your teeth brittle and prone to cavities. This is because enamel protects your teeth from plaque and debris buildup. When the enamel isn’t there, plaque and debris buildup can result in cavities.The cavities on the surface of the tooth can enter into the deeper parts of the tooth through the opening that missing enamel has left unprotected. This can cause extreme pain and in some cases, infection due to bacteria that has an easier access through the porous structure of dentin.

Determine if you have a Hawley retainer.,
Hold the retainer properly.,
Place the retainer in your mouth.,
Push the retainer onto your teeth.,
Anchor the retainer firmly to your back teeth.",How to Put on a Retainer1," This is made of plastic and wires. The plastic piece is shaped to the inside of your mouth. The wires should fit around the front row of your teeth (usually the front six), with more wires in the back to hold it firmly in place over your back teeth., You will need to know whether the retainer is for your top or bottom row of teeth. The plastic arch in the center should be pointing up or down toward the row of teeth it will hold in place. Make sure the metal strip is pointed away from your mouth., Make sure it is close to the right row of teeth. Don't hold it there for a long time — this is a quick step to make sure you push it on all at once.


Don't use too much force as you may hurt your gums if you didn't place it correctly. Check the position in a mirror while opening wide your mouth.

, Do this quickly after placing it in your mouth. Make sure the plastic arch fits perfectly into the roof or base of your mouth, that the wire in the front fits perfectly around your front teeth, and that the wires in the back fit around your back teeth. If your retainer does not fit properly, call your dentist or orthodontist, as it probably needs an adjustment. This could be either the wires around your teeth, or the plastic in your mouth.

, Use your fingers to push it into place if need be. Do not bite the retainer into place, as that may damage it. You should hear a click when it fits into place. If your retainer is falling out, or not staying in place, you may not have anchored it properly, or you may need to see your dentist or orthodontist to adjust the retainer."
"
Go to the dentist.,
Be careful not to brush your teeth too hard.,
Protect yourself from tooth-to-tooth contact.,
Ditch the unhealthy biting habits.,
Cut back on acidic drinks.,
Watch out for sticky foods.,
Be careful with medications.,
Be aware of health issues that can cause enamel loss.",How to Recognize Tooth Enamel Loss2," Regular visits to the dentist will help you to be proactive in the fight against enamel loss; however, if you notice any of the signs of enamel loss in between visits, make an appointment right away.


Try to visit your dentist at least once a year. Though some dentists will want to see you every six months; going at least once a year will help with early detection of enamel loss.
If you think you may have a cavity, point it out to your dentist at the beginning of the appointment. Mention any other symptoms you may be experiencing, as well.

, You may not realize it, but brushing your teeth too hard can negatively impact your enamel.Using a hard brush and harsh strokes can similarly contribute to enamel loss.


Always use a soft bristle brush, along with gentle strokes when brushing.
Don’t forget those hard to reach places such as your gums and back teeth. Try to spend at least two minutes just on those areas, but brush gently.

, Habits such as teeth grinding and jaw clenching can be harmful to your enamel, as the friction causes wear and tear.If you think you may be harming your enamel at night, speak with a dentist about solutions for teeth grinding and jaw clenching.


Getting fitted for a custom mouth guard or purchasing an inexpensive option online will help to protect against those harmful grinding and clenching habits.

, Mom always yelled at you for biting your nails, but did you know this seemingly harmless habit is anything but harmless when it comes to your enamel?


In addition to biting your nails, refrain from chewing on bottle caps and pens as doing these things can also contribute to wear and tear of the enamel.
Chewing ice or tobacco is another stressful activity for your teeth and can result in chips and fractures, which contribute to enamel loss.

, Consuming acidic drinks temporarily softens your enamel, which leads to its eventual breakdown. This is particularly worrisome if you’re consuming these products frequently.Ditch carbonated beverages such as soda and fruit juices that are high in sugar. If you do choose to drink soda or juice, get in the habit of rinsing your mouth out with water afterwards.Sports drinks, wine, and beer are also high in sugar and should be avoided as often as possible. Just like with soda and juice, try to rinse with water after consuming these beverages.

, Sticky food, as you may have guessed, stick to your teeth for a longer duration than other foods. Additionally, they often contain a high sugar content, which promotes the production of acid.Foods like candy bars and toffee can do a number on your teeth, as can starchy foods such as bread.
You don’t necessarily have to give up these tasty treats. Simply limit your intake and space out your sticky foods. For example, if you consumed a lot of bread with dinner, try not to eat toffee for dessert.

, Aspirin, antihistamines, some asthma medications and chewable vitamin C can all cause enamel loss, due to their acidic nature.


Because these medication are acidic by nature, damage can occur when they come into contact with tooth surfaces. Corrosion is one of the damaging side effects.
Know that you don’t have to abstain from taking these often beneficial medications. Always take oral medicines, such as aspirin, with a glass of water. For chewable medicines, rinse your mouth out with water, then wait a few minutes before brushing your teeth.

, This is primarily true for health issues, which result in frequent vomiting, as acids from the stomach enter the mouth and cause tooth enamel loss.There are many illnesses which affect tooth enamel loss. Acid reflux, gastrointestinal problems, peptic ulcers, bulimia, alcoholism, and pregnancy are just a few examples of such illnesses.
Despite what you may think, it’s better not to brush your teeth right after you’ve vomited. The acidic environment softens your enamel and brushing immediately can harm your teeth. Instead, simply rinse with water, wait for a half hour or so and then brush your teeth."

Determine if you have an Essix retainer.,
Hold the retainer properly.,
Place the retainer in your mouth.,
Push the retainer onto your teeth.",How to Put on a Retainer2," This retainer is a clear plastic mold of your teeth, with no additional pieces or wires. It should cover the entire row of teeth (top or bottom). Because they are made only of thin plastic, Essix retainers may warp or bend, which makes them not fit properly. If your retainer used to fit, but no longer does, it may need to be fixed or replaced by your dentist., You will need to know whether your retainer is for your top or bottom row of teeth. Make sure the arch points forward, and that the opening can be placed on the correct teeth., Make sure it is close to the correct row of teeth. Don't hold it there for a long time — this is a quick step to make sure you push it on all at once.

, Do this quickly after placing it in your mouth. The plastic should fit snugly over your whole row of teeth, and should not move. Make sure your retainer fits over all of your teeth, including in the back to hold it in place. If your retainer is falling out, or not staying in place, you may not have anchored it properly.


Remember not to eat with the retainer placed, as you may break it or hurt your jaw.

Try laxative tea cleanses.",How to Make a Homemade Colon Cleanser," Colon cleansing can take a few forms. You can perform a colonic, also known as colon hydrotherapy. This is done using a small tube inserted into the rectum, through which warm water is gently pumped. You can also take an oral solution to increase excrement output, which are essentially homemade laxatives.Doing water or salt water enemas at home without a professional assistance is not recommended unless instructed to do so by a doctor.Most mainstream physicians do not recommend regular colonics for healthy individuals, though some natural doctors and other healthcare professionals recommend colon cleansing once or twice a year to help release toxins.;
, Colon cleanses can be very helpful, but can also become harmful over time. Even natural, homemade colon cleansers can be hurtful to you. Just because something is natural doesn’t mean it is harmless and a serious problem can occur if you begins to depend on colon cleansers rather than your healthy, natural colon function.


This dependence is called laxative abuse and can be an addiction much like any other.
Laxative abuse can result in damage to the kidneys and the cardiovascular system and can be life-threatening.Never use a cleanse more than every six months unless under the care of a health professional.

, Once you do a colon cleanse, you need to put back in certain nutrients, called prebiotics and probiotics, into your body. Be prepared to restock and support your colon bacteria by eating foods that contain good bacteria for at least one to two months after you cleanse. These foods include:


Bananas
Garlic
Leeks
Wheat bran
AsparagusSauerkraut
Kefir
Yogurt
Kimchee
Aged cheeses, Talk to your doctor before you try any colon cleanse. Discuss the type of cleanse you plan on doing to be certain it isn't going to hurt you. Certain herbs, fruits, and vegetables can interact with prescription medications, so be aware of the side effects of your medications.


As a general rule, anyone with a condition that affects the digestive tract, the kidneys, the liver, or the cardiovascular system should be very cautious about using a colon cleanse and should always talk to their doctor before using a cleanse.
If you have more than three to four bowel movements in a day, discontinue all cleanses and call your doctor for advice.

, For natural, food based cleanses, you need to pick the right foods. Vegetables contain fiber that is essential for healthy and frequent bowel movements. Pick the freshest fruit you can, and try to buy organic is possible. You want to be ingesting as many nutrients as possible with no additives. Make sure all vegetables and fruits are raw when you use them in the cleanse. Good produce to include is:


Spinach
Asparagus
Brussels sprouts
Cabbage
Celery
Collard greens
Leeks
Peas
Swiss chard
Mustard greens
Dark green lettuces
Wheatgrass
Kale
Bok choy
Parsley
Cilantro
Cucumber
Beets and beet greens, The best ways to use fresh produce for a colon cleanse is to use a juicer or to make them as smoothies in a blender. The juices will kick start your colon and also give you added energy, and the edible skins give you added fiber. You can also add organic apple juice as needed to the juice to make it thin enough to drink easily. Apple juice contains pectin, a kind of fiber which is very helpful in achieving complete bowel movement.


You can mix and match vegetables to your own taste, but you should add enough to have three eight ounce glasses every day for five to seven days.
Add some fruit to improve the taste. Use bananas, oranges, cherries, berries, plums, or apples. If you leave the edible skins on the fruit, it will give you an added boost of fiber. , If you aren't sure what kind of recipe to start with, try a green cleanse recipe. Chop two apples, four stalks of celery without the leaves, one cucumber, six kale leaves and add it to a blender or juicer. Add one tablespoon of finely chopped fresh ginger root and lemon juice. Blend or juice and enjoy. If this mixture is too bitter, try adding one teaspoon of honey to sweeten it.

, If you don't like straight greens, try a recipe with more fruit. Mix two peeled oranges, one quartered and cored apple, two tablespoons of lemon juice, 1 cup of spinach, and one kale leaf in a juicer or blender. Once smooth or juiced, drink and enjoy.


You can add a little apple juice if this mixture isn't thin enough for you.
You can also add some baby carrots for some extra color, fiber, and sweetness.

, For a more nutrient packed cleanse, try an aloe vera juice based cleanse. Add together one cup aloe vera juice, ½ cup of rolled oats, one cup spinach, two kale leaves, five Swiss chard leaves, one peeled banana, ½ a medium cucumber, ½ cup of blueberries, and one teaspoon of cinnamon. You can either put it through a juicer or mix it in a blender. Once smooth or juiced, drink and enjoy.You can add some honey if it isn't sweet enough.

, One popular cleanse for colon health is a psyllium and bentonite clay cleanse. Bentonite clay is a mixture of mineral salts, which includes calcium bentonite and sodium bentonite. This clay absorbs many times its weight in water as well as minerals, toxins, and organic substances. This ability makes bentonite clay useful in cleanses. It is commonly used by natural health professionals and has found a place in mainstream medicine to safely treat various types of poisonings and overdoses.Bentonite clay and psyllium husks, a naturally derived fiber-heavy powder, can be purchased online or at your local health food store.

, Be careful how much of the bentonite clay you use. An overabundance of this product can cause electrolyte, or mineral, imbalances. This can cause some serious health issues, which is counterproductive to the goal of a cleanse. Make sure to talk to your doctor before your try this cleanse. It is not recommended for everyone, so always follow your doctor's advice. He or she knows your situation and how this product can effect you better than anyone.


Also, always follow the directions on the products you buy., To make this cleanse, add one rounded teaspoon psyllium husk, which can be dark yellow or brown husks, to one teaspoon of bentonite clay powder to an empty glass. Add eight ounces water or pure, organic apple juice to the glass, stirring briskly to dissolve the powder. Drink it quickly before it has time to thicken.


This should immediately be followed by another eight ounces of water or apple juice.
You can also get bentonite clay in liquid form., The Master Cleanse is great for cleansing, but it has also been used as a weight loss method. It has been in use since 1940, but it does have some known adverse effects, such as vitamin deficiencies, blood sugar changes, muscle breakdown, and frequent bowel movements.


Always consult a physician before doing the Master Cleanse. You should not do a Master Cleanse for longer than four to five days.
If you are pregnant, nursing, under 16 or over 50, or have chronic heart, kidney, liver or digestive conditions, you should not use the Master Cleanse., The traditional Master Cleanse has a set recipe. Start by freshly squeezing the juice of one lemon into a cup, which should be about two tablespoons. Next, add two tablespoons of pure, organic maple syrup. To this, add a pinch of cayenne pepper, which is about 1/10 of a teaspoon. Pour 10 ounces of purified water on top and stir vigorously. Once it settles, drink the whole glass.


Drink a minimum of six to 12 glasses throughout the day whenever you are hungry or feel you need a colon cleanse. , In addition to these other cleanses, you can try tea cleanses before bed. Try teas with laxative-like qualities, such as herbal detox teas or senna tea. Herbal detox teas contain ingredients that will help cleanse your system and energize your as well. Senna has been used as medicine in Arabic and European countries since 800 BCE, mainly as a laxative. You can buy these at your local heath food stores.


To make herbal detox tea, boil a tablespoon of the loose leaf tea, or the tea bag, in eight ounces of water for 15 minutes. Let cool, strain, and drink.
To make senna tea, take one teaspoon of dried senna or three tablespoons of fresh senna leaves. Add the leaves to eight ounces of boiled water. Steep for five to 10 minutes, strain, and drink."

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) offers helpful nutritional guidelines through its My Plate program. My Plate shows portion sizes for eating a balanced diet of fruits, vegetables, grains and protein, as well as interactive tools for customizing diet according to need.
To balance your calorie count, the USDA suggests you eat foods you enjoy, but in smaller portions.
Half your plate should be fruits and vegetables, and at least half of the grains you eat should be whole grains.
Read nutrition labels to be aware of sodium, calorie and fat counts to make informed food choices.
For women, calcium intake is especially important in order to prevent osteoporosis, which is the loss of bone density. Milk is a good source of calcium. The USDA recommends fat-free or low-fat (1 percent) milk, rather that whole or 2 percent.
Type II diabetes is one of the most common endocrine disorders in the U.S. Obesity increases your risk of developing type II diabetes, so eating a low-calorie, low-fat diet may help keep your endocrine system in balance.;

Notify your health practitioner if any family members have endocrine disorders.
Although you can't change family history, being aware means you can take preventive measures, such as eating a healthy diet. Early diagnosis and treatment may limit the effects of the potential condition.
If you are at high risk for developing an endocrine disorder, you may be referred to an endocrinologist.

,


Stress, be it physical, emotional or environmental, can threaten a body's homeostasis. Certain endocrine glands secrete hormones that help the body respond to stress, but the function is meant to be short term. Extended secretion may weaken the body's defenses, leaving room for infection, or even result in high blood pressure or a lack of cortisol and other steroid hormones. Long-term, this lack can lead to organ damage and even failure.
Reduce stress by getting enough sleep, utilizing relaxation techniques and keeping a positive outlook.
The amount of sleep you need to function best varies among individuals, but on average each night, adults need 7 to 9 hours; teens need 8.5 to 9.25 hours; children ages 5 to 10 should get 10 to 11 hours; preschool children need 11 to 13 hours; toddlers ages 1 to 3 should get 12 to 14 hours; infants need 14 to 15 hours and newborns need 12 to 18 hours.
Relaxation methods can include meditation activities such as walking, painting or knitting � anything calm and repetitive � or focusing for a few minutes on breathing deeply or finding a quiet place to lie down and calm your heart beat.

If you have some Epsom salts at home, then you can mix 1 to 2 teaspoons of Epsom salts (check the package to be sure about how much you should use) into eight ounces of water and drink the solution. This should produce a bowel movement within 30 minutes to six hours.You can also take a bath with Epsom salts to help relieve your constipation. Fill a bathtub with warm water and add about one cup of Epsom salts to the water. Your body will absorb the magnesium in the Epsom salts through your skin.;
, Osmotic laxatives work by helping fluids move through the colon. However, keep in mind that long-term use of laxatives can lead to negative side-effects. They can cause an electrolyte imbalance, which may result in abnormal heart rhythms, confusion, and weakness and seizures. Long-term use may also lead to dependency and result in decreased bowel functionality.Some of the examples of osmotic laxatives include:


Milk of magnesia.
Magnesium citrate.
Lactulose.
Polyethylene glycol., If your constipation is severe, then you may want to take a laxative to get fast relief. There are number of different laxatives that are available from your local pharmacy or drug store. Stimulant laxatives work by helping fluids move through the colon. Some of the examples of stimulant laxatives include:Dulcolax
Senokot
Purge
Correctol

, A sodium phosphate enema is one way to relieve occasional constipation. It requires you to insert the enema tip into your rectum and then squeeze the bottle until enough of the substance is in your rectum. You will then have to stay in position for up to five minutes. After that, you will feel a strong urge to go to the toilet.These enemas are available at most supermarkets and drugstores.

, Severe constipation can lead to impaction and this can cause serious problems. If it has been three or more days since your last bowel movement and nothing seems to be helping, then call your doctor for advice. Your doctor may recommend an over-the-counter laxative, suggest visiting the office for an exam, and make other recommendations to help you have a bowel movement. Your doctor will generally only recommend such medications if over-the-counter laxatives have been ineffective., Warm liquids are a great way to get things moving in your digestive system and they can also help to keep you hydrated. If you are just starting to feel constipated, then start by drinking a cup of warm herbal tea, such as peppermint or chamomile, or a cup of warm water with about a teaspoon of lemon juice added to it.

Sip the warm fluids slowly and wait to see if this helps you have a bowel movement. You may feel the urge to go while you are drinking the warm fluid, or it may take a while.

, Prunes are well known for their ability to produce bowel movements. If you have some prunes or prune juice around your house, then try eating or drinking some prunes to help you have a bowel movement.You don’t need to overdo it, just have a few prunes or one cup of prune juice.

, Light exercise a great way to stimulate your digestive system as well. If you have been sedentary for a while, try getting up and taking a walk around your neighborhood to get your bowels moving.Even if constipation is making you feel uncomfortable, don’t sit or lie down. Get out and move around every day.Going for a daily walk or run can help ease constipation., A mixture of baking soda and water may also help to relieve your constipation. Mix a teaspoon of baking soda with ¼ cup of water and drink the solution. This remedy can also help to relieve gas or an upset stomach along with your constipation.Keep in mind that baking soda is high in sodium so this remedy is not ideal for people following a low-sodium diet.

, Stool softeners are for oral use, and are a relatively gentle laxative. Stool softeners are good products to use at first if you have occasional constipation. A stool softener, such as Docusate, works by increasing the amount of water the stool absorbs. The stool then becomes softer and easier to pass.Follow the instructions on the package. Generally you will take a stool softener once a night before you go to bed.
This is a good option if you are just starting to feel constipated because it is gentle. Stool softeners can also take a little while to work, such as one to three days.Do not take it for more than a week unless advised to do so by your doctor.

Men may have two alcoholic drinks per day.Even if you only drink rarely, be mindful of over-consuming even on isolated occasions. Binge drinking--defined as any pattern or episode of drinking which causes a blood alcohol content greater than 0.08g/dL--can accelerate liver damage.Be on the lookout for behavioral signs of dependency. If you think you're drinking too much, review your habits and check yourself for symptoms of addiction like drinking alone and increased tolerance.;
, If you eat more fat than your body can digest, the fatty tissue accumulates in your liver. This buildup can lead to inflammation, scarring, or other injuries.Avoid in particular processed foods high in saturated fat. Such foods include fast food like hamburgers and pizza, red meat, potato chips and other deep-fried foods, cheese, and sweets.People with certain medical conditions should be particularly careful regarding managing fat intake, since these conditions may contribute to fatty liver disease: diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, and high blood pressure., Maintaining a balanced diet consisting of grains, proteins, dairy, fruits, vegetables, and fats will help to ensure that your liver receives the nutrition it needs to complete its diverse array of bodily functions.

, Fiber assists in clearance of the large intestine by binding to bile and thereby facilitating its transfer out of the body. This represents an important way that the body gets rid of fat-soluble toxins which can eventually deposit and build up within the liver.Examples of fiber-rich foods include peas, beans, artichokes, broccoli, and whole grain breads and pastas.

, Combining your healthy dietary regimen with regular exercise should enable you to lose weight over time. This reduction in your weight can lead to diminished fatty tissue in your liver.Regular physical activity will help not only to keep your liver in good condition, but also to improve your overall physical and mental health. You should complete some combination of aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities every week.Keep your exercise regimen varied in order to avoid burnout or boredom.
While weight loss is generally encouraged as a method of combating fatty liver disease, it is unwise and even dangerous to engage in extreme dieting or exercise. Losing more than four pounds a week can damage the liver, so make sure that your weight loss regimen is gradual., Tobacco has been shown to have many adverse effects on internal organs such as the liver, despite the fact that the inhaled smoke does not come into direct contact with it.


Smoking tobacco has been linked to liver cancer and should be discontinued as soon as possible in order to limit your risk factors for the disease.While tobacco smoking does not damage liver cells directly, it can worsen existing liver conditions like fatty liver disease and cirrhosis., While fatty liver disease is generally asymptomatic, alcoholic hepatitis is marked by symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and jaundice. Alcoholic cirrhosis is the most advanced form of alcohol-related liver disease and causes jaundice, yellowing skin, extreme weight loss, and severe abdominal pain., Seeing a health care practitioner regularly will help you avoid all kinds of medical problems, including problems with your liver.

, Talk to your health care provider about having a blood sample taken and testing for liver function. The results will indicate how well your liver is performing normal functions such as protein production and clearing of blood waste products like bilirubin.If your tests indicate signs of compromised liver function, there are numerous, highly effective remedies available. For alcoholic fatty liver and most cases of alcoholic hepatitis, abstention from alcohol can reverse liver damage. For non-alcoholic-related liver damage, your doctor may utilize a combination of medication and dietary alterations to initiate liver regeneration., All infants should begin receiving the Hepatitis B vaccine series at birth, while babies between the ages of 12 and 24 months should undergo the Hepatitis A vaccine.Additionally, if you are considered to be “at-risk” for Hepatitis A or B ,you should receive the vaccines. Such cases include individuals traveling to high-risk international regions like Africa or Eastern European, individuals with infected sexual partners, and those with chronic liver disease., While some medications do not affect the liver, many common drugs are considered hepatotoxic—that is, they damage liver cells—and should be used sparingly or only in strict accordance with doctors’ instructions.


Fluoxetine (generic Prozac) and Trazodone are some of the most widely prescribed drugs which are known to be hepatotoxic, while acetaminophen is perhaps the most popularly consumed hepatotoxic drug which may be purchased over the counter. Make sure to check prescription information or product label—or, better yet, consult your local pharmacist—before taking any new medication."

Start your day with a cup of warm lemon water.,
Drink plenty of fluids.,
Get regular exercise.,
Eat more fiber.,
Add plenty of fruits and vegetables to your diet.,
Take a fiber supplement.,
Listen to your body.,
Get into the right position.,
Get an abdominal massage.,
Make an appointment with your doctor.,
Keep a diary to identify the cause of your constipation.,
Aim to make small improvements to your diet.,
Try to get a little more physical activity.",How to Make Yourself Poop2," Drinking warm water with lemon juice can be especially helpful first thing in the morning. You can drink warm water with lemon juice any time during the day, but drinking it every morning before you have had anything to eat or drink is a great way to regulate your digestive system.To prepare the warm lemon water, add about one teaspoon of lemon juice to a cup (eight ounces) of warm water. Sip the water slowly.
Drinking warm water with lemon juice should soften your stools and help you have a bowel movement, but it may take a little while before it happens.
If constipation is a frequent problem for you, then try starting every day with a cup of warm water and lemon juice.
If you don't have any lemon juice around, then you can also drink a cup of tea, coffee, or just plain warm water to help get your bowels moving.

, Dehydration can contribute to constipation, so make sure that you are drinking plenty of water and other fluids every day.Try to drink at least eight 8 ounce glasses of water every day.
You can also get fluids from drinking clear broths and from eating hydrating fruits, such as watermelon, grapes, and apples.
Don’t drink too much caffeine, or you can become dehydrated, making the problem worse.

, Regular exercise is essential for increasing the muscle activity in your digestive tract, so it is important to exercise if constipation is a common problem for you.Try to get at least 30 minutes of moderate cardiovascular activity on five days of every week.For example, you can try walking, riding a bike, or using an elliptical exercise machine., Not getting enough fiber can cause constipation. Try to eat at least 18 to 30g of fiber each day. High-fiber foods include fresh fruit, vegetables and cereals.Some good ways to increase your fiber intake include:


Eating a high-fiber breakfast cereal.
Choosing wholegrain or granary breads.
Adding pulses such as beans, lentils or chickpeas to stews and salads.
Having some fresh or dried fruit for dessert., Choose a fruit smoothie at breakfast, a salad at lunch and leafy vegetables like broccoli, spinach or sweet potatoes at dinner. Or in the morning have warm water with lemon juice and carrots on the side.If you are often constipated, then try adding prunes as a regular snack in your diet. Prunes increase fiber in your diet and they often work to speed up digestion.
One clinical trial found that 70 percent of people find relief from constipation with prunes., If you are struggling to get enough fiber into your daily diet, you could always opt for a fiber supplement. These supplements are available at your local drugstore and supermarket. They can be a good short-term measure, but try to incorporate fiber from fresh food into your diet in the longer-term., You should always try to listen to your body and respond to it. That means don’t delay when you need to go, and don’t try to hold it in.You may be constipated because you have been withholding when you need to go. In this case, feces can condense, making the stool harder to pass.People who are traveling or experiencing a change in routine can become constipated. Add in yogurt or prunes and try to stay near a toilet.
Ask for an aisle seat on a plane or stop frequently on a road trip.

, Sometimes it can help to raise your knees above your hips to make it easier to poop. Try placing your feet on a low stool when you are using the toilet. This will elevate your knees above your hips, and potentially make passing stools easier., If you have long-term constipation problems, an abdominal massage can help. The massage takes around 10 to 20 minutes, and can be done while you are standing, sitting or lying down. These massages can reduce the need for the regular use of laxatives, and can relieve flatulence. Abdominal massage is not recommended for everybody, so speak to your doctor first.


Pregnant women should not get a massage and neither should someone with a history of malignant bowel obstructions., If you have tried all of these methods and you were still unable to go to the bathroom, you could have a bowel obstruction. If constipation persists for weeks you should get checked to rule out other more serious medical issues. You should see a doctor straightaway if you have symptoms such as cramping, spasms, dizziness or fatigue.You can ask your doctor about a biofeedback appointment. This is a special consultation in which you will learn how to relax and tighten muscles in your pelvic area.If you are on any medications, discuss this with your doctor. There is a chance that medications could be causing your constipation., If you occasionally suffer from constipation, then it might be helpful to take a look at your diet and lifestyle for a couple of weeks to identify a potential cause. Some of the risk factors for constipation include dehydration, inadequate fiber intake, a sedentary lifestyle, and certain medications, such as narcotic painkillers, sedatives, and high blood pressure medications.Try keeping a diary for two to four weeks of everything you eat, drink, and take (medications). Also, keep track of how much exercise you get each day, as well as other pertinent information like stress level and illness. Note also when you are constipated over the course of this two to four week period.
After tracking your diet and lifestyle for a few weeks, review the log to see what foods, drinks, medications, or other factors seem to contribute to constipation. Then, use this information to make lifestyle changes. For example, if your diary reveals that you become constipated when you eat a lot of dairy, then you may want to limit your dairy consumption.
If your log reveals a connection between a medication and constipation, then discuss this with your doctor. Do not stop taking any of your medications without talking to your doctor first.

, If you are not sure what is causing your constipation, you may consider making some small changes to see if this reduces your episodes of constipation. Some things you can try include:Drinking more water. Try filling a large water bottle every morning and aim to finish it by midday. Then, fill it again and aim to drink it by dinner time.
Adding more fiber from whole foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
Limiting junk foods, fast foods, and processed foods like cookies, chips, and crackers.
Taking a daily fiber supplement, such as psyllium husk, Metamucil, or FiberCon.

, Regular physical activity can help to reduce constipation by increasing the muscle activity in your colon. If you do not get regular exercise, or if you do not get the recommended 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week, then try to increase your physical activity.You can do this by:

Taking a daily 30 minute walk or a few 10 minute walks throughout the day.
Parking further away from entrances, such as at grocery stores, malls, and your place of work.
Getting up and walking around during commercial breaks when you are watching TV.

Choose a time to poop each day.,
Go when you feel the urge.,
Use daily relaxation techniques.,
Make your home bathroom a relaxing environment.,
Set boundaries about not wanting to be disturbed.",How to Make Yourself Poop3," Using the bathroom at the same time each day can help to regulate your digestive system and make it easier to poop. Try to choose a time to use the toilet each day, such as right after breakfast, and see if this helps you to have regular bowel movements.Try to go in the morning if you can. Many people find it easier to poop after eating breakfast or having a morning cup of coffee.

, If you are pressed for time and struggle to go when you do have a moment to sit down on the toilet, then try to go only when you feel the urge. You may be able to have a bowel movement quite quickly if you feel like you have to go.

Don’t wait if you have the urge. Get to a toilet as quickly as you can to take advantage of feeling like you have to go.

, If you are feeling like stress is contributing to your constipation, then taking some time to relax each day may help. Try setting aside at least 15 minutes every day to use a relaxation technique, such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, or progressive muscle relaxation., Having an environment where you can relax can help you poop more easily. Keep your bathroom clean and inviting, such as by getting a nice rug to put at the base of your toilet or by hanging a decorative shower curtain.

To give your bathroom a pleasing scent, try lighting a scented candle when you use the bathroom, using an air freshener, or putting out some potpourri.

, Close the door and make sure your family knows it is not okay to enter if the door is shut. Don't let people pressure you or make a fuss of it.

Try saying something like, “I am going to be in the bathroom for about 30 minutes. While I am in there, please don’t interrupt me.”
If someone knocks while you are using the bathroom, then try saying something like, “I will be out in about 15 minutes. Please do not knock again.”

Pay attention to your bowel movements.,
Think about how much gas you pass.,
Consider how often you get sick.,
Monitor your weight.,
Reflect on your pain levels.",How to Maintain Healthy Gut Bacteria1," If you have regular and easy bowel movements, then this is a good indication that your gut bacteria are healthy. If you frequently experience hard, painful bowel movements or if your bowel movements are irregular, then you may be lacking healthy gut bacteria.;
, Gut bacteria produce more gas if they are healthy, so passing gas is a good sign. Many of the foods that help to promote healthy gut bacteria are known as gas-inducing foods, but try not to think of this as a bad thing., Healthy gut bacteria also help to promote your immunity to certain illnesses and infections. If you do not get sick with colds and other infections very often, then you may have healthy gut bacteria., You may have healthy gut bacteria if you are at a healthy weight or if you begin to lose weight. Some studies have shown that thinner people tend to have healthier gut bacteria than people who are obese or overweight.One study indicated that if you transplant the gut bacteria of a thin mouse into an obese mouse, then the obese mouse will lose weight., You may begin to see various aches and pains subside because of the anti-inflammatory effects of healthy gut bacteria. Think about how often you experience pain in your joints and other areas of your body. If you are relatively pain-free, then you may have healthy gut bacteria."

Incorporate fermented foods into your diet.,
Increase the amount of fiber in your diet.,
Choose foods that support healthy gut bacteria.,
Eat plenty of vegetables.,
Consume more beans.,
Avoid foods that can harm the gut bacteria.",How to Maintain Healthy Gut Bacteria2," Fermented foods are especially helpful because they contain prebiotics and probiotics. Try to get 4-6 servings of these foods every week to help promote healthy gut bacteria. These foods include:yogurt
kefir
sauerkraut
soft cheeseskombucha
kimchee

, You can do this by eating whole foods (whole grains) and avoiding processed white foods such as white bread, white rice, and white pasta. Fruits and vegetables are excellent sources of fiber as well. Try to consume about 30-40 grams of fiber per day.Increasing your fiber intake can increase gas. However, one study suggests that increasing your fiber intake by even small amounts can be good for your gut bacteria.If you experience excess gas after increasing your fiber intake, try increasing it in smaller increments.
Make sure to drink plenty of water with your high-fiber diet. This will help keep your stools regular and easy to pass., Some foods contain soluble fiber that healthy bacteria can digest. Eat one type of prebiotic food daily to ensure that you are providing your gut bacteria with enough fuel to grow. Foods that are high in this type of fiber include:garlic
leeks
asparagus
chicory root
Jerusalem artichoke
dandelion greens
bananas
wheat bran
whole wheat bread

, You should eat lots of vegetables every day. Vegetables support the growth of healthy gut bacteria. They contain substances that bacteria use to produce anti-inflammatory substances and may even help prevent cancer. Be sure to include:cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, and kale
leafy greens such as spinach, Swiss chard, mustard greens, collard greens, beet greens, and turnip greens

, Beans are a good source of fiber and they also release short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). SCFAs strengthen and support healthy gut bacteria. SCFAs are also good for the lining of your gut and improve nutrient absorption.Try to include beans in your diet 3-4 times per week.

, Diets high in certain types of foods can harm the gut bacteria and alter the numbers and types of bacteria in the gut. Evidence is growing that this sort of alteration of the gut bacteria, often called dysbiosis, may lead to all sorts of health issues.Many of these foods also increase your risk of other health issues, such as heart attack or cancer. Foods to avoid include:


animal fat
antibiotic-fed meat and poultry
sugar
processed and packaged foods that include additives, preservatives and sugar

"
"
Keep in mind that probiotics are not necessary in most situations.,
Check the label for other important information.,
Take probiotic supplements as directed.",How to Maintain Healthy Gut Bacteria3," You can get plenty of probiotics from the foods that you eat, as long as you make good food choices. If you are unable to eat certain foods or if you are concerned that you are not getting enough probiotics from food, then you may want to consider a probiotic supplement.


Make sure to discuss taking probiotics with your doctor if you are on any medications or if you are being treated for something.

, Make sure that you check the label for important information and also look for a “USP Verified” seal on the bottle. The USP seal indicates that a non-profit lab, the USP, has checked the product and found that the bacteria and other ingredients listed on the label is what is in the bottle. Some other things to look for include:company name and contact information
the recommended dose
strain, genus, and species of the probiotic
expiration date that also mentions how many organisms will be alive by that date

, Make sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the supplements that you are taking. You can also ask your physician for advice. Since it may take a while for your body to balance out the bacteria after you finish a round of antibiotics, it is a good idea to use probiotics for a month after you are finished taking the antibiotics."

Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables.,
Include fiber and healthy grains into your diet.,
Avoid processed foods.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Lose weight.",How to Lower Urobilinogen Levels1," A healthy diet full of fruits and vegetables promotes a healthy liver and normal urobilinogen levels. Red veggies and fruits contain compounds that can help lower bilirubin levels, which will help lower your urobilinogen levels. Tomatoes is a great food to eat to help with this.Radishes are also a great vegetable to promote liver health.;
, Fiber can help promote a healthy liver. In addition to fruits and vegetables, you can find fiber in healthy whole grains, rice, cereals, and nuts. Men should have around 25 grams of fiber each day, and women should have 35 grams.Barley helps remove toxins from the body and supports the liver.

, Unhealthy diets can impair your liver function and cause your bilirubin and urobilinogen levels to rise. Try to eat a diet full of mostly fresh, unprocessed, natural foods. Avoid refined sugar, refined carbs, fast food, fried foods, and prepackaged and processed foods., One easy way to help keep your urobilinogen levels at a normal level is to stay hydrated. You should drink at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water each day. Hydration is important for kidney and liver function.Limit the amount of alcohol you consume because it can negatively affect the liver.

, Your doctor may suggest that you lose weight and increase your physical activity if your urobilinogen levels are high. Some liver problems can be treated with weight loss, healthier eating plans, and exercise.Talk to your doctor if you are interested in losing weight. They can suggest a diet and exercise plan that works for you.

Change medications.,
Take iron supplements.,
Treat a liver condition in the hospital.",How to Lower Urobilinogen Levels2," If your abnormal urobilinogen levels are a result of a medication you are taking, your doctor may suggest that you stop taking a medication or switch to a different one. Stopping the medication may be enough to lower your urobilinogen levels., Anemia may be the cause of your higher urobilinogen levels. If that is the underlying cause, the doctor will prescribe iron supplements. Depending on the severity of the anemia, you may be able to take oral supplements or be given iron intravenously.For severe anemia, you may be admitted to the hospital so the doctor can monitor your condition.

, If the high urobilinogen levels is caused by liver disease, your doctor will monitor your condition closely. If the disease progresses to a severe state, you may be admitted to the hospital. While in the hospital, you may be given antiviral drugs to help treat the condition.If your liver is severely damaged, you may need a liver transplant.+

, If you have high levels of urobilinogen, you should go see a doctor. Elevated urobilinogen indicates there is a problem with your liver. Many serious and potentially fatal liver diseases cause higher urobilinogen levels, so you should see your doctor immediately.For example, you may have liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, or hepatitis.

, If you believe you may have elevated urobilinogen levels, your doctor will recommend a urine test. You will be given a test stick that reacts to urobilinogen to determine if your levels are elevated. Then, if the test stick is positive, the doctor will perform a test to determine how much urobilinogen is in your urine.The doctor will probably also test your blood and liver function at the same time.

, If not, you should be replacing your toothbrush every three to five months., If you wear dentures, be sure to soak them in a chlorhexidine solution. You can get this from your pharmacist., How often you need to visit the dentist may depend on your own specific dental health. You should be going once or twice a year regardless to have a regular cleaning. Your dentist can provide a much more thorough cleaning than you can at home, which will decrease your likelihood of getting thrush.Ask your dentist how often you should make appointments. They will have a better idea, based on your medical history, how much care you’ll need., Keeping your hands clean can help lower your exposure to bacteria and diseases, as well as lower your risk for thrush.


Wash your hands before and after handling food.
After using the restroom.
Before and after caring for a sick individual.
After touching items frequently touched by other individuals in public, such as door handles and escalator railings.

, Antibiotics contain properties that can disrupt the natural pH balance in your mouth and increase the risk for thrush. Rinse with water or brush your teeth immediately after taking antibiotics.If you currently take antibiotics, talk to your healthcare provider about alternative treatments that won’t increase your risk for thrush.

, Foods that contain mold and yeast can lead to Candida yeast overgrowth in the body and increase your risk for thrush.Avoid consuming processed and refined carbohydrates such as breads and pastries, lower your intake of cow’s milk and cheese, and stop consuming alcoholic beverages high in yeast content, such as beer and wine.

, Exercise can help strengthen your immune system and prevent you from developing diseases and health conditions that can lead to thrush, such as type 2 diabetes.

Learn what the liver does for your body.The liver aids both in glandular function and with other organ systems.,
Educate yourself on conditions that can tax the liver.,
Recognize the symptoms of liver disease.,
See your healthcare provider for a diagnosis.,
Track your liver enzymes.",How to Lower Liver Enzymes1," It protects the body by detoxifying hormones, drugs, and any biological molecules not produced in the human body. The liver also synthesizes cholesterol and proteins that might otherwise lead to clotting and inflammation. It stores vitamins, minerals, and sugar while removing bacteria.


The liver is involved in several important body functions, so it can become taxed by overuse.
It's very important to return an overburdened liver to healthy enzyme levels to ensure all of these processes continue to function normally.;
, Partly because the liver performs so many essential functions, it is prone to a number of different diseases. There are a wide variety of diseases that can cause your liver enzyme levels to shoot up:Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH), also known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): fats such as triglycerides and cholesterol accumulate in the liver.
Hepatitis viruses: Hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E all have different causes. However, each different type of hepatitis infection taxes the liver.
Other infections that burden the liver include mononucleosis, adenoviruses, and cytomegalovirus. Tick bites and parasites can cause harmful diseases like Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever or toxoplasmosis.
Cancer that is often related to previous viral infections and liver cirrhosis
Alcoholic hepatitis
Jaundice
Cirrhosis or the late-stage scarring of the liver

, Because the liver is involved in so many different processes, there is no single list of symptoms that point to liver disease. However, every liver disorder has both unique and shared symptoms. If you experience any of these symptoms, speak with your healthcare provider immediately:Yellowish skin and eyes that suggest jaundice
Abdominal pain and swelling
Swelling in the legs and ankles
Itchy skin
Dark yellow or reddish urine color
Pale stools or bloody, tarry stools
Chronic fatigue
Nausea or vomiting
Loss of appetite
Weight loss
Dry mouth, increased thirst
A tendency to bruise easily

, See your doctor for a physical exam, and provide him with a complete medical history and description of your symptoms. The doctor will also order a Liver Function Test (LFT) analysis of a blood sample. The LFT will test for the levels of various liver enzymes and proteins. Your doctor will use that information to aid in diagnosis. Some of these enzyme tests include:AST (Aspartate aminotransferase): AST levels are analyzed to determine the likelihood of acute or chronic hepatitis.ALT (Alanine aminotransferase): ALT is used to detect and follow the progress of hepatitis and liver injury.High levels are found in those with alcoholism, viral hepatitis, and diabetes.
The ratio between AST/ALT levels is often used to tell if liver disease is due to infection, inflammation, or alcohol use. ALP (Alkaline phosphatase): Can help diagnose bone disease, liver disease and gallbladder disorders.GGT (Gamma-glutamyl transferase): With ALP, can be used to distinguish between liver and bone disease. GGT is also useful to help determine alcohol history; it is increased in about 75% of chronic alcoholics.LD (Lactic dehydrogenase): LD (sometimes known as LDH) is used along with the other LFT values to monitor treatment of liver and other disorders. High levels are seen in various liver diseases, anemias, kidney disease, and infections., If you have a history of liver disease, you may need liver tests every month or every six to eight weeks. Keep track of the numbers carefully. A downward trend in lab values over six to twelve months will indicate success in supporting the liver. Always keep your physician informed regarding any supplements you are taking, and let her know if there is any change in your symptoms.

Eat plenty of leafy greens.,
Look for foods high in antioxidants.,
Get 35–50 grams of fiber a day.,
Drink citrus juices rich in vitamin C. Vitamin C helps in tissue repair and wound healing.,
Increase your consumption of cruciferous vegetables.,
Ask your healthcare provider about your protein intake.Protein is usually the key to repairing damage in the body, so you might think you should increase protein to treat a strained liver.,
Hydrate your body well.,
Avoid foods that harm liver health.Healthy foods can support the liver, but unhealthy foods can damage the liver.",How to Lower Liver Enzymes2," Leafy green vegetables have high levels of vitamins, minerals and other nutrients. Importantly for liver function, they can lower the level of fat deposits in the liver.Leafy greens include spinach, collard, beet, turnip and mustard greens, kale, the cruciferous vegetables (cauliflower, cabbage, broccoli, Brussels sprouts), Swiss chard, dandelion greens, and all lettuces.

, Beets alone won't lower your liver enzymes, but they're high in ""flavonoids"" that act as antioxidants that support liver function.Avocados can also be helpful, as they have a lot of vitamin E, which is an effective natural antioxidant. Avocados and walnuts have precursors for the body’s primary antioxidant — glutathione.Walnuts are also a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, which can reduce liver inflammation.Other nuts, including walnuts, Brazil nuts, pecans, and almonds also contain B vitamins and minerals in significant amounts.

, Foods that are high in fiber prevent your body from absorbing cholesterol. By reducing the amount of cholesterol your liver has to process, you increase liver health and lower enzyme levels.Fiber also increases the liver's bile secretion, improving fat digestion and preventing liver disease down the line. Foods high in fiber include:Oat, wheat, corn, rice bran
Beans (lima, adzuki, black, red, kidney, white,navy and pinto beans), lentils (red, brown and yellow) and peas
Berries (raspberry, blueberry, strawberry, blackberry, loganberry, gooseberry, boysenberry, salmonberry)
Whole grains ( wheat, oats, corn, rye, teff, buckwheat, brown rice)
Leafy green vegetables (Greens of turnips, mustard, collard, beets and Swiss chard, kale, and spinach)
Nuts (almonds, pistachios, cashews, walnuts) and seeds (sesame, pumpkin, flax, sunflower)
Fruit (especially those with edible rinds such as pears, apples, prunes, plums, peaches, apricots)

, Eating citrus fruits or drinking their juices will help the liver heal, bringing enzyme levels back to healthy levels. Citrus fruits are also known to reduce the risk of liver cancer.Find ways to work oranges, grapefruits, lemons, and limes into your diet. When buying juices, look for products fortified with extra vitamin C.

, The family of vegetables called ""cruciferous vegetables"" are known to balance the production of detoxifying liver enzymes. These ""phase two detoxification enzymes"" neutralize cancer-causing carcinogens in the body. These vegetables also have plenty of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fiber:Broccoli
Brussels sprouts
Cauliflower
Radishes
Horseradish
Rutabaga and turnips
Wasabi
Watercress

, But because the liver is the organ processing the protein, you may overwhelm it with too much protein. This causes even more strain, further elevating your enzyme levels.


Speak to your doctor and/or nutritionist about how much protein you should be consuming. They will be able to provide you with a plan specific to your body's needs.

, Drinking enough water will help your liver flush out waste products, reducing its work burden.Drink eight to ten 8 oz. glasses of water every day. Take special care to drink water at the following times:When you first wake up.
Before and during meals.
Before and after physical activity.
Right before you go to bed.

, Too much fat, salt, sugar, or oil can overburden the liver. If you already have high enzyme levels, you need to give your liver a break for a while. Avoid the following foods to balance your enzyme levels:


Fatty foods like lamb, beef, chicken skin, foods made with shortening or lard, and vegetable oils.Salty foods like most processed and prepared foods, snacks like pretzels and chips, and canned foods.
Sugary foods like cakes, pies, or cookies.
Fried foods.
Raw or undercooked shellfish (these may contain liver-damaging toxins).
Alcohol (though it’s not a food) should be avoided as much as possible, especially if you already have liver disease.

Drink herbal teas that improve liver health.,
Cook with garlic and turmeric.,
Take antioxidant supplements.",How to Lower Liver Enzymes3," There are many herbs that have been traditionally used to support liver function. Little is known about how these herbs function, but there is a long history of safe use. In general, most of these herbs have been given as teas, so dosing is not often clear. Follow manufacturer’s instructions and consult your physician for dosing. The doses listed here should only be used as guidelines.


Milk thistle: Research suggests it may be most useful for those with alcohol-related liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatitis.Dosages range from 160-480 mg daily.
Astragalus:The usual dose used is 20–500 mg of extract taken three to four times daily.
Dandelion/Taraxacum root: Decreases cholesterol, reducing the burden on the liver. Drink two to four cups of dandelion root tea daily or two to four gm of root daily.Combination formulas: There are many of these on the market, though most have not been clinically tested. Examples include NOW’s Liver Detoxifier and Regenerator, Gaia Herbs Deep Liver Support, and Oregon’s Wild Harvest Milk Thistle Dandelion.
Green tea: Reduces the risk of liver disease, but in some people, it can increase liver problems. The best course is to speak to your physician for advice regarding using green tea. In general, two to four cups of green tea has been shown to reduce the risk of liver disease., These herbs not only taste delicious, but are also known to improve liver health. Add these herbs to taste, and use at least one of these daily.


Garlic also prevents liver cancer and heart disease and boosts the immune system.Turmeric has anti-inflammatory properties that support the liver by decreasing the inflammation that leads to hepatitis, NASH, liver cancer, and cirrhosis., Though there are plenty of ways to get antioxidants through diet, supplements can help you get even more. Alpha-Lipoic acid (ALA) is an antioxidant that has been studied in diabetes, heart disease and liver disease. It supports sugar metabolism in the liver and prevents alcoholic liver disease. The most common dose is 100 mg three times a day.N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) serves as a precursor to glutathione, the body’s major antioxidant. The most common dose to support the liver is 200–250 mg twice daily.


ALA may interact with diabetes medications, so consult your physician regarding the best dose.
There have been rare cases where very high doses of NAC increased liver enzymes."

Bilirubin is a yellowish-orange pigment found in liver bile.Because a healthy liver usually eliminates excess bilirubin, its presence indicates a liver problem.In addition to yellowish pigmentation to the skin and whites of the eyes, symptoms of jaundice may include fatigue, abdominal pain, weight loss, vomiting, fever, pale stools, and dark urine.
Jaundice symptoms are usually present when the liver is seriously impaired, and it is best to seek medical attention immediately if you are experiencing them.;
, Abdominal swelling, if you are not pregnant, usually indicates an accumulation of fat, fluid, or feces, or the presence of a tumor, cyst, fibroids, or other enlargement of an organ such as the liver or spleen.In some severe cases, you could actually look eight months pregnant even if you're not. Many causes of abdominal swelling indicate an underlying medical condition that your doctor should examine.If it is a fluid accumulation, then it is referred to as ascites and is a common symptom of an enlarged liver.
This abdominal swelling will often lead to a decrease in appetite as you are too “full” to eat. This symptom is termed “early satiety.” You may also not have an appetite at all due to the swelling.You may also experience swelling in the legs.Abdominal pain, especially in the right upper side of your abdomen, may also be a sign of an enlarged liver, especially if you have other symptoms as well., Fever, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, pain in the upper right side of your abdomen, and weight loss are symptoms that are not specific to liver enlargement, but can be a sign of liver disease and enlargement if they are severe, prolonged, or unexpected.A lack of appetite or unwillingness to eat can accompany abdominal distention, as mentioned above. It can also be a symptom of gallbladder disease as sufferers may be unwilling to eat, since eating is a trigger for pain. Lack of appetite may also accompany cancer and hepatitis.
Doctors typically define significant weight loss as more than 10% of your body weight. If you're not attempting to lose weight, and you notice weight loss, you should get in touch with your doctor.Fever is a marker of inflammation in the body. Because liver enlargement could be due to an infection such as hepatitis, it’s important to recognize and address fever when it occurs.
Unusually pale, light grey, or even white stools may be a sign of liver problems., When you experience fatigue, you feel tired after exerting only a little effort. This can occur when the liver’s reserve of nutrients is damaged, and the body depletes its muscles of their nutrients as an alternative energy source.Fatigue can indicate the presence of a liver problem, and swelling can be an accompanying symptom. Viral hepatitis and cancer can both cause fatigue.

, When the liver is impaired, you may experience pruritus (itchy skin) that may be either localized or generalized. This condition happens when the liver biliary ducts are obstructed. As a result, bile salts that have been excreted into your bloodstream deposit themselves in your skin and causing an itching sensation.You may be tempted to treat the itching, but if you suspect a liver problem, you must see your doctor first.

, Spider angiomas (or spider nevi) are dilated blood vessels that spread out from a central red dot and look like spider webs. These veins often form on the face, neck, hands, and upper half of the chest and are a classic sign of liver disease and hepatitis.A single spider nevus is not typically a cause for concern on its own. However, if you exhibit other health conditions or symptoms, such as lethargy, fatigue, bloating or signs of jaundice, you should see your doctor as this may be a sign of liver problems. In addition, if you have multiple clusters of spider nevi, you should also see your doctor as this suggests something is wrong with your liver.Spider angiomas can range in size up to 5 millimeters in diameter.
If you apply moderate pressure with your fingers, their red color will disappear for a couple of seconds and they'll turn white (blanching) because the blood will drain out.

, At the beginning of the appointment, your doctor will want to do a complete medical history with you. It's important to be forthcoming and honest with your provider.


Be aware that some of the questions your doctor will ask are quite personal and concern substance use, alcohol consumption, and sexual partners. However, your answers are critical to your diagnosis. Be clear and tell the truth.
Tell your doctor about any medications or supplements you're taking, including vitamins and herbal remedies.

, A clinical physical examination is the first step to diagnosing an enlarged liver. Your physician will begin by examining your skin for jaundice and spider angiomas if you have not already reported these as symptoms. He may then examine your liver by feeling your stomach with his hand.An enlarged liver may feel irregular, soft or firm, with or without lumps depending on the underlying cause. This kind of test can determine the liver’s size and texture in order to assess the degree of liver enlargement. Your doctor will use two methods of physical examination: a percussion test and a palpation test.

, Percussion is a method to assess the size of the liver and to make sure that the liver does not exceed the boundaries of the right costal margin (the rib cage), which is the liver's protective barrier. It explores your inner organs by analyzing the sounds they produce. Your doctor conducts this exam by tapping on your body’s surface and listening to the resulting sound. If they hears a dull sound that stretches more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) below the bottom of your rib cage, then your liver may be enlarged. Note that if you are experiencing abdominal distention, this test will not be accurate and you will likely need to have an abdominal ultrasound.Your doctor, if right-handed, will place their left hand on your chest and press their middle finger firmly against the chest wall. Using the middle finger of their right hand, they will strike the midpoint of their left middle finger. The striking movement should come from the wrist (much like playing the piano).
Starting from below your breast, the percussion should result in a tympanic drum sound. That is because your lung is located there, and is filled with air.
Your doctor will move slowly down in a straight line overlying the liver, listening for when the tympanic drum sound changes to a “thud.” This signifies that your doctor is now over the liver. They will continue to percuss and pay close attention as they near the end of your rib cage to see if they continue to hear a ""thud"" noise and how far. Your doctor will stop when the ""thud"" changes to a mix of intestinal noises (gas and gurgling).
The doctor will count how many centimeters below, if any, the liver, went beyond the rib cage. This is usually a sign of disease, as our rib cage is intended to protect our important internal organs like the liver and spleen. (If you have hyperinflated lungs but are otherwise healthy, your doctor may be able to feel the liver edge.)

, Your doctor will also use palpation to determine whether your liver is enlarged. Palpation, like percussion, uses the touch and pressure provided by the hands.This is performed, if your doctor is right-handed, by placing their left hand under your right side. You will have to take a big breath in and exhale slowly out as your doctor tries to “capture” the liver between their hands. They will use their fingertips to feel the liver between its edge and the bottom of the ribcage, looking for important details such as shape, consistency, surface texture, tenderness, and border sharpness.
Your doctor will be feeling for a surface texture that is rough, irregular or nodular and also whether the liver has a hard or firm consistency. They will also ask you if you feel any tenderness as they press.

, Your doctor will likely want to have a sample of your blood drawn in order to assess your liver’s function and health. Blood tests are usually used to identify the possible presence of a viral infection such as hepatitis.The blood sample will indicate what your liver enzyme levels are and thereby provide important information about the health and functioning of your liver. Other blood tests may also be appropriate, including a complete blood cell count, hepatitis virus screen, and blood clotting tests. These latter tests are especially useful to assess liver function because the liver is responsible for creating the proteins involved in clotting blood., Imaging tests such as ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are often recommended to confirm the diagnosis and assess the anatomy of the liver and its surrounding tissues. These tests can provide specific information to your doctor who can then make an informed assessment of your liver's condition.Abdominal Ultrasound — In this test, you will lie down as a handheld probe is moved over the abdomen. The probe emits high frequency sound waves that bounce off the organs in the body and are received by a computer, which translates these sound waves into an image of your internal abdominal organs. Your healthcare provider will tell you how to prepare for the test, but in most cases, you are not supposed to eat or drink before the test.Abdominal CT scan — In a CT scan, x-rays are taken to create cross-sectional images over your abdominal region. You have to lie on a narrow table that slides into the CT machine and stay still as the x-rays are taken and rotate around you. These are translated into images on a computer. Your doctor will tell you how to prepare for this exam. Because the test sometimes involves a special dye called contrast being put into your body (either through IV or orally), you may not be able to eat or drink beforehand.MRI abdominal scan — This test uses magnets and radio waves to create images of the internal abdominal region, rather than radiation (x-rays). You have to lie on a narrow table that slides into a large tunnel-like scanner. To make your organs more clear on the scans, the test may require dye, something that your doctor will discuss with you beforehand. As with the other tests, you may be asked not to eat or drink before the test., This is a scope that looks for problems in the bile ducts, the tubes that carry bile from the liver to your gallbladder and small intestine.In this test, an IV line is placed in your arm and you will be given something to relax you. Then, your doctor will insert an endoscope through your mouth and down the esophagus and stomach until it reaches the small intestine (the part closest to the stomach). They will pass a catheter through the endoscope and insert it into the bile ducts that connect with the pancreas and gallbladder. Then, they will inject dye into the ducts, which helps the doctor see any problem areas more clearly. X-rays are then taken.This test usually follows imaging tests, including ultrasound, CT scan or MRI scan.
As with many of the other tests mentioned, your doctor will outline the procedure and tell you what to expect. You will need to provide your consent for the ERCP and not eat or drink for four hours prior to the test.
An ERCP can be a good option because your physician can also use it to facilitate treatment. For example, if there are stones or other obstructions in the bile ducts, the physician can remove those while the ERCP is being conducted., As a general rule, an enlarged liver and any liver diseases or conditions can be diagnosed successfully through a medical history, physical examination, blood tests, and, finally, imaging tests. A biopsy, however, can be recommended in certain situations, particularly if the diagnosis is unclear or if cancer is suspected.The procedure involves insertion of a long, thin needle into your liver to collect the liver tissue sample and will usually be conducted by a liver specialist (either a gastroenterologist or hepatologist). Because it is an invasive test, you will be placed under local or general anaesthesia. The sample is then sent to a laboratory for further investigation, particularly to examine whether there are any cancerous cells present.

, A relatively new imaging technique, magnetic resonance elastography combines MRI imaging with sound waves to construct a visual map (elastograph) to assess the stiffness of body tissues, in this case of the liver. A hardening of the liver is a symptom of chronic liver disease, and something that the MRE can detect. This test is noninvasive and can be an alternative to a liver biopsy.Magnetic resonance elastography is a new but rapidly developing technology. It is currently offered only at a few medical centers but is on the rise. Check with your doctor to see whether this is an option for you., Hepatitis A, B, and C cause liver inflammation, and can lead to enlargement accompanied by a smooth, tender liver edge. If you have any form of hepatitis, you are at higher risk for having an enlarged liver.The damage to the liver is due to blood and immune cells that flood the liver in an attempt to fight against the hepatitis infection.

, Right-sided heart failure can produce enlargement of the liver, with a smooth, tender liver edge.This occurs because blood accumulates in the liver as a result of inefficient pumping of the heart. Because the heart isn't doing its job, blood backs up into the liver.

, Cirrhosis is a chronic disease that leads to increased density of the liver, as a result of fibrosis (excessive scar tissue production). Cirrhosis is usually the result of lifestyle choices that have an adverse effect on the liver. Alcohol abuse in particular can directly cause cirrhosis.Cirrhosis may produce either enlargement or shrinking, but is most often associated with enlargement.

, People with certain genetic or metabolic conditions, such as Wilson's diseaseand Gaucher's disease,may also be at a higher risk of developing an enlarged liver.

, People with cancer may develop liver enlargement due to the spread of cancer (metastasis) into the liver.If you have been diagnosed with cancer, especially cancer of an organ near the liver, you are at higher risk of an enlarged liver.

, Chronic or excessive alcohol consumption beyond a few drinks a week can cause damage to the liver and impair liver regeneration. These can both induce irreversible functional and structural damage to the liver.As the liver loses its functionality due to alcohol use, it can become enlarged and swollen due to decreased drainage capacity. You may also develop fatty deposits in your liver if you consume alcohol in excess.
The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines ""moderate"" drinking as no more than one drink per day for women and no more than two drinks per day for men., Many over-the-counter medications can damage your liver if used for extended periods of time or if used beyond the recommended dosage. The most liver-toxic drugs include oral contraceptives, anabolic steroids, diclofenac, amiodarone, and statins, among others.If you are on long-term medication, you should get regular check-ups and closely follow your physician’s advice.
Acetaminophen (Tylenol), especially when overdosed, is a common cause of liver failure and can cause liver enlargement. The risk is higher if acetaminophen is mixed with alcohol.Be aware that some herbal supplements, such as black cohosh, ma huang, and mistletoe, can also increase the likelihood of liver damage.

, Regular consumption of fatty foods, including french fries, hamburgers, or any other junk food, can lead to fat accumulation in the liver, called fatty liver. Pools of fat can develop that will eventually destroy liver cells.Your damaged liver will be impaired and may swell due to a decreased ability to process blood and toxins and the accumulation of fat.
Be aware as well that being overweight or obese increases your risk of liver disease. Whether someone is overweight or obese is determined by using the body mass index (BMI), an indicator of body fatness. BMI is a person's weight in kilograms (kg) divided by the square of the person's height in meters (m). A BMI of 25-29.9 is considered overweight, while a BMI greater than 30 is considered obese."

Plain Highway Exit Sign.svg.med.png|right]]Plan the trip's restroom breaks ahead of time.",How to Live Your Life Despite Crohn's Disease,"  Stress aggravates Crohn's.  You may have experienced this.  You get stressed out, and before you know it, your gut is twisted in knots and you lose your appetite.  You might go one or two days without eating anything - possibly longer.


Step back from everything and ask yourself, ""What stresses me?""  Make a list if needed.  Now, weed those things out.  Get rid of them however you can.  You will find that there are lots of things you can avoid for the most part, or even eliminate completely.
For instance, maybe driving is stressful to you.  Try to walk instead of drive.  Or tie trips together so that you can go to the post office, buy groceries, purchase new shoes for Jimmy, and take Susan to soccer practice in one trip.  Even little things help.
You may also find that some stress is unavoidable - a necessary evil.  In these cases, find ways to relieve the stress.  Start doing yoga, listen to soothing music - whatever works best for you.;
,  You're probably thinking, ""Yes, I knew that.""  But it's not just about what you eat.  Watch how you eat.


Eat small amounts.  When you go to eat your lunch, fill your plate as usual.  Then, divide everything in half.  Eat one half now, and the other half in 2 or 3 hours.  This will be hard at first, because you will most likely still be hungry when you're done.  But you will grow accustomed to it.  This allows your body to keep up with your food intake, and your digestive track handles things better.
Eat more than 3 meals per day if needed.  By eating less at a time, you may find you have to eat extra meals.  That's okay, as long as you aren't over-eating.
Take smaller bites.  Give your body less to deal with at a time.  This will take some thinking and focus at first.
Chew extra well.  Your mother may have always told you to ""Chew twenty times before you swallow"".  This is a good time to start counting your ""chews"".  Sometimes even more than twenty are in order.  Whatever the magic number is, just make sure your food is well-chewed by the time you swallow.  The rest of your digestive track will have less to break down.

,  This may take some experimenting.  There are the general diet outlines, and your doctor has probably made some recommendations, but remember: everyone is different.  Your diet will still be slightly different than the next Crohn's' patient.  A little bit of trial and error is the best way to learn, however, do your experimenting at home - never in public.

,  This doesn't necessarily mean you have to go tell everyone you have Crohn's.  Just don't be shy to tell your friends.  You don't have to go in depth about it.  You can say something simple, such as, ""I have Crohn's disease, and it really limits my diet.""  That will satisfy most people.  Close friends may want to know more, but if you are uncomfortable talking about it, ask them to look it up in their own time if they wish to learn about it.  The advantage of telling others is that they will totally understand!  Your friends and family will be more conscious of your diet, and they will be considerate of your limitations when they are making dishes for get-togethers.

,  Don't eat something that will make you sick.  It's not being rude - it's being healthy.  If your friends know about your problem, they won't judge you if you say ""No thanks"" to the dish they are offering you.  Sometimes, you have to protect yourself.

,  When you are ordering something at a restaurant, having a guys night, or going out for luncheon with your girlfriends, feel free to ask for things that specifically fit your diet.  In a world that is growing increasingly aware of such issues, you can easily find foods that fulfill your needs.  No need to risk getting sick.

,  Even if you eat right and avoid stress, Crohn's is still somewhat unpredictable.  If you know where the restrooms are, you can avoid the desperate search for them should the need arise.  


If you should feel an emergency coming on, don't rush.  Calmly dismiss yourself saying you will be right back, and make your way to the restroom.  If you remain calm, you will appear more natural and will draw less attention to yourself.

,  You know what's in it.  You know that it's safe.  Bring as much of your own food as you can.  Once that's gone, you can eat out, but be cautious!

,  This varies, but a rough estimate will do.  If it's about every hour and a half on a good day, plan on it being every hour the day you travel.  Figuring this out helps you plan your trip.

,  When you are estimating how long you will be on the road, add time in for additional stops.  (i.e. If you trip is 12 hours long, and you think you will most likely stop every hour for a break, you can estimate 11 extra stops.)


 If each stop only takes you 15 minutes, you need to add about 3 hours to your trip time. Allow for these breaks.  Don't let the lost time discourage you.  
Plus, by overestimating your travel time, you will feel better about your life when you get ahead of schedule.  This encouragement is much better than you feeling stressed because the trip is taking longer than expected.

,  This may sound crazy, but it can be extremely important at a crucial moment.  Sometimes, you may be traveling through a barely-populated area.  As you pass exits, you can't actually see a town, and you have no idea how far away it is.  Yet, that little town may have the nearest toilet in a 20 mile (32.2 km) radius or more.  


If you plan ahead, you can look up the small towns you will be passing and learn about the gas stations and visitor centers they may harbor.  That way, in a moment of desperation, you can pull off on an exit in the middle-of-no-where, confident that there's a restroom just one more mile away.

Know and avoid your trigger foods.,
Eat regular and consistent meals.,
Aim for a well-balanced diet.,
Limit gas-producing foods.,
Drink adequate fluids.,
Consider taking vitamin and mineral supplements.",How to Live with Both IBS and GERD1," Although completely separate conditions, both IBS and GERD come with a set of trigger foods. These may vary from person to person, but it's essential that you're aware of your trigger foods and you avoid them.


If you're not fully sure what foods set off your symptoms, start a food/symptom journal. Write down everything you eat, the symptoms that follow and the severity of the symptoms.
Review your journal and see if you can make any connections. For example, after your morning coffee you have heartburn, cramping and diarrhea. Or after eating spicy foods, you have abdominal cramps and heartburn.
Make a list of your trigger foods and keep this with you. That way, when you're grocery shopping or going out to eat, you have a list of what you should be avoiding.
Common trigger foods include: alcohol, caffeine, carbonated beverages, spicy foods, fatty foods, chocolate, garlic, onions, tomato-based foods (like pizza sauce) and acidic foods (like citrus fruits).;
, With both GERD and IBS it's important to be as consistent with your meals and eating times as possible. The more consistent you are, the more predictable your symptoms will be.Do not skip meals or leave long periods of time in between meals. Try to eat every three to five hours during the day.
You may need to pack meals or snacks so that you have something with you at all times.
Keep meal sizes the same, too. Eating larger meals may overwhelm your GI system and cause reflux, bloating, abdominal cramping, diarrhea or constipation.
Also consider eating smaller meals in general. This helps prevent reflux from occurring.

, A well-balanced diet is essential to the management of both IBS and GERD. Work to include a variety of foods into your diet to help keep your body health and reduce symptoms.


Even though some healthy and nutritious foods may cause symptoms (like citrus fruits or tomatoes), it's still essential that you focus on eating a variety of foods.
This type of diet helps ensure that you're getting a wide variety of nutrients and will help prevent any nutrient deficiencies.
A well-balanced diet is one that features foods from every food group each day, in addition to a wide variety of foods within each group throughout the week.Choose foods from each food group: protein, fruits, vegetables and whole grains.
If some foods cause symptoms, make note on your list of triggers and avoid these items. Focus on other foods from that food group. For example, if citrus fruits cause acid reflux, avoid oranges, lemons or grapefruits. Try other fruits like bananas, berries or grapes instead.

, Some foods are known to cause more gas and bloating compared to others. Although GERD symptoms aren't always triggered by these foods, IBS symptoms are.Some foods have certain types of nutrients that are difficult for your body, especially your colon, to break down. They cause an increased production of gas in your intestines which can cause bloating, cramping or flatulence.
Foods to limit or eat in very small portions include: beans, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, sugar alcohols, onions, carbonated beverages and dairy products.If these foods do not cause any problems or symptoms, you can include them in your diet; however, it's best to limit them or only have very small portions of them if they do produce any adverse side effects.

, In addition to eating the right types of foods or avoiding trigger foods, you need to drink an adequate amount of fluids. This can help issues related to both IBS and GERD.Water is the best type of fluid you can drink. It can help dilute stomach acid and replace fluids lost through diarrhea. Drink at least 6 – 8 oz (177 – 237 mL) before meals.
Avoid drinking water with meals to reduce stomach volume.
In addition to water, you can try: decaf coffee and tea or flavored water. You may try sparkling water if carbonation doesn't irritate your system.
Aim for 64 oz (1.9 L) at a minimum; however, many people need 80 oz (2.4 L) or more. This is especially true if you're experiencing diarrhea.Stop drink water two to three hours before bed to reduce symptoms of nighttime GERD.

, Supplements can be helpful if you suffer from IBS and GERD. Many of the side effects, especially if not well managed or if they occur frequently, can increase your risk for nutrient deficiencies.Diarrhea, which occurs frequently with IBS, can cause your GI system to malabsorb many vitamins and minerals.
In addition, some of the medications used to treat GERD prevent some vitamin and minerals from being absorbed as well.
Many people who suffer from both IBS and GERD may have a limited diet due to a large variety of trigger foods or fear from eating a larger variety of foods. This behavior limits how many nutrients you can get from your diet.
To prevent any deficiencies, consider taking a multivitamin. This can help prevent nutrient deficiencies by providing a ""back-up"" set of vitamins and minerals.
Always talk to you doctor before starting any type of supplementation. And remember, the best place to get your nutrients is from foods.

Sometimes the esophagus is inflamed enough that swallowing becomes difficult, since the food has limited space to pass.When the acid reflux from the stomach goes up the esophagus to the vocal cords, it can cause hoarseness and a sore throat. Although these are common signs of Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) as well, when associated with esophagitis, they are usually accompanied with difficult or painful swallowing. ;
, Heartburn is a common symptom of esophagitis when it is related to reflux. When acid leaves the stomach and enters the esophagus, it will cause a burning sensation because the cells of the esophagus were not designed to withstand an acidic environment.

, If you have eosinophilic esophagitis, there is a buildup of white cells called (eosinophils) in the esophagus and stomach. The white cells produce a protein which causes inflammation in your throat and can lead to scarring narrowing and formation of excessive fibrous tissue in the lining of your esophagus.An allergic response might also induce stomach pain and nausea and/or vomiting.This can occur at almost any age, and happens more commonly in Caucasian men.
As a result to the inflammation, you may have difficulty swallowing food. The esophagus can narrow to the point that food cannot pass through and becomes impacted. This is a medical emergency and requires the immediate care of a surgeon., You can affect your risk for esophagitis through some of the lifestyle choices you make.Alcohol reduces the strength of the lower esophageal sphincter and can trigger gastroesophageal reflux, or stomach acid that refluxes up the esophagus. This creates irritation and inflammation in the lining of the esophagus. Take note how you feel after you drink alcohol. See if you start to notice a trend.


Cigarette smoking has the same effect on the esophagus.

, Acidic foods and caffeinated beverages will also increase the acidity in the stomach. These can increase the risk of reflux and trigger esophagitis. Write down the foods you eat and how you feel in the hours after you eat.

, Drug-induced esophagitis is triggered when you swallow pills with little to no water. The residue from the pill remains in the esophagus, creating irritation and inflammation. Some of the more common medications to create this problem includes pain relievers such as ibuprofen, aspirin and naproxen sodium, antibiotics, potassium chloride, biphosphonates for treatment of osteoporosis, and quinidine used for treatment of some heart conditions.

, Reflux esophagitis occurs when the stomach acid refluxes through the lower esophageal sphincter and into the esophagus. GERD is a condition in which this backflow is a chronic problem. One complication of GERD is tissue damage to the esophagus leading to esophagitis., Your risk for esophagitis can increase because of pre-existing medical conditions.For example, surgery or radiation to the chest will weaken the lower esophageal sphincter and increase your risk of experiencing esophagitis.
Chronic vomiting weakens the sphincter from pressure in the stomach and thus increases the risk of esophagitis.
People with a weakened immune system from medications or an immune-mediated illness such as HIV can develop infections that lead to esophagitis. These infections include those due to fungi or viruses such as herpes or cytomegalovirus.

, Infectious esophagitis can be the result of a bacterial, viral or fungal infection. Although relatively rare, this type of esophagitis will occur more often in people with poor immune function, such as people suffering from HIV, leukemia, chemotherapy treatments for cancer, diabetes or organ transplant.Symptoms associated with infectious esophagitis can include:


Fever and chills associated with the infection.
Oral thrush if the infectious agent is candida albicans
If the infection is herpes or cytomegalovirus, you may experience sores in your mouth or in the back of your throat, making swallowing food or saliva even more uncomfortable.

, You may be having an allergic reaction that can cause esophagitis. Eosinophilic esophagitis can occur in response to an allergic reaction or from acid-reflux or both. Eosinophils are white blood cells that play a role in allergic reactions in the body. Sometimes the allergy is to foods, such as milk, eggs, wheat, soy or peanuts. At other times, people can have non-food reactions to pollen or dander, which causes esophagitis.

, In many cases, esophagitis will clear spontaneously within three to five days. This is especially true when the trigger was taking medication without enough water and you start drinking lots of water with medication. If you resolve your GERD, then the esophagitis will also begin to heal spontaneously.


Stop eating the foods that cause an allergic reaction (eosinophilic esophagitis), and the inflammation and irritation will resolve.

, Some people experience symptoms that necessitate a visit to the doctor in order to prevent further physical damage.Make an appointment with your doctor if you notice:


Symptoms that last more than a few days.
Symptoms that don’t improve or go away with over-the-counter antacids, changes to the way you take medications, or when you stop eating the foods causing the allergic reaction.
Symptoms that are severe enough that you have difficulty eating.
Any symptoms of esophagitis accompanied by signs of infection, such as muscle aches, headache and fever.
Any symptoms of esophagitis that is accompanied by shortness of breath or chest pain that happens shortly after eating.

, Emergency care is needed if your symptoms also include:


You suspect that you have food lodged in the esophagus.
You have a history of heart disease or experience chest pain.
You experience chest pain that lasts more than a couple minutes.
You vomit blood, which can indicate bleeding from the esophagus.
You have black tarry stools, which indicate bleeding in the digestive tract. Blood turns black with a tar appearance after exposure to digestive enzymes. If the esophagus is bleeding, it can either turn the stool black in color or you may vomit blood.

, Your doctor will make a diagnosis based on a thorough history and physical examination as well as one or more tests. Keep in mind that your doctor will recommend treatment based on the cause of esophagitis.

, A barium x-ray, usually called a Barium swallow, is an imaging study which uses a barium solution that lines the esophagus and stomach, making the organs more visible. These images will identify any narrowing of the esophagus. They can also indicate any other structural changes, such as hernias, tumors or other abnormalities.

, An endoscopy is a test which uses a tiny camera placed down the throat into the esophagus. Your doctor will look for any unusual appearance of the esophagus. This procedure also gives your doctor the opportunity to remove small tissue samples for testing. The appearance of the esophagus can change if the esophagitis is caused from drugs, reflux or eosinophilic esophagitis.


Tissue samples removed during an endoscopy can be tested for bacterial, viral or fungal infections, determine if there are white blood cells (eosinophils) in the tissue and identify abnormal cells that could indicate cancer or precancerous changes.

, These medications block and control acid production, are often the first line of defense.They may not work for all patients, but some people respond well and will experience relief from inflammation.


If you don't respond to PPIs, your doctor may prescribe a steroid such as fluticasone or budesonide., These are prescription or over-the-counter medications which reduce the production of stomach acid.These medications include famotidine (Pepcid), nizatidine (Axid), ranitidine (Zantac).Talk to your doctor about which H2 blocker is right for you.


Common side effects include constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, hives, nausea or vomiting, or problems with urination., If your doctor diagnoses you with esophagitis and he determines that it is triggered by reflux, your doctor may prescribe periodic surveillance endoscopy. This means that periodically, depending upon the severity of your symptoms and any other problems you might be having, your doctor will perform an endoscopy. He will look for tissue changes and evaluate tissue samples for precancerous conditions., Left untreated, esophagitis can result in narrowing of the esophagus from scar tissue. This is called a stricture of the esophagus. This causes swallowing to be difficult until the stricture is treated and the esophagus returns to a normal size.Barrett’s esophagus is a second long-term side effect of chronic inflammation and irritation to the esophagus. As the esophagus tries to heal the cells in the esophagus change to those similar to cells found in the intestines. This type of cell change is associated with an increased risk of esophageal cancer. The tissue changes that are characteristic of Barrett’s esophagus cause no symptoms for the individual. The risk is small but it’s important to have regular checkups. If precancerous cells are discovered, they can be treated immediately.
Chronic and uncontrolled inflammation can also trigger irreversible structural alterations. This leads to tissue fibrosis, stricture formation and ultimately impaired function of the esophagus. This remodeling of the esophagus can require surgical intervention.
Other long-term consequences of untreated esophagitis resulting from reflux include damage to the lungs and upper esophageal area, such as asthma, laryngitis and chronic coughing. These changes are the result of the exposure of the cells in the lungs and larynx to stomach acid, which also triggers the inflammatory response in the esophagus.

, If you are afflicted by esophagitis, you should consider how your diet is contributing to the condition. Making some changes to your diet may help you overcome your esophagitis.Try the following strategies:


Eat several small meals during the day.
Eliminate chocolate, mints and alcohol.
Don’t eat any foods that give you an allergic response.
Avoid foods high in acid and other foods that trigger your heartburn.
Avoid stooping over or bending immediately after meals. This increases the pressure in the stomach and triggers reflux.
Wait for at least three hours after eating to lie down or go to bed.

, Too much excess body weight can contribute to pressure on your abdomen. Talk to your doctor to determine a healthy weight for your body frame. Maintaining this weight will reduce pressure on the stomach and the lower esophageal sphincter. , Smoking can contribute to your chances of developing esophagitis.Give up smoking by making a plan to quit and using products to help you quit (such as nicotine gum or a nicotine patch).

, When your clothes are too tight, you may be putting added pressure on your stomach and lower esophageal sphincter. Go for clothes that fit properly or slightly loosely. Find pants that fit your waist comfortably instead of pants with a tight waistband.

, Taking medications without drinking plenty of water with them can cause irritation to the lining of the esophagus and trigger esophagitis. Some of these medication include tetracycline, doxycycline, alendronate, ibandronate and vitamin C. Take all medication with plenty of water to reduce the irritation to the esophagus.

, When you elevate the head of your bed, your head will be higher than your chest, causing acid to stay in your stomach. Place wooden blocks under the head of the bed to elevate it. Do not use pillows to elevate your head. This causes you to bend in the middle, both increasing the pressure on the abdomen and increasing the potential for back and neck problems.

Manage stress.,
Stop smoking.,
Exercise regularly.,
Don't lie down after you eat.",How to Live with Both IBS and GERD2," One of the biggest and most common triggers for both IBS and GERD is stress. Even small or mild stressors can set off a whole host of symptoms from both of these conditions.If you have a stressful lifestyle or have even low grade, but chronic stress, this can be a serious contributor to the flare up of your symptoms.
To help reduce your stress, consider: talking to a friend, going for a walk, taking a hot bath or reading a good book.
If you're having difficulty managing your stress and it continues to cause symptoms, consider seeking additional help from a behavioral therapist.

, Another irritant that can cause continued symptoms from both IBS and GERD is smoking. Quit smoking immediately to help reduce some of the symptoms associated with these conditions.


In terms of GERD, smoking decreases the function of a ring of muscle (a sphincter) between your esophagus and stomach, allowing acid to be pushed upwards into the back of your throat.With IBS, cigarette smoking can cause diarrhea and other intestinal distress.To reduce symptoms, consider quitting. Either give up cigarettes cold turkey or talk to your physician about joining a smoking cessation program or using medications to help you quit.

, Another way to decrease the occurrence symptoms of IBS and GERD is by exercising on a regular basis. Be consistent with exercise and meet the weekly guidelines to help you cope with these conditions.


It has been shown that exercise helps those with IBS by stimulating bowel contractions and keeping you regular.Exercise is also known as a great way to reduce and relieve stress. Since both IBS and GERD symptoms can be exacerbated by stress, including regular exercise is a smart idea.
Aim for 150 minutes of moderate intensity cardio each week plus two to three days of strength training.Avoid tight-fitting clothing when exercising or relaxing at home. Tight clothing will put pressure on the abdomen and the esophageal sphincter.

, In terms of GERD, there are specific suggestions to help prevent symptoms. Making sure you don't lie down or sleep for a certain time after you eat will be helpful in managing your symptoms.GERD revolves around how much acid is being pushed up the back of your throat.
Gravity, especially when you're standing or sitting with your back straight, aids your body in keeping the acid down and in your stomach; however, if you lie down, the acid can trickle up your esophagus and throat.
Wait at least two hours before going to sleep after you've finished dinner or your last meal.
You may also want to try elevating the head of your bed or resting on multiple pillows to help keep acid down.

Talk to your doctor and registered dietitian.,
Take your medications regularly.,
Consider taking probiotics.,
Carefully experiment with fiber.",How to Live with Both IBS and GERD3," To help you manage your IBS and GERD, you need to see your doctor regularly. In addition, it may be helpful to also enlist the help of a registered dietitian.


Stay in touch with your primary care physician or your gastroenterologist. They should be managing these conditions and staying in touch regularly.
If you take medications for these conditions, inform your doctor if they stop working or you're still having symptoms.
Look for a dietitian that specializes in GI conditions. Since many foods can trigger symptoms, it is important to make sure you learn how to avoid them while still following a fairly well-balanced diet.
Ask your dietitian for specific meal plans, recipes and supplement suggestions to help you stay healthy.

, If you have severe IBS or GERD, you may be prescribed prescription medications. These should be taken regularly to help you live with these chronic conditions.


Many times, both GERD and IBS can cause severe enough symptoms that they need to be managed with medications.
Take your medication as directed by your doctor. Never take more or less of the medication.
Also stay consistent. Don't skip days of taking your medications, otherwise they'll be less effective overall.
Try setting an alarm to remind you to take your medications. Timing your medication to take it directly after something that is already an ingrained habit (such as right after you brush your teeth) can help you remember to take it. Try storing your pills near your toothbrush or something that will trigger a reminder to take your medication.

, An additional supplement you may want to consider adding to your daily routine is a probiotic. This can help manage symptoms of IBS.


Some studies suggest that if you have IBS, that you might have an overgrowth of ""bad"" or ""unhealthy"" bacteria in your gut causing many of your symptoms.Probiotics are considered ""good or healthy"" bacteria. Adding a probiotic supplement to your diet may help repopulate your gut with the good bacteria and weed out the bad bacteria.
Probiotics can be taken in supplement form — in tablets, liquids or capsules. In addition, many foods have probiotics naturally or added. Try: yogurt, kefir, fermented vegetables, kimchi, sauerkraut or tempeh.

, Like probiotics, you might also want to consider adding some fiber to your diet; however, be careful with fiber supplements. A little too much and you could cause irritating symptoms.Fiber is great at relieving constipation — especially if you have IBS. Fiber also has been shown to reduce the symptoms associated with GERD.If possible, integrate more fiber-rich foods into your diet such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Be careful to avoid trigger foods and keep track of symptoms in a journal. Try: lentils, raspberries, blueberries, pears, apples, or artichokes.
You can add fiber in a supplement form - like a tablet, capsule or gummy chew.
Regardless of the choice of fiber, you always need to start adding it very slowly to your diet. Add in just 3 – 5 grams per day and assess how that affects you.

Talk to your doctor before using any treatment.,
Get the capsules made at your local pharmacy.,
Insert the suppository properly.,
Do 14 days of treatment to cure a yeast infection.,
Prevent recurring infections with biweekly use.,
Take a probiotic during your treatment.",How to Insert Boric Acid Suppositories1," Before using any over-the-counter medicine to treat a yeast infection, see your doctor or OB/GYN to confirm the diagnosis. They will likely do a physical exam and ask you questions about your health history. They will rule out other causes of vaginal discomfort before diagnosing a yeast infection. They can also advise you on how long to use boric acid and warn you of any health effects. Alternate treatments may be more effective for you based on your personal health history.


Your doctor can give you a prescription to take to your pharmacy to have capsules made.
When you go to your doctor, be ready to discuss the history of your symptoms and how they have evolved, including how many yeast infections you’ve had in the past and what is similar and different this time.;
, If you decide not to make your own boric acid capsules you should be able to get them from your pharmacy. The pharmacy will have to make them because they’re not currently sold pre-made.Call in advance to ask, because some pharmacies will not make them.If necessary, call around to find a pharmacy able and willing to help.


It will help to tell them what you intend to use it for, so they don’t think you’re trying to poison someone! Boric acid is also used to kill rats.

, Wash your hands and the outside of your vagina using mild soap and water just before bedtime. Lie down on your back and gently bend your knees with your legs slightly apart.Use your finger or an applicator to insert the boric acid suppository as far up into your vagina as it will comfortably go. Wait several minutes for the suppository to dissolve before sitting or standing up, or just thoroughly wash your hands then go directly to sleep.


If you’re using a reusable applicator, clean it as directed by the manufacturer. Otherwise, throw it away.
If it’s hard for you to insert the suppository while lying down, try standing with one foot propped up on the edge of the bathtub or a chair.It’s normal to have some discharge when using suppositories. Wear a panty liner to bed to avoid staining your underwear.

, To get rid of a current yeast infection, insert one-two suppositories per day for two weeks, based on the instructions from your doctor.One should be inserted before bed.Do not use them for longer than two weeks.


The first time you use this method, it’s best to consult with your doctor or OB/GYN.

, After you treat the yeast infection you currently have, use boric acid to prevent future infections. Use one suppository two nights out of the week – for instance, every Tuesday and every Friday. Do this for 6-12 months, or as long as your doctor recommends., Boric acid is good at killing both fungus and bacteria, so consider taking a probiotic daily while you’re using boric acid suppositories to help promote “healthy” bacteria in your vagina. You can get probiotic capsules at the pharmacy, or eat yogurt with “live cultures.”You can alternate using lactobacillus acidophilus suppositories during the day and boric acid at night."
"
Do NOT use boric acid if you’re pregnant.,
Use alternate treatment if you have open wounds on your vagina.,
Never ingest boric acid.",How to Insert Boric Acid Suppositories2," Boric acid can affect the health of your baby. If you’re pregnant and get a yeast infection, talk to your OB/GYN about alternate treatment. Do not use boric acid suppositories., Do not use boric acid if you have any broken skin that the boric acid can possibly contact.This includes open sores, wounds, or cuts in or around your vagina. Also be sure to wear gloves if you make your own capsules and have cuts on your hands.


If the powder contacts your skin (other than inside your vagina where it’s meant to dissolve), wash the area thoroughly., Boric acid can be a safe and effective treatment for yeast infections when inserted into your vagina. However, NEVER take a boric acid capsule by mouth. Boric acid is toxic when taken orally. If you accidentally swallow boric acid, seek emergency medical assistance immediately.Ingesting boric acid causes vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain and can be fatal.If someone else accidentally swallows it, be prepared with the following information when you call for emergency services: The person’s age, weight, and condition (awake/unconscious/vomiting, etc.), how much was swallowed, and what time it was swallowed.In the United States, call 1-800-222-1222 to speak with the poison control center for further tips while waiting for emergency services.

Gather the materials you’ll need.,
Fill your capsules using a sharp knife.,
Fill your capsule using the funnel method.,
Store them in a cool, dry place.",How to Insert Boric Acid Suppositories3," To make boric acid suppository capsules at home, you will need the following tools: Boric acid powder (not crystals), empty size 0 gelatin capsules, a clean sheet of paper, and a clean kitchen knife.


Boric acid powder should be readily available at most convenience stores such as Walmart, CVS, and Rite Aid. If you cannot find it, a pharmacist can probably order it for you.Look for empty gel capsules at local stores and pharmacies like Walmart, a vitamin or health food store, or order them online.
You may also want to wear latex or rubber gloves, as boric acid can irritate the skin.

, Lay a clean sheet of paper on a flat surface to catch any spills. Over the paper, dip the small tip of your clean knife into the powder and use the knife to carefully spoon the powder into an open capsule. Close the capsule tightly.A capsule should contain around 600mg of boric acid. Fill the capsule with as much powder as it will hold., If you’d prefer, use your sheet of paper like a funnel to fill your capsules. First, make a sharp crease down the middle of the paper. Then put a small amount of boric acid on the paper, and tilt the paper so the powder pours neatly into the capsule until the capsule is full. Close the capsule tightly., It’s okay to make up many capsules at once. Store them in an old vitamin container or other waterproof, sealed container. If possible, put a small packet of silicon in there with them to help prevent moisture. They should keep well for up to a year.Do not store them in the refrigerator.

Consult your doctor.,
Wash your hands thoroughly with water and soap.,
Read the instructions.,
Apply disposable latex gloves or a finger cot.,
Make the suppository rigid if it feels soft.,
Lubricate the area around the anus with petroleum jelly (optional).",How to Insert a Rectal Suppository1," Although suppositories can be purchased over-the-counter, it is always a good idea to consult your doctor before using any new medications.This is especially important if you have experienced constipation for an extended period of time and have tried to treat it at home with suppositories. You should not use laxatives for a long period of time.
Also consult your doctor before using a suppository if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, taking other medications, or using it for a child.
Also mention if you have severe abdominal pain or feel sick or if you have had an allergic reaction to a laxative in the past.;
, Germs and other bacteria are capable of invading the immune system through the rectum if given the chance. For this reason, it's recommended to wash your hands, even if you'll be wearing gloves during the procedure.


If your nails are long, you might want to cut them to avoid scratching or injuring the rectal lining.

, There are several laxative products available that differ in the way they are applied or on the dosage needed. The strength of the laxative determines how much or many suppositories you need to use.


Follow the product label and never exceed the recommended dose.
If you are using a prescription laxative, follow the instructions you received from your doctor.
If you don’t need to take a full dose, cut the suppository in half lengthwise. A lengthwise cut makes insertion much easier than a sideways cut.

, If you prefer, you can use latex gloves to protect your hands during the application. This is not necessary but you may feel more comfortable inserting the suppository with gloves on, especially if you have long nails.

, If the suppository is too soft, it might be painful to insert it. For this reason, it's recommended that you harden it before insertion. There are several to do this, before removing the wrapper:Place it in the refrigerator or freezer for up to 30 minutes.
Hold it under cool running water for several minutes.

, You may want to lubricate the surrounding skin to ease the application. Use petroleum jelly or other cream or lotion recommended by your doctor."
"
Lie on your side.,
Insert the suppository into the rectum.,
Hold the buttocks together tightly for a few seconds after insertion.,
Wait for the medicine to take an effect.,
Remove gloves and wash your hands completely.",How to Insert a Rectal Suppository2," One way to insert the suppository is to do it while lying down. Lie on your left side and pull your right leg upward towards your chest.


You can also insert the suppository while standing. In this case, stand with your feet apart and squat down slightly.
Another method is to lay on your back, with your legs raised in the air (not unlike a child about to get a diaper change).

, To make the insertion easier, lift the right (upper) butt-cheek up to expose the rectum. Insert the suppository lengthwise to make for easier passage.


Aim to push the suppository at least 1 inch into the rectum.
For children, aim to push the suppository at least ½ to 1 inch into the rectum.
Also make sure to insert past the sphincter. If the suppository is not inserted past the sphincter, it may eventually come out instead of being delivered by the body

, This will help keep the suppository from sliding out.You may want to remain lying down for several minutes after insertion.

, Depending on the suppository, it usually takes between 15 to 60 minutes to take an effect and cause a bowel movement., Use warm water and soap and be sure to rub the soap in for at least 20 seconds and then rinse off properly.

"
"
Have the person lie on his side.,
Prepare to insert the suppository.,
Insert the suppository.,
Hold the butt cheeks closed for about 10 minutes.To ensure the suppository doesn't slip out, gently press the person's butt cheeks together.,
Remove gloves and wash your hands thoroughly.",How to Insert a Rectal Suppository3," There are multiple ways the person can position himself, the easiest being laying on one side with his knees drawn toward his chest., Hold the suppository in one hand, between your thumb and forefinger.Use your other hand to lift or open the buttocks so that you can see the anal opening., Using your index finger for adults or your pinkie for younger children, gently insert the round end of the suppository into the rectum.


For an adult, aim to push the suppository at least 1 inch into the rectum.
For children, aim to push the suppository at least ½ to 1 inch into the rectum.
If you have not inserted the suppository far enough (past the sphincter), it will likely be pushed right back out of the rectum.

, The person's body heat will eventually melt the suppository, allowing it to take effect.

, Use warm or hot water and soap and be sure to scrub for at least 20 seconds, then rinse.

Drink lots of water.,
Avoid beverages that irritate the bladder.,
Watch out for spicy foods.,
Eat fiber to avoid constipation.,
Reduce the amount of meat and gluten you eat.,
Talk with your doctor about your medications.,
Lose weight.,
Quit smoking.,
Do Kegel exercises and bladder training.,
Completely empty your bladder when you urinate.,
Urinate frequently.,
Urinate after sexual intercourse.",How to Keep Your Bladder Healthy," According to the Institute of Medicine, men should drink 13 8-ounce glasses (3 liters) of water a day and women should drink nine glasses (2.1 liters). Water helps flush toxins out of your body and can reduce your risk of kidney or bladder infection. Drinking plenty of water also prevents constipation. This is important because constipation can cause your bowels to press down on your bladder, irritating your bladder and causing discomfort.Since our bodies are mostly water, drinking water can keep you healthy, maintain body temperature, act as a shock absorber for your nervous system, and lubricate your organs.If you exercise intensely, sweat profusely, are ill, pregnant or breast-feeding, your fluid intake may differ. For example, pregnant women are recommended to drink 10 8-oz glasses (2.4 liters) of water a day and those who are breast-feeding 13 glasses (3 liters) a day.;
, Carbonated drinks and caffeinated beverages like coffee or soft drinks can all aggravate your bladder. You should also avoid drinks that have artificial sweeteners like aspartame or saccharine. Limit the amount of alcoholic beverages and acidic juices (like citrus or tomato juice) you drink since this can also irritate your bladder.Citrus and tomato are also foods you should limit since your body breaks these down into acid. Excess acid can irritate your bladder.
Coffee and alcohol are both diuretic and bladder irritants. If you can’t live without coffee, try to limit yourself to one cup.
Women should have more more than one serving of alcohol daily and men should have no more than two servings.

, Spicy foods like curries or hot peppers can make bladder problems worse, probably because spicy components are excreted in you urine, irritating the bladder. Pay attention when you eat these foods and avoid them if you notice any bladder problems.You may find that you can eat small amounts of spicy foods. If that's the case, know your limit and avoid eating a larger amount that would trigger problems.

, Try to eat 25 to 30 grams of fiber a day to prevent constipation. Constipation can put excess pressure on your bladder and make bladder problems worse. Good sources of fiber include beans and other legumes, raspberries, pears (with the skin), apples (with the skin), split peas, artichokes, and green beans.You can also take senna or psyllium which are fiber supplements that act as gentle laxatives.A natural treatment for constipation is to include prunes in your diet.

, Consider how much meat and gluten you eat during the week and try to significantly reduce that amount. Meat is an acidic food that can irritate your bladder. This is because meat contains purines which your body breaks down into acid.Reducing the amount of gluten can help to reduce bladder irritation and decrease urinary urgency, frequency, and incontinence in some people.


Excess of uric acid in the system can lead to gout, kidney stones and other gastrointestinal disturbances, like gas. You might also notice that you need to urinate more often and with more urgency.

, Some medications can aggravate the bladder. If you have been prescribed any of these medications, ask your physician if another medication can be used as a substitute:Diuretics (water pills)
Antihypertensives (blood pressure pills)
Calcium channel blockers
Antidepressants
Sedatives
Tranquilizers
Muscle relaxants
Sleeping pills
Cough and cold preparations

, Being overweight or obese can aggravate bladder problems and can cause stress incontinence. If you develop stress incontinence, your bladder leaks small amounts of urine when you're physically active or when you cough or sneeze. Losing weight can relieve excess pressure on your bladder and surrounding muscles.Talk with your doctor about safely using weight. Your doctor can recommend strategies for reducing calorie intake and exercises for you to do.

, Tobacco and the ingredients added to cigarettes can cause you to urinate more often, make you feel like you urgently need to urinate, and increase your risk of bladder cancer. Smoking can also make you cough which can trigger stress incontinence. This is because coughing from smoking can weaken your abdominal and bladder muscles.Talk with your doctor about using a cessation program. While some people can quit smoking easily, you might need to use therapy or a nicotine-reduction aid to help you quit.

, You can strengthen the muscles of your bladder that control urination. Men and women should do at least three sets of 10 Kegel cycles every day. Both men and women should identify the muscles used in emptying the bladder. To do this, stop the flow of urine midstream. Once you identify those muscles, start doing Kegels with an empty bladder.Women should: lie down, squeeze and hold the muscles for a count of five. Relax for another count of five. Repeat this 10 times for a complete cycle.
Men should: lie down with knees bent and spread apart. Squeeze and hold the muscles for a count of five. Relax for another count of five and repeat this 10 times for a complete cycle.
With time, aim for 10 seconds of tightening and 10 seconds of relaxing between contractions. You also do not have to lie down to perform Kegel exercises once you get the hang of it. You can do them pretty much anytime, anywhere — in the car while sitting in traffic, while sitting at your desk at work, etc.
Do not to flex the muscles in your abdomen, thighs, or buttocks. Avoid holding your breath.
By doing Kegel you can increase the time between going to the bathroom and have fewer incontinence accidents.
Bladder training is best for patients with overactive bladder and involves voiding according to a schedule.

, Relax as much as possible when you use the restroom. This can relax your bladder muscles which means that your bladder empties more easily. Take your time and don't feel rushed when urinating. Emptying your bladder completely can reduce your risk for a urinary tract infection.Practice double voiding when urinating. Once you've finished urinating, lean forward slightly and try to urinate again. Moving forward can help the bladder empty completely.

, Never hold urine for long when you feel the urge to use the bathroom. Instead, try to urinate whenever you first notice the need. Frequent urination can prevent infection and keep the bladder muscles from weakening. Don't wait to use the bathroom until it becomes an urgent matter.You might need to schedule bathroom breaks if you find yourself too busy or to simply get in the habit of urinating frequently.

, For the best bladder hygiene, urinate before and after sexual intercourse. You should also clean your genital and anal areas before and after sex to prevent the spread of bacteria. These habits can reduce your risk of getting a urinary tract infection after sex.You can also drink a glass of pure tart cranberry juice or blueberry juice every day to further reduce your risk for urinary tract infections.

Consume more prebiotic foods.,
Have more fermented foods.,
Consume three to five servings of fruits and vegetables every day.,
Add more beans to your diet.,
Increase the amount of fiber in your diet.",How to Improve Your Gut Microbiome1," Prebiotic foods help to support gut bacteria and essentially feed your gut microbiome. You should try to consume prebiotic food at least twice a day, including:Garlic.
Leeks.
Asparagus.
Wheat bran.
Dandelion greens.
Chicory root.
Jerusalem artichoke.
Baked wheat flour.
Bananas.;
, Fermented foods help to support and replenish your gut microbiome. Look for fermented foods that are unpasteurized, as pasteurization actually removes bacteria or the probiotics from foods. Try to have more fermented foods like:Tempeh, which is fermented soybeans.
Kimchee, which is fermented Korean cabbage.
Miso, which is fermented barley paste.
Sauerkraut, which is fermented cabbage.
Yogurt, which is fermented milk with active probiotic bacteria.
Kefir, which is fermented milk.
Kombucha, which is green or black fermented tea with fruit and spices.
You should also eat probiotic foods like yogurt, at least 1 cup a day, and a few slices of aged cheese like Roquefort, Bleu, Brie, Feta and Gruyére a day. You should try to have at least one serving a day of kimchee and 6-8 ounces of Kefir a day.

, Probiotic foods like fruits and vegetables contribute to a healthy gut microbiome and will provide new, diverse bacteria to help replenish your gut microbiome.Include leafy green vegetables in your diet, such as kale, spinach, Swiss chard, mustard greens, collard greens, beets, and turnips.
You should also eat vegetables like broccoli, brussel sprouts, cabbage, and cauliflower to help support the growth of healthy bacteria in your microbiome. These vegetables also have anti-inflammatory properties and contain glucosinolates, which are sulfur-containing chemicals that help to form indoles, nitriles, thiocyanates, and isothiocyanates. These substances have been found to inhibit certain cancers, including bladder cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer, and stomach cancer in lab animals. Consuming probiotic vegetables can also help to prevent the development of cancer in humans.

, Beans are high in fiber and they also release short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), which help to strengthen and support your gut bacteria. They also help your body absorb many nutrients, which can contribute to weight loss., Fiber helps to increase the regularity of your bowel movements, removes metabolic and toxic wastes from your body and provides support for your gut microbiome.


Have more high fiber foods like whole grains, and fruits and vegetables, especially fruits where you can eat the rind, such as apples, plums, prunes, peaches, and nectarines.
Aim to eat 20-35 grams of fiber a day. Keep in mind consuming too much fiber can cause gas, so try to have a reasonable amount every day as part of a healthy diet.

Take note of abdominal pain.,
Look for nausea and vomiting.These symptoms are fairly common with gastritis.,
Check for black, tarry stool.The black, tarry stool seen in many gastritis patients is called “melena.” The same bleeding ulcers that makes people vomit blood causes them to excrete it through stool.,
Be aware of a change in appetite.People with gastritis often find that they've lost their appetite.,
Notice excessive burping and bloating.The inflammation in the stomach lining causes gases to build up.,
See a doctor for a physical exam.,
Allow the doctor to take a blood sample.,
Be prepared for an endoscopy if you have ""alarm symptoms."",
Take medication to fight the H. Pylori bacteria.If your gastritis is caused by this bacteria, your doctor will prescribe medication to kill it.,
Proceed to the second “eradication protocol” if necessary.,
Expect longer treatment for children.,
Learn the goal of supportive treatment.If you didn’t have the H. Pylori bacteria or after it’s been addressed, the remaining treatment for gastritis is “supportive.” This means that its goal is to relieve symptoms.

,
Reduce your stress levels.,
Treat any heartburn you experience.,
Discontinue behaviors that cause Peptic Ulcer Disease (PUD).,
Take PPIs to treat PUD.Peptic Ulcer disease has been on the decline since the advent of PPI therapy.,
Turn to surgical remedies if necessary.Most ulcers are found in the stomach and duodenum (the first part of the small intestine).,
Get treatment for nausea and vomiting.,
Eat smaller meals to control gas.",How to Know if You Have Gastritis," Patients with gastritis often experience ""epigastric pain,"" or pain in the upper central abdomen.It can be described as a burning, gnawing, or deep boring pain. You may find that it wakes you up in the middle of the night, but it can often be relieved by eating something or taking an antacid.;
, You may also see blood or bile in your vomit. The blood may be partially digested and look like coffee grounds.This is caused by bleeding ulcers.You should contact a doctor immediately if you see blood or green bile in your vomit.


Excessive vomiting can often lead to dehydration, which can also be dangerous. Make sure to get a lot of fluids if you're vomiting.

, This should also be reported to the doctor as soon as possible.

, You may lose your it altogether or simply find that you feel full after a smaller amount of food than usual. Take notice if your clothes feel unusually loose without any explanation. If you're losing weight without purposely dieting, you may be eating less.


If your appetite decreases significantly, you may eat little enough to be considered anorexic. See a doctor if you feel woozy or dizzy from a lack of nutrition or fluids.

, This, in turn, can make you belch more than you usually would. Even with the release of gas through burping, you may still feel bloated from all the gas that’s trapped in your stomach.

, Let the doctor know that you suspect gastritis, and ask him to focus on an abdominal exam. Bring a prepared list of all the symptoms you’ve experience and show it to your doctor. He will look for “alarm symptoms” that suggest you need urgent care. The alarm symptoms you should make sure to tell the doctor about are:Vomiting blood or bile
Black tarry stool (melena)
Appetite loss, anorexia, and weight loss (especially of six pounds or more)
Anemia (this may cause you to be pale, tired, weak, or dizzy)
A bulge you can feel in your abdomen
Let the doctor know if you are over 55 years old, as well.

, Once the sample has been drawn, he will send it to the medical lab for analysis. The lab may run the following tests:


Complete Blood Count (CBC) to check for anemia
Amylase and Lipase to rule out pancreatic disease
Liver function test and renal function test to assess for dehydration and for other causes of your symptoms if you’re vomiting
Stool guaiac test for occult blood (not visible in the stool)A urea breath test or stool/blood test to check for the bacteria Helicobacter Pylori, If the doctor is worried about the list of symptoms you've provided, he will likely order an endoscopy for you. He will insert a small camera attached to a long, flexible tube down your throat. The camera will reach far enough down to observe the esophagus, stomach, and part of the small intestine.If you tested negative for H. Pylori, but continue to have symptoms, you may choose to have an elective endoscopy.


You can ask for a sedative during the procedure to help you relax. While you may feel pressure, you won’t feel any pain.
The doctor will look for ulcers, erosions, tumors, and other abnormalities. He can also take biopsies to be tested in the lab.

, The first “eradication protocol” for addressing this bacteria has a 90% success rate.Your doctor may prescribe four medications to be taken for one day:


Pepto Bismol: 525 mg taken orally four times
Amoxicillin: 2 g taken four times
Flagyl: 500 mg taken orally four times
Lansoprasole: 60 mg taken orally once

, If the initial treatment does not successfully kill off the H. Pylori bacteria or if your doctor feels that you should do so, your doctor may prescribe a second round. The combination of medications in this protocol have an 85% success rate at killing the bacteria:Biaxin: 500 mg taken orally twice daily for seven days
Amoxicillin: 1 g taken orally twice daily for seven days
Lansoprazole: 30 mg taken twice daily for seven days

, Shorter, more intense treatments are not recommended for children. Not enough studies have been done to research the effects on their bodies. Instead, the doctor will recommend a longer two-week regimen. Their medication will also be prescribed in divided doses. For example, a divided dose of 50 mg/kg per day means you give the child 25 mg/kg twice during the course of the day.


Amoxicillin: 50 mg/kg in divided doses twice daily for 14 days.Biaxin: 15 mg/kg in divided doses twice daily for 14 days.
Omeprazole: 1 mg/kg divided twice daily for 14 days.

,, Gastritis can be caused by severe stress related to major surgery, injury, burns or severe infections.Lowering your stress may help with your gastritis.

, People have different experiences of heartburn. Some may feel a mild burning while others have pain so severe it feels like a heart attack. Heartburn is the result of stomach acid getting up into the esophagus where it doesn't belong. This is often the result of a loose gastroesophageal sphincter. If you overeat, you can apply too much pressure on this sphincter, forcing your stomach contents up past it.Heartburn can also be caused by simple gravity. When you lie down right after a meal, you encourage stomach fluid to flow up into the esophagus.


The first line of treatment for heartburn is with proton pump inhibitors (PPI). The doctor may prescribe Lansoprazole or Omeprazole.
The second line of treatment is with H-2 blockers like Pepcid or Zantac.

, If you take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for pain, they may be causing your ulcers.Examples of NSAIDs include aspirin and ibuprofen.Talk to your doctor about finding an alternative treatment to manage your pain. Smoking and drinking alcohol can also put you at greater risk of peptic ulcers.Avoid herbal products and supplements, as they may worsen your condition.Ask your doctor if your current medications, like bisphosphonates to treat osteoporosis, may be the culprit. Figure out an alternative course of treatment if so.

, PUD can cause gnawing, burning or boring pain in the upper abdomen. If you have no ""alarm symptoms,"" you'll usually take PPIs to neutralize the acid eroding your stomach lining. Possible prescription options include Nexium, Vimovo, Prevacid, Prilosec, Zegerid, and Aciphex.

, If PPI therapy doesn't help your symptoms, talk to your doctor about your surgical options. Though the procedure is less common now than it once was, the doctor may suggest a vagotomy. In a vagotomy, a surgeon severs branches of the vagus nerve that are responsible for producing stomach acid.

, If nausea and vomiting are part of gastritis, then the gastritis needs to be treated to avoid complications like ulcers and cancer. You will likely undergo antiemetic therapy. Antiemetic drugs are used to control nausea and vomiting.You might get a shot of Zofran or take a tablet that diffuses the medication under your tongue.


If you've been vomiting a lot, you may be dehydrated. In that case, you may receive IV hydration.
Tell the doctor if you feel dizzy or weak after vomiting, if you are urinating less than usual or your urine is very dark, or if it takes longer than usual for your skin to snap back when you pull it., If your major symptoms are bloating and belching, unfortunately, as of now, there's no good therapy available to treat these symptoms. The best you can do is to eat smaller, but more frequent meals throughout the day.You get the same amount of nutrition, but put less strain on your digestive system.


Anti-gas medications like simethicone could be tried for belching and bloating due to gas.

Be aware of the relationship between prebiotic supplements and probiotic supplements.,
Get prebiotic supplements.,
Take probiotic supplements.",How to Improve Your Gut Microbiome2," Prebiotics are non digestible carbohydrates. They are food for probiotics, which are live micro-organisms. When you combine prebiotics with probiotics, this forms a synbiotic.Synbiotics are made of live bacteria and the fuel needed for the bacteria to thrive. So having synbiotics in your body can help to keep your gut healthy and strengthen your immune system., Look for prebiotic supplements that contain inulin and fructooligosaccharides (FOS), as well as galactooligosaccharides or GOS. Check the label of the prebiotic supplements for the “USP Verified” seal, which indicates a non-profit lab, the USP, has confirmed the contents of the supplements.


You can find prebiotic supplements at your local health food store. Make sure the supplements are USP Verified as this will ensure they are of high quality.

, Probiotic supplements can help to increase the number of beneficial gut bacteria in your microbiome. The supplements may come in liquid, capsule, tablet or powder form. Check that the supplement contains different strains of bacteria, including L. acidophilus, L. Fermentum, L, rhamnosus, B. longum, and B. bifidum. You should also check the expiration date of the supplement and confirm the supplement contains at least 25 billion Colony Forming Units (CFUs).


You can find probiotic supplements at your local health food store, often in liquid form. You should always refrigerate probiotic supplements to ensure they do not spoil or lose potency.If you have IBS, avoid supplements that contain a yeast called Saccharomyces, which can help to protect your gut bacteria but can also lead to issues for individuals with IBS.
You should also confirm that the supplement can survive the acids in your stomach, as stomach acid can kill the probiotic bacteria. The supplement should be in controlled-release form, which means it will dissolve after it has passed through your stomach.

Exercise at least three times a week.,
Avoid taking antibiotics.,
Cut down on smoking and drinking alcohol.,
Talk to your doctor about gut microbiome health.",How to Improve Your Gut Microbiome3," Exercise is a great way to stimulate your gut microbiome, as it helps to increase blood flow and massages your digestive tract. Massaging your digestive tract will allow your body to release toxins and properly digest your food.Do exercise like walking, running, yoga, Tai Chi, housework, yardwork and gardening. You can also take up a sport like tennis, basketball, baseball, softball, hockey, lacrosse, or football. Work out on a stationary bicycle, an elliptical machine, or a rowing machine.

, Though antibiotics are useful for killing off bad bacteria in our body, they also kill off good bacteria needed to aid in digestion. If possible, talk to your doctor about taking medication other than antibiotics, as they can negatively affect your gut microbiome. If you do need to take antibiotics, make sure you also take probiotic supplements so your body contains the bacteria it needs to stay healthy., Maintain a healthy gut microbiome by reducing unhealthy habits like smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol. Try to limit your drinking to a few drinks a week and try to quit smoking, if you do smoke.

, Your doctor can monitor your gut microbiome and let you know if there are any issues with your digestion that could be linked to an unhealthy gut microbiome. Talk to your doctor about your gut microbiome during your yearly or bi-yearly check up, especially if you have low energy, digestive issues, or poor immunity to illness and disease.

Brush your teeth after every meal.,
Get the right toothbrush and toothpaste.,
Floss.,
Rinse with mouthwash.,
Visit your dentist regularly.,
Cut down on sweets.,
Drink cavity-fighting beverages.,
Eat food containing vitamins and minerals.,
Eat crunchy fruits and vegetables.,
Chew sugar-free gum.",How to Prevent Cavities," Brush your teeth thoroughly about 20 minutes after every meal. If you can't manage that, brush at least twice a day. Brush your teeth for two minutes each time. Play a song that lasts two minutes, set an alarm, or watch the clock while you brush.


Apply a pea-sized amount of toothpaste to your brush. Rinse with water when finished.
Brush every part of your teeth in turn. Brush the front and back of each tooth, and brush the tops. Brush along the gumline, and brush your tongue.Hold your brush at a 45 degree angle and use small up-and-down or circular strokes.
Brush firmly, but don't push down with your brush, or you could damage your gums.
Don't overbrush! Brushing more than three times a day can damage the enamel, making you more prone to cavities.;
, Get an electric or sonic toothbrush with a circular head that moves up and down and in circles. Sonic toothbrushes are thought to be the best at getting your teeth clean, as the high-speed vibrations stimulate fluids into areas where the brush can't reach.If you don't like electric or sonic toothbrushes, choose any soft-bristled brush with a small head. A half-inch wide and one-inch tall head will allow you to reach around the corners of your mouth.


Replace your toothbrush (or the head of your electric toothbrush) every three months, or when frayed.
Carry your toothbrush with you, or keep an extra toothbrush at your desk at work or in your locker at school. Bring a travel tube of toothpaste, too. Make sure you rinse your toothbrush with water after use to reduce the buildup of bacteria on the bristles.
Brush your teeth using a toothpaste that contains fluoride, a mineral that fortifies your enamel, making your teeth more resistant to attacks from the plaque bacteria.
Children cannot have as much fluoride as adults. Consult your dentist if you wish to administer some fluoridated products to your child., Floss to remove bacteria from hard-to-reach places between your teeth.Unwind about 18 inches (46 cm) of floss around your middle fingers, leaving an inch or two to floss with, and hold it tautly between your thumb and index fingers. Gently slide it up and down between your teeth. Curve the floss down your tooth, slightly below your gum line.


Floss at least daily. Floss after meals that contain stringy, husky, or sticky elements.Floss to prevent tooth decay, gingivitis, and heart disease., Swish a mouthwash containing fluoride and a low percentage of chlorhexidine (0.02 %) around in your mouth for 10–15 seconds. You can do this after brushing. Pick a fluoridated, alcohol-free mouthwash that has been approved by the American Dental Association or your country's equivalent.Do not substitute mouthwash for brushing and flossing. It is a supplement meant to lower the number of oral bacteria, not a replacement for cleaning your teeth.

, Your dentist can advise you on best hygiene practices, head off cavities before they hurt, and help you take further action if you are prone to tooth decay. If you have few dental issues, visit your dentist once a year. If you are a young adult with exceptionally good teeth, you can probably visit once every 18 months to two years. Any pain, unusual odor, or changes in your mouth should send you straight to the dentist, however.Children's teeth can decay faster than those of adults, so bring your child to the dentist every six months to a year. This is especially important once your child reaches six years of age, when permanent teeth begin to grow.
Ask your dentist about supplemental fluoride. If your teeth are weak, or if there is no fluoride in the water where you live, it could be helpful.
Ask about dental sealants. If you are prone to cavities, a composite protective coating can protect your molars. They can last up to ten years, depending on the way you bite, what you eat or how they were bonded. You should also have an annual check of the sealants as sometimes cavities may be found under a sealed tooth., Cut down on sugars. Avoid soda, candy and carbohydrates. Junk food, which is high in carbohydrates and added sugars, should be avoided. Save chips, candy, cake, cookies, and white bread for special occasions. Sugar on your teeth will attract bacteria, causing plaque buildup and cavities.


When you do eat sugar, brush your teeth immediately afterwards.
When you eat candy or other sweets, pick ones that spend less time in your mouth. Sucking on a lollipop exposes your teeth to sugar for a longer time than gobbling a piece of chocolate does.

, Drink water, and rinse with water after eating, especially if it will be a moment before you get a chance to brush. Drink water frequently, as it will clean your teeth and, in many cases, fortify them with fluoride. In many areas, fluoride is added to public water supplies. Check to see if your area uses it, and consider supplementing if not.


Drink black and green teas instead of coffee. They are less acidic, and can fight plaque.Rinse or brush after drinking alcohol, which is high in sugar.
Eliminate soda from your diet completely if possible.The phosphoric acid found in soda rapidly dissolves the enamel of your teeth and carries no benefits for any other part of your body.
Minimize the damage done to your teeth by drinking through a straw. You won't protect your teeth from sugar exposure entirely by using a straw, but it will help a little., Calcium is excellent for your teeth, so eat dairy products, fortified soy products, almonds, and dark leafy vegetables. Vitamin D, found in sunlight, milk products and in fatty fish such as salmon, is also desirable. Meat, fish, and eggs will give you phosphorous, while whole grains, spinach, and bananas will give you magnesium. Eat orange fruits and vegetables as well as dark leafy greens for vitamin A., Raw food is especially rich in vitamins and minerals. Eating crunchy vegetables like carrots or celery can actually help clean your teeth. The crunchy plant fiber acts as a mild abrasive. When they say that ""an apple a day keeps the doctor away,"" that's because chewing a crunchy apple or vegetable encourages your mouth to produce more saliva, which restores the pH balance in your mouth, preventing plaque., While ordinary gum contains tooth-decaying sugar, sugar-free gum that contains xylitol can help you fight plaque. Xylitol fights bacteria, and chewing gum can stimulate saliva that will help you clean your teeth. Try chewing a stick of sugar-free gum after a meal if you don't have a chance to brush your teeth right away.Don't go crazy with chewing gum — chewing too much can produce stomach problems or increased volume of your masseter muscle.

Brush gently.,
Rinse with salt water, alternatively.,
Avoid foods that can irritate the wound.,
Talk to your dentist.,
Evaluate your risk.,
Follow the directions and take the appropriate dosage.,
Watch for tenderness and pain.,
Beware of swelling.,
Note bad breath or foul tastes in the mouth.",How to Prevent Infection After Dental Work," Depending on what work you’ve had done – like oral surgery or a tooth extraction – you may need to stop brushing for a short time. You should still keep your mouth and teeth clean, however, as food particles and other debris can promote the growth of bacteria. Follow your dentist’s instructions. She may want you to continue brushing gently to keep your mouth clean or stop for a period.For tooth extractions, you won’t be able to brush, rinse, spit, or use mouthwash on the day of the surgery or for about 24 hours afterward. Resume brushing thereafter, but avoid the extraction site for about 3 days.
Brush if your dentist gives you the go-ahead. Just be gentle near sensitive areas and don’t overdo it.
If you had a tooth extraction, you should not rinse with force. This will create negative pressure that is bad for the blood clot created in the socket.;
, A salt water rinse is a more gentle way to clean your mouth, though it doesn’t replace brushing. Salt temporarily raises the pH balance in your mouth and creates an alkaline environment hostile to bacteria, slowing their growth. It can therefore ward off infections that might otherwise form in open wounds or sores.It’s very easy to make a salt water rinse. All you have to do is add a half teaspoon of salt to one cup of warm water.
After oral surgery like wisdom tooth extraction, start to rinse your mouth with salt water the next day. Rinse every two hours and after each meal for a total of about five to six times per day. Rinse gently, by moving your tongue from one cheek to the other. Take care not to harm the extraction site. Continue to do this for a week after the surgery.
Some dentists may ask you to irrigate after a tooth extraction, too. They will give you a small dental irrigator to use starting three days afterward, to flush the tooth socket with warm water after meals and at bedtime. This will clean the site and reduce your chance of infection.

, Infections occur when bacteria enter into your blood stream and multiply. Wounds in your mouth need to close properly and stay closed, then, which means that you’ll need to watch what you eat to avoid reopening incisions, dislodging things like stitches, or irritating the wound. Follow your dentist’s instructions and, if need be, restrict your diet.You may need to eat a liquid or semi-soft diet for a few days. Things like applesauce, yogurt, pudding, Jello, eggs, or pancakes are usually OK.
Avoid tough, crunchy, or hard foods. Things like toast, chips, and fried shrimp could disturb site of your dental work or worse, like opening your stitches and causing bleeding.

, People with certain medical conditions are at a higher risk for developing dangerous infections after getting dental work and may need preventative or “prophylactic” antibiotics. This is especially true for people who are at risk of an infection of the heart, or endocarditis. They will need antibiotics before the procedure. Talk to your dentist to see whether you fall into this group.Endocarditis occurs in the heart valves, especially in the presence of heart defects. Usually, bacteria in the bloodstream don’t stick to the walls of the heart. However, with some abnormalities the blood flows turbulently and allows bacteria to attach themselves and grow.
Endocarditis is a risk if you have artificial heart valves, shunts or conduits, rheumatic heart disease, or other congenital heart defects. Risky procedures for people in this category include dental extractions, dental and periodontal surgeries, implants, and the cleaning of teeth or implants where bleeding is expected.
Some people with artificial joints are also at risk for developing infections around those joints. If you have an artificial knee or hip, for example, you could be at an elevated risk for infection after dental work.

, Healthy patients aren’t usually prescribed antibiotics before or after dental procedures as part of the treatment. While one study suggests that preventative antibiotics taken post-op can reduce the risk of infection, it argues that the practice may do more harm than good. Talk to your dentist to see whether or not you are healthy enough to go without antibiotics.Check your medical history – do you know that you have any congenital heart defects? Have you ever had heart surgery? If you don’t remember, ask your general practitioner.
Always be honest. Inform your dentist about any kind of health problem you had or you may have, as this can influence the entire treatment.
Talk to your dentist to evaluate your risk. She should be able to advise you and, if you are at risk, she will likely prescribe you antibiotics.

, Antibiotics are like any medicine and should be used with care. Follow your dentist’s instructions to the letter. Take the prescribed dosage for as long as she recommends, if your dentist decides to have you take preventative antibiotics.


In the past, dentists and doctors recommended that at-risk patients take antibiotics before and after dental procedures. Today many instead advise patients to take a single dose about an hour before the procedure.
If you’re at-risk you may receive penicillin. However, patients that are allergic to penicillin are often prescribed amoxicillin either in capsule or liquid form. Patients that can’t swallow medicine may be given injectable doses.
If you are at-risk for endocarditis and develop a fever or other symptoms of infection after dental work, contact your doctor immediately.

, An infection can form anywhere in your mouth, from your teeth and gums to your jaw, tongue, and palate. You should be vigilant in the days after your dental work and try to spot any developing infection. One of the most obvious signs is pain, discomfort, and tenderness near the site of the infection. You might also have a fever and pulsatile pain. You may notice that the discomfort also increases with touch or when in contact with hot and cold.Does it hurt to chew or to touch the area of your mouth that’s affected? Infections are usually sensitive to touch and pressure.
Does it hurt to eat hot food or to drink a cold beverage? Infections are also sensitive to temperature.

, Certain kinds of dental procedures may cause some swelling, like wisdom tooth extractions and periodontal surgery. Usually you can manage the level of swelling with ice packs. However, this sort of swelling should go down within about 3 days. If you have unexpected swelling or still have swelling three days after a major procedure, you might have an infection and should seek medical attention.Swelling in the jaw and gums is often a sign of an infection, especially if you haven’t had an extraction or surgery at the site. Difficulty opening your mouth can also indicate that you have an infection.
In some cases, you may find swelling in your neck or under your jaw. This is caused when an infection spreads to the lymph glands there and can be a very serious situation. See a medical professional immediately if you notice an infection in your head or neck.

, Another giveaway of an infection is a foul taste or smell in your mouth. This is caused by the build up of pus – white blood cells that have died while fighting the infection – and is an almost certain sign that you should see your dentist as soon as possible. Pus is one of the main hallmarks of infection.Pus tastes bitter and slightly salty and also smells bad. It may be the cause if you have a bad taste in your mouth that won’t go away or bad breath.
Pus can get trapped inside your body in what’s called an abscess. If the abscess breaks, you will taste a sudden rush of bitter and salty fluid. You might also feel some pain relief.
Talk to your dentist or a doctor if you notice pus in your mouth. You will need to get be treated for infection.

Brush your false teeth at least once a day.,
Use a soft toothbrush.,
Use mild toothpaste that does not have any abrasives in it.,
Use dish washing soap if you can’t find any mild toothpaste.,
Brush your false teeth with the proper techniques.,
Clean your false teeth every after meal.",How to Keep False Teeth White1," Just like natural teeth, your should brush your false teeth at least once daily. Ideally, you should brush after every meal, although this can be difficult for those who work away from home all day. So at the very least, you should brush your false teeth at night before going to bed.;
, Use a soft toothbrush, or a toothbrush that is available specifically for false teeth. There are many brands (like Oral-B) which have launched toothbrushes designed exclusively for false teeth.


If you choose hard toothbrushes, the false teeth may get numerous scratches which will cause the loss of the original glaze.

, Or use a toothpaste which contains an extremely low percentage of abrasives. This is important, as strong chemical abrasives can scour the false teeth.


You can also brush your teeth without toothpaste because the main purpose of brushing is to remove the biofilm covering the teeth.
Buy a denture toothpaste that has a Radioactive Dentin Abrasion (RDA) value between 0-70. The RDA is an index used by the American Dental Association (ADA) to determine the level of abrasion of a toothpaste. RDA values higher than 70 indicate that a toothpaste is abrasive, and is therefore dangerous to your false teeth.

, Dish washing soap is the most ideal cleanser because it does not contain abrasives that can damage false teeth. It has bactericidal ingredients like Tetrasodium EDTA and triclosan that kill and inhibit bacterial growth.

, After you have chosen what denture paste to use, rinse your false teeth in running water. Apply a strip of denture paste on the bristles of your toothbrush.


Hold the brush such that the bristles face the gum part of your false teeth.
Do small, circular, vibratory brushing strokes to remove food particles. This is the best method to reach food particles caught in between false teeth.
Do a sweeping motion from the gum part towards the biting surfaces of the false teeth to flush out all the food debris.
Rinse your false teeth in running water to remove excess denture paste and food particles.

, Food debris or plaque can cause black/green/grey staining of false teeth.


When proper oral hygiene is not observed, this plaque will harden and absorb colored liquids like coffee, tea or soda.
Brushing your false teeth regularly removes debris and prevents plaque build-up.

Channel positive thoughts.",How to Have a Great Smile," The single most important thing you can do to keep your teeth healthy is to brush them two to three times a day, using the proper technique. A lot of people fall short in this area, so make sure you understand exactly how you should be brushing your teeth.Each time you brush your teeth, you should brush for approximately two minutes. Try using a timer to help you get the timing right.
Hold your brush at a 45-degree angle and brush in short, up-down strokes, making sure to brush the backs and fronts of all your teeth, even the hard to reach ones.
Apply gentle pressure as you brush. Brushing too hard can actually cause permanent damage to your gums, so ease up if it feels uncomfortable.
Don't brush more than three times a day, or you may end up causing more harm to your teeth.
Wait at least thirty minutes after eating before brushing your teeth to avoid spreading acid around your mouth and wearing down your enamel.;
, There are a lot of options for toothbrushes these days, but luckily choosing the right one for you is rather simple. Look for a brush that is comfortable for you and makes it easy to clean your teeth thoroughly.Make sure the head of your toothbrush is small enough that you are able to reach all of the surfaces of your teeth, even the back ones.
Soft bristles are best for most people. Your gums should not feel irritated when you are brushing.
An electric toothbrush may make it easier for you to brush correctly, but you can achieve the same results if you commit yourself to using your manual brush the right way. It really comes down to personal preference.
Don't forget to replace your manual toothbrush or electric toothbrush head every three to four months.

, Plain fluoride toothpastes are best. Tartar fighting and whitening toothpastes can damage your enamel and the structure of your teeth. If you do use these products, it's a good idea to use them for only short periods of time., It's best to floss in the evening to remove all of the food particles that accumulated during the day. Just like with brushing, there is a proper technique.Use about 18 inches of floss and wrap the ends around the middle fingers on both hands. Then hold the center of the floss taut between your thumbs and index fingers.
As you floss between each tooth, gently work the floss up and down, reaching up to the gum line and all the way around each tooth.
Use a clean section of floss for each tooth.
Different teeth require different types of floss. Make sure you get a floss that fits snuggly in the gaps between your teeth without causing pain. Interdental brushes, floss threaders, and water picks also work nicely for some people.

, Fluoride mouthwashes can help strengthen weak enamel. It is best, however, to wait at least an hour after brushing your teeth to use your mouthwash, as it may deactivate the active ingredients in your toothpaste.Avoid mouthwashes containing chlorhexidine gluconate, which can cause staining on your teeth.
Also avoid mouthwashes containing alcohol, which can dry out your mouth and lead to bad breath.

, Many common foods, especially those high in sugar or acid, can eat away at the enamel on your teeth. Other substances, like coffee, tea, and red wine, can stain your teeth. Avoid these substances if possible, and consider rinsing your mouth out with water right after you enjoy them.If you're concerned about staining, try drinking dark liquids with a straw. This can also be helpful with acidic beverages, as it keeps much of the acid away from your teeth.
Common sources of acid include energy drinks, sports drinks, sodas, citric fruit, sour candies, and vinegar.
You should also avoid sticky candies, like caramels, as it can be very hard to remove all of the particles from between your teeth.
Smoking will also darken and stain your teeth..

, Most dentists recommend checkups every six months, but some studies suggest that adults can stretch that to once every 18 to 24 months.If you have tooth decay, cavities, staining, or other dental problems, you’ll go more often than someone who has no dental issues.
Even if you don't have any obvious dental issues, go to the dentist regularly, as they can catch cavities and other problems, such as gum disease and oral cancer, early.

, If your teeth are discolored, you might consider whitening them at home with store-bought whitening toothpastes or gel. Your dentist can also professionally whiten your teeth, which will most likely give you better results.If whitening products cause you to experience sensitivity in your teeth, stop using them.
If you have stains beyond the surface of your teeth, you will probably need to visit a dentist for a professional whitening service,

, If you are really uncomfortable with your teeth, consider getting dental work. There are lots of different treatment options to deal with different concerns.If your teeth are crooked or you have a misaligned bite, braces or clear aligners can help correct this. The type of treatment you receive will depend upon the recommendation of the orthodontist you see.
If you don’t like the shape of your teeth, you can consider having your natural teeth contoured by a dental professional.If you have chipped or damaged teeth, you may want to ask your dentist about veneers, which are thin layers of porcelain that bond to your existing teeth. These can also help if you want to change the shape of your teeth.
If you are missing teeth, you might consider getting tooth implants, dentures or bridges.
If you have excess gum tissue, you can undergo a surgical procedure called crown lengthening, which will expose more of your teeth., Staying hydrated will help prevent your lips from getting chapped. The amount of water you need will depend upon your body, your lifestyle, and where you live, but it is commonly recommended to drink eight eight-ounce glasses of water each day.If you exercise often or live in a hot climate, you’ll need to drink more than eight glasses of water each day.

, Your saliva contains acids that will irritate your lips. In addition, licking your lips regularly will remove your lips’ natural oils that keep them moisturized., Smoking can darken lips, thin them, and cause wrinkles.If you're open to quitting, consider using a nicotine patch or an electronic cigarette. Note that if you are getting nicotine from a patch or e-cigarette, you need to ensure that you are not still smoking regular cigarettes, too, as this can be dangerous.If you don’t want to give up smoking cigarettes, try massaging almond and coconut oil on your lips each day, which may help reduce the discoloration of your lips.

, If your lips are dry or chapped, use a lip balm regularly. Ensure that whatever lip balm you choose includes SPF, regardless of the season, as your lips can burn even during winter months.Beeswax lip balms are popular, but in general, waxes are too heavy to moisturize your lips. If your lips are chapped, avoid waxes.
Look for nourishing ingredients like shea butter, vitamin E, and macadamia oil.
You can also try using a gentle lip exfoliator. If you don't have one on hand, use a toothbrush to gently exfoliate your lips, or massage a mixture of honey and sugar into your lips.

, Lipstick and lip gloss can give your smile some extra pizzazz.Try out different shades and find a few that make you feel confident.Make sure to choose a shade that complements your skin tone.
If you are concerned about your teeth looking yellow, steer clear of orangey shades.Darker lipsticks can make lips look thinner, so stick to lighter shades if you have thin lips.
Matte lipsticks and stains can be more drying to your lips, so stick with moisturizing, creamy lipsticks or glosses if you have chapped lips.
Although it's more common for women to use lipstick, men with pale lips might find it useful to use a tinted lip balm.
If you're unhappy with the shape of your lips, you can try experimenting with lip plumping glosses. Lip liner can also help you achieve a fuller look, but make sure it matches your lipstick or is a natural tone that matches your lips.

, When you’re genuinely smiling, the corners of your mouth push upward into the corners of your eyes. Your eyes relax and squint slightly at the corners and your lower eyelids will tighten slightly. Your upper eyelids might lower a little bit too.Pay attention to what happens to your face the next time you are genuinely happy and smiling. Remember how that feels. Doing it enough will commit it to your muscle memory.
You can also look at photos of yourself where you were genuinely happy to see how your eyes and mouth look.
If you smile only with your mouth and not with your eyes, your smile will look fake.

, A tense smile will look forced and uncomfortable. Try to relax the muscles in your cheeks. and refrain from pulling the sides of your mouth up too high. , This is a handy trick that will help you achieve a smile that is not too big and not too small. If you look at photos of models, you might notice that many of them use this trick!, To achieve a more flattering mouth shape, try saying a word that ends with an ""uh"" sounds, like ""toga."", Try out different types of smiles: a smaller, closed-mouth one; one with your mouth slightly parted; a huge smile with all of your teeth showing. Pay attention to both your mouth and your eyes here. Pick the versions of your smile that you like the best.When you perfect a smile you really like, take a selfie. This will help you remember the ones you like best once you’re done experimenting.
While taking selfies you might also consider trying out different angles (both in the camera position and how you position your face), which will help you better control how you look in photographs.

, When you need to smile for a photograph, think about a happy memory or funny story. This will help you achieve a genuine smile, even if you weren't feeling much like smiling before."

Understand why false teeth become stained.,
Avoid tobacco and cigarettes.,
Avoid tea, coffee and other brightly colored foods.",How to Keep False Teeth White3," False teeth are made from plastic (acrylic) that gets porous as time goes by. It can pick up stains from the liquids/food we eat and drink and this causes unsightly discoloration of false teeth.


The degree of staining differ from one person to another because no diet is the same.
In general, try to consume foods and liquids that are lighter in color, as they are less likely to cause any discoloration.

, When you inhale cigarette smoke, you are coating your teeth with tar and nicotine. Nicotine is the ingredient in cigarettes that is responsible for the yellow-brown stains on your teeth.


Naturally, nicotine is colorless, but once it comes into contact with oxygen, it turns to an ugly yellow stain on your teeth. This discoloration is hard to remove, even with the use of dental instruments.
Since false teeth are more porous than natural teeth, they get cigarette stains pretty easily.
Also steer clear of marijuana. Marijuana produces a greenish, circular band stains.

, Brown to black stains on your false teeth are characteristic of tea or coffee stains. Tea and coffee particles are absorbed into the pores of false teeth and cause stains.

Maintenance and Care.",How to Give Someone a Filling," Pain is sometimes experienced with tooth cavities. This occurs because of the depth of the cavity. To address pain, the patient may take over-the-counter pain relievers. These should be taken as needed and never be taken in excess.;
, The edges of tooth cavities are not always smooth; it could be jagged, rough, and sharp. The sharp edges can cause tissue trauma. There is a simple, temporary solution to this problem:


Gently run your tongue along your teeth, taking note of areas with sharpness.
Roll a small amount of dental wax, and place it over the sharp edges.
Run your tongue over the area to check for any sharpness; if there are any sharp edges left, place dental wax on the area. Repeat these steps as needed. Application of dental wax is a temporary solution; the wax will fall off during use. However, it is a simple way to prevent tissue trauma while waiting for your dental appointment.

, There are instances where a patient cannot visit their dentist for a permanent filling. During these times, the patient would feel bothered and uncomfortable because of the cavity. To address the cavity, they could use a temporary filling material which is available at most pharmacies. These come with simple instructions:


Clean the tooth. Remove any food build-up at the area.
Dry the tooth using cotton swab.
The kit would come with an applicator; using this, scoop some temporary filling material and pack the tooth cavity.
Gently bite to ensure the height of the filling.
Clean any excess material around the tooth.
Let the temporary filling set. Do not eat, drink, or bite on the area for the next 30 minutes to allow complete setting of the temporary filling.

, The above three steps are temporary ways on how to temporarily deal with your tooth cavity while waiting for a permanent filling from your dentist. A dental visit and consultation is required even if you do not feel pain or sharpness, or have filled the tooth with a temporary filling. The dentist would replace these temporary and short term solutions with a permanent and durable dental filling. A dental consultation could also prevent a serious injury or problem from occurring.

, The dentist will check the teeth that are decayed. If there is more than one decayed tooth on the same side, he can treat them in a single sitting with your consent. You will be informed about the number of cavities and the stage of decay. Depending on the extent of decay, the dentist will choose a specific filling material to best improve your oral health.


If the amount of decay is unclear, a dentist may use an x-ray or caries detecting dye to get a full understanding of the decay’s extent. Both of these methods are painless and harmless. Lasers can also be used as decayed tooth matter reflects light at a different rate than healthy tooth enamel; again, this test is painless and harmless.

, An anaesthetic gel will be applied on the area where you will receive an injection of local anaesthetic solution. The gel reduces the discomfort associated with the injection. The injection numbs the tooth and the adjoining area so that you are at ease while your tooth is being filled.

, While the numbing solution starts acting on your tooth, the rest of the mouth is covered with a rubber dam. A rubber dam is a rubber sheet that is fixed to a metal frame and placed in the mouth. A small hole is made in the sheet, and it is stretched down to the tooth that is to be filled. The idea is that it will prevent any filling material or tooth shavings from entering your throat or mouth, and help the dentist focus on the tooth that needs to be filled.

, Using a dental high speed hand piece and diamond burs, the dentist will remove any previous dental restoration. They will also remove any decayed and unsupported part of the tooth. The tooth cavity must be cleaned and only sound tooth structure should be left.

, Once the tooth has been cleaned and only sound tooth structure is left, the dentist will add additional retention features as needed. These additional retention features would help retain the permanent tooth filling in a mechanical manner. Some retention features that could be incorporated as needed are:


Convergent walls. The convergence acts as an undercut preventing dislodgement of the tooth filling in a vertical manner.
Boxes. These are usually used on the proximal sides of the tooth. It prevents dislodgement of the tooth filling to the sides.
Grooves. These help in assuring one path of insertion and removal of the tooth filling; thus, the tooth filling would not easily be dislodged. It is usually located along the sides of the prepared tooth.
Pins. These are simple tooth preparations done on the floor of the tooth. It aids in retention of the tooth filling.
Slots. These are long and slender tooth preparations done when there are insufficient walls to contain the restoration.
Before filling the tooth, the dentist will make sure that the tooth preparation is smooth and there are no rough and sharp edges. Also, they will make sure that there are no unsupported tooth structures.
Filling the tooth. After doing the tooth preparation and selection of the material, you are now ready to permanently fill the tooth with your chosen material. Remember that each material would have its own instruction on how to properly handle it.

, It is one of oldest types of dental filling material and is still a preferred one due to its superior physical properties. There are specific guidelines regarding the shape of the cavity that a dentist has to consider if the filling is of amalgam. For the filling to stay within the tooth perfectly, the tooth has to be cut in a special box shape which may involve the removal of tooth material other than the decayed part.

, This is a tooth-coloured filling material that is gaining popularity because of its aesthetic virtue. This material is applied in a layer-by-layer manner, and each layer is set by exposure to a curing light. For a composite filling, the dentist does not need to create a specific shape of the cavity.


After the complete removal of decay, the cavity is cleaned and composite resin layer is applied. Composites are an ideal type of filling material for front teeth and tougher mixtures with higher strength are available for back teeth.
Gold and porcelain fillings. Gold and porcelain are materials with extreme durability. Gold is very expensive, which is probably the only drawback of gold filling. After shaping the cavity, the dentist has to take an impression of your tooth and send it to the lab. The gold or porcelain inlay (an indirect restoration that does not exceed half of the dimensions of the tooth) or onlay (an indirect restoration that is more extensive than an inlay and covers a cusp) is prepared for your tooth and sent back. This is fixed to your tooth cavity with the help of dental cement.
Glass ionomers. These fillings are available in various mixes and consistencies; it could be thin or thick depending on the use. If used as a tooth filling, it is recommended that it has a thick consistency to ensure the durability of the filling.

, Before dismissing the patient, the dentist will check the bite and anatomy. One has to ensure that the bite is just right and the anatomy is restored. This helps bring back normal function of the tooth.


To check the bite they could:

Have the patient bite on an articulating paper. It is a coloured piece of paper that is used to take note of any areas that have a high bite.
Ask the patient for any feeling of discomfort. Because teeth are highly innervated, a patient could easily feel and sense if there are any changes in the height.


To check for anatomy:

Run a hand instrument around the tooth checking for any overhangs or catch. If there are any, these need to be adjusted and corrected using a hand piece.
Visually inspect the inclinations of the tooth (the grooves and other physical traits). It must mimic a natural tooth. These attributes function as a natural spillway for food during chewing, ensuring that chewing takes place with a natural movement of the job.



, Your dentist will ask you to avoid eating anything for about an hour or so. If you are thirsty, you can have plain water after a 30 minutes. Coloured drinks may stain your filling if it is natural-coloured, so wait for over an hour before drinking to ensure that the filling is completely set before drinking dark or bright liquids. As well, the strength of the filling may be compromised if it is disturbed before complete setting. To ensure that the filling is maintained:


Brush regularly using fluoride toothpaste
Control intake of sugar
Be careful when eating hard foods
Maintain good oral health

Brush your teeth twice a day. Use a soft or medium bristled toothbrush, and brush for at least two minutes at a time.You can also use an electric toothbrush, but always make sure you improve your brushing technique so you can maintain healthy gums.
Floss at least once a day. Use 18 inches of floss, and work the floss around each individual tooth.Rinse with water or mouthwash after flossing. If you suffer from dry mouth, use an alcohol free mouthwash.Rinse dentures after eating, and brush them at least once a day to reduce the amount of bacteria which may cause mouth ulcers or other mucosal irritation.If flossing is painful or difficult, you can use a water flosser instead, such as a waterpik. A flushes out the spaces between your teeth and around your gums with water. You can add mouthwash to the water used for the waterpik for increased protection against bacteria. They're just as effective, if not more, than traditional flossing.;
, When you brush your teeth as normal, you should also brush your tongue to remove bacteria that can cause tooth decay or bad breath. Using a brush with soft to medium bristles, move your toothbrush gently across the top surface of your tongue going from back to front.If brushing your tongue provokes your gag reflex, you can try leaning your head forward as you brush. You might also want to use a smaller toothbrush to minimize your discomfort.If you have a sore in your mouth, be careful as you brush. Avoid brushing the sore itself, and do not use a toothpaste containing sodium lauryl sulfate. Sores will normally go away on their own., Tongue scrapers are plastic tools sold in drug stores and pharmacies that remove the top coating of bacteria and plaque from your tongue. Use it once a day after you brush your teeth. Start in the back of your tongue, and gently pull the scraper forward. Rinse it off afterwards using tap water, mouthwash or even a saline solution.Avoid scraping your tongue if you have a mouth sore on your tongue. Wait until the sore heals before you scrape again.

, Your dentist can give your mouth a deep cleaning that will help prevent infections and bacterial growth. They can also diagnose infections and problems early. To keep your tongue healthy and clean, schedule a visit with your dentist at least once or twice a year.

Keep dentures, retainers, and other appliances clean.,
Check to be sure your dental hygiene routine is working.",How to Prevent Plaque1," Plaque builds up on the teeth day in and day out, whether we like it or not. The best way to deal with plaque is to brush it away using a soft-bristled toothbrush and toothpaste approved by the American Dental Association (ADA). You can find a list of approved products at the ADA website.


Brush after eating or drinking sweets.Do not brush for 30 minutes after consuming acidic drinks like coffee, orange juice, or soda, which weaken the enamel in your teeth.Never go to bed without brushing your teeth. Doing so gives the bacteria that produce plaque all night to work unimpeded.;
, If you're not brushing correctly, you may be leaving plaque on your teeth even after you've taken the time to clean them. For a thorough brushing:Brush your teeth for 2 to 3 minutes.
Brush your teeth with small circular motions or with gentle, short (tooth-wide) back and forth strokes. Do not scrub hard back and forth.
Be sure to brush the outer, inner, and chewing surfaces of your teeth.
To clean the inside surface of your front teeth, tilt the brush vertically and use up-and-down strokes.
Brush your tongue to remove bacteria and keep your breath fresh.
Pay special attention to the teeth in the back that are more difficult to reach, as these are commonly neglected.

, A poorly cleaned toothbrush can carry bacteria that contribute to plaque, while a brush that is too old will have damaged or weakened bristles that do a poor job cleaning your teeth.


Thoroughly rinse your toothbrush with tap water after use, and do not store it in a closed container, as this may lead to bacteria growth.Replace your tooth brush every 3 to 4 months, as a worn-out brush will not clean your teeth as well.Don't use a brush with hard bristles, since this can be too abrasive on your booth enamel.
Consider using an electric toothbrush, as they have been shown to be more effective than manual ones., Plaque that builds up between the teeth and against the gums cannot be reached with a toothbrush. It's important to floss every day so the plaque trapped between your teeth isn't left to harden into tartar and cause cavities. Choose from waxed, unwaxed, flavored, or tape floss, so long as it has the American Dental Association (ADA) seal of approval.


The National Institute of Health recommends flossing before brushing,but the most important thing is that you floss, regardless of when.
When you floss, use the correct technique. Start with about 18 inches of floss. Gently pull the floss between your teeth, taking care not to let it snap against your gums. Curve the floss into a “C” shape against the side of one tooth and gently rub it up and down, keeping it pressed against the tooth. Repeat on the opposite tooth. Use a clean segment of floss before inserting floss between your next two teeth. Don’t forget to floss behind your back teeth.Do not floss too hard, as this can damage your gums. While flossing may produce some discomfort when just starting, that discomfort should fade after a couple of weeks. If it continues, you are flossing too hard.If you hate the feeling of flossing, try using a mouth pick instead. It's a slender piece of plastic that fits between your teeth as an alternative to floss.

, Rinses are designed to kill the plaque that builds up in all the little parts of your mouth that are difficult to reach by brushing or flossing. They have been shown to be more effective than floss in preventing plaque build up.The active ingredient – chlorhexidine, essential oils, Delmopinol, or cetyl pyridinium chloride – does not matter; just be sure to choose a rinse that is labeled ""antimicrobial"" or ""antibacterial.""However, do not use chlorhexidine for more than two weeks. Long term use can cause your teeth to acquire brown stains which can only be removed with dental cleaning.
It does not matter if you use your mouth rinse before or after you brush and floss.
Swish a capful (about a teaspoon) of rinse around your mouth for about 30 seconds, making sure it coats your teeth, then spit it out.
In the United States, look for mouth rinses that display the American Dental Association (ADA) seal. You can find a complete list of approved plaque-control mouth rinses at the ADA website.

, Most commercially-produced toothpaste contains fluoride, which has been shown to prevent tooth decay.The low amount of fluoride in tooth paste and water poses no proven health risk to adults, but too much fluoride can affect the mental development of children. Accordingly:Do not use fluoride toothpaste in infants under 2 years of age.
Use only a pea-sized amount for children older than 2.

, Bacteria can collect on these mouth appliances and contribute to plaque, even if you are otherwise practicing good oral hygiene. Brush your dentures, retainer, or other appliances regularly and occasionally soak them in a cleansing solution to prevent buildup of bacteria., You can perform a plaque test to make sure your combination of brushing, flossing, and mouthwash is removing all the plaque from your teeth.

Examine your teeth in a mirror. Plaque that you failed to remove via brushing and flossing will be stained pink or red.
If the test shows remaining plaque, you should modify your brushing and flossing technique and repeat the test until you are sure you are removing as much plaque as possible.

Rinse a bitten or burned tongue with saltwater.,
Take proper precautions before getting your tongue pierced.,
Gargle oral antiseptics to treat stomatitis.,
Visit the doctor if the tongue becomes discolored.",How to Have a Healthy Tongue3," If your mouth consistently feels dry, prickly, or dehydrated, you may suffer from dry mouth. Certain medications, medical procedures, or conditions can cause this. You might find that certain dental products worsen the problem or irritate your mouth.


See your dentist first. Dry mouth is a serious problem that requires medical attention. Your dentist may prescribe you some collutory (a special rinsing solution) to help alleviate pain and other symptoms. You will also need to see your GP, for a referral to a specialist
Ask your dentist about what you should avoid. For example, spicy foods can dry out your mouth more and cause irritation, so you may want to avoid these. Also, mint-flavored mouthwashes, toothpastes, or candies can irritate a dry mouth., If you have bitten or burned your tongue, a saltwater rinse can reduce pain while killing harmful bacteria in your mouth.Dissolve a teaspoon of salt in eight-ounces of warm water, and gargle with it for up to 30 seconds. Spit the water out in a sink; do not swallow it.If you have a cut on your tongue larger than 1 cm, you should have it checked out by a doctor or dentist., Tongue piercings can be stylish, but they present significant risk to your mouth. Before you get a tongue piercing, you should make sure that you are having it done at a clean, licensed shop. Read local reviews to make sure that your piercer is skilled and highly rated. After the piercing, call a doctor if you notice any signs of infection, pain, swelling, or red streaks around the piercing.Before the piercing, make sure that you are up to date on your Hepatitis B and tetanus vaccines. You should ask the piercer if everyone in the shop has been properly vaccinated for Hepatitis B.Once your tongue is pierced, rinse your mouth after every meal with an alcohol-free mouthwash or saltwater. Avoid spicy, salty, or acidic foods, and do not kiss anyone until your piercing heals.You may also take some over the counter pills such as Ibuprofen to reduce the tongue inflammation.
Avoid habits such as holding the piercing between your teeth because you can hurt your tongue and destroy the enamel

, Mouth sores and painful bumps may be a sign of stomatitis. Stomatitis can be caused by chemotherapy, radiotherapy, herpes, or loose dentures. While you should see a doctor about potential stomatitis, you can reduce the discomfort using a few simple mouthwashes. Hold a mouthful of the rinse in your mouth, and swish it back and forth. Spit it back out into the sink. You should not swallow mouthwash. Some recommended rinses include:Club soda
Alcohol-free mouthwash
Benzydamine hydrochloride
Lidocaine Viscous (typically used for severe cases caused by chemotherapy)

, Your tongue should be a consistent pink color. Discoloration is the first sign of disease or sickness, so check your tongue everyday to make sure that it is the right color.


A black, lumpy tongue may be a sign of “hairy tongue” disease. This can be caused by certain medications or by smoking. Hairy tongue can give you bad breath. It might also distort your taste perception.If your tongue is bright red, you may have a Vitamin B-12 or folic acid deficiency. If it is accompanied by a fever, you might have scarlet fever or Kawasaki disease. Seek immediate medical attention.Alternating patches of red and white may be geographic tongue, which is a genetic condition. While people with geographic tongue may be sensitive to spicy foods, the condition is otherwise harmless.Lumps on your tongue may be canker sores or mouth ulcers. If they do not disappear after two weeks, visit your dentist to be checked for oral cancer."

Avoid sugary and starchy foods.,
Avoid things that dry out your mouth.,
Eat crunchy fruits and vegetables.,
Consume healthy foods that stimulate saliva flow.,
Drink green and black teas.,
Drink water.,
Do not smoke or chew tobacco.",How to Prevent Plaque2," Plaque requires carbohydrates to form, so to prevent the buildup of plaque, nothing beats saying ""no"" to food products that contain sugar or starch. If you're serious about preventing plaque from forming, try to limit the following items, especially later in the day when you're about to go to bed:Sweets – If you do eat them, go for ones that clear your mouth quickly like cookies, chocolate, or ice cream. The worst sweets are those that stay in your mouth for a long time, like lollipops, caramels, or cough drops that contain sugar.
Carbonated soft drinks – They are the leading cause of tooth decay because they contain lots of sugar, plus phosphoric and citric acids, which wear away tooth enamel. If you do drink soft drinks, using a straw positioned towards the back of the mouth can reduce their impact.Starchy foods that get stuck in your mouth – Starches that get trapped between your teeth, such as soft bread, potato chips, or dried fruit, allow much more time for plaque build up than starches that pass quickly through the mouth, like baked potatoes.
If you do eat any of the above, try to do so with a meal, as the saliva production from eating will help combat plaque formation., Saliva helps prevent plaque, so you don’t want a dry mouth, which can be caused by alcohol or medicines. If medicine is causing your dry mouth, talk to your dentist about getting fluoride rinse to protect your teeth.Many antihypertensive, antidepressant, and antihistamine medications can cause or worsen dry mouth.If you take any medication and experience dry mouth, pay special attention to caring for your teeth.

, You can clean plaque off of your teeth throughout the day without ever pulling out a toothbrush. Crunchy fruits and vegetables like carrots, apples, and pears gently scrape the plaque from your teeth as you eat and also stimulate saliva which reduces the impact of plaque producing bacteria.If you feel a film on your teeth and you don't have a toothbrush handy, try taking a big bite out of an apple with the skin on for instant results.

, Saliva acts as a natural cleanser for your teeth, washing away the plaque. Choose foods that make you salivate as a way to keep plaque away during the day.


Dairy products such as milk and cheese are great for stimulating the production of saliva; plus, they contain calcium and other minerals that help to strengthen your teeth.Sugarless chewing gum is another great saliva producer, which also removes food particles from your mouth. The optimal time to chew is 1 minute, after which bacteria begin to be released back into the mouth from the gum., Both kinds contain polyphenols – compounds that inhibit or kill the bacteria that produce plaque. Brewing your tea in tap water rich with fluoride will further protect your teeth., Drinking water will keep you hydrated so you produce plenty of saliva, as well as helping to clean out your mouth. When your teeth are feeling less-than-clean, try swishing water around your mouth, spitting it out, then taking a long drink. Most tap water also contains fluoride, which will help to protect your teeth from plaque.

, Smoking does not directly contribute to plaque, but it does heighten the negative impact of any plaque you develop.Studies show that smoking increases the risk of tooth lossand periodontal disease.Chewing tobacco has similar effects due to its nicotine content, as well as directly yellowing teeth.

You should visit the dentist more often if you have a history of cavities, wear braces, smoke or chew tobacco, are diabetic, or have a suppressed immune system., Scaling is the removal of tartar, particularly along the gum line, which is usually done using hand instruments (scrapers) if tartar is light, or ultrasonic instruments if heavier. Planing uses similar instruments to smooth out your teeth so there are fewer surfaces for bacteria to attach to., If you have not visited the dentist for several years, plaque and tartar may have built up on your teeth to the extent that you need debridement – the removal of large amounts of plaque and tartar through high-pressure water and high-frequency sound vibrations., If you have large amounts of plaque and tartar that have led to periodontal (gum) disease, your dentist can prescribe topical antibiotics or try other procedures like photodynamic therapy in order to kill the bacteria that cause plaque."

A skin test in which the doctor will prick your skin, inserting a small amount of the potential allergens under your skin.",How to Improve Your Digestive Health," Fiber is made up of the parts of plant foods that your body can't digest, but instead pass without absorbing. Most people get only a small portion of the 20 to 40 mg of fiber that is recommended for healthy digestion. Your body needs both soluble fiber, which dissolves in water to form a gel-like consistency, and insoluble fiber, which does not dissolve in water.Get more soluble fiber by eating more oats, peas, beans, apples, citrus fruits, carrots, and barley. This will also help control your cholesterol and blood sugar levels.
Eat more insoluble fiber by adding whole-wheat flour, wheat bran, nuts, beans, and vegetables like cauliflower and green beans to your diet. Increasing your intake of insoluble fiber will help keep your bowel movements regular and combat constipation.
Many plant foods contain both soluble and insoluble fibers, so you can easily maximize your intake of both by eating a diet filled with diverse grains and vegetables.
High fiber foods are generally low in calories and they will also help you control your weight, lower your blood sugar and cholesterol levels, and reduce your risk of hemorrhoids.;
, The combination of high fiber and water will increase the efficiency of your digestion by helping to soften and break down foods so your body can absorb the nutrients. It will also soften your stool and make regular bowl movements easier.Doctors sometimes recommend eight 8-oz. glasses per day (1.9 l), but the amount you need will vary with your body weight, how active you are, and what climate you live in.
If you get headaches in the evening, feel tired, lightheaded, nauseous, and sweat very little even when it is hot, you might need to drink more water.Other signs of dehydration include reduced urine output and urine that is darker than usual., A healthy digestive tract has many species of microorganisms which help break down food. Eating fermented products like yogurt, kefir, kimchi, natural sauerkraut, temphe and kombucha will help replenish and balance the bacterial community in your digestive system.Not only will this combat diarrhea and constipation, but it may also improve or prevent several other health conditions:


Diarrhea after antibiotics have killed some of the naturally occurring gut bacteria
Irritable bowel syndrome
Vaginal yeast infections and urinary tract infections
Colds and flu

, It is best to do this in consultation with a doctor because supplements may alter how your body absorbs some medications. A doctor will help you adjust the dosages to be right for you.


Take prebiotic supplements. These supplements will help you get enough fiber in your diet, promote the growth of healthy gut bacteria, and alleviate constipation.You should make sure you area also eating prebiotic foods such as oatmeal or berries.
Try probiotics. Probiotics are bacteria and yeasts that are similar to those naturally occurring in your digestive tract and aid digestion. Probiotic supplements can help treat diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, and ulcers.Add essential vitamins to your diet. Essential vitamins are those that your body needs to function properly. They include A, B, C, and D vitamins. Adequate vitamin levels are necessary for your body to process proteins, carbohydrates, and fatty acids, absorb iron, and maintain immune functions. Supplements can help you avoid deficiencies., Not only can these substances cause stomachaches in high quantities, but they slow digestion, causing constipation.


Eat less prepackaged, processed foods. They often have high quantities of sugar, as well as salt and fat, added to them. They will also prevent you from being hungry for healthier foods, like high fiber foods., What is good for the entire body is good for the digestive system. Exercise will reduce stress, control your weight, and help your intestines to contract normally, moving food through your system.The activity should be strenuous enough to increase your heart rate. Do something you enjoy like fast walking, jogging, or biking.
If you have other health concerns like high blood pressure or heart problems, discuss any new exercise plans with your doctor before starting.

, This will prevent you from getting extremely hungry and eating too much.Eat slowly to give your body time to register that you have eaten and signal to you that you are no longer hungry. Eating too fast makes it more likely that you will eat larger amounts before you realize you are full, causing uncomfortable stomach stretching and painful bloating.
Eat these small meals at the same time every day so that your body can anticipate the meal and physiologically prepare.

, What foods people don't tolerate may vary greatly from person to person.Try keeping a food diary to discover if there are any foods that upset your GI system.

Types of foods that are frequent triggers include:


Fatty foods like cheese, deep-fried foods, and fast food
Highly acidic foods including coffee, tea, tomatoes, vinegar, and citrus fruits (lemons, limes, grapefruits)
Gassy foods such as beans, cabbage, or carbonated drinks
Spicy foods
Gluten/wheat
Dairy, soy, corn, and fructose

, Salt causes your body to retain water, making you feel bloated. , People who are lactose intolerant do not produce enough of the lactase enzyme and so cannot digest lactose, the sugar found in milk and other dairy products. Symptoms include bloating, cramping, gas, diarrhea, and nausea 30 minutes to two hours after consuming milk products.
If these symptoms occur, try avoiding milk, cheese, ice cream and other milk products.
Thoroughly boil milk before drinking it. This will break down the lactose.
Take lactase capsules before eating milk products. The capsules will supply you with the necessary enzyme for digesting the milk.
Substitute milk with products that don't have lactose, like soy or rice milk.

, Avoiding eating late at night or right before bed often helps people reduce acid reflux and heartburn.


Frequent, small meals keeps your digestive system busy without overloading it.

, These proteins are essential for healthy muscles, but lean cuts are less likely to cause heartburn and will be quicker to digest.

, Smoking can damage the valve at the bottom of the esophagus leading to frequent heartburn.


Stopping smoking will also reduce your risks of ulcers and cancers, including those of the digestive system., Excessive drinking can lead to inflammation of the stomach lining, ulcers, cramping, bleeding, abdominal pain, heartburn and acid reflux. Other organs involved in digestion such as the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder may also be damaged., Caffeine may cause an increase in acidity in the stomach that can lead to high levels of heartburn and acid reflux.

, Stress has been shown to cause weight gain, constipation, diarrhea and a lowered immune system. It will leave you prone to the h. pylori bacteria that causes ulcers.



Yoga, meditation, massage, baths and other relaxation techniques can help you to handle stress and inadvertently help your digestion.
Regular exercise will also release endorphins and help you relax.

, See a doctor right away if you show any of the following symptoms:Severe heartburn that is not helped by medication
Incontinence
Diarrhea or constipation that doesn't go away
Abdominal pain that interferes with your daily life

, If you are having GI issues, it's important you take a look at your poop before visiting the doctor, as this can actually provide him with a lot of information. You can look at a Bristol Stool Scale to determine what kind of poop you have and how to describe it and talk about it with your doctor. This information can help your doctor determine how quickly food is passing through your body and may give clues toward certain digestive problems., This is a physician who specializes in the gastrointestinal tract and liver. A Gastroenterologist can determine if you have reflux, motility problems, colon polyps, gallbladder disease or an infection, for which she can test with endoscopy and biopsy.

, If you are allergic, you will probably develop a raised bump.
An elimination diet in which you stop eating all foods you suspect to be allergens for one to two weeks (until the symptoms disappear). Then you add the food items slowly back into your diet, one by one. When the symptoms return, you know that that food is triggering your digestive problems.
A blood test to measure your immune response to various foods.
An oral food challenge in which the doctor will monitor your reaction as you eat foods that are potential allergens.

, Jaundice may cause your skin to become very itchy because of the increased level of toxins accumulating in your blood vessels during the break down of bile, to which bilirubin binds in the liver.Itchiness may be related to underlying bile duct obstruction or cirrhosis of the liver.The bile ducts carry bile away from the liver to the gallbladder and may get blocked by gallstones.Cirrhosis of the liver is a condition in which the liver is damaged to the point that normal healthy liver tissue is replaced with non-functioning scar tissue and is caused by hepatitis, alcoholism, and other liver disorders., Called spider angiomas, your skin may develop these small markings because the underlying process causing the jaundice is likely also causing increased blood flowing through your blood vessels. This makes the blood vessels very noticeable under your skin.Spider angiomas are not a direct result of the jaundice itself but often occur simultaneously.
These spider vessels blanch when you press on them and most frequently occur on the upper body including the trunk, arms, hands, neck, and face., Small, reddish and purple spots may appear on your skin, indicating that you might be bleeding under the skin. This occurs because because of liver damage causing problems with blood clotting, as your liver normally makes substances that helps your blood clot. There is also increased efficiency in the breakdown of red blood cells and blood formation in the body that can cause you to bleed more easily., If you have jaundice, you may notice that you have a tendency to bruise more easily than normal. You may also find that if you get a cut, the blood takes a longer time to clot.This symptom is also related to a damaged liver not being able to make the substances that help with blood clotting.

Drink plenty of water.,
Increase your fiber intake.,
Eat lean meats.,
Avoid foods that are hard to digest.,
Eat smaller meals.,
Add natural herbs to your diet.,
Replenish your gut with good bacteria.",How to Improve Digestion1," Hydration is essential for healthy digestion, so be sure to drink lots of water throughout the day.Keep in mind that alcohol and caffeine can actually cause dehydration, so drink them in moderation.
You should drink water all day, but drinking during and right after you eat is especially helpful for digestion.;
, Fiber helps regulate your digestion, so it’s important to eat foods that are naturally fiber-rich, like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.There are two types of fiber, soluble and insoluble, and they play very different roles in digestion.


Soluble fiber (found in oatmeal, nuts, beans, apples) absorbs water, while insoluble fiber (found in celery, whole wheat, the skins of fruit) does not. Increasing your soluble fiber intake can help with issues like diarrhea and can bulk up your stool; increasing your insoluble fiber can help with issues like constipation and hemorrhoids.If you plan on adding more fiber into your diet, do so slowly. Adding a lot of fiber all at once can cause digestive issues like bloating and gas.
While most whole grains are good for you, you should stay away from wheat products if you are gluten intolerant.Cabbage is a fiber-rich food that is especially beneficial for digestion.Our bodies can’t process all types of fiber easily. For example, corn contains cellulose, which is a type of fiber that is very difficult for the human body to process. If you eat corn, make sure to chew it thoroughly to help your body break it down better.If you suffer from gas, you may actually want to consider temporarily reducing the amount of fiber in your diet. Do so slowly and pay attention to whether or not the change in diet has any effect on your digestive issues. You should then begin reintroducing fiber little by little., Leaner proteins, like chicken and fish, are much easier for your body to digest than fatty proteins, like beef., Some foods are just more difficult for your body to process, so it’s best to stay away from them as much as possible, especially if you have digestive issues. Avoid fried foods, foods that are high in fat, and spicy foods.It’s also very important to stay away from dairy products if you’re lactose intolerant.

, Large meals may overwhelm your digestive system, so try eating several smaller meals throughout the day — five or six small meals instead of three large ones.Eating more slowly may also help improve your digestion because it will prevent you from overeating and encourage you to chew your food more thoroughly., Small amounts of ginger are thought to be very good for promoting digestive health.Bitter herbs like beet leaf, dandelion, milk thistle, and artichoke are also beneficial for digestion, and can be consumed in a salad or in an herbal tea., Certain kinds of bacteria are beneficial to your digestive system. One of the easiest ways you can increase the levels of healthy bacteria in your gut is to eat foods like yogurt or kefir that contain live cultures."

Keep track of the color of your stool.,
Watch the frequency and color of your urine.,
Feel to see if your abdomen is swollen.,
Look for swollen ankles, feet and legs.,
Check your temperature for fever.,
Monitor your baby’s behavior.,
Ask for a jaundice bilirubin test.,
Notice other signs of severe liver disease.",How to Identify Symptoms of Jaundice2," Your stool may change color and become very pale if you have jaundice. This change occurs because when you have jaundice, there may be a duct blockage causing reduced bilirubin in your stool, leaving most of it to be excreted in your urine.Most bilirubin is normally excreted in your stool.
Your stool may even be grey if you have severe obstruction.your stool may have blood in it or be black if you are having bleeding complications from liver disease.

, Bilirubin is also normally excreted in your urine, though less than is normally in your stool. When you have jaundice, however, your urine becomes darker because of the higher levels of bilirubin being excreted by this means.You may also notice that you end up peeing less each time you go to the bathroom. Be sure to track how frequently you go, whether you pee a lot or a little each time, and what color your urine is so you can tell your doctor.
Urine changes may occur before skin colouration changes so remember to tell your doctor when you first started noticing your urine getting darker.
Newborn baby urine should be clear. If your baby has jaundice, you can expect his urine to be darker yellow., If you have jaundice, your liver and spleen may become enlarged, which in turn can cause your abdomen to become distended.In addition, liver disease may cause fluid to build up in your abdomen.


A swollen abdomen is usually a later sign of an illness that also causes jaundice, and is not caused by the jaundice itself.You may also experience abdominal pain because the underlying illness could cause your liver to become infected or inflamed.

, An illness that causes jaundice might also cause you to have swollen ankles, feet and legs.The liver helps in the excretion of bilirubin in urine and, when its function is interfered with, or if there is excess pressure in the circulation associated with the liver, fluid accumulates in different parts of the body, causing swelling.

, Jaundice can cause you to have a fever of 38C (100.4F) and higher.The reason for the fever may be due to an underlying liver infection (such as hepatitis) or bile duct obstruction., Your baby may have other symptoms such as a shrill, high-pitched cry, being inconsolable, refusing to feed, and being floppy or difficult to wake.If you are discharged from hospital with baby less than 72 hours after birth, you may want to book a follow-up appointment to see your doctor in the next two days to check for infant jaundice.
Severe infant jaundice left untreated can cause permanent brain damage., The most accurate way to tell if you or your baby has jaundice is to have your blood tested for elevated bilirubin levels.If the bilirubin is elevated, your doctor may perform other tests to determine the cause of the jaundice, look for any complications, and to look at how well the liver is functioning.


Babies may also have a skin test called a transcutaneous bilirubin test. A special probe is placed up against baby’s skin and measures the reflection of a special light shining through or being absorbed. This allows the doctor to calculate the amount of bilirubin present.

, Symptoms may include weight loss, nausea and vomiting, or vomiting blood.

Look at your dog or cat’s skin.,
Monitor urine and stool output.,
Watch your pet’s eating habits.,
Observe your pet’s behavior.",How to Identify Symptoms of Jaundice3," Though it may be harder to see on some breeds, all dogs and cats can get jaundiced yellowish skin.Check the gums, whites of the eyes, base of the ears, nostrils, abdomen, and genitals, as the jaundice may be more noticeable in these areas.If you suspect your pet has jaundice, take him to a vet for immediate examination. If you pet has jaundice, he has an underlying illness, such as hepatitis or other liver problems, that will require veterinary treatment or it could become fatal.

, As with humans, your pet’s urine may be darker due to increased bilirubin being excreted. Unlike humans, the pet’s stool may also be darker and orange colored.Your pet may urinate more than usual.

, Pets with jaundice may be excessively thirsty but lack an appetite, and suffer weight loss while having abdominal distension. These are all symptoms that coincide with jaundice to reflect an underlying illness., As with humans, your pet may be lethargic and have difficulty breathing, also due to the underlying illness."

Talk to your doctor about all medications.,
Consider probiotics.,
Try supplements.,
Take over-the-counter remedies.,
Get a prescription.",How to Improve Digestion2," There are a wide variety of medications out there, both prescription and over-the-counter, that may be able to help you improve your digestion. It's important to remember, however, that medications, even herbal supplements, can interact with one another. Be sure to talk to you doctor about all of the medications you take., If eating foods that are rich in probiotics is not improving your digestion, consider taking an over-the-counter probiotic. These formulas help increase the amount of healthy bacteria in your digestive system., Popular over-the-counter supplements that may help improve your digestion include probiotics, licorice, peppermint oil, chamomile, ginger, L-Glutamine, psyllium, and artichoke.Enzyme supplements are also available over-the-counter. These may help with minor digestive issues, but they have not been tested the way prescription medications have. There is also a small risk for side effects related to these medications, although the side effects are typically minor.Again, you'll want to speak with your doctor before trying these supplements.

, There are many over-the-counter medications available for the relief of occasional digestive issues like heartburn or diarrhea.If you tend to have gas when you eat foods that are high in fiber, try taking a medication like Beano when you eat these foods., If one of the organs that makes up your digestive system is not functioning correctly, you will likely be prescribed medication by your doctor. For example, a patient whose pancreas does not produce the proper enzymes may be prescribed an enzyme supplement."
