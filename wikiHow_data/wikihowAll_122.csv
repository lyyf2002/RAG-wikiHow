Keep track of any digestive issues you experience each day as well. Once you do this for a while, you may start to notice patterns.Common foods that trigger digestive problems include dairy, coffee, and carbonated beverages.
Fruit juices can be a common trigger as well. Foods with high amounts of simple sugars are osmotically active and pull water into the bowel, causing diarrhea. This is especially seen in children.

, In order to avoid introducing unhealthy bacteria into your digestive system, make sure to always thoroughly wash your hands with warm water and soap after you use the bathroom and before you eat., You can prevent food poisoning by thoroughly cooking meat and eggs, washing produce, storing all foods at the proper temperature, checking expiration dates, and avoiding unpasteurized dairy products and cider., Stress can trigger digestive issues for many people, so try to combat it by pursuing relaxing hobbies.Yoga and meditation are relaxing for many people, but if these don’t appeal to you, you can choose any hobby that helps you feel relaxed.

, Getting your body moving can help stimulate digestion. Try taking a short walk after you eat.Exercise is also important to help you maintain a healthy weight, which is important for optimal digestive health.Aerobic exercises like running and dancing are great for relieving constipation.Certain yoga poses, especially twists and forward bends, which massage the digestive organs, can help improve digestion.Give yourself some time to digest before engaging in any strenuous exercises, or you might experience symptoms like bloating and cramping., In addition to the many other known health risks, smoking can cause or aggravate a variety of digestive issues, including heartburn, GERD, Crohn’s disease, pancreatitis, gallstones, colon polyps, and peptic ulcers. Smoking also increases the risk of many different cancers of the digestive system, like colon and liver cancers.You may experience immediate relief from some of your digestive ailments when you quit smoking. Your risk of developing chronic digestive conditions will also decrease over time after you quit.

, If your digestive problems are severe or if they don’t improve at all with diet and lifestyle changes, you may have a medical condition that requires treatment, so see your doctor. You should make an appointment right away if you have any of the following symptoms:


Persistent diarrhea
Persistent or severe abdominal pain
Bloody stools
Changes in the color or frequency of stools
Unintended weight loss
Chest pain

Be aware of underlying conditions.",How to Heal Damage from Acid Reflux," Fried foods, fatty foods, alcoholic beverages, tomatoes, and caffeinated drinks such as coffee, tea, and soda can increase the acid levels within the stomach. Try to take away these foods and liquids from your diet so that your esophagus can heal.


There are other dietary restrictions as well. Dairy products, such as whole milk, cheese, butter, and sour cream, are also to be avoided. Also avoid food containing peppermint or spearmint. There are also fruits you should avoid as well, such as oranges, lemons, lime, grapefruit, and pineapples.If you do find yourself consuming these foods, drink plenty of water and eat approved foods to dilute their acidic powers.;
, Create five to seven divided meals a day and avoid eating two to three hours before bedtime. The esophageal sphincter of the stomach relaxes when the stomach gets too full, bringing the hydrochloric acid up into the esophageal walls. In other words, if you eat too much, your esophagus will let you know. It's best to avoid it by eating smaller meals more often.


Most of us frequently have this issue out at restaurants. At home it isn't so bad, but at restaurants it's just so tempting to finish what's in front of you, which is often too much. To avoid the impending disaster, box up half of your meal at the very beginning. You can take it home to eat later later., There are a few foods you should be eating every day to combat acid reflux. These include:



Oatmeal. Oatmeal makes you feel full without causing reflux. It also absorbs the acid in fruits if you add a small amount. This will considerably aid in lowering the acidity in the stomach.

Ginger. Ginger contains anti-inflammatory ingredients to help treat various gastrointestinal problems. Peel or slice ginger roots and add it to your favorite recipes.

Green vegetables. Green leafy vegetable contain low calories and zero saturated fat. It’s the most recommended diet for patients suffering from acid reflux. Just be sure to stay away from using tomatoes, onions, cheese, and high-fat salad dressing. Try asparagus, cauliflower, parsley, and other green vegetables.

White meat. Red meats such as steak and beef are hard to digest, so go for chicken and turkey meats instead. Chicken makes good soup, too. The chicken skin contains high fats, though, so remove it before cooking. Poultry meats can be boiled or grilled; avoid eating them fried.

Seafood. Just like poultry, fish, shrimp and other seafood also help avoid acid reflux. Just don’t fry them. Seafood is easily digested and is very low in fat and therefore helps prevent reflux and avoid heartburn., You should be drinking eight to 12 glasses of water every day to prevent dehydration. It will help dilute the acid contents found in your stomach and gut, making it less acidic. And your hair, skin, nails, and organs will benefit, too., Obesity and excess weight are among the major risk factors of having acid reflux. Start an exercise program that focuses on simple exercises that can help burn calories and start eating healthier. A thirty minute walk in the park can burn up to 100 calories. Dieting doesn't mean you have to starve yourself. Try to exercise more, eat smaller amounts per day, and eat more low caloric food that are better for you. You don't have to go hungry.


Having an active lifestyle can fight off heart disease, diabetes, and a number of other health issues as well. Focus on leisure activities like dancing, horseback rides, or golf. It’s fun to burn calories while doing what you love. Then, slowly increase your physical activity as you get stronger.
Determine your body mass index and start losing weight. The normal body mass index (BMI) range from 18.5 to 24.9. This will help you determine if your weight is currently on the normal range. You can manually calculate your BMI by dividing your body weight in kilograms by your height in meters squared, or you could use an online guide or calculator.Count your daily required calories and track the food that you eat. A total of 3500 calories is equivalent to 1 pound. So if you plan to lose 1 pound per week, you need to cut 500 calories from your daily required caloric intake.

, Smoking irritates the esophageal lining which causes more inflammation and pain. If you can’t stop smoking you should gradually decrease the amount you smoke per day. If your overall health wasn't reason enough, do it to make the everyday acid-reflux free.


Drinking beer and other carbonated beverages can also cause harm to the linings of the esophagus and stomach. It is best to have total abstinence from smoking and drinking., You should elevate the head of your bed using pillows by about six to eight inches (15 to 20 cm). Improvement of symptoms can be resolved when the upper body is elevated. It will prevent reflux of acid or any gastric contents while sleeping.


While you're at it, get enough sleep, too. Having enough rest and enough hours of sleep will allow your body to relax, repair, and build up damaged tissues and muscles in the body. Muscle and tissue repairs happen when the body is at rest or in a sleeping state. Enough sleep is at least seven to eight hours per day., Although is may seem counter-intuitive considering that acidic foods are definitely not recommended for acid reflux, the acetic acid which is the main ingredient of apple cider vinegar is a weaker acid compared to the hydrochloric acid being produced in the stomach. Consuming this kind of acid tends to balance the acid production in your stomach and allows it to reach neutral acid levels.


Apple cider vinegar is available in many grocery stores and supermarkets. Mix one to two tablespoons with eight ounces of water before meals. You may also add a teaspoon of honey to improve its taste.
Apple cider vinegar makes tasty vegetable salad dressing, too., You can mix a ½ teaspoon of baking soda in a glass of water as a natural antacid. Knowing that baking soda is a base, it will help to neutralize the acidity in the stomach.


Take precaution when using baking soda, however, because this is high in sodium. Too much sodium is definitely not a good thing, especially for acid reflux., Aloe vera gel and leaves can be made into juice. Aloe vera contains glycoprotein, which is an essential healing property to reduce esophageal irritation and polysaccharides to promote tissue repair. Aloe vera is one of the medicinal plants approved by the Food and Drug Administration.


Drink two to three ounces of aloe vera juice in an empty stomach or 20 minutes before a meal to treat acid reflux.
Be careful not to use this remedy too much because it's a known laxative., Ginger contains natural anti-inflammatory ingredients while honey coats the esophageal walls, preventing cell inflammation. Add two to four grams of ginger powder in hot water to make tea. You can also cut a regular size piece of ginger root into bits and bring it to boil. Add a teaspoon or more of honey to taste.Make sure it's not too hot. You don't want to burn your esophagus.

, For 30 minutes after a meal, chew a piece of sugarless gum. This will increase saliva production and will help neutralize the acid in the stomach. Also, the acid in the gut will be excreted due to a large amount of saliva that was ingested., For centuries, the roots of the licorice plant have been used for cuisines and for medicine. You can also try deglycyrrhizinated licorice, which is a tablet that you can chew about 15 minutes before you eat to protect the lining of your stomach and esophagus and prevent future acid reflux.


Licorice increases the number of mucous secreting cells in the stomach and enhances the life of intestinal cells as well. Likewise, it improves the microcirculation in the gastrointestinal tract., Antacids neutralize acids in the stomach. Moreover, they help build mucous secretions and bicarbonate, which, in turn, increases your stomach's pH levels, which makes it less acidic. Tums and Gaviscon are well-known antacid brands.


These are more of a crutch than anything and won't fight long-term acid reflux. While they're great in the here and now, you should seek other methods of treatment so you don't have to rely on antacids for long periods of time., H2 antagonists prevent the histamine at H2 receptors, thereby reducing the gastric acid secretion within the stomach. They prevent new stomach acid from forming, so the stomach and esophagus can heal and you can be free of acid reflux symptoms. Zantac, Tagamet, and Pepcid are few examples of H2 receptor antagonists.Famotidine (Pepcid) is available in 20mg and 40mg. You can take 20mg twice daily for six weeks.
Nizatidine (Axid) is available in 150mg and 300mg. You can take 150mg twice daily.
Ranitidine (Zantac) is available in 150mg and 300mg. You can take 150mg twice daily., Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are medications that decrease the acid production by blocking the enzyme in the stomach walls that produces acid. These medications include omeprazole, lansoprazole, and pantoprazole.Lansoprazole (Prevacid) is an over-the-counter PPI, available in 15 and 30mg. You can take 15mg once daily for eight weeks.
Esomeprazole (Nexium) and pantoprazole (Protonix) require a prescription. Your doctor will determine the course of these drugs.
Omeprazole (Prilosec) is an OTC PPI, available in 10mg, 20mg, and 40mg. You can take 20mg once daily for four weeks., You can prokinetic medication as a way to advance gastric emptying. All require a prescription and should only be taken if your doctor thinks it's appropriate for your case. The medications under this classification include:


Bethanechol (Urecholine)
Domperidone (Motilium)
Metoclopramide (Reglan), Surgical intervention comes in when medications and medical management can no longer treat or heal acid reflux. It also is suggested often for patients who suffer from severe acid reflux. It is the only method that can cure the cause of acid reflux instead of just treating the symptoms. Often, even if medications and lifestyle changes help, acid reflux returns once these methods are stopped. This causes many to consider surgery. The surgery for acid reflux is a minimally invasive surgical procedure called Nissen Fundoplication. This procedure involves wrapping a portion of the gastric fundus, or stomach, around the esophageal sphincter.


There is a new surgical procedure that doesn't use incisions and instead goes through the mouth. This greatly reduces the recovery time from the surgery and has the same outcome., If your acid reflux has caused extensive damage to your esophagus, such as erosive esophagitis, Barrett’s Esophagus, or esophageal cancer, your doctor will recommend a series of treatments that depend on the severity of your condition. In these cases, an endoscopy is often done to assess the damage to the esophagus. Depending on how bad your case is, the doctor may consider keeping an eye on the damage, performing an biopsy to test for cancerous cells, or giving you medication.


In cases where cancer or other advanced conditions are found, other surgical procedures, such as radiofrequency ablation, may be performed., Gastroesophageal Reflux Disorder, also known as GERD or acid reflux, is a disorder is which contents from your stomach and intestines enter your esophagus. The acid from the stomach migrates upwards past your lower esophagus, causing a burning pain and, at times, actual erosion of the tissue of the esophagus. Approximately 25 to 35% of Americans are affected acid reflux. It is uncomfortable and quite painful in some cases.


The discomfort can be assessed on a spectrum from just mild burning to a severe burning chest pain, mimicking a heart attack.
The pain of acid reflux is brought on by the gastric fluid, which has a very low acidic pH. It migrates up the esophagus and finds its way into an environment where it doesn’t belong and is not intended to be, such as your esophagus., The migration of gastric fluid that causes acid reflux can be caused by a loose lower esophageal sphincter (LES). It can also be due to gravity, which can take effect if you lie down right after a meal. Acid reflux can also be caused by overeating and applying too much pressure to the LES, forcing the stomach contents back past the sphincter.


Other situations that may cause acid reflux are smoking, obesity, high intake of sodium, low intake of dietary fiber, limited physical exercise, and taking certain medications., There are multiple underlying conditions that can cause or be caused by acid reflux. Other conditions that can lead to acid reflux are pregnancy and a hiatal hernia, which is where a hole in the diaphragm allows the upper portion of the stomach to enter the chest cavity.Acid reflux can cause other conditions, such as a condition called Barrett’s Esophagus.
Ask your doctor if you think your acid reflux has an underlying conditional cause or if you think it is causing more serious problems."

Avoid foods that irritate your stomach.",How to Improve Digestive Health with Fermented Foods," Studies have linked fermented beans like tempeh (fermented soybeans) with improvements in bowel and menopausal health. Tempeh may also protect your heart against disease and protect you from some cancers.More research is needed to determine a daily recommended intake,but you should start by just including tempeh in your diet.


Tempeh is also a complete protein which means it has all the amino acids your body needs to make more protein. It also has antibacterial properties.;
, Vegetables are easy to ferment and they're easy to find in many grocery stores. Some popular choices include sauerkraut (fermented cabbage), kimchee (fermented Korean cabbage), and pickles (fermented cucumbers).


Research has shown that kimchee can prevent constipation, improve colorectal health, and has probiotic properties., Miso can be made from a combination of fermented barley and soy beans. Eat miso every day to improve intestinal function.Miso provides one of the major flavor compounds of umami, but it should be used in small doses since it is high in sodium.


While you can eat miso soup, you can also try substituting miso in place of chicken or vegetable stock when cooking.
Don't forget that you can cook with vinegar, which is a good fermented food base.

, There are several good options for adding fermented dairy to your diet. Yogurt is fermented milk with active probiotic bacteria. Kefir is fermented milk that's also very high in calcium. Kefir may also be used to treat lactose intolerance and improve digestion.You can also try seed cheese which is a fermented vegan cheese that's made from a variety of seeds (including sunflower and pumpkin seeds).


While yogurt has many health benefits, make sure to choose yogurt that contains live active cultures and is low in added sugar.

, Fermented tea is known as kombucha. It's a slightly sweetened black or green tea that's been fermented and often contains fruit and spices. It's not actually carbonated, but does have a natural effervescence. Studies suggest that kombucha may be effective in regulating blood sugar and treating diabetes.You can purchase a kombucha starter (""scoby"") at a health food store.
Once you have made kombucha, keep ½ cup of “starter” to add instead of the vinegar.

, Fermented foods contain digestive enzymes and bacteria that is needed to help your body make vitamins (like B vitamins, vitamin K, and minerals) and neurotransmitters (like serotonin). These neurotransmitters can affect mood and they train your immune system to respond to dangerous bacteria, viruses, and other infectious organisms. Digestive bacteria may improve your overall health by reducing the risk of disease like heart disease, high blood pressure, certain cancers, and diabetes.Digestive enzymes makes digestion easier and more efficient.


Your gut contains over 1000 species of bacteria. Diverse bacteria is good for your health., Mix the following ingredients and firmly pack the mixture into a quart-sized canning jar. Leave about 2 inches free at the top of the jar. Cover the top of the jar with cheesecloth and clamp it on with a rubber band. Let the sauerkraut sit and ferment for 4 to 12 days at 67 to 72 degrees F. For sauerkraut, mix:


1 small head of green or red cabbage, chopped
1 medium carrot, chopped
1 teaspoon ginger, 1 teaspoon dill weed, and ½ teaspoon sea salt
¼ teaspoon probiotics (1 capsule) or probiotic culture starter
½ of a lemon, juiced
¾ cup of filtered water

, Mix 2 cups of coconut water, 1 cup of coconut meat, and 12 cups of water. Pour this into a glass container and add 1 tablespoon of kefir grains or 1 teaspoon of probiotic starter power (or 4 capsules of probiotics). Cover the container with cheesecloth and let it sit and ferment at 70 to 75 degrees for 12 hours. Stir and strain the kefir grains. Use the kefir after 24 to 48 hours.


You can re-use kefir grains after making your own kefir. Pat them dry with a clean towel and store them in the freezer.

, To make 1 quart of kombucha from green, black or white tea, steep 1 ½ teaspoons of loose tea (or 2 tea bags) in 2 to 3 cups of hot water. Add ¼ cup of sugar and mix it thoroughly. Once cooled, add ½ cup of vinegar. Add the “scoby” (a kombucha tea starter) which should be about 2 inches in diameter and about ¼ inch thick. Cover the jar with cheesecloth and put a rubber band around it. Let it ferment for up to 30 days at 68 to 85 degrees out of direct sunlight.


You'll see the scoby growing on top and it should become 1/4 inch thick before the kombucha is ready.

, For breakfast, consider making a fruit and yogurt smoothie. Or, make a fruit or coffee lassi by blending fruit or espresso with kefir. If you prefer something savory for breakfast, make an omelet and fill it with kimchi.If you're looking for something quick, make your own yogurt cups by topping plain yogurt with fresh fruit or jam. This way, you get the health benefits while avoiding the high sugar found in many commercial yogurt cups.

, Make a healthy sandwich by filling whole-grain bread with seed cheese, fermented pickles, and a lean meat. Or, if you have a little more time make miso soup and stir fry some tempeh to serve with noodles.


For a fermented snack, buy commercially fermented vegetable chips like lacto-fermented carrot chips to nibble throughout the day. Sourdough bread is also good to toast up and eat with a cultured dairy dip.

, Grill salmon that's been marinated in miso and serve it alongside sauerkraut or kimchi. Or, if you're eating soup, you can stir in cultured sour cream to get some fermented food in the meal. You can also garnish your meals with fermented chutneys.


Consider rounding out your meal by drinking kombucha.

, Insoluble fiber (fiber that doesn't dissolve in water) is important for regular bowel movements. It can also help your stomach and intestines digest food quicker. Eat 25 to 30 grams of fiber every day. It's better to get fiber from foods you eat, rather than from supplements. Foods that are high in insoluble fiber include:Wheat bran, whole grains
Vegetables: cauliflower, green beans, potatoes
Fruits: apples, pears, oranges, berries
Legumes, beans, nuts

, Simple carbohydrates are basic forms of sugar that your digestive system breaks down quickly. Some foods break down into sugars that your body has a hard time digesting (like lactose), which can lead to gas or bloating.Instead, choose complex carbohydrates that take longer for you to digest. These often contain fiber. Good sources of complex carbohydrates include:Beans, lentils, peas
Whole grains, brans
Vegetables: potatoes, pumpkin, corn, green vegetables
Fruits: apples, bananas, berries

, The Institute of Medicine recommends that you drink 8 eight-ounce glasses of water a day.To help you get in the habit, try drinking a glass of water before each meal. Drinking water helps your body remove waste and softens your stools, making them easier to pass.While you can drink juices to improve hydration, avoid drinking a lot of caffeine, carbonated beverages, or sodas. All of these can irritate your stomach., Regular exercise several times a week can improve digestion. Exercise like walking or yoga can help your intestines contract. Intestinal contractions can keep bowel movements regular, especially if you have a digestive condition like irritable bowel syndrome.Avoid eating too much right before you exercise since this can make you tired. Consider eating a small snack about an hour before you exercise so you have some energy for your workout., Eating slowly will help you feel fuller faster, so you don't eat as much at meals.When you chew, your saliva begins breaking down the food in a process called mechanical digestion. Taking your time to slowly eat meals and chew your food can help overall digestion, since your stomach won't need to work as hard to break down the meal. Try to take at least 20 minutes to eat a meal, since this is how long it takes signals to reach your brain telling it that you're full.


You can also help your stomach digest food by eating smaller, more frequent meals.For example, eat 5 or 6 small meals throughout the day instead of 3 large meals.

, You might notice that your digestive system doesn't handle certain foods very well. Maybe you have constipation, diarrhea, nausea, or get gassy after eating them. Consider tracking what foods bother you, so you can avoid eating them. Common food irritants include:Fatty foods: cheeses, deep-fried foods, processed or fast food
Highly acidic foods: coffee, tea, tomatoes, vinegar, citrus fruits
Gassy foods: beans, cabbage, or carbonated drinks
Spicy foods: chili, peppers

Include probiotics in your diet.,
Eat more fiber.,
Drink water throughout the day.,
Eat softer foods.,
Pay attention to how caffeine affects you.",How to Improve Digestion As You Age1," Probiotics are known as healthy bacteria that live in your intestines. Probiotics help move food through your intestines. They are known to be helpful with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), Irritable Bowel Disease (IBD), and certain types of diarrhea.To improve the health of your intestines and encourage digestion, you can take a probiotic supplement or just eat foods that are high in probiotics. If you want to take a supplement, talk with your doctor first. Probiotic supplements are not regulated by the FDA, but your doctor can help you to choose a supplement and recommend a good dosage for you. These foods include:Kimchi.
Sauerkraut.
Kefir.
Yogurt.
Miso soup.
Kombucha tea.
Soft cheeses.
Tempeh.;
, Most people only get 15 grams (0.53 oz) of fiber a day although the daily recommendation is 25 grams (0.88 oz) for women and 35 to 40 grams (1.2 to 1.4 oz) for men.It's especially important to get the recommended fiber as you age because slower digestion can cause constipation. Talk with your doctor about taking a fiber supplement or include more of these high-fiber foods in your diet:Brans and whole grains: oats, wheat, corn.
Beans: lentil, kidney, black, pinto, garbanzo.
Berries: blackberries, raspberries, blueberries.
Nuts and seeds.

, As you include more fiber in your diet, you'll need to drink more water to prevent constipation. Drinking water before meals can also prevent weight gain. Try to drink at least 15 cups (3.7 liters) if you're a man or 11 cups (2.7 liters) if you're a woman.Keep in mind that these amounts include water that you're getting from meals that include fruits and vegetables. Drink enough water to prevent cloudy or dark urine and drink before you begin to feel thirsty.

, As you get older, your mouth won't make as much saliva or stomach acid. This can make digestion take longer and might increase your risk for choking on food. To improve your digestion, eat foods that are softer and take the time to cut your food into manageable bites.If you'll be eating dry or chewy foods, ensure that you drink plenty of fluids to help your body break down the food.

, Regular caffeine consumption affects people differently. Studies have shown that some people experience acid reflux and slowed digestion while others aren't affected by it. Some people believe that coffee has a diuretic effect, making it easier to pass stools.Caffeine may irritate the digestive systems of people with Crohn's, colitis, and irritable bowel syndrome."

Watch for signs of blood in your stool and vomit.,
Seek immediate help for acute symptoms.",How to Identify Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding Symptoms1," You might have an idea that there is something wrong based on your bowel movements and/or from vomiting. If you notice blood in your stool or vomit, then you will need to make an appointment to see your doctor as soon as possible. Some of the common symptoms that people notice with an upper GI bleed include:Black, tarry looking stools
Blood in your stool, on the toilet paper, or in the toilet bowl
Blood in your vomit.;
, If the problem is severe, then you will need to seek immediate medical attention by calling 911. Some signs that you might be going into shock from the bleeding and will need immediate medical attention include:Weakness or fatigue
Pale skin
Feeling dizzy or faint
Shortness of breath
Bleeding while on aspirin, or other anticoagulants and antiplatelets
Drop in blood pressure
Fast pulse
Loss of consciousness
Not urinating or urinating very little
Vomiting frank (obvious, fresh) blood
Large amount of blood from the rectum (not just a small amount on the toilet paper only)

Decide where the enema will be given.,
Place the supporting hook at the right height.,
Prepare for spills or leakage.",How to Give an Enema1," The three most common places to give an enema are on a bed, on the bathroom floor or in a bathtub.;
, The hook should be from 18 to 24 inches (45 to 60 centimeters) above the surface where the recipient of the enema will be lying, so that the enema bag is suspended 12 to 18 inches (30 to 45 centimeters) above the recipient's anus. This is high enough so that the enema solution will gradually flow out of the enema bag.


Suspending the enema bag too high will increase the incoming pressure and thus the enema recipient's discomfort. Suspending the bag too low will cause the fluid to flow back into the enema bag, leaving little fluid to reach the colon

, If giving an enema in the bedroom or bathroom floor, place a thick absorbent pad or towel where the recipient will be lying. If giving the enema in the bathtub, an absorbent towel is unnecessary, although you may wish to wipe spills off the recipient's buttocks or legs.

Get more exercise.,
Maintain a healthy weight.,
Talk with your doctor about medication side effects.,
Avoid smoking and limit your alcohol intake.",How to Improve Digestion As You Age2," Exercise increases blood flow and oxygen circulation through your body which improves digestion. Try to walk for at least 15 minutes after eating to immediately improve digestion.You could also do cardiovascular exercises like running or cycling.Don't forget that yoga can help your digestion. Downward facing dog, spinal twists, and child's pose are all good for relieving stomach problems.Stress can aggravate digestive problems, but getting more exercise can help to regulate your stress.

, While it's always important to be a healthy weight, you need to be within your healthy weight range as you age. Talk with your doctor to ensure that you're within the recommended body mass index (BMI) range. As you get older, you might find that your metabolism slows and it's harder to keep weight off.Some people find that they lose muscle mass as they age which can make it hard to gain weight. You'll need to work with your doctor to gain weight safely.

, Medications can impact people in different ways, so pay attention to any side effects when your doctor prescribes a new medication. If your medication is causing diarrhea, constipation, or stomach irritation, ask your doctor if there's a different medication you could take.Older people are more likely to have problems with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Try to choose coated tablets to prevent stomach irritation.
Certain commonly prescribed medications can cause constipation, such as Calcium Channel Blockers for treating high blood pressure and narcotics given for pain., Smoking can cause a number of cancers of the digestive tract and it also causes problems like heartburn, acid reflux, ulcers, and liver disease. Quitting smoking is important to your digestive health. You should also follow recommended alcohol limits for your sex since alcohol abuse can contribute to many digestive problems.Women and people over 65 should limit themselves to one drink a day. Men under 65 can drink two drinks a day."

Get regular medical attention.,
Diagnose and treat diverticulosis.,
Treat acid reflux as you age.,
Handle food allergies.",How to Improve Digestion As You Age3," It's important to get routine medical care as you age. The doctor will check for disease, talk with you about things you can do to prevent illness, answer any health questions you have, and give you immunization boosters as needed. You should go to the doctor for a physical exam every 1 to 5 years, if you're under 65. After age 65, you should get a physical every year.Catching health conditions early will give you a jump on treatment, so you should talk with your doctor about any digestive problems or concerns you have.

, Diverticulosis is a gastrointestinal disease that can be common in people over age 60. With diverticulosis, small sacs develop in the intestines and cause constipation, diarrhea, bloating, cramping, and pain. Your doctor can diagnose diverticulosis by taking x-rays, CT scans, or colonoscopies. Your doctor will probably prescribe antibiotics or recommend surgery, if you have severe diverticulosis.To reduce your risk for diverticulosis, eat a high-fiber diet, limit the amount of red meat you eat, maintain a healthy weight, and exercise.

, You may notice more heartburn and indigestion as you age. Fortunately, adjusting your diet can help manage acid reflux. Try to cut back on eating high-fat or fried foods and limit the amount of caffeine and alcohol you consume. If you find that you always have heartburn after meals, reduce the size of your meals.If simple changes to your diet still doesn't improve your reflux, talk with your doctor about prescribing medications like proton-pump inhibitors or antacids., As you age, so does your immune system. You might find that you become allergic or sensitive to foods that you used to tolerate well. Drinking more alcohol than is recommended can increase your risk for food allergies and sensitivities. Once your doctor has diagnosed a food allergy, you'll need to remove it from your diet.To avoid a food, you'll need to read food labels and check for cross-contamination when you eat in restaurants. Don't be afraid to ask about food preparations or even bring your own food when eating out.

Be aware that some medical conditions can put you at risk.,
Reflect on any upper GI diagnoses you have received.,
Check the warnings on your medications.,
Identify lifestyle factors that might put you at risk.",How to Identify Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding Symptoms2," Having a non-serious or serious medical condition can put you at a higher risk of developing an upper GI bleed; however, you may be unaware of the condition until you notice bleeding.This is why it is important to see your doctor if you have identified any signs of GI bleeding.


If you have had a non-serious condition such as hemorrhoids or an anal fissure, or have experienced GI bleeding in the past, then you are at a higher risk of GI bleeding.Serious conditions, such as colon cancer and intestinal polyps, can also cause GI bleeding.

, You may be more at risk of developing an upper GI bleed if you have already been diagnosed with another condition. Consider any medical diagnoses you have received that might increase your risk of a GI bleed. Some conditions that may cause an upper GI bleed include:Peptic ulcers
Esophageal varices
Esophagitis
Gastritis
Mallory-Weiss tear
Malignancy
Portal hypertension from liver issues

, Some medications can also increase your risk of an upper GI bleed. Think about the over-the-counter and prescription medications that you take on a regular basis as well as any prescription drugs that have warnings about an increased chance of gastrointestinal bleeding.NSAIDS, such as ibuprofen and naproxen, can increase your risk of an upper GI bleed.
Some prescription medications may also increase your risk of an upper GI bleed. For example, taking a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant along with an NSAID can make your risk of gastrointestinal bleeding 15 times higher than normal.Check the warnings to determine if your medication might put you at risk of an upper GI bleed.

, Certain lifestyle factors may increase your risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Think about your lifestyle and be sure to share any relevant information with your doctor. If you drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, or eat acidic foods, then these lifestyle factors may be increasing your risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.


Consider your alcohol consumption. Alcohol can increase the level of acid in your stomach and this can lead to bleeding in your gastrointestinal tract.
Take smoking into account. Smoking can also increase stomach acid and this may increase your risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.Think about your diet. Some foods may increase the acid levels in your stomach, such as coffee and spicy foods, and this might also increase your risk of a gastrointestinal bleed."

Make an appointment with your doctor.,
Provide a thorough health history.,
Get a physical exam.,
Go for additional tests.",How to Identify Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding Symptoms3," If you suspect that you might have an upper GI bleed, then make an appointment to see your doctor as soon as possible. Laboratory tests are necessary to confirm an upper GI bleed, and you will also need to get treated for your condition.Do not put off treatment. An upper GI bleed may become more severe if it is not treated promptly.

, Your doctor will start by asking you lots of questions about past health problems as well as questions about your current condition.Make sure that you provide honest, complete answers to these questions to help your doctor make a diagnosis.


For example, if you have a history of ulcers, then this is important information for your doctor to know that.
Your doctor will also ask lots of questions about your symptoms, such as when they started, what they are, and what (if anything) helps to ease your symptoms.

, Your doctor will also need to do a physical exam. During this exam, your doctor will listen to your bowel sounds, tap on different parts of your body, and do other things to check your body for signs of a problem.Let your doctor know before the exam if you are in pain. For example, if you are having pain in a specific area of your abdomen, tell your doctor so that they can avoid pressing on the painful area.

, Multiple diagnostic tests may be required for your doctor to make a diagnosis. If your doctor suspects that there is a problem, then you will likely need to go to a hospital for these tests. These tests may include:Blood tests — These may be used to determine the extent of the bleeding and check for anemia.

Stool test — You may need to provide a stool sample for a blood test. The sample will be sent to a lab to confirm whether or not there is blood in your stool.

Angiogram — An imaging test that uses x-rays to photograph your colon and can help identify lesions or the site of the bleeding. This can be done using a special catheter and requires no preparation (such as cleansing of the colon).

GI bleed scan — For this test, your blood will be drawn, mixed with a small amount of a radioactive material, then injected back into your body. A special camera, called a Gamma Camera, will take pictures, similar to an x-ray. This can help identify the location of the bleeding as well as the frequency and amount.

Upper GI endoscopy — This can help your doctor to find the cause of the bleeding. In this procedure, a small tube with a tiny camera at the end of it is inserted into your throat and down into your stomach. The images will be projected onto a screen in the room. You will receive anesthesia for this procedure.

Enteroscopy — This is similar to an upper GI endoscopy, but the tube is longer and it provides images further down in your GI tract. There is also capsule enteroscopy, which is when you swallow a capsule that has a tiny camera inside of it. The camera takes images of your entire GI tract as it passes through your body.

Colonoscopy — If you experience bleeding from your rectum but have a negative upper GI endoscopy, you will likely undergo a colonoscopy to help discover the cause of the bleeding. Your doctor will insert a small tube with a camera into you rectum to examine your large intestine.

Nasogastric lavage— This may be necessary to find the cause of the upper GI bleed. This procedure will remove the contents of your stomach through a tube that is inserted through your nose.

Choose the right water temperature.,
Add the necessary solute for the purpose of the enema.,
Fill the enema bag or syringe.,
Connect the bag to the tubing.

",How to Give an Enema2," Most enemas should be given at close to human body temperature, or between 98 and 105 degrees Fahrenheit (37 to 40.5 degrees Celsius). Enemas may be given with water as cool as 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius) or as hot as 113 degrees Fahrenheit (45 degrees Celsius). Using water colder than 86 degrees Fahrenheit may cause cramping, while using water hotter than 113 degrees Fahrenheit can scald the rectal area.

, While tap water is sufficient for most enemas, it may be necessary to add something to make the enema more effective, or if the enema is intended for something other than colon cleansing.


Mild soap is added to the enema solution when the enema is intended to relieve constipation. Enema soap is specially formulated to be mild enough for infants but able to handle the most severe constipation. Enema soap is available in packets in most medical supply stores or may be ordered by a local pharmacist. One packet is sufficient. (Liquid dishwashing detergent should not be substituted, as it will irritate the colon and may cause colitis.) If enema soap is not available, baking soda may be substituted.
Salt is added to enemas that are designed to soften impacted stools rather than trigger the bowel to expel them. Generally, one teaspoon of salt should be added per pint of water (10 milliliters/cubic centimeters of salt per liter of water). Mineral oil also softens stools and lubricates the colon, but it may seep out of the anus for up to 24 hours after the enema is given.
Sodium phosphate is added to commercial enema solutions designed to clean out the colon prior to a colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy. Sodium phosphate draws water from the bloodstream into the colon, but often triggers intense cramps in the process.
Certain drugs that penetrate the body faster without going through the digestive tract, such as some cancer, arthritis and macular degeneration medicines, as well as a few anti-nausea drugs, can be added to the enema solution.
Barium solution is used in enemas that are to be retained long enough to enable the colon to be displayed on an X-ray.

, The amount of enema solution the recipient will be able to accept varies according to the size of the recipient's colon and how much fecal matter is inside it. A child 11 years old or older has the same colon capacity, on average, as an adult.


If using a pre-measured enema solution, a child aged 5 to 10 years can be given a full bottle of a child-sized enema, while a child aged 2 to 4 years needs only half a bottle.

,"
"
Coat the tubing nozzle with a lubricant.

,
Let enough enema solution flow through the tubing to force air out of it.,
Lubricate the anus and rectal area.,
Get the recipient into position.,
Insert the tube into the rectum.,
Let the enema solution flow into the colon slowly.,
Massage the abdomen slowly and deeply in a counter-clockwise direction.,
Clamp off the tube once the enema is stopped.,
Give the enema time to do its job.",How to Give an Enema3,", This will reduce cramping when the enema is administered.

, The lubricant should be applied generously to the exterior of the anus and as far up the rectal area as possible to both make the tube easier to insert and protect the skin around the rectal area. Afterward, wipe off your finger with a tissue. (Alternatively, you can put on rubber or latex gloves before applying the lubricant.)

, While there are several positions the enema recipient can be in, the 3 most common positions are Sims' position, the knee-chest position and lying on the back with knees bent.


Sims' position can be used whether receiving an enema from someone else or giving an enema to yourself. To assume Sims' position, lie on your left side with your left leg straight and your right leg bent at the knee. Place your left arm behind your back and your right hand under the pillow at your head. If administering the enema to yourself, the flow regulating clamp should be placed where your left hand can reach it.
Knee-chest position may be more comfortable for someone receiving an enema from someone else, particularly if the recipient is pregnant, and may also be called for in cases of severe constipation. In this position, the recipient gets on hands and knees, places 1 or more pillows under the chest and leans on them while turning the face sideways and resting it on another pillow his or her arms are wrapped around. It does not lend itself to controlling the enema flow if you're giving it to yourself, however.
Use the lying on the back with knees bent position if giving yourself an enema while lying on the bathroom floor or in the bathtub. Put a pillow under your head and make sure you can reach the flow regulating clamp before you start.

, Twist the tube back and forth while inserting it to make it easier to go in. The tube should be inserted no more than 3 to 4 inches (7.5 to 10 centimeters) into the rectal area without forcing. Having the enema recipient ""bear down"" as though having a bowel movement may help the insertion process.

, A suggested flow rate is 4 to 8 ounces (118 to 236 milliliters) per minute. Have the enema recipient take slow, deep breaths; the recipient may feel the stomach expand somewhat while receiving the enema, and the stomach and abdomen may also appear fuller. Stop the flow at the first sign of cramping and have the recipient take quick, shallow breaths, then resume the flow when the discomfort passes. Interrupt the flow as often as necessary for the enema recipient's comfort. Allow up to 15 minutes to administer a large-volume enema.

, This will work the enema solution higher into the colon and also help dislodge fecal material from the colon walls. Start from the lower left side of the body, work up to the rib cage and then work back down the right side.

, This will prevent backflow into the bag when it is time to evacuate the bowels.

, On average, the enema should be held between 5 to 15 minutes before evacuating, with the longer times desired for relieving constipation. If the recipient feels the urge to go before this time, have him or her take deep breaths by mouth to relax.

"
"
Get to the toilet.,
Remove the enema tube.

,
Have the recipient squat over the toilet.,
Expel the enema.",How to Give an Enema4," If the recipient is having trouble holding the enema in, either press the buttocks together or press a folded washcloth against them to help retain it.

,, Squatting causes the thighs to push against the abdomen, helping to expel more of the enema solution at a given time. If squatting is too difficult, then let the recipient sit on the toilet as for a normal bowel movement.


To further aid in expelling the enema solution, massage the recipient's abdomen in a clockwise direction.

, The enema solution, and any waste matter, should come out within a few minutes. If not, have the enema recipient lie down in the Sims or knee-chest position, wait until the urge to evacuate returns, and try again. In any case, it will likely take several evacuations to clear out all the enema solution.

Carry an emergency kit.",How to Have a Bowel Movement away from Home," You might be anxious about going to the bathroom at work or at school because of the fear that someone might walk in. Remind yourself that everyone, even your boss, teacher, and coworkers, have been exactly where you are now.;
, This can be a scary thing to consider, but once you let yourself imagine beyond the initial embarrassment, you’ll realize that its not really the end of the world at all., Anxiety about anything can affect the body in many ways. Be sure to take deep breathes and relax your muscles. If you are too anxious and tight, you’ll have more trouble going and ultimately be in the bathroom even longer. , Ask yourself, what’s worse, holding it in and risking an accident, or taking charge and relieving yourself of discomfort?, The only excuse you need is a simple, ""Excuse me."" You don't have to make up an excuse; everyone uses the bathroom.

, This is nothing to be embarrassed about either. Everyone uses the bathroom.

, This might involve a little searching, and if you don't think you have time, obviously go for the first one you see. If you are at a friend's house you might use the upstairs bathroom. In a mall, you might choose the restroom furthest from the major departments stores., Before you even sit down in a stall, or any bathroom for that matter, check to make sure there is toilet paper.If there isn't any ask the manager of the restaurant or the homeowner to bring you some.
If you are in an office building you may need ask at reception or locate a member of the janitorial staff.

, Either the stall or the door to the bathroom itself should have a lock on it. Locking the door will help relieve some of the anxiety you might have and will ensure your privacy.

, If you can, put your feet up on a small trash bin. Squatting will allow you to pass your waste more quickly and with less effort, minimizing the amount of time you spend in the bathroom., Sometimes thinking about it too much can make defecating even more stressful. If you have a cell phone, playing a game or doing a little reading on the internet can help you relax.


When defecating in public you’ll want to get in and out as quickly as you can. Be wary of spending so much time on your phone that it distracts you from the task at hand., Once you are in the bathroom, don't forget to continue to take deep breathes. This will help your body relax.

, If you are still having trouble going, place your hand on your abdomen and lightly push down. You might want to slightly lean forward while you do this., If possible, try flushing immediately after each release. This will cut down on the odor. , If there are stains or skid marks visible in the bowl, try flushing again. You can also try putting a few sheets of toilet paper in the water, letting them soak for a minute and then flushing them down. They should help remove any remaining waste., Many people leave air fresheners on the backs of their toilets or under the sink. Some restaurants with one person bathrooms (as opposed to ones with several stalls) will have air fresheners out as well. Don’t be afraid to use them., If you have room in your bag, it can be helpful to carry things like matches, small air fresheners,wet wipes toilet paper, hand sanitizer etc. "

The most common symptoms reported by sufferers of indigestion include:Feeling very full or bloated
Nausea, and even vomiting
Excessive burping and belching (beyond what is ""normal"" for you)
Regurgitation of the stomach contents or food into the esophagus
Sharp or intense pain in the stomach;
, Indigestion is not a disease or illness itself, but a symptom of an underlying problem with the digestive system. It's important to think about some of the potential causes of your indigestion. As the name suggests, indigestion is most commonly associated with food and drink.Eating too much and too fast, excess alcohol, and consumption of foods that are difficult to digest can all cause abdominal pain. Chronic indigestion, however, can be associated with several other problems, including:Functional dyspepsia (no obvious clinical abnormality)
Stress
Obesity
Smoking
Pregnancy
Medications (e..g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), aspirin)
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD)
Gastroparesis (failure of the stomach to empty properly)
Helicobacter pylori infection
Stomach ulcers
Cancer of the stomach

, Sometimes, chronic indigestion is a side effect of long-term medication use, particularly with NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), which include aspirin, naproxen (Aleve, Anaprox, Naprelan, Naprosyn), and ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), among others.NSAIDs can cause intestinal problems and discomfort. For this reason, long-term use of these medications is not recommended.Iron supplements are also known to be hard on the digestive system and can cause acid reflux, constipation, and an upset stomach.Some high blood pressure, anti-anxiety, and antibiotic medications can also cause heartburn, nausea, and indigestion, among other side effects.If you suspect that your indigestion is being caused by a particular drug, then consulting your doctor about changing to another medication may be the answer.

, Pregnancy is often associated with indigestion, perhaps not surprisingly, because of the pressure it exerts on the digestive system due to the growing fetus. Eight out of ten women typically experience indigestion during their pregnancy.If the symptoms are mild and are not causing significant pain, you can consider making some changes to your eating and drinking habits (see Part 2). You can also take an over-the-counter antacid, which reduces the production of stomach acid, or an alginate, which helps relieve indigestion caused by acid reflux (when the acid from your stomach leaks back up into the esophagus) In general, you should take an antacid or alginate only when you experience symptoms (rather than as a general everyday medication). See Part 3 for brands.
Although there is a lot of reluctance and fear surrounding taking medications during pregnancy nowadays, antacids or alginates are safe as long as you take only the recommended dosage. However, feel free to consult your physician if you are still unsure.

, Chronic indigestion is one of the most common symptoms of IBS (irritable bowel syndrome), a condition characterized by persistent abdominal pain, discomfort, bloating, and alteration of bowel habits. The cause of IBS is unknown and not detectable via any tests.


The best treatment strongly depends upon the particular symptoms of discomfort experienced by the patient; however dietary changes are often effective in alleviating symptoms.

, Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is caused by a persistent, abnormal leakage of the stomach acids back up into the esophagus. The associated indigestion may be treated using medications (see Part 3), lifestyle changes (see Part 2) or even surgery, depending on the severity of the illness.


It is important to consult your physician if you suspect you may have GERD. If left untreated, GERD can, in the long-term, increase your risk of developing permanent damage and cancer in the esophagus., Gastroparesis is a condition in which the stomach cannot empty properly as a result of nerve damage. It is sometimes associated with diabetes.


There is no satisfactory treatment for this condition but metoclopramide, a dopamine antagonist, helps to contract the stomach thus preventing associated symptoms such as indigestion. In this case, you will need to consult a specialist recommended by your physician.

, Stomach ulcers and cancers can only be accurately assessed and treated by competent specialists. Adequate treatment of these problems may help any associated indigestion.


In the meantime, symptomatic relief can be obtained by consuming antacids, alginates or H2 blockers (see Part 3).

, Eating large meals requires further peristalsis or synchronized movements of the digestive tract in order to digest the food. This can further aggravate the irritation in the intestinal lining. Instead, aim to eat six small frequent meals per day: three major meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) and three snacks in between. In addition, make an effort to stop eating about two to three hours before you go to bed.


Try eating a half-size portion of what you would normally eat at breakfast, lunch, dinner. As a general rule (and one that holds even if you don't suffer from regular indigestion), you should feel satisfied, but not stuffed, after eating.

, A number of foods can irritate the intestines and stomach. Spicy, fatty, and acidic foods are all common culprits and should be cut back on or removed entirely from your diet if you suspect you have digestive pain.Avoid fatty foods, like fried food, soft cheese, nuts, red meat, and avocados.
Avoid spicy food like curries and other sauces with heat to them.
Avoid tomatoes and tomato-based sauces and citric foods like grapefruits and oranges (as well as in juice form).
Avoid carbonated drinks, which can unsettle the stomach.
Eliminate alcohol and caffeine.
Try cutting a few foods out at a time to see if you can narrow down the culprit. As you remove foods from your everyday diet, see if you notice a change and whether your indigestion has abated.

, Chewing with your mouth open or talking while eating can lead you to swallow excessive amounts of air, which can cause further bloating.

, Do not lie down or bend over after meals. With the aid of gravity, bending or lying down can lead to the regurgitation of stomach contents or food into the gullet or esophagus. Similarly, avoid wearing clothing, pants or belts that put pressure on the stomach.Wait at least one hour after eating before lying down or doing activities that require bending over. If lying down cannot be avoided, elevate the head at an angle of 30 to 45 degrees to help facilitate the digestive system to do its job, breaking down the food.

, If you smoke, consider quitting if you experience indigestion. The nicotine in cigarettes can cause a relaxing of the muscles at the lower part of the esophagus, thus aiding the stomach acid in its attempt to leak back up. In addition, nicotine is a potent vasoconstrictor. This means it can constrict the intestinal lining, which is inflamed by the irritation of the excessive stomach acid. As a result, abdominal pain can worsen when smoking.Quitting smoking of course has numerous other benefits alongside relief from chronic indigestion, including reduced risk for lung cancer and other cancers, heart disease, and stroke.

, Alcohol and caffeine can trigger indigestion, and particularly heartburn, because it opens the esophageal sphincter and thus permits the stomach acid to leak back up.Although you may not notice a problem with an individual drink, the effect can be compounded if for example you pair that drink with problem foods on a regular basis (e.g., if you have coffee in the morning, a glass of wine with tomato soup at dinner, and then an orange later).Coffee, tea, and soda and other drinks that contain caffeine should also be avoided. You don't have to totally give them up, but you should cut back. Aim for 1-2 small cups (3-4 oz) of coffee a day., If you are overweight or obese, you are more likely to suffer from indigestion because of the added pressure in your abdomen. Make a concerted ever to lose weight and see if your indigestion is alleviated.Try to eat healthy and regularly. Incorporate more fruits and vegetables and whole grains into your diet. Make sure to limit foods with high acidic content until your symptoms are alleviated.
Get regular exercise. Try to get at least 30 minutes of moderate to intense activity at least three times a week. It's also a good idea to incorporate strength training into your workouts in order to convert fat into muscle.

, Easy-to-obtain antacids like Maalox, Rolaids, and Tums contain calcium, magnesium, or aluminum and can help neutralize neutralize or counteract the acid in the stomach to make it less corrosive. Antacids can be purchased over-the-counter at pharmacies and drug stores.One of the most prescribed antacids is Maalox. Its recommended dose is one to two tablets four times a day.
Though some people find these helpful in treating the casual occurrence of heart burn or indigestion, these may not be strong enough in cases of chronic indigestion.

, One of the main causes of chronic indigestion is excessive stomach acid which leaks upwards into the esophagus and causes discomfort. Acid blockers (also known as H2 blockers) work to reduce the production of stomach acid, thereby making the stomach contents less acidic so that when they do leak into the esophagus, it will be less irritating.


The most widely recommended H2 blocker is ranitidine, or Zantac, which can be obtained OTC or with a prescription. Ranitidine can be taken orally in tablet form. In general, most H2 blockers are to be taken 30 to 60 minutes before eating (but only twice per day maximum).Acid blockers do not act as quickly as antacids but they last longer. In fact, acid blockers can work for several hours and are best used as a preventive measure.

, Proton pump inhibitors work by blocking a chemical system called the hydrogen-potassium adenosine triphosphatase enzyme system, which produces stomach acids. If the level of stomach acid is low, then the abdominal pain in chronic indigestion can be minimized.Physicians recommend PPIs when acid blockers don't provide lasting relief or when you have problems in the esophagus thanks to GERD.
One PPI called Prilosec is available OTC, whereas others, including Aciphex, Nexium, Prevacid, Protonix, and stronger Prilosec, require prescription., Alginates, such as the OTC brand Gaviscon, create a foam barrier that floats on top of the contents of your stomach and keeps your stomach acids from pushing back up to the esophagus. Because they create that barrier between the stomach acid and the esophagus, alginates are especially good at providing relief from acid reflux and heartburn.Alginates work faster than H2 blockers and last longer than antacids. They come in both liquid and tablet form, so you should use whatever you prefer.
You should take alginates when you experience symptoms and not before a meal, since the food passing through the esophagus can disrupt the barrier and make it less effective.

, Reglan, or metoclopramide, increases digestive contractions, which helps to move food through the digestive system and into the intestines. The math is simple: speedier digestive means less heartburn.Reglan should only be considered a short-term treatment and only as a last resort when the other medicines mentioned above do not provide sufficient relief. Do not use Reglan for more than 12 weeks.Reglan requires a prescription and can be taken in tablet or liquid form, usually 30 minutes before meals and before bed.

, NSAIDs are not given to patients with chronic indigestion to relieve abdominal pain because these drugs can irritate the intestinal lining and may aggravate the condition. Instead, antidepressants are prescribed for pain relief.Antidepressants aid in pain relief by reducing the ability of the nerve cells to reabsorb brain chemicals such as serotonin and noradrenaline. These chemicals accumulate outside the nerve cells if they are not reabsorbed. This results in the inhibition of pain messages to the spinal cord.
Amitriptyline is usually prescribed for this purpose. Its therapeutic dose is 10 to 25 mg daily, which is gradually increased by an increment of 10 or 25 mg each week.Always consult your physician about the possibilities of taking an antidepressant for pain relief.

, If you think you are suffering from chronic indigestion, you should seek treatment in order to get relief. The American Gastroenterological Association recommends that you consult your physician if you experience any or a combination of the following symptoms: You experience indigestion three or more times every week.
You've suffered from regular indigestion for four or more years.
You've used OTC antacids and other medications for a period of several months or longer.
You have not been able to find relief in spite of various attempts (lifestyle changes, medication, etc.).
Note that if you experience chest pain, you should call your doctor or emergency services, as this could be a sign of a heart attack that you may be mistaking for heartburn or indigestion.

, Your doctor will probably want to get a blood sample from you in order to help determine the underlying cause of your indigestion. Common blood tests that are ordered to help diagnoses digestive disorders include a CBC (Complete Blood Count, which measures red and white blood cells as well blood platelets and an ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate) or CRP (C-Reactive Protein), which assess the level of inflammation in the body. Blood tests can be used to diagnose and monitor diseases such as IBS, H. pylori, Celiac disease, and Crohn's Disease, among many others.A blood sample is drawn from the patient’s vein through a sterile needle and syringe. The sample is put in a sterile container and will be examined in a medical laboratory.

, In some cases, particularly in those where the complaints of indigestion are persistent, your doctor may refer you to a gastroenterologist, a specialist in the area of the gastrointestinal tract and liver. The specialist may opt to conduct an endoscopy, a procedure that enables him to look inside your esophagus to see whether the underlying cause is acid reflux that is damaging the lining of your esophagus.In an endoscopy, a medical instrument is inserted into the colon and is guided by a small camera with a lighted tube at its end. This procedure can be performed in one of two ways: colonoscopy or upper endoscopy.
A colonoscopy utilizes a flexible tube that is gently inserted into the opening of the anus, allowing direct visualization and examination of the colon (the large intestine) and the terminal ileum, the final section of the small intestine.An upper endoscopy is aided by a flexible tube inserted through the mouth, down the esophagus and the stomach until it reaches the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine. Usually you will be asked to come in with an empty stomach (meaning no food or drink six or more hours before the procedure).During the endoscopy, your doctor may also remove a small piece of tissue to test., Your doctor may recommend this if you've been experiencing stomach pain, bleeding from the rectum, and abnormal bowel movements (such as diarrhea or constipation). A barium enema is an X-ray test that can tell if there are any abnormalities in the colon.In this test, a liquid is injected into your rectum that contains a metallic substance called barium. Barium works to coat the lining of the colon so that the colon can be more easily seen on the X-ray.Before the exam, you'll have to ""empty"" your colon because anything remaining could be seen on the X-ray as an abnormality. You will likely be required to fast after midnight and take a laxative in order to clear out your colon. In some cases, your doctor may request that you stick to a special diet the day before (e.g., no solids, only clear liquids like water, broth, and black coffee). A week or two before the test, be sure to ask your doctor about any medications you may be taking and whether you should cease taking them before the exam.In general, the exam is uncomfortable, but there are no real side effects from a barium enema, although you may experience white stools (because of the barium) or a bit of constipation. Your doctor may suggest you take a laxative if this is the case.

Try taking an antacid.,
Take an H-2 receptor blocker.,
Take a proton pump inhibitor.,
Take antibiotics.,
Avoid medications that cause indigestion.",How to Get Rid of Indigestion1," Antacids are the most commonly used over-the-counter remedy for treating the symptoms of indigestion. Antacids contain sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), and as they dissolve in the stomach they help to neutralize some of the acid that has collected there.Do not take antacids within one to two hours of administering other medications, as the sodium bicarbonate may interfere with your other medicine.Anyone on a low-sodium diet should talk to a doctor before taking antacids, as they contain a substantial amount of sodium.Avoid large quantities of milk and dairy products while taking antacids, as they may cause further discomfort and complications.Do not take antacids if you have any symptoms of appendicitis.Antacids are not recommended for long-term use. It is best to discontinue antacid use after a maximum of two weeks. If you're having chronic indigestion, talk to your doctor and consider making other lifestyle changes to reduce the incidents of indigestion.;
, Over-the-counter H-2 receptor blockers, such as cimetidine, famotidine, nizatidine, and ranitidine, may help reduce the production of acid in your stomach for up to 12 hours. Depending on the severity of your symptoms, your doctor may also recommend a stronger, prescription-grade version of an H-2 receptor blocker.Talk to your doctor if you are taking H-2 receptor blockers for more than 2 weeks.

, Over-the-counter proton pump inhibitors, such as lansoprazole or omeprazole, can help block the production of stomach acid and allow the esophagus to heal, if it has been damaged by stomach acid. These medications are available over-the-counter, but depending on the severity of your symptoms your doctor may recommend that you take a prescription-strength version of a proton pump inhibitor, such as esomeprazole or pantoprazole.Talk to your doctor if you're taking a proton pump inhibitor for over two weeks. You should only take OTC PPIs for short-term use. See your doctor if your indigestion is persistent.

, If your chronic indigestion is caused by an H. pylori bacterial infection, your doctor will most likely prescribe a course of antibiotics to kill the bacteria and prevent future ulcers. Many doctors prescribe two different types of antibiotics at once to prevent the H. pylori bacteria from developing resistance to one specific type of antibiotic.When taking antibiotics, it's important to strictly follow the dosage recommendations on the label and to take all of the antibiotics given to you, even if you feel better. Failure to complete a full course of antibiotics can result in the bacterial infection flaring back up, with a resistance to the antibiotics you were previously using., Talk to your doctor about any medications you are taking that may be contributing to your indigestion. A common cause of indigestion associated with peptic ulcers is the excessive and prolonged use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin or ibuprofen.One way to reduce the likelihood of future indigestion problems is by avoiding NSAIDs like aspirin and ibuprofen if you're prone to peptic ulcers. Your doctor may recommend that you take an alternative medication that won't cause stomach ulcers, such as paracetamol, acetaminophen or a COX-2 inhibitor."

Consider taking probiotics.",How to Get Rid of Tonsil Stones," Tonsil stones are usually pale yellow, gray, or white in color, and can be found lodged in the soft tissue of your tonsils.Your tonsils are fleshly lumps, or pads, found on either side at the back of your throat, are oval in shape, and contain crevices, crypts, craters, and pits.Tonsils are part of your immune system and contain lymphatic liquid known also as lymph, the reason why doctors consider them to be two lymph nodes. They work in your body to help fight infections.Food debris, dead tissue cells from your mouth, mucus, and bacteria, can easily get lodged in those pits and crevices and become calcified, causing the hardened areas referred to as stones.;
, With the use of a mirror, and good lighting like a flashlight, you can see your tonsils, and probably see the whitened or yellowed calcification deposits, which are the tonsil stones, embedded in the tissue of your tonsils.In some cases they may be buried within the tissue of your tonsils and are not visible.If you have symptoms consistent with tonsil stones, but they are not visible, seek medical attention to help with getting rid of the stones., One of the most common symptoms caused by tonsil stones is bad breath. The unpleasant odor is caused by bacteria and food debris that gets lodged in the crevices of your tonsils and becomes part of the calcification process that forms the stones that are embedded in your tonsils.Bad breath can also be related to dental problems such as decay, abscess, or gingivitis. Sinus infections or a coated tongue can also cause bad breath. If none of these seem to be the problem, then you should have a complete investigation of your tonsils.
Other common problems related to tonsil stones include an uncomfortable feeling that something is lodged in the back of your throat, a metallic taste, coughing, feeling like you are choking at times, tonsil redness, irritation, inflammation in the back area of your mouth and throat, and coughing up small and smelly lumps.Chronic sore throat and recurrent episodes of tonsillitis are possible complications of having tonsil stones.If your tonsils are painful, inflamed, bleed easily, or if you have a sore throat with a fever, seek medical attention.

, In order to remove the stones at home, you will need to clearly see inside your mouth.


Strong flashlights work well for visibility, however you will probably need both hands free to manipulate the tools you choose.
Some people have difficulty with manually trying to remove the stones because it can be awkward, uncomfortable, and trigger your gag reflex., You may have avoided using your tongue to poke around your tonsils, especially if they feel painful or strange to the touch, but using your tongue may actually be a good tool that can help loosen the stones and get them out.Press on your tonsils and try to break up the stones or push them free. Working the back of your mouth by swallowing hard can also help to loosen the stones. Try coughing to loosen and release the stones.
This method may take patience, as the stones are snugly embedded in the crevices of your tonsils.Gargle with water, a salt water rinse, or mouthwash for 30 seconds to help keep the tissues moist and assist with freeing the stones.

, Scraping the calcification deposits from your tonsils is commonly done by using a regular toothbrush.Use the brush side and the flat side to lift the tonsil tissue to find the calcification deposits. The brush side can help to dislodge the stones from the tissue.Pull your tongue out and say ""Aaahh"" for a better view

, Wet the ends of the cotton swab to make it easier to manipulate against the stones and be gentler on your tonsils.Use the cotton swab to maneuver the fleshy tonsil tissue to locate the stones, then push up to dislodge them and scrape them away from the tonsil tissue.If you try to remove the stones with your finger, first wash your hands thoroughly with warm, soapy water and rinse them well. Open your mouth and find your tonsils with your finger.Be careful not to reach too far back with your finger to prevent triggering your gag reflex.
Apply pressure and then push up slightly so that the tonsil stones pop out.Rinse your mouth out with water or a salt water rinse.

, The force of the water generated by a water flossing appliance can help to loosen the deposits within the tonsil tissue.Use a water flossing device along with a toothbrush and/or cotton swab to remove the stones.Make sure you use it for just a few seconds, pointed directly to the stone, in order to avoid choking.

, Gargle frequently to help loosen the stones. Salt water gargles are a common method used to remove tonsil stones.Use a salt water rinse following any procedure you use to remove the stones. The salt water can help to wash away residue from the stones and remove any remaining bacteria and food debris in the tissues.Use salt water gargles routinely once the stones have been removed to help prevent them from returning. The salt works against the accumulation of bacteria that can lead to the development of tonsil stones., Tonsil stone removal kits can be purchased at drugstores or online.The kits range in size and price, with some containing several different tools that can be used to remove the stones., This type of doctor, often referred to as an ENT, is trained in managing conditions that involve the throat area, including the tonsils and tonsil stones.The doctor may be able to perform a procedure during your office appointment to remove the stones with little discomfort.If you are particularly anxious, the doctor may be able to apply a local anesthetic.

, In some cases, the symptoms of tonsil stones may overlap with other underlying conditions that may be more serious.Persistent soreness or discomfort in your tonsil area, redness, and tonsil tissue that bleeds easily warrants medical attention.If the pain and discomfort felt in your tonsils extends into one or both ears, seek medical attention., If you have frequent problems with tonsil stones, your doctor may recommend a tonsillectomy. Take into account that tonsils are the first ""soldiers"" to fight against bacteria or viruses that threaten your throat or respiratory system, and a tonsillectomy may make you more vulnerable to illness.


Having a tonsillectomy only to prevent recurrent tonsil stones is considered a last resort.If you and your doctor decide to proceed with a tonsillectomy, the surgery can be done in most people as an outpatient procedure.Partial tonsillectomies are performed in some cases. This allows the tonsils to remain in the body to help with immune responses, but removes enough tissue to prevent the formation of recurrent tonsil stones.Some risks are possible as with all surgeries. The most common problems following surgery include some additional bleeding, and pain.Pain following the surgery is usually managed by taking prescription-strength pain medications, along with plenty of fluids, and adequate rest., A procedure called laser tonsillotomy or laser tonsillectomy is a type of laser resurfacing that can be done on tonsil tissues.Laser resurfacing leaves the tonsils in place but eliminates the pits and crevices of their surface.
The tonsil tissue becomes smooth, avoiding the bacteria and food deposits that lead to the development of tonsil stones., Developing good daily oral hygiene habits can help to prevent stones from developing.Brush your teeth regularly. To maintain a clean and bacteria-free environment in your mouth, brush your teeth each morning, after each meal, and at bedtime.
When you brush your teeth also brush your tongue to remove excess food debris and bacteria., Rinse your mouth regularly with a salt water rinse or mouthwashes that do not contain alcohol.Alcohol-free mouth care products or those containing a low percentage (.02%) chlorhexidine digluconate can help to reduce the amount of bacteria that remains in your mouth area after use.Salt water used as a mouth rinse on a regular basis can help to prevent stones from developing., By flossing each day, you are removing excess bacteria that contribute to the formation of tonsil stones.Use mouth rinses or gargles after flossing to further remove bacteria and food particles dislodged from the flossing., Discard old and worn brushes. Replace toothbrushes every three months to help in properly cleaning your teeth, tongue, and gums.


Using a fresh toothbrush aids in removing food debris and bacteria that cause the stones to develop.
Rinse your toothbrush thoroughly after each use to prevent the accumulation of bacteria along the bristles.

, Drinking water throughout the day helps to refresh your mouth area, prevent dryness in your mouth area, and rinse away debris that can accumulate in the pits and crevices of your tonsils.Drinking plenty of water also helps to provide adequate hydration for the body and works to prevent an environment that can cause bacteria to grow., Probiotics help to maintain a healthy balance of bacteria in the body. This includes bacteria that resides, or remains, in the mouth cavity.In addition to taking probiotics, maintaining a balanced diet promotes overall good health and can help to prevent the overgrowth of unwanted bacteria.
Include apples, carrots, garlic, and onions in your diet."

Brush two or three times a day.,
Get your technique right.,
Floss regularly.,
Choose the right equipment.",How to Clean Your Whole Mouth1," The first step to cleaning your whole mouth and ensuring you maintain good oral hygiene is brushing your teeth frequently and effectively. Normally it is recommended that you brush twice a day, once in the morning and once at night. You can add a third time after lunch, but don't brush more than three times a day.If you frequently brush more often than this, you risk wearing down your tooth enamel and damaging your gums.Each time you brush your teeth, you should do it for at least two minutes. Try dividing your mouth into four sections and giving each one thirty seconds to help you keep track.;
, When you are brushing your teeth, it's important to use the best technique to maximise the benefit and minimise the risk of damaging your gums or wearing down enamel. Start by placing your brush at a 45-degree angle to your gums. Move the brush back and forward gently in strokes that are about the width of a single tooth and then continue the movement by gently brushing the entire surface of your tooth with an up and down motion.


Brush all the surfaces of the teeth, the outer surfaces, the chewing surfaces, and the inner surfaces.
For the inner surfaces, tilt the brush up and brush up and down a few times for each tooth., Even if you're a diligent brusher, there some areas your toothbrush cannot reach. Flossing daily will help to remove any lingering substances that are caught between your teeth. Just like brushing, it is important to use a proper technique to avoid any potential damage from scraping teeth and gums when flossing. Wrap a length of floss around the index fingers on each of your hands so there's around two inches of floss between your hands.


Keep the floss tight against the tooth to remove plaque and avoid rubbing the gums.Gently move the floss with a back and forth movement. Make sure that you use only gentle pressure to avoid hurting your gums with the floss.
If you maintain a good flossing routine and technique you will have healthier teeth and healthier gums.
You should floss your teeth once a day., When you are brushing your teeth, it's important that you have the right tools for the job. Use a soft-bristled brush that fits inside your mouth easily and enables you to reach all areas without any trouble. You should replace your brush every three or four months. If you notice the bristles are getting frayed you should replace it sooner.Combine a good brush with a fluoride toothpaste that is approved by dental professionals.
Look for a seal or marking on the package of the toothpaste to check it for a professional endorsement.Avoid using an abrasive toothpaste for more than two weeks in a row because it can wear down your tooth enamel and increase sensitivity

"
"
Brush your tongue.,
Use a special device.,
Understand the benefits.",How to Clean Your Whole Mouth2," The most common and easiest way to clean your tongue is just by using your toothbrush. Brush your tongue from the back to the front to help remove plaque and discourage the growth of bacteria and the development of bad breath.Do not apply too much pressure when you brush your tongue.
Go over your tongue with the toothbrush four or five times.

, Although most people just brush their tongue with a toothbrush, these brushes are designed to work best on the smooth surfaces of your teeth. The bumpy and fleshy surface of your tongue is very different. Probably the best way to remove the coating of bacteria on the tongue is through scraping rather than brushing.


It is possible to buy a device designed specifically for cleaning your tongue if you think using your toothbrush is not as effective as you would like.Tongue-scrapers can be used after you have brushed your teeth and flossed. You can find them in some health stores, pharmacies and online., Although less emphasis is placed on cleaning the tongue than cleaning the teeth in oral care, up to 50% of the bacteria in your mouth will live on your tongue.Because of this, cleaning the tongue is an important part in the full oral care and should be included in an oral hygiene routine that cleans your whole mouth. Up to 80 or 90% of bad breath is thought to result from the bacteria on the tongue, so tackling this with good oral hygiene will lower the chances of you suffering halitosis."
"
Rinse with your mouth with mouthwash.,
Choose a therapeutic mouthwash.,
Understand the importance of oral hygiene.",How to Clean Your Whole Mouth3," You can use mouthwash to make sure you reach every corner of your mouth. Mouthwash should never be used as an alternative to brushing and flossing, but it can be used as an additional cleaning method. Often people use mouthwash after brushing and flossing, but it makes no difference in what order you perform the three oral hygiene tasks.Try using mouthwash before going to bed to help protect your teeth from bacteria while you sleep.
Specific products will have detailed instructions on how they should be used, but generally you will swish the liquid around in your mouth for thirty seconds to a minute before spitting it out., You will find that there are a wide variety of mouthwashes available to buy in your local drug store or pharmacy. Therapeutic Mouthwash products can help you to reduce plaque, cavities, bad breath and conditions such as gingivitis. The alternative Cosmetic mouthwashes will not be as effective. They may temporarily control bad breath, but don't tackle the root causes or contribute to your broader oral hygiene.Look for a mouthwash that has a mark or seal from an official dental professional body endorsing it.
Marked products have been assessed by experts and tested for effectiveness., If you don't look after and clean your mouth, you risk developing gum infections, gum disease, cavities and tooth loss. The best way to care for your gums is to care for your teeth and mouth by brushing and flossing regularly. If you allow plaque to develop on your teeth, you may suffer from problems with your gums. If plaque is not removed it may harden into tartar, a substance which can only be removed by your dentist or dental hygienist."
"
Consider a professional dental cleaning.,
Know what to expect.,
Don't consider it a one-off.",How to Clean Your Whole Mouth4," One way to ensure you have a clean mouth is to visit your dentist or your dental hygienist and get a full dental cleaning. A dental cleaning will thoroughly and effectively use a professional brushing method to remove built up plaque and tartar, leaving your teeth feeling smooth and clean. The freshly clean and smooth surface of the teeth will make it harder for bacteria to fasten to your teeth, helping you keep your teeth clean after your visit., The dental hygienist will use small dental tools, including a scraper, brush and a mirror. The hygienist might begin with an ultrasonic device which uses vibrations to knock loose larger pieces of tartar.Next, she will use a scraping instrument on your teeth to remove plaque. After this, the hygienist will brush your teeth with a specialised brush and toothpaste.


After brushing, the hygienist, will floss and talk you through good oral hygiene practices.If you have opted for an extra fluoride treatment, this will take a few minutes and will work to strengthen and harden your teeth., Having a professional cleaning can help you maintain good oral hygiene and instill you with good dental care habits. Consider making visits to the dental hygienist a regular part of your dental care programme. Although people have been recommended to have cleanings twice a year, recent research suggests that once a year is sufficient for those who do not exhibit specific risk factors of tooth decay and gum disease.


Key gum disease risk factors include smoking, diabetes, and genetics.Ask your dentist if you are unsure about whether you are at an elevated risk of gum disease.

Drink plenty of water.Dehydration is one of the most common causes of dry mouth.,
Avoid or limit caffeinated beverages.Caffeine is a diuretic, which means it promotes fluid loss.,
Eat sour foods.Sour foods stimulate the salivary glands, so consuming these can help if you are struggling with dry mouth.,
Add sauces and gravies to your dishes.,
Eat soft, moist foods.These foods will require less chewing, and be more comfortable to swallow than dry, crunchy, or chewy foods like tough meats and crusty breads.,
Sip water when you eat.Because dry mouths lack saliva, the condition can make it more difficult or painful to swallow food.",How to Cope With Dry Mouth1," Sipping water can also help to relieve dry mouth when it is caused by disease or as a side effect of medication.Doctors recommend drinking eight to twelve 8-ounce glasses of water each day to keep hydrated.Drinking too much water, however, can actually dissolve the mucus lining of the mouth and worsen the symptoms of dry mouth. If you feel the need to drink excessive amounts of water to soothe your dry mouth, ask a doctor about other options.
You can also dissolve (not crunch) ice chips in your mouth in addition to sipping water.;
, For this reason, caffeine can worsen the symptoms of dry mouth. Make sure to drink plenty of water and avoid coffee, tea, and certain sodas if you suffer from dry mouth.

, Some sour foods (such as citrus fruits) are also good sources of vitamin C.


Too much acid from sour foods, however, can wear away the enamel of your teeth, increasing your risk of tooth decay. To reduce this risk, sip water as you eat sour foods.

, If you suffer from dry mouth, your ability to swallow solid foods may be affected. Try adding liquid-based additives like sauces and gravies to your recipes to make “rough” solid foods easier to swallow., Good choices include:


Yogurt
Pudding
Canned fruit
Mashed vegetables
Casseroles made with a broth or sauce base
Thinned cereals, such as oatmeal
Soups and stews
Fruit smoothies
Soft cooked meats such as boiled chicken

, If you make sure to sip water while eating, however, it can make things easier and help keep you hydrated. Try taking a sip of water, then a bite of food, then have another sip of water.

See your dentist more regularly.",How to Determine if a Tooth Needs to Be Pulled," Tooth decay refers to any deterioration in the physical tooth surfaces — including cavities — often caused by plaque (bacteria feeding on substances leftover from eating, especially sugary or processed foods) eroding the enamel. This eventually causes inflammation of the inner pulp of the tooth. Decay, if left unchecked, can put deep holes in the tooth and cause infection, leading to extraction.You can see signs of decay or damage by looking carefully in a mirror under good lighting.
Check for discoloration on the tooth surface.
Look for missing pieces or unusual marks on the tooth.
See if the gums around the tooth are red, swollen, tender, painful, and/or bleeding.
You may also notice a filling surrounded by black, which may be a secondary decay located at the margins of your filling.;
, If a permanent tooth is loose, this may indicate some damage or trauma was suffered in the immediate area. If the tooth falls out on its own, save it in a clean container and bring it to your dentist.

, If your gums around particular teeth are red, painful, swollen, and/or bleed frequently then you may have gum disease and/or an infection that will lead to an extraction.Look for gums that have pulled away from the tooth.
Persistent bad breath can be a sign of gum disease.
Pay attention to any changes in the way your teeth fit when you bite.
Notice you feel any type of mobility of your teeth when you bite. In some cases you may feel an opposing force from a tooth when you bite, similar to a spring that has a force on it. This may be due to an infection at the end of the root
If you wear dentures, be aware of any changes in their fit.
This can become a more advanced form of gum disease called periodontitis as further bone and tissue loss leads to looser teeth.

, A common reason for tooth extraction is when a tooth is trying to break through the gum. One of the most common occurrences of this is when ""wisdom"" teeth are coming in.If you have a fever and notice swelling, pus, and/or feel pain around the area where the tooth should be emerging, it could be a sign of an abscess and require attention as soon as possible.
Swollen tonsils and swallowing difficulties will appear when lower wisdom teeth are involved.
Ask your dentist about the risks of keeping the wisdom teeth in or removing them.

, Another reason for tooth extraction occurs when the process of orthodontics (to properly align one's teeth) needs to move forward, but is hindered by the amount of room in the patient's mouth.Braces work by placing a small brackets (metal, ceramic, or plastic) on each tooth and holding them together with wires. Sometimes additional fixtures like oral bands are used on the teeth that serve as an anchor for the wires and exterior head gear are used for more severe bite corrections. Spacers are used between the teeth that need to make room for the bands.Ask your orthodontist about newer and more cosmetic varieties of braces that are just as effective, but less intrusive on the patient's daily life.
Braces are usually worn by a patient for a duration of one to three years.
Talk with an orthodontist about braces and any steps that will need to be taken once the braces are removed. She will make a determination if an extraction is necessary to make room in the patient's mouth during the procedure.

, If one or more teeth show signs of decay and/or damage, your gums are showing signs of infection, or these areas are giving you pain, then a dentist needs to determine the cause. If your condition is extreme and no dentist is available in a timely fashion, you can consider going to your local emergency room.


Before going to an emergency room or to your dentist, make sure they have x-ray equipment. If not, search for a dental x-ray center in order to save valuable time. Every tooth which is not extremely loose requires x-ray before extraction.
If you suffered any injury to cause the possible need for extraction, let your dentist know.
If your tooth has already fallen out or lost any portions that you managed to save, bring them along. This will help give your dentist an idea of what is left to be extracted.

, Copies of any insurance, discount cards, medical records (or contact information to get them) and identification should all be brought to dental visits.


Make sure you inform your dental provider with up to date information regarding medication you are on. He will need to know in case an extraction is the chosen course of action and uses anesthetic and/or painkillers later.

, The dentist will diagnose any oral condition you may be suffering as a result of problems with your teeth and/or gums. You will need to consult with her to make the final determination if extraction is necessary, or if another course of action can be taken.Report to the dentist any incident(s) that may have caused the tooth's decay or damage.
Provide the dentist any tooth or parts of tooth you may have saved.
Submit to an oral x-ray of your mouth if recommended.

, Know what to expect if extraction is indeed the recommended course of action.Either version of the extraction procedure will first involve injecting local anesthetic near the extraction area to numb it. Review any medical problems, such as allergies or adverse reactions you may have with anesthesia, if necessary.
The most common type of tooth pulling procedure is a ""simple extraction"" in which the tooth is easily visible in the mouth. The dentist loosens the tooth with what is called an ""elevator."" Then the dentist uses another tool — forceps —to remove the tooth.
Surgical extractions are used for broken or hidden teeth — and are usually performed by oral surgeons, though some regular dentists will perform the procedure. The dentist/surgeon must cut into the gum and sometimes cut away some of the bone around the tooth and cut the tooth itself in order to remove it.

, These risks include problems with the physical procedure and aftermath risk with infection.A problem called a dry socket occurs in a small percentage of patients. This happens when the bone under the removed tooth is exposed to contamination if a blood clot doesn't remain in place after extraction. This can also occur after a very difficult extraction that caused the bone and blood vessels to expand.
The dentist can accidentally damage neighboring teeth or jaw.
The sinuses in the nearby area can be damaged. They will usually heal themselves, but more extreme cases would require additional surgery.
Soreness in the extraction area or jaw.
Numbness in the extraction area or jaw. This can be long-lasting or permanent if there is nerve damage.
In some cases of anesthesia required for the extraction of upper front teeth up to premolars you may experience double vision or eyesight disorder for about an hour

, This will take a combination of caring for the area the tooth was extracted and pain management. Consult closely with your dentist on keeping up dental hygiene, and spotting warning signs if the affected area is not healing correctly.After the extraction your dentist will have placed gauze in the area to let a blood clot form. Change this pad early to avoid it becoming soaked with blood, but then leave it two to three hours to allow the blood clot to remain and stabilize in the socket.
Take your dentist's prescribed painkillers as instructed.
Keep ice bags around to apply to your face and reduce swelling. You may try applying the ice for 10-minute intervals.
Avoid excessive physical activity, harsh mouthwashes, spitting, drinking from straws, smoking, eating hard foods, and lying too flat when resting for the day or two after the extraction. In addition, avoid heat in the area and do not sleep on that side, especially not propped up on your hands. Try to sleep faced up on a higher position by placing two pillows underneath your head.

, Problems are most likely to start at the extraction location, though some symptoms can be more general.Your dentist may place sutures in order to help and fasten the healing but also to protect the blood clot. They should be removed after seven days.
Let your dentist know if you have signs of infection such as fever, chills, and/or redness at the extraction location.
If you feel nausea and/or experience vomiting soon after the procedure, also let your dentist know.
If you feel short of breath, have bouts of coughing, and/or start suffering chest pains within a short time of the procedure, then let the dentist know immediately.

, If you were not already regularly brushing your teeth, flossing, and rinsing with mouthwash in order to prevent tooth decay and gum disease, then it is at least as important to do so after an extraction. The same techniques generally will work apart from some extra care in the week or two immediately after the extraction procedure.Ask your dentist if she recommends any particular variety of toothpaste and toothbrush for your condition — especially after an extraction.
Brush twice a day, including once before you go to bed.
When brushing and flossing, don't neglect your back teeth.
You should keep mouthwash or a dental rinse as part of the hygiene regimen. Some will instruct you to rinse before the brushing phase, some are to be used after the brushing phase.

, Eating balanced meals and reduced snacking can cut down on the sugars and other stain-leaving foods and drinks that frequently damage teeth.


You don't have to eliminate things like coffee, teas, sodas, sugary snacks from your diet — but consume them in moderation.
Ask your dentist about varieties of toothpaste or cleaning procedures that might help stave off decay in addition to regular efforts.

, Having check-ups and cleaning by your dentist and dental hygienist on a schedule can maintain the health of your teeth and gums.


These check-ups, often called prophylaxis, can also spot potential problems early and allow your dentist and you to come up with a plan to deal with them before they become more severe.
If you have dental insurance or a discount plan, consult with them on how often they will cover these visits.

Maintain good oral hygiene.Poor oral hygiene can cause dry mouth by allowing the build up of bacteria and plaque.,
Use an oral rinse.,
Chew sugar-free gum or candies.,
Use over-the-counter saliva substitutes.Various sprays and other products are available that can supply you with an artificial saliva substitute if you suffer from dry mouth.,
Use a humidifier.,
Breathe through your nose.One of the most common causes of dry mouth is simply breathing through your mouth, which causes more moisture to escape.,
Protect dry lips.Dry mouth can also be associated with dry or cracked lips, which can make the condition more uncomfortable.,
Avoid using tobacco products.Smoking cigarettes or chewing tobacco can affect the amount of saliva your mouth produces.",How to Cope With Dry Mouth2," In addition, dry mouth itself can increase your risk of cavities and other oral health problems. Make sure to:


See your dentist regularly for check ups and cleanings.
Brush your teeth after each meal, and floss regularly.
Avoid sugary food and drinks.

, Over-the-counter (OTC) mouthwashes can help kill bacteria and fight plaque build-up. Use one at least twice a day, but make sure that it is alcohol-free, since alcohol-based formulas may worsen dry mouth.Your dentist may also recommend a prescription-strength fluoride rinse to protect your teeth, and/or a rinse that is specifically meant to treat dry mouth.

, Chewing or sucking on certain substances can promote saliva production and soothe dry mouth. Sugar-free gums, candies, mints, etc. can help in this way without increasing your chance of developing cavities or other oral health problems.Xylitol, which is often found in sugar-free gums and candies, can cause diarrhea or cramps is consumed in large quantities.

, These are available at most pharmacies. Look for one that contains xylitol, carboxymethylcellulose, or hydroxyethyl cellulose.

See a doctor or a dentist.,
Get a prescription for a secretagogue.In some cases, your doctor may prescribe a medication designed to treat dry mouth.,
Talk to your doctor about all medications you are taking.,
Follow your doctor’s instructions.",How to Cope With Dry Mouth3," If your dry mouth is persistent and at-home remedies haven’t done the trick, it is time to see a professional. Discuss your full medical history with your doctor. Numerous conditions, diseases, and syndromes can cause dry mouth, including:Diabetes
Parkinson’s disease
Sjögren’s syndrome
Sicca syndrome
Certain forms of radiation therapy Some dental surgeries, like having your wisdom teeth removed
The use of some medications, including antihistamines, decongestants, painkillers, blood pressure treatments, antidepressants, and many others

, Currently, there are a few options:


Cevimeline is approved to treat dry mouth caused by Sjögren’s syndrome.
Pilocarpine is approved to treat dry mouth caused by Sjögren’s syndrome as well as by radiation therapy.
Amifostine protects against the damage of radiation, and studies show that it can reduce the severity of dry mouth for many patients.

, Since dry mouth is often caused as a side-effect of medications, you doctor should review any that you are taking. If your dry mouth is severe, he or she may be able to write a prescription for a different medication to eliminate one that is causing the problem. In some cases, the irritation associated with dry mouth outweighs the intended benefits of the medication.

, In many cases, your problem may be chronic or reoccurring. If you doctor tells you to take a prescription or to use a fluoride treatment for a period of time, follow his or her instructions even if your dry mouth goes away after a couple of days.

Insert your aligners.",How to Clean Invisalign1," Take out the Invisalign according to the instructions you received from your dentist. Unlike metal braces which need to be cleaned around, Invisalign must be cleaned on the outside of your mouth.;
, Use toothpaste and a soft toothbrush, just as you would when brushing your own teeth. Gently brush away any food particles on both sides of the aligner. Clean it thoroughly.

, Run the Invisalign under a steady stream of lukewarm water to rinse off any toothpaste and mouthwash. Allow the Invisalign to dry on a clean towel before putting it back onto your teeth.


Never rinse your Invisalign with hot water, as this could melt and permanently damage the aligners.
Some dentists recommend not using toothpaste, as it often contains abrasive ingredients that leave scratches on your trays. Over time, the aligners become more visible. If this is a concern, brush with water only, or using a mild dish detergent., While the Invisalign is out of your mouth to be cleaned, be sure to brush your bare teeth. Floss as well, to keep food particles and bacteria from hiding between your teeth. Keeping your teeth clean and healthy will help to keep the Invisalign pieces clean.

, Once the aligners have dried, you can reinsert them as directed by your dentist.

Try a desensitization process on your gag reflex.,
Distract yourself from anticipating your gag reflex.,
Breathe through your nose while cleaning your tongue.,
Clean your tongue on an empty stomach.,
Do the best you can to clean your tongue.",How to Clean Your Tongue Without Gagging1," While you might assume that your gag reflex is set in stone, it may in fact be possible for you to retrain and reduce it. Basically, you want to slowly and steadily take yourself to your gagging limit, which will over time creep further back on your tongue.Stick your tongue out as far as possible, and press it down against the bottom of your mouth.
Start to to gently work your brush or scraper back from the tip of your tongue.
When you just begin to feel the beginning of your gag reflex, stop moving back and gently massage that area of the tongue for ten seconds.
Repeat this process once or twice per day, and you may find that you are able push your gag threshold further back in your mouth over time.;
, Especially if you’re anxious or have had problems with gagging before, you may begin feeling an anticipatory gag reflex before you actually reach your threshold. See if you can instead take your mind off what you’re doing.Try humming a tune while you clean, or even just try saying “aaaaahhhhh” like you might when the doctor checks your throat.
Make a tight fist with your thumb tucked inside. There is an element of distraction through pain here, but also some evidence that accessing a pressure point in your palm can actually reduce your gag reflex., For many people, breathing through the mouth seems to increase the gag reflex. Focus on breathing through your nose while cleaning your mouth, and see if your results improve.Taking shallower, more rapid breaths can also help reduce the gag reflex in some people., While the correlation is not universal nor entirely clear, your gag reflex may increase in proportion to the fullness of your stomach. Essentially, if you’ve just eaten a big breakfast, you may gag more easily than you would have before the meal.Also, if gagging causes you to vomit, there are obvious practical benefits to not having a full stomach at the time.

, Your tongue can harbor up to 40,000 types of bacteria at any one time, many of which can cause bad breath and potentially lead to a range of other more serious dental and medical concerns. Most of the bacteria hang out on the back of your tongue, but if you simply can’t get back that far without gagging, at least clean the parts of your tongue you can tolerate. You’ll still be improving your oral health.While it can’t clear away the caked on layers of tongue bacteria like a good scraper or brush, an antimicrobial mouthwash (like Listerine) can kill a significant number of mouth bacteria.While best used in combination with proper tongue cleaning, antimicrobial rinses alone are better than nothing for those with severe gagging issues.

Take an over-the-counter pain medication.,
Rest an ice pack on the pain.,
Rinse with warm salt water.,
Rub on some topical antiseptic gel.,
Apply clove oil to a sore tooth.",How to Fight Mouth Infection1," While antibiotics are not commonly given for most mouth infections, if you have a severe infection or abscess, you may be prescribed a pill or topical ointment. Follow your dentist’s instructions for taking or applying this medication. Some treatments include:



Antimicrobial mouthwash: like normal mouthwash, you will gargle this before spitting it out into the sink.

Oral antibiotics: these are pills that you swallow by mouth.

Antiseptic chip, antibiotic gel, or antibiotic microspheres: these are applied or implanted by a dentist or periodontist if the infection is not too advanced and is located near one or two teeth. They slowly release medication over time. Follow your doctor’s advice for treating these properly.;
, If you have pain from a toothache or abscess, you can take pain medication such as ibuprofen (which includes Advil and Motrin) or acetaminophen (which includes Tylenol). Follow the directions on the box.


A common folk remedy calls for you to apply the pill directly to your gums or toothache. This is not advised as the medication may cause burning or irritation to your gums causing even more trouble and discomfort. Always swallow the pill.Check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking over-the-counter medicine to make sure that it will not conflict with any current medications that you are taking. Inform your dentist and pharmacist of any allergies you may have.

, Toothaches can cause pain not only in your gums and teeth but also in your jaw, ear, and neck.Prepare an ice pack, and press it against the sore area until the pain starts to disappear.You can make an ice pack by filling a quart-sized plastic bag with ice, and wrapping it in a dish towel pressing it on the cheek where the pain is. You can also find reusable ice packs available at pharmacies or convenience stores.

, Salt water rinses may give you some minor pain relief while preventing bacterial infection after dental surgeries.Stir ½ teaspoon of salt into eight-ounces of warm water until dissolved. Rinse your mouth with the water for 15 to 30 seconds before spitting out. Do not swallow., Benzocaine gel can help reduce pain in toothaches and other painful mouth conditions.Put a small drop on your finger or on a cotton ball. Gently apply to the affected tooth or area. Follow the dosage information on the box very carefully. Use the smallest amount necessary to cover the affected area. Keep it on for about 10 to 15 minutes and avoid swallowing during the procedure. If the gum turns red or it starts to burn, then remove the gel right away and rinse.


You can buy benzocaine over the counter at pharmacies or drug stores.
Do not eat within an hour of using benzocaine in your mouth.
If you develop a headache, fatigue, confusion, fast heart rate, shortness of breath, or a gray/blue color in your skin, lips, and nails, seek medical attention immediately. You may have a rare side effect called Methemoglobinemia., Clove oil may be able to reduce the pain of the tooth while you heal. Apply a drop or two of clove oil to a cotton ball.

Put the appropriate amount of crystals (or a tablet) into the warm water.,
Add your inserts and let them soak for 15 minutes.,
Remove the aligners and rinse thoroughly in warm water.,
Reinsert your Invisaligns.",How to Clean Invisalign2," Sonic or ultrasonic cleaning systems work in conjunction with soluble crystals. They create a cleansing solution that agitates the aligners to dislodge microorganisms and kill bacteria that ordinary brushing cannot remove., Make sure you use the amount suggested in the product instructions.

, You may have to measure it, or the crystals may come pre-measured in packets or tablets that dissolve.

, At this point, don't forget to brush and floss your own teeth. Your aligners are only as clean as your teeth.

, The cleansing solutions are intended for your inserts, not your mouth. Rinsing afterwards helps reduce the chance of an allergic reaction from one of the ingredients.Rinse your hands and the sonic appliance as well.

, Once they've dried, put your aligners back into your mouth.

To remove bacteria, try a hydrogen-peroxide solution.,
Remove tartar and kill microorganisms with a vinegar solution.,
Remember to brush and floss your teeth before reinserting your Invisaligns.",How to Clean Invisalign3," Dilute hydrogen peroxide with warm tap water in a 1:1 ratio. Soak your aligners for at least 30 minutes, then rinse thoroughly with warm water.


Note that hydrogen peroxide will not remove plaque build-up.

, Mix equal parts white distilled vinegar and warm water, and submerge your aligners. Let them soak for 15-30 minutes. After, brush gently with a soft toothbrush and rinse with warm water.The vinegar smell will disappear soon, don't worry.

, Whichever home soak you use, take advantage of the break to clean your teeth thoroughly before putting your aligners back in.

Use a soft-bristled toothbrush or a specially designed tongue brush.,
Find your most comfortable tongue brushing pattern.,
Rinse your mouth with water.,
Brush your tongue before or after you brush your teeth.",How to Clean Your Tongue Without Gagging2," In either case, moisten the brush with water and rinse it periodically while cleaning. You want to clean your tongue thoroughly, but not make it bleed and/or cause short-term damage to your taste buds, so don’t use a hard-bristled brush or scrub too aggressively.You don’t need to add toothpaste, or any other product than water.

, Your natural inclination will probably be to brush in a parallel direction to your tongue — that is, from tip to back and back to tip. If you can do it this way without gagging, that’s fine; if not, consider circular or perpendicular techniques.Brushing in small, circular motions may allow you to ease further back on your tongue without engaging your gag reflex — as opposed to what happens when you’re jabbing the brush towards the back of your throat.
Perpendicular (or side-to-side) brushing also prevents the brush from poking towards the back of your throat. With this method, you’ll have more control over exactly how far back on your tongue the brush reaches., Antimicrobial rinses (like Listerine) may help further reduce mouth bacteria,but using plain, clean water to rinse out your mouth is perfectly acceptable. Remember that you’re trying to expel this loosened tongue bacteria, so spit out the water instead of swallowing it., Either pattern works equally well; the important thing is to clean both these parts of your mouth frequently. If you brush your tongue as often as you brush your teeth, you’ll reduce the amount of buildup you need to clean off.If your tongue feels raw or bleeds, give it a day or two to recover. Instead of reducing your cleaning frequency long-term, though, try not pressing as hard or find a softer brush (or a scraper).

Choose a tongue scraper that suits your needs.,
Extend your tongue while pressing it to the floor of your mouth.,
Scrape your tongue only from back to front.,
Rinse and repeat as part of your regular oral hygiene regimen.",How to Clean Your Tongue Without Gagging3," Tongue scrapers come in many shapes and sizes, but if you have a strong gag reflex, a low-profile model is likely your best bet. Scrapers that get closer to the roof of your mouth are more likely to trigger your gag reflex.

If even small scrapers are problematic for you, you can try using dental floss instead. Its ultra-low profile on your tongue should help keep your gag reflex at bay.You can even try wrapping a clean, damp, thin washcloth over your first two fingers and using that as your homemade scraper.

, The more of your tongue you can get away from the back and roof of your mouth, the better. In addition to helping keep your gag reflex at bay, this also enables you to place the scraper more precisely and see your progress more clearly., Place the scraper on your tongue as far back as you comfortably can, and draw it along the surface until you pass beyond the tip of your tongue. Make firm contact, but don’t press as though you’re trying to scrape paint off a surface.You’ll probably pull a lot of gunk off of your tongue, so rinse the scraper with clean water after each pass. Repeat the process until you’ve covered as much of your tongue as your gag reflex will permit.

, Rinse and spit with clean water or an antimicrobial mouthwash after you finish scraping. You can and should scrape your tongue every time you brush (either before or after brushing).

Brushing or scraping your tongue are equally effective at reducing bacterial buildup, so it’s not important which technique works best for you — what is important is that you clean your tongue regularly."

Brush your teeth twice a day.,
Floss daily.,
Gargle mouthwash.,
Avoid problematic foods.,
Quit smoking.,
Visit the dentist regularly.",How to Fight Mouth Infection2," Brushing your teeth daily is an important way to prevent cavities and infections. You should brush your teeth in the morning and at night. To brush, hold your toothbrush at a 45-degree angle to your tooth, and make small back-and-forth motions followed by vertical movements to brush the gums on your tooth surface so you can prevent gum recession. Move the brush around the front, back, and bottom of your teeth. Don’t forget to reach back into your mouth. Perform circular motions on the chewing surfaces of your teeth. Keep brushing for at least two minutes. Use a fluoride toothpaste and a brush with medium to soft bristles.You should brush your tongue as well as your teeth to reduce bacteria in your mouth.
Replace your toothbrush every three to four months to prevent the build-up of bacteria.

, Plaque is a substance that forms between your teeth. If left unattended, plaque can cause cavities, tooth abscesses, or gum disease.To floss, tear off about 18 inches of floss, and hold it tightly between both thumbs and forefingers. Gently rub the floss up between your teeth, working it up until it moves between the tooth and the gumline line. Floss should not snap or jab into teeth, so use light pressure, but expect a small amount of bleeding., Fluoride mouthwash is important to help prevent tooth decay. If you have an infection, your dentist may even prescribe you a special antibiotic mouthwash. Once a day, gargle a mouthful of mouthwash for 30 seconds before spitting it out into the sink. Do not swallow., Acid can wear down the enamel on your teeth, leaving your teeth vulnerable to cavities and infections while sugar encourages the growth of bacteria.To prevent future infections, you should reduce your consumption of both acidic and sugary foods and drinks.These include:


Sodas
Citrus
Fruit juice
Coffee
Candy, particularly gummy candy
Wine
Beer, Smoking can dry out your mouth, leading to a host of medical problems, including mouth or throat cancer. It may also discolor your tongue and cause a condition called ""Hairy Tongue.""The best way to ensure both your dental and physical health is to quit smoking.

, You should see your dentist at least once or twice a year for a check-up and cleaning. During this visit, your dentist can diagnose any new infections before they become serious. They can also provide a thorough cleaning, preventing further mouth infections and decay."

Pain along the jaw, ear, or neck.
Soreness of the gums.
Mouth sores or cuts.
Chewing or swallowing problems.

, There are many different types of symptoms that may manifest in mouth infections. These can all signal that something is wrong with your mouth. Some common symptoms include:


Red or swollen gums.
Bleeding gums.
Bad breath.
Dry mouth.
Difficulty swallowing.
Fever.
Loose teeth., To help your dentist find the most accurate diagnosis, you should keep a record of when your symptoms occur. Writing down these details—either in a notebook, planner, or in your phone—can help you remember the specifics of your condition. Write down:


When symptoms occur.
How long symptoms last for.
What activities you are doing when symptoms flare up.
What you have eaten recently.
When do they calm down and medication that calms the pain.

, Only your dentist can give a proper diagnosis and treatment for mouth infection. As mouth infection can include many different types of infections and diseases, it is important to be screened regularly to catch the infection in its early stages. Common mouth infections include:



Oral Thrush: a fungal infection that is caused by the same bacteria that causes diaper rash and yeast infections.Gingivitis: the early stages of gum disease marked by tender, swallowed, or bleeding gums.

Periodontal Disease: the late stages of gum disease that causes bone loss, bleeding or receding gums and tooth loss.Cavity/Tooth decay: weakened enamel caused by a build-up of plaque on your teeth, which creates acid erosion.Tooth abscess: an infected tooth caused by tooth decay, gum disease, or a cracked tooth., If your infection is severe, you may have to undergo a procedure or surgery to correct the problem. You may even be referred to a specialized doctor such as a periodontist or an endodontist. Follow your dentist’s advice to receive the best care for your infection. Some common procedures include:



Tooth extraction: the infected tooth is removed.

Drainage: fluid that has built up in the gums or tooth is drained by the dentist.Root canal: infected root pulp is removed from the tooth, and the tooth is then filled with a rubber-like substance and antiseptic paste.Flap surgery: the gums are pulled back so that the surgeon can remove tartar, necrotic cementum, and infection from deep within the gums.Bone or tooth grafts: natural or synthetic bone is implanted to help promote bone growth."

Take one dose of an anti-worm medication.,
Take another dose at the two week mark.After two weeks have passed, you will be directed to take one more dose of the same anti-worm medication.,
Treat everyone in the household.Since threadworms are so easily passed from one person to another, your doctor will likely recommend that everyone in the household be treated with two doses of the anti-worm medication.,
Know that medication is your best bet.,
Understand how threadworms are spread.Threadworms can be transmitted from person-to-person contact with an infected person, as well as from touching objects that may be contaminated with eggs such as a toilet seat, bedding, or other things.,
Wash toilet seats daily.Because eggs are laid around the anal area, it is important to clean the toilet seats at least once a day to avoid contaminating others with threadworm eggs, and also to avoid re-infecting yourself with more eggs.,
Wash your hands regularly, especially if you are infected.Pay particular attention to washing your hands both before meals and/or food preparation, as well as after using the toilet.,
Change your bed sheets at least twice a week.In order to effectively get rid of threadworms, you need to change and wash your sheets to get rid of any eggs that may be present.,
Avoid scratching around the anus.Because female worms migrate toward the anus and lay eggs there, the anus can become particularly irritated and itchy.,
Recognize the symptoms of a threadworm infection.The sooner you can catch the infection the better, as that way you can start medical treatment and hygienic prevention measures at home as soon as possible.,
Administer a ""tape test.,
Opt for treatment anyway if you live in the same household.It is key to understand that if you are in the same household as someone diagnosed with threadworms, you will be advised to take the medication (and to practice the hygienic measures) without needing to be formally diagnosed with threadworms.",How to Get Rid of Threadworms," Your doctor will prescribe (or recommend an over-the-counter version of) an anti-worm medication. Some examples include Mebendazole, Pyrantel permeate, and Albendazole.You will be directed to take one dose of one of these medications (follow the specific instructions of your doctor) and then to wait two weeks.


The way this medication works is that it kills off any adult worms. They are all eradicated, except for the eggs which will remain in your system.;
, The purpose of this second dose is to kill any new worms that have formed as a result of the eggs. The two week timing is extremely important, as it catches the worms at just the right phase in their lifecycle so as to kill all of them without needing any further doses after this one.

, It is better to be safe rather than sorry, and to prevent the hassle of someone in the household showing signs of an infection just after the initial person was cured.

, This is especially true if you are treating pinworm infections in children.Although pinworms can technically be treated with six weeks of very strict hygiene measures (because the lifecycle of the worm is six weeks), it is very challenging to adhere by these strict standards at home, particularly if children are involved.


The benefit of medication is that it is extremely effective at clearing the infection in two weeks.
Hygienic measures can then be used as a means to prevent re-occurence or subsequent infections down the road.

, Therefore, excellent hygienic measures at home are key to preventing the spread of threadworms to everyone who lives in the household, as well as to supporting a cure for the person who was initially infected.

, Clean with water and regular household cleaners (no special products are needed). Use gloves when you clean to keep your hands clean.

, This will help to get rid of the threadworms faster by preventing spread of the infection.

, It is also important to wash your pyjamas regularly (or whatever you sleep in), as well as the clothes you have been wearing, for the same reason of avoiding re-contaminating yourself with eggs. This will help to clear up the infection faster by removing eggs that will simply continue the lifecycle of the threadworm, making it more challenging for you to regain your health and wellbeing.

, People, especially children, may be tempted to scratch around the anus to alleviate the itch. However, this is one of the worst things you can do, because your hands then immediately become contaminated with eggs, which will spread to everything you touch after that. Therefore, to reduce the spread and transmission of threadworm eggs, avoid scratching around the anus.


Also avoid applying ointments or creams to the anal area in an effort to soothe it. This may cause the female worms to lay eggs higher up in your rectum or colon, which makes the problem worse not better.

, Common signs and symptoms include:


Itching and irritation around the anus
Potential signs of irritation or infection on the skin around the anus (particularly in children, who are more likely to scratch there which can lead to an infection from broken skin)
Difficulty sleeping (due to anal itchiness)
Irritability (from itchiness and poor sleep)
Sometimes vaginal itchiness or irritation in girls (as on rare occasions the female worm can enter the vagina rather than the anus).

,""If you suspect you or someone in your household may have threadworms, contact your doctor as soon as possible. As previously mentioned, rapid diagnosis and treatment is key to getting rid of the infection as soon as possible. For a tape test, the doctor will ask you to take a piece of cellophane tape and press the stick-side against the skin surrounding the anus. Remove the tape and put it in a plastic bag and give it to your doctor, who will check under the microscope for the presence of eggs. Eggs can only be visualized under the microscope. A test positive for eggs is diagnostic for a threadworm infection.


Do the tape test first thing in the morning, before showering or using the toilet.
Make sure you wear gloves and wash your hands thoroughly to avoid spreading the eggs. Don't let the tape touch anything, either!

, This is because your risk is high enough, so it is better to be safe than sorry and the benefits of treatment far outweigh the risks.

Purge the flosser before and after use.,
Run diluted vinegar through the flosser.,
Rinse the flosser.,
Leave the reservoir unattached.",How to Clean a Waterpik2," Remove the reservoir. Run the flosser for at least ten seconds with the reservoir removed. Turn off the unit. Wipe down with a paper towel the cavity where the reservoir sits on the unit. Replace the reservoir sitting at an angle, so that the inner cavity and tubes can air dry.This will remove the extra air and water, to prevent bacteria and microorganisms.

, Mix sixteen ounces of warm water with two to four tablespoons of white vinegar. Pour this solution into the reservoir. Run the Waterpik so that half of the solution goes out. Turn the unit off. Put the handle of the Waterpik in the sink and let the rest of the solution drain for twenty minutes through the handle.Disinfect your unit with this solution every one to three months.
The vinegar solution removes mineral buildup from hard water.Vinegar’s acid content kills bacteria and breaks down grease.
Instead of diluted vinegar, you can use diluted mouthwash at a ratio of one part mouthwash to one part water., Run out any of the vinegar solution that is left. Fill the reservoir with warm water. Run the tankful of warm water through the flosser into the sink., Place the disconnected reservoir on the counter. Alternately, place it on the unit at an angle, so that the internal cavity is exposed. Allow the parts to air dry.Leave the reservoir unattached until the next time you use your Waterpik.

Drink herbal teas.,
Eat seeds.,
Take activated charcoal.",How to Get Rid of Gas and Bloating1," Herbs such as chamomile,peppermint,gingercan help to soothe the stomach and ease digestion. Try drinking a cup of one of these herbs in tea-form first thing in the morning and after your evening meal each day.Peppermint tea contains menthol, which soothes the muscles of the digestive tract. Combine water and the peppermint tea and let it sit for 10–15 minutes before drinking. Do not add sugar.
Ginger tea may relieve bloating, heartburn, and gas. Use one ginger root, hot water, lemon juice, and honey. Cut the ginger into four to six pieces, add water, and one teaspoon of honey and lemon juice. Let it sit for 10 minutes. Drink a glass before or after your meal.;
, Munching on caraway, fennel or anise seeds may help to eliminate gas and relieve bloating.Anise also helps to ease stomach cramps, thanks to its anti-spasmodic properties. Try eating a pinch or two of either of these seeds after a large meal.Anise seeds may help with digestion. Combine one teaspoon of ground anise seeds with hot water. Let it sit for 10–15 minutes and then strain. Drink the solution before or after your meal.

, Activated charcoal is a dietary supplement that may reduce intestinal gas and relieve bloating.It is available at pharmacies and health food stores and should be taken according to the instructions on the label.


Take activated charcoal with 8 ounces of water at least one and a half to two hours after eating. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using activated charcoal — it can affect how other medications are absorbed by the body and decrease their effectiveness.
You can also try pads, underwear, and cushions that contain charcoal to reduce odor when you pass gas."

Determine what foods cause problems.,
Limit your intake of dairy products.,
Limit your intake of cruciferous vegetables.,
Steer clear of beer and soda.,
Limit your intake of legumes.,
Choose your fiber carefully.,
Avoid processed foods and artificial sweeteners.",How to Get Rid of Gas and Bloating2," Before you make changes to your diet, you should document the frequency and intensity of your gas and bloating. Note which foods seem to trigger your symptoms. Also be observant when you add new food or drinks to your diet.Knowing which foods cause problems will help you determine the best solution.

, It is estimated that 65 percent of the human population are lactose intolerant.If you suffer from lactose intolerance, eating dairy products can cause gas and bloating.Lactose is sugar found in milk and milk products. The small intestine produces an enzyme called lactase that breaks the lactose into simpler forms of sugar; however, if your digestive tract produces low levels of lactase your body cannot adequately digest lactose, leaving you feeling bloated and gassy. Limit your dairy intake to items such as yogurt and hard cheeses (cheddar and provolone) as these are less likely to cause problems.
Avoid eating a lot of dairy in one sitting. Disperse your consumption throughout the day.
Switch to lactose-free or lactose-reduced dairy products or take an over-the-counter remedy such as Lactaid or Dairy Ease to help digest lactose-heavy foods.Add dairy alternatives such as soy or almond milk to your diet. Soy milk is made from soybeans that have been ground with water and are completely lactose free. Almond milk is also naturally made with water and once strained, it is lactose free. Other options include oat milk, rice milk, or coconut milk.

, Cruciferous vegetables, like broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower naturally contain indigestible natural sugars that are rich in vitamins and fiber; however, our bodies cannot break down this fiber effectively and thus, eating large amounts of these vegetables at one sitting can cause excess gas.Do not cut these healthy veggies from your diet completely as they are important. Instead, try balancing your intake of these veggies with protein (meat, poultry, fish, eggs) and healthy fats (avocado, olive oil) to prevent overloading your digestive system with the offending nutrient.
Cook your cruciferous vegetable dishes with herbs, such as rosemary, bay leaf and ginger that may help break down the gas-causing sugars.

, Beer and soda are both examples of carbonated beverages — drinks that have been combined with carbon dioxide gas in order to produce bubbles.Consuming carbon dioxide finds a way back out again in the form of burping and flatulence.
Try to cut back on these drinks as much as possible (they are unhealthy in other ways also) and switch to water or natural fruit juices. If you want an alcoholic beverage, try drinking a small glass of red wine.

, Legumes, such as beans, peas and lentils, are some of the most common culprits behind gas and bloating due to the same indigestible sugars and fiber found in cruciferous vegetables.Cut back on your intake of legumes if you suspect that they might be causing your excess gas. As with cruciferous veggies, you should also balance your consumption of legumes with other healthy foods to avoid overloading your digestive system.
Break down the offending sugars by soaking dried beans overnight (or for a minimum of 10 hours) before cooking and by rinsing canned legumes before cooking., Although fiber-rich foods are normally recommended due to their healthy properties, certain types of fiber can actually lead to increased gas and bloating.Eating a high-fiber diet can cause flatulence because the natural flora of bacteria in the colon can only digest small amounts of fiber at a time.Try to get most of your fiber intake from whole foods such as fruit, veggies, and whole-grain carbs like rice, pasta and bread.
Check the labels of packaged foods, such as granola bars, cookies and breakfast cereals, which claim to have added fiber. This fiber is usually in the form of chicory root or inulin. Fiber is often extracted from other sources and added to the packaged food.

, Processed foods (such as fast food and microwave meals) tend to sit in your stomach, leaving you feeling bloated and uncomfortable. These foods contain chemicals that are not easy for your body to digest — meals high in fat slow gastric emptying.You should also avoid diet or sugar-free foods that contain a high amount of artificial sweeteners such as sorbitol, mannitol and xylitol. These are a common cause of digestive issues such as gas and bloating.

"
"
Eat more slowly and chew thoroughly.,
Avoid swallowing air.,
Avoid overeating.,
Get more exercise.,
Do not hold in gas.",How to Get Rid of Gas and Bloating3," Eating too fast or talking while eating causes you to swallow more air, which leads to flatulence and bloating. Slow down and avoid talking with your mouth full.Take smaller mouthfuls and remember to chew each bite approximately 20 times before swallowing.
Taking smaller bites of vegetables and high-fiber foods, allows them to digest more easily when they have been chewed properly.

, Aside from eating too fast, there are several things that may cause you to swallow excess air while eating, drinking or chewing.Avoid drinking through straws. They usually cause you to suck up and swallow air, especially when you reach the end of your drink.
Avoid chewing gum and sucking on hard candies. Both of these actions tend to involve swallowing air.Tighten your dentures. Loose dentures cause you to swallow excess air when eating and drinking.
Stop smoking. When you inhale the smoke you are also inhaling air., Eating too much can overload your stomach and digestive system, causing flatulence and bloating.Avoid overeating by eating your meals more slowly. It takes time for your brain to register that your stomach is full, so eating quickly makes it more likely that you will overeat before realizing that you are already full.
Drink a glass of water before each meal. Sometimes you can mistake thirst for hunger, so drinking water helps you to avoid eating more food than you need. It also helps to keep you hydrated and can aid digestion.
Put your food on smaller plates. By eating smaller plates, you are tricking your brain into thinking you are eating more food than you actually are, which can prevent you from going back for a second helping.

, Although it is very tempting to be lazy after a meal and just sit on the couch, getting some light exercise is actually very good for your digestion and will help you to avoid bloating.Go for a brisk ten minute walk (or do some other form of moderately-strenuous physical activity) after a meal. This allows air bubbles to pass through your digestive tract more quickly, eliminating that bloated feeling.
Doing half an hour of moderate exercise at least three times a week will help you avoid bloating and can even relieve symptoms of digestive diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome., Passing gas in public can be an embarrassing experience, but if you can, try to excuse yourself and go to the bathroom or find a semi-private location to let it rip. Holding it in will only make bloating and stomach pains worse.Passing gas can be difficult. Try going to the bathroom and sitting on the toilet, even if you do not need to go. The simple action of sitting on the toilet can send signals to your subconscious, letting it know that it is okay to release trapped wind.
Try getting down on your knees and placing your head on the floor. This position can help force trapped air from your belly."
"
Know when to see a doctor.,
Try over the counter medicines.,
Understand underlying health problems.,
Have diagnostic tests, if necessary.",How to Get Rid of Gas and Bloating4," If your symptoms are not reduced after you have changed your eating habits and made lifestyle changes, you should see a doctor. Also, see a doctor if your gas and/or bloating is accompanied by diarrhea, bloody stool, change in the color or frequency of bowel movements, chest pain, unintended weight loss, or severe abdominal pain.Keeping a journal of your symptoms will help your doctor diagnose and treat your condition. Your journal should include what you eat and drink and how often you are passing gas.

, Beano and simethicone (Gas-X, Gelusil, Mylanta, Mylicon) can help with gas. These medicines are not always effective, but they are worth a try.Beano can be added to your beans and vegetables. Take it with your first bite of food to be effective.
Simethicone products break up gas bubbles in the gut and may provide some relief for gas-related abdominal discomfort., Gas and bloating can indicate an underlying medical condition such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), Crohn's disease, diverticulitis, or other intestinal condition.If you are belching excessively, you may have peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or gastritis., Your doctor may suggest some testing to determine the source of your gas and/or bloating. Common tests include abdominal X-rays, sigmoidoscopy, a barium swallow, or a colonoscopy.A colonoscopy allows your doctor to see any issues in your large intestine. A long tube is inserted into the rectum until it reaches the colon.A sigmoidoscopy helps your doctor identify causes of diarrhea, abdominal pain, and constipation. A short, lighted tube is inserted into the rectum to view the intestines.A barium swallow is used to determine the causes of chronic belching. You would swallow a liquid (barium) that coats your organs so that the doctor can see them on an X-ray."

Avoid fatty and spicy foods.,
Stay away from alcohol and caffeine.,
Steer clear of acidic foods.,
Choose healthy foods.,
Eat smaller meals more frequently.,
Wait at least three hours after eating before lying down.",How to Get Rid of GERD1," These are the kinds of foods that will typically trigger heartburn and acid reflux. In small amounts you might be able to continue eating them for a treat, but as a regular part of your diet, you need to cut them out.Fried foods, particularly deep fried
Foods with lots of chiles or hot peppers
Creamy or dairy-heavy foods (particularly those with lots of cream or butter);
, Neither substance is easy for your body to process. They also tend to dry out your mouth, which is bad for saliva production. Saliva helps your body break down and process your food.You can have a drink of alcohol or coffee occasionally, but keep track of how you feel afterward -- if it exacerbates your symptoms you should probably try to never drink either.

, Acid reflux and heartburn can both be exacerbated by acid in your diet. Unfortunately, they are common in many diets. Some of the common acidic foods to avoid are:Citrus fruits
Tomatoes
Cocoa products (chocolate-based)

, A varied diet of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats will help keep GERD at bay. Check the website below for help planning healthy meals.Some good choices include:


Berries
Apples
Leafy greens
Cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower
Whole grains like oatmeal, farro, quinoa, wild rice
Lean meats like loin cuts and poultry
Fish

, Your body will be better able to process smaller amounts of food. With the smaller amounts, it’s less likely that your body will respond with GERD symptoms. Staying full means that you will probably need 5-6 small meals per day, rather than three.

, You need to be upright for your body to properly process food, and it takes a while. Going to bed or laying down soon after eating is a very common cause of heartburn, as acidic stomach contents move back up into your esophagus. Stay upright for three hours after every meal or snack to prevent this.Also avoid bending over and lifting heavy objects after a meal, as the strain can also trigger GERD symptoms.
If you absolutely need to rest, raise your head up on the bed so that you’re not completely horizontal. You might also consider sleeping with your head slightly raised to help digestion.

Create a mixture of bleach and water.,
Wipe down the toothbrush head with the bleach







,
Submerge your toothbrush in bleach for an hour.,
Rinse the toothbrush completely.,
Dampen your cloth with your bleach and water solution.,
Wipe out the area where the toothbrush attaches to the handle.,
Do not submerge your toothbrush's body in water.,
Rinse your toothbrush head after each use.,
Do not soak toothbrushes in disinfectant solutions.,
Replace toothbrush heads regularly.,
Store your toothbrush in open containers.",How to Clean an Electric Toothbrush," Once a month, give your toothbrush a deep clean using bleach and water. Mix one part bleach with 10 parts water in a small container, like a cup. Make sure the container is big enough that you can submerge your toothbrush's head completely.Wear gloves when handling bleach.;
,, Place your toothbrush head in your bleach and water solution. Make sure to submerge it completely. Set a timer for an hour. During this time, let your toothbrush head soak. This should disinfect and clean your toothbrush.







, After an hour has passed, remove your toothbrush head from the bleach and water solution. Rinse the toothbrush completely under running water. Make sure you get out any traces of bleach as it is not safe to use a toothbrush with bleach residue stuck on.








Rinse the toothbrush until the water runs clean and you no longer smell bleach coming from the toothbrush.

, To clean the body of your toothbrush, you should also use your bleach and water solution. Dip a cloth or cotton pad in the solution. Then, swab your toothbrush's body with the solution to remove any stuck on toothpaste residue or grime from the bathroom.








Make sure your electronic toothbrush is not plugged in while you're cleaning it.
Wear gloves while handling bleach.

, If your toothbrush's head detaches from the handle, there should be a small slot near the top of the handle. Use your cotton swab or rag to clean out this area as well. You want to remove any bacteria that may be hiding here.







, Never submerge the body of your electronic toothbrush in hot water. This can be dangerous, as it can cause an electric shock. It can also damage the electronic toothbrush, making it necessary for you to purchase a new one. Only clean the body of an electronic toothbrush with a rag, paper towel, or cotton ball., Each time you use your electronic toothbrush, rinse the head under running water. Get out any traces of toothpaste from your brush after each use. This will keep it clean on a daily basis., Some people advocate storing your toothbrush in mouthwash or another disinfectant solution. This is unnecessary and it can also lead to contamination if multiple people share the same solution. Store your toothbrush in a toothbrush stand or an empty glass instead., The heads of electric toothbrushes are replaceable. Every three to four months, replace your toothbrush's head. Even with regular cleaning, a toothbrush's head will need to be replaced periodically.When a toothbrush's bristles begin to look worn and splayed, it's time to replace the toothbrush's head.

, Avoid storing your toothbrush in closed containers. This does not actually protect your toothbrush from bacteria. In fact, the increased humidity can increase your toothbrush's exposure to bacteria. Instead, store your toothbrush in an open container in your bathroom."

Use an antibacterial mouthwash to fight plaque and gum disease.,
Choose a fluoride mouthwash if you’re prone to cavities.,
Use a lubricating mouthwash if you have dry mouth.,
Avoid whitening mouthwashes if you experience irritation.",How to Choose a Mouthwash1," Antibacterial mouthwashes kill the germs that cause bad breath and grow into plaque deposits. Cosmetic mouthwashes that don’t have any antibacterial ingredients may temporarily stop bad breath, but they don’t address the root cause of the problem.Look for mouthwashes labelled antibacterial or plaque-inhibiting that include ingredients such as cetylpyridinium chloride, thymol, eucalyptol, menthol, and methyl salicylate.;
, Use a mouthwash that contains fluoride, especially if you have dry mouth (known medically as xerostomia) or are otherwise prone to cavities. Fluoride occurs naturally in water and soil, and it’s been proven to prevent and restore tooth decay.You can find a list of recommended non-prescription fluoride rinses and mouthwashes on the American Dental Association (ADA) website., Dry mouth, or xerostomia, is a side effect of many prescription drugs and medical treatments. Avoid mouthwashes that contain alcohol if you experience dry mouth, as alcohol will worsen your condition. Choose a lubricating mouthwash labelled specifically for dry mouth that contains xylitol., Most over-the-counter whitening mouthwashes bleach teeth with hydrogen or carbamide peroxide. Both of these ingredients can cause gum and tooth irritation, and their long-term effects aren’t well studied. Avoid using whitening mouthwashes if you have sensitive teeth and gums.Stop using whitening mouthwash if you experience any burning or irritation of your teeth, gums, or oral tissues.

Don't be afraid to pass gas.,
Try to relieve the pain by belching.,
Avoid foods that cause gas.,
Eat foods that won't increase bloating and gas pains.,
Avoid dairy if you're lactose intolerant.,
Mix a teaspoon or two of baking soda in some water.",How to Get Rid of Gas Pains1," Probably the most straightforward method of alleviating abdominal pain from gas accumulation is getting rid of it by passing the gas (also called flatulating or farting). Most peoples and cultures regard passing gas in public as bad manners, so be discreet about it and go to the bathroom to pass gas. To help facilitate passing gas, go for a leisurely walk outside and/or lightly massage your abdomen in a downward manner, which may help push the gas out of your large intestine.

The gas produced by fermenting bacteria in your large intestine is a combination of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, methane and sulfur compounds — which contribute to the foul odor.Flatulence often becomes more common with age, often due to a decreased production of digestive enzymes.;
, Another way to pass gas, albeit from the opposite end, is by burping or belching. Although you don't make much impact on lower intestinal gas by belching, it can certainly get rid of excess gas in the stomach and upper intestinal tract. Accumulation of air in the stomach can occur from gulping liquids or eating food too quickly, drinking through a straw, chewing gum and smoking. The accumulated air can be relieved easily, quickly and painlessly by belching.Although drinking too much carbonated liquid can cause bloating, a few sips of something fizzy is helpful for promoting belching and gas release.









Natural remedies sometimes used to encourage belching include ginger, papaya, lemon juice and peppermint.
Much like passing gas, many peoples and cultures (but not all) regard loudly belching in public as bad manners, so act accordingly.


, Some foods have a tendency to create intestinal gas because they are difficult to digest or contain compounds that irritate the stomach or intestines. Common gas-causing or bloating foods include beans, peas, lentils, cabbage, onions, broccoli, cauliflower, prunes, and mushrooms.Eating too much insoluble fiber (found in most veggies and the skins of some fruits), fructose sugar (found in all fruit, particularly sweet berries) and gluten (found in most grains such as wheat, barley and rye) can also lead to bloating, flatulence and diarrhea. If you love to eat raw veggies and fruit, then eat smaller portions, chew them slowly and allow more time for digestion.









People with celiac disease are particularly sensitive to gluten, which irritates their intestines and triggers abdominal pain and bloating.
Other intestinal disorders that cause people to be more sensitive to bloating include irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.
Beverages that can trigger bloating include coffee, fructose-rich drinks, beer and carbonated sodas with artificial sugar (aspartame or sorbitol).

, Ginger, raw honey, peppermint, chamomile, cinnamon, cucumber, banana, pineapple, fennel and flax seeds, probiotic yogurt, and kale.








, Lactose intolerance is the inability to produce enough (or any) lactase enzyme, which is needed to properly digest and break down milk sugar (lactose). Undigested lactose ends up in the large intestine and provides a substrate for friendly bacteria to ferment and use as food — which produces gas as a byproduct. Symptoms of lactose intolerance include flatulence, bloating, abdominal cramps and diarrhea.As such, reduce or avoid dairy product consumption if you suspect a lactose intolerance problem, particularly cow's milk, cheese, whipping cream, ice cream and milkshakes.









The ability to make lactase drops off rapidly after childhood, which means there's more risk of lactose intolerance as you get older.If you want to continue to consume dairy products without the risk of gas and abdominal pain due to lactose intolerance, then buy some lactase enzyme capsules from a health food store or pharmacy. Take a few enzyme capsules before you indulge in food that contains dairy.


, Gas pains can be caused by acid in the stomach. Baking soda is a base, which will work against the acid to calm the gas pains.

Avoid smoking.,
Wear loose-fitting clothing.,
Lose weight if you’re overweight.",How to Get Rid of GERD2," As with alcohol and caffeine, tobacco dries out your mouth. Without enough saliva, it’s easier for your body to produce the symptoms of acid reflux or heartburn. It’s also important to reduce your intake of secondhand smoke, which will produce the same issues. Tobacco also decreases the lower esophageal sphincter's ability to function properly., Sometimes constricting clothes around your stomach can exacerbate GERD symptoms. Tight clothing can force the contents of your stomach up your throat, creating acid reflux.


Avoid belts
Try elastic-waist pants rather than jeans

, GERD symptoms can be reduced or eliminated if you lose weight. Avoiding fatty foods, for example, can both help you lose weight and stop heartburn and acid reflux. Exercise can also both help your body process food and help you lose weight.Keep track of the calories you consume. If you want to lose weight, decrease the number of calories in your diet.
Start an exercise program. Exercise is an important complement to eating less and losing weight.
Drink water before you eat -- it can help fill you up and hydrate you before you eat, helping you eat smaller portions.

Choose an antacid.,
Consider an H2 blocker.,
Ask your medical professional about PPIs.",How to Get Rid of GERD3," They help neutralize the gastric acid that can cause GERD symptoms. Widely available at grocery stores and pharmacies, antacids like Tums and Rolaids are a quick and easy way to feel better. Keep in mind, however, that they only last a few hours, so long-lasting GERD symptoms might need something different. Read the label of your chosen antacid carefully to get the right dosage. Take the tablet or pill only after the heartburn or acid reflux has kicked in., H2 blockers are available both over-the-counter and as a prescription. Pepcid and Zantac are common over-the-counter varieties, and can last significantly longer than a chewable antacid like Tums or Rolaids.They help your stomach stop producing acid (the cause of acid reflux). Doctors sometimes prescribe both an antacid and an H2 blocker, to first neutralize and then stop the acid that causes GERD symptoms. H2 blockers come in both chewable and pill form, and you typically take them as you begin to feel the symptoms of GERD., PPIs, or Proton Pump Inhibitors, are prescription drugs that help your stomach stop producing acid. They can also help in healing your esophagus, if your GERD has advanced to the point that it is damaged. Keep in mind, however, that PPIs are not recommended for long-term use."

Make sure you are experiencing the symptoms of GERD.,
Seek medical attention if these symptoms occur often.,
Visit your doctor if GERD continues.",How to Get Rid of GERD4," If it’s something else, you will probably need to visit the doctor to check what it might be. Chest pain, particularly coupled with arm pain or shortness of breath, might be a heart attack. Classic GERD symptoms include:Heartburn
Difficulty swallowing
Hoarse or dry throat
Difficulty swallowing
Acid reflux (food or sour liquid coming back up into your mouth)

, This would mean if you are having to take antacids or other heartburn remedies more than twice a week. Keep in mind that many women experience these symptoms during the early stages of pregnancy -- GERD and morning sickness often present as the same ailments.

, If you have made diet and lifestyle changes that should keep the GERD in check, yet it continues, seek medical attention. Discuss possible next steps with your doctor. In some cases, GERD will require surgery to completely cure it.Surgery to cure GERD would fix the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), allowing it to close properly after your body has processed your food. It can be performed laparoscopically, requiring minimal incisions and requiring a short hospital stay.Without treatment, GERD can eventually lead to more dangerous complications. One of the most common is ""Barrett's esophagus,"" a condition that increases the risk of esophageal cancer."

Your dentist or dental hygienist can help you choose a mouthwash that meets your specific oral hygiene needs.Ask your dentist, “Should I just go with an antibacterial mouthwash? Do you recommend I choose a fluoride rinse even if I use a fluoride toothpaste? Do I have periodontal disease or any other issues that might call for a prescription antiseptic mouthwash?”
You should visit your dentist twice a year to maintain your oral hygiene.

, It can be difficult or impossible to brush or floss immediately after having teeth extracted or undergoing another form of oral surgery. Ask your oral surgeon or other dental professional if they recommend you use a prescription mouthwash after surgery.Your dental professional might also prescribe an antiseptic mouthwash to fight gingivitis or periodontitis.Make sure you use a prescription mouthwash as directed by your dental professional or pharmacist.

, Cancer therapies and other treatments for chronic medical conditions can cause oral issues like dry mouth and mouth sores. In addition to using a lubricating mouthwash, you can ask your specialist for help preventing or controlling your treatment’s side effects.

Mixed medication mouthwashes, or magic mouthwashes, are sometimes prescribed for mouth sores caused by chemotherapy and radiation treatments. However, they’re typically expensive and not always covered by insurance. Further, there’s no evidence that these are any more effective than gargling with a homemade salt and baking soda rinse."

Consult with your doctor.,
Ask your doctor about taking hydrochloric acid.,
Consider taking alpha-galactosidase enzyme.,
Try taking probiotics.,
Consider laxatives for constipation.",How to Get Rid of Gas Pains2," Aside from eating gassy foods and being lactose intolerant, there are many medical conditions that cause bloating and abdominal pain. As such, if you have frequent gas pains, make an appointment with your family physician and get a physical examination in order to rule out anything serious. Medical conditions that typically cause bloating and stomach pain include gastrointestinal infections (viral, bacterial and parasitic), stomach ulcers, intestinal blockage, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, food allergies, intestinal or stomach cancer, gallbladder disease and acid reflux.








If your gas pains are caused by an infection or food poisoning, your doctor might recommend short-term antibiotics. However, over-use of antibiotics kills friendly intestinal bacteria and can actually lead to more GI symptoms.Certain medications often lead to bloating and flatulence such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen, naproxen), laxatives, antifungal medicines and statins (for high cholesterol), so talk to your doctor about your prescriptions drugs.Your doctor may want a stool sample and may check the blood for celiac disease and do a breath test for lactose intolerance. An X-ray or colonoscopy may be necessary in some cases.


, Normal food digestion, especially of protein-rich meals, takes lots of stomach acid, which is concentrated hydrochloric (HCl) acid.A lack of stomach acid production (a common condition of aging) can lead to inadequate protein digestion, which can ferment in the intestines and produce gas. As such, ask your doctor about testing for stomach acid production and then consider taking supplemental HCl if you no longer produce enough naturally.









To help with protein digestion, eat your meat, poultry or fish course at the beginning of a meal instead of starting with bread and/or salad. The stomach tends to dump the hydrochloric acid in as soon as you start eating, but carbohydrates need very little (compared to protein) to digest.
Betaine hydrochloride is a popular supplemental form of HCl that you can get at most health food stores. Remember to take the tablets after you eat, not before or during your meal.

, As noted above, a common reason some foods cause intestinal gas is because the human body can't digest certain complex sugar compounds (such as insoluble fiber and sugars called oligosaccharides). Taking over-the-counter products with alpha-galactosidase (Beano, Suntaqzyme, Bean-zyme) can help correct this problem because the enzyme breaks down complex sugars before they reach your intestines and start to ferment.Take a tablet containing alpha-galactosidase right before you start eating foods high in fiber (most veggies, fruit and legumes) to help prevent gas formation and abdominal pain.









The sugar enzyme is derived from food-grade mold called Aspergillus niger, which can cause an allergic reaction in people sensitive to molds and penicillin.
Alpha-galactosidase breaks down galactose into glucose effectively, but it may interfere with diabetic medication. Consult with your doctor if you're diabetic and thinking of taking products that contain it.

, Probiotic supplements contain strains of healthy bacteria that are normally found in your large intestine. These ""friendly"" bacteria can be destroyed by over-using antibiotics, taking laxatives, drinking too much alcohol, consuming heavy metals and getting colonoscopies. An imbalance of healthy intestinal bacteria leads to digestive problems and GI symptoms. If you think you're at risk for bacterial imbalance in your intestines, then consider taking probiotic supplements to get relief from gas pain.Probiotics are safe and commonly found in health food stores.









Probiotics are available as tablets, capsules or powders and must be taken on a regular basis in order to maintain effective concentrations/colonies in your large intestine. Whichever supplement you choose should be enteric coated or microencapsulated to survive being digested by stomach acid, so it can make it to the intestines and still be viable.Fermented foods are also a good source of friendly bacteria and include natural yogurt, buttermilk, kefir, fermented soy products (natto, miso, soy sauce, tofu), sauerkraut and even unpasteurized beer.


, Constipation is infrequent bowel movements or difficult passage of stools, which can happen from eating way too much fiber (or almost none at all) or not drinking enough fluids.Chronic constipation is usually defined as fewer than 3 bowel movements a week for many weeks or months, but most cases of constipation last for just a few days. Constipation can lead to intestinal pain and cramping that's similar to gassy pain, but the cause of the discomfort is often very different. Medicinal treatment for constipation involves taking laxatives, which promote bowel movements. Laxatives work by either bulking up your stool (FiberCon, Metamucil, Citrucel), softening your stool, helping fluids move through your colon (milk of magnesia) or lubricating your colon (mineral oil, cod liver oil).








Elderly people with poor diets usually get constipation from not consuming enough fiber, which is why eating prunes or drinking prune juice is often recommended.
Constipation in children and younger adults is more often caused by eating too much fiber at a time, such as carrots or apples.
If constipation is caused by eating way too much fiber, then gas production and bloating from bacterial fermentation is possible too. As such, much of the advice above for getting rid of gas pains would apply.

Get a referral from your dentist.,
Search for a professional through the American Board of Prosthodontics (ABP).,
Use the online search from the American College of Prosthodontists (ACP).,
Call your health insurance company.,
Read user reviews.,
Ask people you know for suggestions.",How to Choose a Prosthodontist1," If you need a procedure that your regular family dentist does not perform, ask for a referral to a qualified prosthodontist. Your dentist can usually offer suggestions for professionals they have successfully worked with in the past.Prosthodontists are often ""team leaders"" when different dental professionals work together, so it's likely that your dentist has worked with several prosthodontists in the past.;
, Use this national organization’s easy online search engine at www.abpros.org. Simply enter your location by state, city, or zip code and you will see a list a certified prosthodontists in your area.This site only lists prosthodontists in the United States. To search for professionals in other countries, go through a website like the Association of Prosthodontists of Canada at www.prosthodontics.ca or another site that lists specialists internationally.
If you don’t have your own computer at home, try using one at a public library. You can also ask a friend, family member, or your doctor to help you search online.

, Like the ABP, the ACP uses a simple online search engine at www.gotoapro.org. The benefit of this site is that you can search by procedure as well as location, for instance, “dental implants,” “sleep apnea,” or, “congenital mouth defects,” among others., Before choosing a professional and starting a dental procedure, make sure it will be covered by your insurance. Call your health or dental insurance company directly and ask whether they cover the procedure you need done. Often, they can provide a list on “in-network” professionals whose work they will cover.You can locate the phone number for your insurance company on your insurance card.

, Visit a website like www.healthgrades.com to read what other patients have to say about your chosen prosthodontist. There is often information available about wait times, how easy it is to get an appointment, and whether people like their prosthodontist and the outcome of their treatment. These are sometimes called “patient satisfaction surveys.”, Sometimes the easiest way to find a prosthodontist is by word-of-mouth. Ask a friend, family member, or co-worker who has dental prosthetics or has had extensive dental work if they see a prosthodontist who they know and trust. Often, you can see the same doctor; if not, you can probably see another professional within the same organization."

Try charcoal activated pills.,
Get some light exercise.,
Limit foods that cause gas.,
Chew your food well and eat slowly.,
Sip water throughout the day.,
Drink tea.,
Chew on some seeds.,
Reduce your anxiety.",How to Get Rid of Gas," Most intestinal gas is caused by swallowing too much air. You can swallow too much air by excessively eating, drinking alcohol, chewing candy and gum and by smoking. If you do these things often, consider limiting them for the sake of your gas.;
, While it is true some foods, such as beans, can cause excessive gas, there may be some foods that your body is particularly sensitive to. List all the foods you eat each day for one week. Also track how many times you pass gas each day. You should quickly see the correlation between your dietary habits and the amount of gas you pass each day.

, Try an over-the-counter medicine containing simethicone, which helps to break down gas bubbles. You can purchase products containing simethicone in many forms, including pills, chewable tablets and liquids. Look into other gas-fighting medications available at your local drugstore as well.

, You can purchase medications that help reduce the amount of gas some foods produce. Activated charcoal will also help decrease the smelly odor that sometimes accompanies flatulence.

, When you feel gassy, some light exercise, or any type of physical movement, will help you speed up digestion and prevent gas build-up in your intestines (bloating.) It is helpful to take a quick 10 minute walk immediately after each meal.

, To reduce excessive gas and bloating, reduce the amount of gas-producing foods you eat. It isn't necessary to cut any of these foods out of your diet, but simply to limit their consumption.


Baked beans, cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli, kale, brussel sprouts and cauliflower, carbonated beverages, chewing gum (especially if it contains sorbitol), apples, bananas, peaches, hard candy, and potatoes all cause gas.
Avoid processed foods. The chemicals used to make processed foods aren’t digested by the body very well and often cause gas.
Excessive gas can also be caused by malabsorption of foods, like when you are lactose intolerant.

, If you eat too fast, you will swallow more air, which causes gas. Eating slowly will help you relax and help you digest foods easier.

, Drinking at least 8 glasses of water a day will prevent bloating and constipation, but gulping the water can actually cause too much gas and bloating. Concentrate on sipping water during your meals and throughout the day.

, Several kinds of tea work wonders for reducing and eliminating gas. Try peppermint, fresh ginger, or lemon tea once a day and wait for results. You can use dried or fresh ingredients and get the same results.

, Anise and caraway seeds aid in moving gas through your digestive tract. If you can handle the taste, chew on a handful of either seed throughout the day and keep track of the results., When you are anxious or stressed, you increase your breathing rate which causes you to swallow more air. Practice deep breathing when you get anxious to reduce the likelihood of gas later."
"
Ask about their education.,
Choose someone who is Board Certified.,
Have a consultation with your prosthodontist.",How to Choose a Prosthodontist2," Every dentist should have the basic dental degree of Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS) or Doctor of Dental Medicine (DMD). Prosthodontists should have completed three years of additional specialty training after finishing dentistry school and earning the basic degree. Ask where they went to school, and whether it was an accredited program., Not all states require prosthodontists to be certified, so ask to see the certification of the professional you choose.Prosthodontists have to recertify and take a test every 8 years to stay current on medical knowledge, so make sure their certification is up to date., Meet your chosen professional before your appointment. Chat with them and make sure you feel comfortable and that they listen to your needs.

Try to discern whether they seem up to date on the latest technology, procedures, and medications.It’s okay to write down things they say and then ask your family dentist about them later.

Run the bite guard under the water to loosen debris and plaque., This can be hand soap or dish soap. Work the soap across the surface and in the hollow areas. If you don't have liquid soap, work bar soap into a lather. Smear the suds across the surface., Make sure the toothbrush has soft or ultra-soft bristles. Apply light pressure to avoid damaging the bite guard. Move in horizontal and vertical strokes. Clean both the outside surface and the hollow surface that touches your teeth. Rinse the bite guard with lukewarm water when you're finished., Lay a clean towel on a flat surface. Place the bite guard hollow side-down on the towel. Let it air dry completely. This usually takes 15 to 30 minutes., Do this once the bite guard is completely dry. Even the slightest dampness can cause fungus or bacteria to grow. After you replace the bite guard, make sure the case snaps closed. Leaving it out can expose it to ambient humidity, which can degrade the material."

Dry the bite guard.",How to Clean a Bite Guard2," This step helps to loosen plaque and other oral debris. Do this immediately after taking the guard out of your mouth. Turn on the tap and let the water run until it feels lukewarm. Run the bite guard under the water.You can skip this step if you're using this method after a soap-and-water cleansing.

, Baking soda is the least abrasive anti-bacterial substance you can use for oral hygiene.Mix baking soda with water. Use 2/3 cups (185 g) for a long-term supply or a teaspoon (4.93 g) for a one-time test. Add water drop by drop and mix thoroughly until the baking soda becomes a paste.

It's best to avoid toothpaste for this method. Even toothpastes formulated for sensitive teeth can cause abrasions on flexible plastic. Abrasions provide hiding places for bacteria that can lead to oral infections., Use only a brush with soft or ultra soft bristles. More abrasive bristles can wear down the plastic of the bite guard. You can use your regular toothbrush for this method, whether it's manual, electric, or battery-powered., Use the same horizontal and/or vertical strokes you normally use to brush your teeth. Just apply less pressure. Brush the inside and outside of the bite guard. Make sure you clean the entire surface to kill harmful bacteria. Rinse the guard with warm water when you're finished brushing., When the baking soda is completely rinsed off, lay the bite guard on a clean towel. Make sure the towel is on a flat surface to reduce the risk of the guard falling on the floor. Allow it to air dry for 15-30 minutes.

Surgically remove the gallbladder.",How to Get Rid of Gallstones," Drink approximately four 8-oz (250-ml) glasses of apple juice or apple cider each day for a period of five days.For best results, drink the apple juice at room temperature or slightly warmed.
Alternatively, you could eat four to five apples each day for five days if you would prefer to do so instead of drinking apple juice.
Apples contain limonoids and malic acid, which both help soften gallstones and alleviate related gallbladder pain.
Note that there are no other dietary restrictions you need to follow for these first five days, but you should try to maintain a balanced diet.;
, Try to have your last meal around 4:00 PM on the sixth day. Wait one to two hours before taking the next treatment.There are no dietary restrictions for the earlier part of the day, and you do not need to drink any apple juice or cider early on.

, At approximately 6:00 PM, dissolve 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of Epsom salt in 8 oz (250 ml) of warm water. Stir well and drink the mixture quickly. Repeat once more at 8:00 PM.


If you are unable to tolerate a full 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of Epsom salt, you should at least use 1 tsp (5 ml). Dissolving the salt in warm apple juice instead of water can also make it more tolerable for some, and the additional apple juice can continue softening the gallstone.
Epsom salts contain magnesium sulphate, which can help open the ducts of the gallbladder enough to release the developing stones.

, At approximately 10:00 PM, mix 1/2 cup (125 ml) of olive oil with 1/2 cup (125 ml) of lemon juice. Drink the mixture quickly.


If you find it difficult to stomach this combination, you can cut it down to 1/4 cup (60 ml) each of olive oil and lemon juice.
Note that sesame oil can be used instead of olive oil. Either one should help lubricate the softened gallstone.
The acidic lemon juice helps soften and dissolve the gallstones further, making them easier to pass.

, Go to sleep like usual on the evening of the sixth day. When you wake up the following morning, the gallstones should pass during your first bathroom trip.


The gallstones should come out as small greenish balls. Some might be as small as a grain of sand, while others can be as large as peas. Depending on the circumstances, you may pass several dozen.
If you don't pass the gallstones, you either don't have any to pass or have gallstones that are too large to respond to home remedies.

, Mix 1/2 cup (125 ml) natural pear juice with 1/2 cup (125 ml) hot water. Add 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of honey, if desired, and drink it all before the beverage cools.You can prepare and drink this mixture up to three times each day. Take it alone or in conjunction with other gallstone home remedies.
The pectin in pears binds to the cholesterol in cholesterol-based gallstones, making it easier for your body to flush the gallstones out. This treatment may not be effective against bile-based stones, though.

, Squeeze the juice out of one beetroot, one cucumber, and four medium carrots. Combine all three juices and consume the resulting mixture.


Drink 8 oz (250 ml) of this juice combination twice daily to achieve the desired results. Store excess juice in your refrigerator.
Beetroot is believed to cleanse your gallbladder, liver, colon, and blood.
Cucumbers have a high water content, and this can help detoxify your system by increasing the flow of fluid through your blood, gallbladder, and liver.
Carrots are high in vitamin C and other nutrients, all of which can help strengthen your both gallbladder and immune system.

, Steep 1 tsp (5 ml) of milk thistle leaves and seeds in 1 cup (250 ml) hot water for five minutes. Strain the leaves, then drink the tea before it cools.


You can also use bags of prepared milk thistle tea instead of using loose leaves and seeds. Add honey to the prepared tea, as well, if you prefer the taste of tea with honey.
Milk thistle is used to help shrink gallstones, detoxify the liver, and reduce bladder pain.
In addition to milk thistle tea, you can also add milk thistle to your diet by mixing powdered seeds into juice, salads, soups, or other foods.

, Steep 1 tsp (5 ml) of dried dandelion leaves in 1 cup (250 ml) of hot water for five minutes. Strain and drink the tea before it cools.


Drink the tea two or three times daily. You can sweeten it with honey, if desired, or drink it without.
Dandelion leaves stimulate both the liver and gallbladder, causing both organs to push bile and other contents through. This can include gallstones.
If dandelion tea doesn't appeal to you, consider adding tender dandelion greens to salads or eating them as a steamed side dish.

, Steep 1 tsp (5 ml) of fresh or dried mint leaves in 1 cup (250 ml) of hot water for three to five minutes. Strain the tea and drink it before it cools.


To maximize the benefit of peppermint tea, drink it in between meals.
Peppermint oil stimulates the flow of bile and other digestive juices, which can help push gallstones out of the gallbladder. Moreover, peppermint also contains terpene, which may help dissolve gallstones
Peppermint oil capsules are another option if you don't want to drink peppermint tea.

, Dissolve 1 tsp (5 ml) of psyllium powder husk in 1 cup (250 ml) of water. Drink the mixture once a night, immediately before going to bed.


Psyllium is a good source of soluble fiber. That fiber binds to the cholesterol in cholesterol-based gallstones, which may help cleanse existing gallstones and prevent future ones.

, If this is your first gallstone episode, your doctor may recommend waiting it out. Oftentimes, the stone will dissolve or dislodge itself without treatment.


Nearly one-third to one-half of people who have gallstones once never have another attack again, so drastic treatment is often unnecessary.
If this is not your first time developing gallstones, your doctor may still recommend waiting it out if there are no accompanying symptoms or if there are other health concerns involved.
If you're told to wait it out, you should still watch for symptoms of gallstone complication. This includes intense pain in your upper right abdomen.

, Your doctor may prescribe ursodiol, an oral bile acid that can dissolve cholesterol-based gallstones. Dosage varies, so you'll need to follow your doctor's instructions.Note that ursodiol and other bile acids only work against cholesterol-based stones and will not dissolve stones made from bile pigments.
Additionally, it may take months to years before this medication successfully dissolves the gallstones, so you could be on this medication for quite a while.

, For medium to large gallstones, your doctor may recommend shock wave therapy. A special device will direct high-frequency sound waves to the gallstones, and those sound waves can break the stones into fragments.


Since shock wave therapy only breaks apart the gallstone and doesn't dissolve it, you may need to take ursodiol or a similar bile salt afterward to get ride of the fragmented pieces.
Also note that shock wave therapy is still considered an experimental treatment, so conventional doctors may not recommend it.

, During this procedure, your doctor will insert a catheter through the abdomen and inject a special drug directly into the gallbladder.


Once this drug gets into your gallbladder, it will immediately begin to dissolve the gallstones inside. Most stones will disappear withing several hours of the treatment.
Contact dissolution is another experimental treatment, though, so some doctors may not recommend it.

, If you've struggled with gallstones on more than one occasion, your doctor will likely recommend a cholecystectomy, or the surgical removal of your gallbladder.Gallbladders are not vital organs in the strictest sense, so it is possible to remove yours without suffering severe complications. After your gallbladder is gone, bile will flow directly from the liver to the small intestines. This may cause diarrhea, and you'll also need to limit your dietary intake of fat to avoid other complications.
Depending on which type of cholecystectomy the surgeon performs, you may need to spend one to three days in the hospital, and you may need to spend several weeks recovering at home afterward.

Be sure to drink water, broth, and juice consistently throughout the day. Even if you can only take small sips at a time, it’s important to replenish the fluids you lose through diarrhea. Drinking water is good, but be sure to also drink broth, juice, or some sports drink, too. Your body needs electrolytes like potassium and sodium.Some people find that apple juice makes symptoms worse.Suck on ice chips if you are too nauseated to drink anything.See a doctor right away if you can’t keep down any liquids for over 12 hours, or have diarrhea or vomiting that lasts longer than 24 hours.

, You can try taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (or NSAIDs, like ibuprofen and naproxen) to help reduce fever and ease the pain of stomach cramps. However, in large doses or with certain conditions these medications can cause irritation and damage to the stomach. Only take these medications as prescribed or indicated on the bottle, and avoid them if:Your doctor prescribed you a different medication, or you take another NSAID for a different condition.
You have liver or kidney disease.
You’ve ever had stomach ulcers or bleeding.
You’re under 18. Consult your doctor first, or before giving aspirin to a child or teenager.

Try probiotics.",How to Get Rid of Diarrhea Fast2," Limit the strain on your digestive tract as much as possible when you have diarrhea. Stick to a clear liquid diet to stay hydrated and keep your electrolytes in balance without stressing your stomach. Have 5-6 small “meals” throughout the day, or just sip on these fluids every few minutes as you can tolerate it.The clear liquid diet includes:Water (carbonated and flavored waters are okay)
Fruit juice with no pulp, fruit punch, and lemonade
Bubbly drinks, including soda (though it’s important to choose sugar- and caffeine-free options)
Gelatin
Coffee and tea (decaffeinated, without dairy)
Strained tomato or vegetable juice
Sports drinks (drink these in addition to other items, not just by themselves – they contain too much sugar to be helpful alone)
Clear broth (not creamy soup)
Honey and sugar, and hard candy like lemon drops and peppermints
Ice pops (no fruit or dairy)

, By the second day you may be able to add some dry, semi-solid foods to your diet. Eat these in small amounts. If you do not tolerate it, go back to the clear liquid diet and try again later. Choose foods that are bland and low in fat and fiber.Try the BRAT diet, containing bland foods like bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast. Other good options are crackers, noodles, and mashed potatoes.
Stay away from highly-seasoned foods. Some salt is okay, but don’t eat anything spicy.

, Foods high in fiber are likely to produce gas and worsen diarrhea. Skip fresh vegetables and fruits (other than bananas) until you feel better.

If you have frequent problems with diarrhea, consider consuming more fiber in your diet to help regulate your system.

, Foods high in fat are likely to worsen diarrhea and stomach pain. Until you’re 100% well, avoid red meat, butter, margarine, whole dairy products, fried food, and processed, prepackaged, and fast food.Limit fat to <15 grams per day., One possible cause of diarrhea, gas, and bloating is lactose intolerance.

Avoid food additives in general, but especially until your digestive system is back on track.There are many brands that contain artificial sweeteners, such as:


Sunett and Sweet One
Equal, NutraSweet, and Neotame
Sweet’N Low
Splenda

, Probiotics are a type of live bacteria that help maintain the digestive tract. You can find them in products like yogurt with live cultures, and as pills or capsules at your local drug store or pharmacy. Probiotics might be helpful for diarrhea caused by antibiotics and some viruses because they can restore the balance of “good” bacteria in the gut.Eating plain yogurt with live cultures is an exception to the no-dairy rule when you have diarrhea.

Wait out viral causes.,
Get prescription medication for bacterial infections.,
Consider changing your medications with your doctor’s help.,
Treat chronic diseases.,
Minimize your stress and anxiety.",How to Get Rid of Diarrhea Fast3," Most cases of diarrhea are caused by viruses, like the common flu and others. Viral diarrhea should subside within a couple of days. Wait it out, stay hydrated, rest, and use over-the-counter anti-diarrheals for relief from symptoms., Diarrhea caused by contaminated food or water is often due to bacteria, or sometimes parasites. In this case, your doctor might need to prescribe you specific antibiotics or other medication to treat the infection.If your diarrhea doesn’t improve within 2-3 days, see your doctor to determine whether there’s an infectious cause.


Note that antibiotics will only be prescribed if bacteria is known to be the cause for your diarrhea. Antibiotics are not effective against viruses or other causes, and they can cause unpleasant side effects or worsen your digestive problems if used incorrectly.

, Antibiotics are actually a common cause of diarrhea, because they change the balance of bacteria in your gut. Cancer drugs and antacids with magnesium can also cause or worsen diarrhea.

Increase the fiber in your diet.,
Eat prunes.,
Eat probiotics.",How to Get Rid of Constipation Pain2," Fiber is essential for healthy and regular bowel movements. Increasing the fiber in your diet can help prevent constipation and help relieve it when you have it. Foods that contain fiber include:Fruits and berries. If the fruit has edible skin, like apples, plums, and grapes, make sure you eat those because that is where most of the fiber is.
Vegetables. Dark, leafy green vegetables like collard, mustard, and beet greens as well as Swiss chard are very high in fiber. Other vegetables like broccoli, spinach, carrots, cauliflower, brussel sprouts, artichokes, and green beans are high in fiber, too.
Beans and legumes. This group includes lentils, kidney, navy, garbanzo, pinto, lima and white beans. Black eyed peas are a high fiber food you can also add. Beans and legumes can cause intestinal gas in some people. If this happens to you, you may want to avoid this source of fiber while you are constipated. Beans and legumes may be best used to prevent any constipation.
Whole grains. Whole grains are unprocessed grains, which excludes white grains. Cereals like granola tend to have the highest fiber, but if you are buying boxed cereals, read the label to make sure your choice is high in fiber.
Seeds and nuts, such as pumpkin, sesame, and sunflower seeds and almonds, walnuts, and pecans.

, Try eating prunes and drinking prune juice. Prunes promote regular bowel movements. Prunes are especially high in fiber and contain sorbitol, a stool-loosening sugar that naturally helps relieve constipation. Sorbitol is a mild colonic stimulant that helps reduce the transit time of stool and decreases the risk of constipation.If you don't like the wrinkly texture or unique taste of prunes, prune juice may be a better alternative. The juice should start working within a few hours, so it’s important to let one glass pass through your intestines before attempting to drink another, or you may risk diarrhea.
Prunes have 14.7 grams of sorbitol per 100 grams, whereas prune juice has 6.1 grams per 100 gram. You will have to drink roughly twice as much prune juice to achieve the same results.

, Probiotics are live bacterial cultures that create the right environment for your digestive system to stay healthy and run on a regular schedule. Probiotics are thought to alter the microflora in the gut and reduce the amount of time it takes for your food to be digested and move through your system. This can help prevent constipation and promote regular bowel movements.Try adding a cup of yogurt to your daily diet. Check the label to make sure the yogurt you buy has active cultures of live bacteria.
Include fermented and cultured foods such as kombucha, kimchi, and sauerkraut. These foods also contain beneficial bacteria that may aid in digestion and relieve constipation.Drink plenty of water. Hard, dry stools are a common cause of constipation. The more water you add, the easier it will be to pass the stool. Experts don’t have a solid rule about how much water a day a person needs to drink. The most common recommendation is to drink about eight eight-ounce glasses of water every day.When you are constipated, increase to ten eight-ounce glasses of water every day. Use that as a starting point and find what works best for you.

Take a walk.,
Put aside enough time for a bowel movement.,
Change the way you sit.,
Do yoga.",How to Get Rid of Constipation Pain3," So many people work at the computer or a desk, and many people don't get enough physical activity. When you have constipation, take a break every hour or so and take a walk. You don't just have to walk, you can do any exercise to help get your bowels moving.Start out walking slowly and then pick up the pace until you are walking at about top speed without actually running. Do the fast walk for about five minutes, and then slow down for another five minutes. The total time walking should be about 10 minutes every hour or so.
If that amount of time doesn’t work for you because of other responsibilities, just try to increase the amount of faster-than-normal walking time you do. However, don’t start with the fast walking. Start out slowly for about 30 seconds and speed up every ten steps. It can be a bit uncomfortable, but don’t let that discourage you.

, So many people rush and don’t take enough time for a bathroom break. Make sure you have enough time to relax and try to let your bowels do most of the work. Bring a book or a magazine. Try to arrange a time when you won’t be interrupted.If possible, you should try to get on a schedule. Try to go to the bathroom at the same time every day to get your system regular.

, You may also try changing the way you sit on the toilet. When you are on the toilet, use a stool or the edge of the tub to prop your feet up. Bring your knees in as close to your chest as possible. This increases the pressure on your bowels and may ease the passage of a stool.Try to relax as much as possible and let your bowels do most of the work.

, Certain yoga poses may help stimulate your bowel and get your body in a comfortable position to have a bowel movement. These positions can be helpful because they increase the internal pressure on your intestines and help the bowels move the stool more easily.Baddha Konasana: In a seated position, bend your knees and bring your feet together so the soles are touching, and grasp your toes with your hands. Flutter your legs quickly, then lean forward so that your forehead touches the floor. Hold for five to 10 breaths.
Pavanamuktasana: In a reclined position, stretch your legs out in front of you. Bring one knee up to your chest, and hold it there with your hands. Flex or wiggle your toes. Hold that position for five to 10 breaths, then repeat with the other leg.
Uttanasana: From a standing position, keep your legs straight and bend at the waist. Touch the mat with your hands or grasp the back of your legs. Hold for five to 10 breaths.

Learn the causes of constipation.,
Understand there is no normal frequency of bowel movements.,
See your physician.",How to Get Rid of Constipation Pain4," Constipation, or the difficult or uncomfortable passage of stools, occurs mainly because people very often don’t have enough fiber and water in their diet.

Some people have two to three bowel movements a day, and other people have a bowel movement every other day, and this is normal for them.In general, at least four to eight times a week seems to be most common. The key is your diet and comfort level.
People with more frequent bowel movements tend to have high fiber diets and are often vegetarians or vegans. Those with fewer bowel movements tend to have a higher meat content in their diet and lower water intakes.

, If none of these methods provide relief in two to three days, make an appointment with your healthcare professional. Long-term constipation can be a symptom of a more serious medical condition.If you are pregnant or nursing, or are caring for an infant or child who is constipated, please talk to your healthcare professional before trying any of the methods described here.

Start a heartburn food and drink diary.,
Limit foods that are known to cause heartburn.,
Eat small, frequent meals.,
Try apple cider vinegar.,
Chew a stick of gum after every meal.",How to Get Rid of Heartburn Naturally2," Start writing down everything that you eat and drink to determine what foods give you heartburn. Make a note in your food diary any time that eating or drinking something gives you heartburn. Over time you will begin to see patterns and learn what foods you should avoid.


For example, you may notice that you tend to get heartburn about an hour after your morning cup of coffee each day. You may then decide to switch to tea or a latte.

, Some foods have a reputation for causing heartburn, so it is best to avoid these foods or at least limit them as much as possible. These foods include:Citrus fruit
Caffeinated beverages
Chocolate
Tomatoes
Garlic
Onions
Alcohol
Fatty foods
Spicy foods

, Eating large meals can cause heartburn as well, so try to stick to small frequent meals instead. For example, instead of eating three big meals per day, eat six small meals spread throughout the day., You may be able to get rid of heartburn by drinking an apple cider vinegar solution. Apple cider vinegar decreases the secretion of stomach acid because it essentially ""fools"" the stomach into thinking that the acid has already been secreted. The stomach believes it has already done its job and the acid secretion is reduced. Mix one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar with six ounces of water and drink the solution., Chewing a stick of gum after a meal has been shown to reduce heartburn symptoms. You can chew a stick of regular gum or look for a specially formulated heartburn gum called GutsyGum. This brand of gum was shown to have more drastic effects on heartburn than regular chewing gum, but regular chewing gum will help as well."

Wear loose fitting-clothing.,
Elevate the head of your bed.,
Manage stress.,
Quit smoking.,
Maintain a healthy weight.,
Get more sleep.,
Ask your doctor if any of your medications may be to blame.",How to Get Rid of Heartburn Naturally3," Tight clothing also puts extra pressure on your stomach, which may lead to heartburn. Choose clothes that are loose and comfortable to help reduce this factor. For example, you might try wearing clothes that have an elastic waistband or clothes that provide a few extra inches of room around your waist., Raising the entire head of your bed up by about eight inches (20 centimeters) can help with heartburn. Make sure that you raise the entire head of the bed and do not just use extra pillows. Place a couple of bricks or pieces of wood under the legs at the head of your bed., Severe stress may worsen heartburn for some people, so it is important to find ways of keeping stress under control.There are many positive ways to manage stress. Some good options include:



Getting more exercise. Regular exercise can help to reduce stress and provide other health benefits as well. Take 30 minutes per day to go for a walk, ride a bike, or take an exercise class. Find something that you enjoy and make it part of your daily routine.

Reaching out to someone. Talking to a friend or loved one may also help to reduce stress. The next time you are feeling stressed, call a friend or meet up with someone to talk.

Setting aside time for yourself each day. Another great way to reduce stress is to take time to do something that you want to do every day. For example, you might read a book, take a bubble bath, or watch a funny movie., Smoking can make heartburn symptoms worse as well as cause many other health problems. If you smoke, then do whatever you can to quit. Try asking your doctor for information about medications and smoking cessation programs that may help., Being overweight can also make heartburn symptoms worse, especially if you carry most of your excess weight around your abdomen. If you are overweight or obese, then try to lose weight and maintain a healthy weight to help control your heartburn., Not getting enough sleep may also be contributing to your heartburn.

Avoid other bad oral habits to keep your mouth strong and healthy.,
Schedule annual dental cleanings.,
See a dentist immediately if you experience problems.,
Get a fluoride treatment.",How to Be Thorough in Your Oral Hygiene Routine," The best oral hygiene habit to get into is to brush your teeth at least twice everyday — once when you wake up in the morning, and again before you go to bed at night. If you do absolutely nothing else for your teeth, at least do this., When you eat and drink during a meal, the enamel on your teeth can soften temporarily. Brushing your teeth immediately after a meal means you may accidentally erode your enamel. Instead, wait for about an hour after you’ve eaten before you brush your teeth. This will allow the saliva in your mouth to help neutralize the acid content and return your enamel to its normal strength., While toothbrushes come in variety of bristle stiffness, you should always use a soft or sensitive bristled brush.If possible use an electric toothbrush instead of a manual toothbrush. The fast action of an electric toothbrush can actually remove twice as much plaque as manual brushing. Look for a sonic electric toothbrush — the head movement offers the correct movements of the brushing technique and they are more gentle on your teeth.Toothbrushes also come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Choose the shape and size that fits best into your mouth and feels comfortable when brushing. The best brush is one that allows you to reach to the very back of your last molar without difficulty., The American Dental Association (ADA) has a seal of acceptance that can be found on dental products that meet their rigorous standards. When selecting a toothpaste, ensure it has the ADA seal of acceptance on the label. Among other things, the ADA seal of acceptance ensures the toothpaste contains the proper amount of fluoride for certain age groups.If you do not live in North America, check to see if a national or regional dental organization reviews and provides seals of approval for dental products in your area. Then look for that specific seal on the toothpaste you buy.

, Brushing your teeth with the proper technique will help ensure removal of the most amount of plaque possible. The back-and-forth technique you see in movies and on TV will actually harm your enamel. The best brushing technique to use is as follows:Hold your toothbrush at a 45-degree angle to your gums.
Move your toothbrush back and forth in short, gentle strokes. Brush each tooth surface 15 times and make sure you count them without applying too much force.
The best way to clean the chewing surface of the molars (where is the highest risk of decay), is to apply a circular clockwise and anti clockwise movement so bacteria can be eliminated by the centrifugal force.
Clean the back of your front teeth by placing the brush vertically against the back of your teeth and making up and down strokes with the brush.
Don’t forget to use your toothbrush to brush the surface of your tongue as well.

, Each time you brush your teeth, you should brush continuously for two minutes. Split the time between all areas of your mouth to ensure they all get equal treatment. Use a timer or stopwatch to ensure you don’t stop early., Always rinse off your toothbrush when you’re done brushing and make sure there’s no toothpaste residue left on the brush. Store your toothbrush in a cup or toothbrush holder so that the brush is standing upwards.If you’re away on vacation or a business trip, try to store your toothbrush in the same fashion in your hotel (or wherever you’re staying). It’s not a good idea to keep a toothbrush cooped up inside a toothbrush holder longer than absolutely necessary.

, At the very least you should replace your toothbrush, or electric toothbrush head, every three to four months. If the toothbrush looks like it’s damaged or worn, replace it sooner than three months., An awesome oral hygiene routine includes flossing your teeth once a day. Dentist’s recommend you floss in the evening, before bed, as this will help to remove any food residue before it has a chance to sit on or between your teeth all night.While most people tend to floss after they’ve brushed, it is actually recommended that you try flossing before you brush. This helps to remove food particles stuck between your teeth and gums and then allows those areas of your mouth to be cleaned more effectively when you brush., When pulling off a strand of floss from the roll, take about 18 in or 46 cm. Roll one end of the floss around the middle finger on your right hand, and roll the other end of the floss around the middle finger of your left hand. Leave enough floss between your middle fingers so you’re able to grab the floss using your thumbs and index fingers on both hands., While you want to hold the floss between your hands tightly, you want to be as gentle as possible when you’re actually flossing. The floss should be used to rub your tooth up and down while it’s in-between two teeth. You should also attempt to curve the floss around the tooth for better results.As you move through your mouth, unwind one end of the floss and wind the opposite end, so you have fresh floss every one to two teeth.

, There are several alternative tools that can be used in place of floss, if you find it difficult to use floss. Floss picks have floss mounted between two ends so you don’t have to wind and unwind floss yourself. They also have an easy-to-grip handle to manipulate the pick between your teeth. There are also electric flossing machines that spray a jet of water that can be used to clean between your tooth (sometimes referred to as a WaterPik)., Consider using an antimicrobial mouth rinse or a fluoride-based mouthwash everyday. You can use the rinse/wash each time you brush, but you can also use it between brushing to keep your mouth fresh.If you don’t like the idea of bringing a toothbrush and toothpaste to school or work with you, you can always bring a small jar of rinse/wash instead to use after a meal.

, Chewing sugar-free gum throughout the day, specifically after a meal, can help protect your teeth. Chewing gum generates more saliva in your mouth, which in turn can balance the level of acidity. Plus, chewing gum can clean the plaque off your teeth, which will help prevent decay and erosion.Look for sugar-free gum that contains xylitol, as it helps maintain an neutral Ph balance in your mouth.
Note that some people with jaw issues (such as TMJ) may be advised not to chew gum as it will cause more problems than it will solve. If you have been diagnosed with a jaw issue, ask your dentist if you should be chewing gum.

, Sugar can be very hard on teeth. Sugar can cause or worsen tooth decay, which in turn can lead to cavities. Reducing the amount of sugary food and drinks you consume will help keep your teeth healthy in the long-term.Keep in mind that this includes the sugar you put into items such as coffee, tea, lemonade, iced tea, and other drink mixes.

, Foods and drinks that have a high acidic value can also have a damaging effect on your teeth by eroding the enamel. Enamel protects protects the dentin, which contains the pulp with the nerves and blood vessels of your teeth. Without enamel you’ll find yourself becoming very sensitive to hot and cold foods and drinks and you’ll also likely experience pain. Reducing or eliminating acidic foods and drinks will help to protect your enamel and keep your teeth healthy and strong.If you are drinking an acidic beverage, try drinking it with a straw. This methods help prevent the drink — and therefore the acid — from actually touching your teeth.

, Smoking is terrible on your mouth. In addition to giving you bad breath and stained teeth, smoking can also increase your chances of losing your teeth and getting mouth cancer. If you currently smoke, seriously consider quitting. If you do not smoke, don’t start. Quitting smoking can also have positive benefits on your overall health and wellbeing, not to mention your pocketbook., There are several things you may do on a regular basis that have become habits, but are actually quite bad for your teeth and mouth. Reducing the amount of time you use the habit, or eliminating it altogether, will significantly help keep your mouth healthy and strong. The following bad habits should be avoided:Biting your nails.
Brushing too hard or with a hard-bristled toothbrush. Massage, don’t scrub, your teeth when you brush.
Grinding or clenching your teeth. If you happen to do this while you sleep, ask your dentist about a mouthguard.
Chewing ice cubes.
Using your teeth as tools! This includes using your teeth to rip tape or open a plastic package. Use scissors instead.

, Ideally you should have a professional cleaning and dental exam at least once a year, however some dentists (and insurance plans) may suggest as often as every six months. A professional cleaning will allow a dentist or dental hygienist to scrape off all the built-up plaque and tartar on your teeth that you are not able to remove with brushing or flossing. X-rays are often taken at annual dental exams in order to allow the dentist to determine if you have any cavities or other issues., If you find yourself experiencing any of the following problems, make an appointment to see your dentist right away. Many of these issues are symptoms for much more serious dental problems which, if caught early, may be simple to fix. If your dentist is already aware of these issues from an annual exam, follow their instructions as to how to handle the problem.Very red, swollen and tender gums.
Gums that bleed a lot when you brush or floss.
Gums that appear to be pulling away from your teeth (it looks like your teeth are getting bigger).
Gums that seem to grow bigger and wider, slowly covering the surface of your teeth.
Loose teeth (other than baby teeth).
Changes in your bite — the way your top and bottom teeth align.
Very high sensitivity to heat or cold.
Constant bad breath or bad taste in your mouth.

, Fluoride can help prevent tooth decay and, therefore, cavities. Fluoride is normally found in toothpastes and mouthwashes, but can also be applied as a varnish or treatment at your dentist’s office. Annual fluoride treatments are normally recommended for children and teenagers, but adults can also benefit.Many cities throughout North America add fluoride to their drinking water, which is for your teeth. Check with your city to determine if fluoride is added to the water where you live.

Stay away from toothpaste brands that market themselves as ""whitening"" or ""brightening"" because they ones are very abrasive.

, Cleaning your teeth doesn't just stop at picking the right toothpaste. You should choose the right toothbrush, too. Pick a toothbrush that has soft bristles, enough to reach those hard to reach areas while not irritating your gums.

Be subtle when cleaning your implants to avoid scratching the outer coating. There are interdental toothbrushes in the market that can help you remove the plaque. These toothbrushed have tiny bristles that can help you get to those hard to reach areas with precision.

, Generally, there are hundreds of dental floss brands in the market. If you are given a choice between the waxed and unwaxed ones, always pick the latter. Insert the floss between your tooth and perform the flossing with a shoeshine motion. This reduces the chances of food particles getting stuck between your dental implants, thus extending its lifespan.

There are also water flossers and dental irrigators that do the same thing, although it's a little harder to acquire than a dental floss.

, After flossing, use an antibacterial mouthwash or mouth rinse. Choose a mild mouthwash to go hand in hand with your mild toothpaste."

Use toothpaste that does not contain sodium lauryl sulfate.,
Brush with a soft bristle brush.,
Floss once daily.,
Make sure your dental equipment fits properly.",How to Avoid Getting Canker Sores1," Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) can be found in some commercial toothpastes and mouthwashes. SLS is often used as a cheap filler to help toothpaste thicken and foam up. But this additive has been shown to increase the likelihood of developing canker sores in your mouth.Read the labels on toothpastes and mouthwashes to make sure they are free of SLS before you use them or search online for brands that specifically do not contain SLS.;
, You can also follow good oral hygiene by choosing a soft bristle toothbrush to clean your teeth. Try to brush your teeth twice a day and after every meal. This will reduce the presence of bacteria and food particles that may cause canker sores to develop.Using a soft bristle brush will also prevent irritation in your mouth. Irritating your mouth with hard brushes can lead to the development of canker sores.

, Floss once each day to prevent food particles from staying in your mouth. These food particles can lead to oral health issues, including canker sores.Get in the habit of flossing before bed as well so your mouth is clean and free of bacteria or food particles.
Flossing more than once daily can be harmful to your gums.

, If you have braces or a retainer, make sure it is not rubbing or scratching the inside of your mouth. Poorly fitting dental equipment can lead to the development of canker sores. Talk to your dentist if you feel your dental equipment is irritating your mouth.If you have braces that are rubbing against your mouth and causing sores, try using dental wax to cover sharp edges.

Learn how to brush your tongue.,
Alter your tongue brushing technique.,
Try a psychological trick.",How to Avoid Gagging While Brushing Your Tongue1," The gag reflex is just that: a reflex. It is triggered when you touch an area too far back in your mouth (including the tonsils, back of the tongue, or uvula). In order to avoid triggering the gag reflex, you have to avoid touching these areas.


Brush and floss your teeth first, and then gently brush your tongue using a soft bristled brush moistened with water. You can use your regular toothbrush, or you can purchase a special ""tongue brush"" which has shorter bristles meant to better clean the crevices of the tongue.Begin brushing the tongue toward the tip, working in small circular motions. Gradually work your way back toward the back of the throat, rinsing the brush periodically. Stop short of the area that triggers the gag reflex. If you gag, you've gone too far.;
, If these basic tips aren't working for you, there are slight alterations you can try that might help.


Hold your toothbrush perpendicular to your tongue, brushing from the side. Putting your toothbrush in the long way will make it easier to ""slip"" into the overly sensitive danger zone, and makes your toothbrush less likely to crowd the back of the throat and induce a gag.
Push the tongue down hard into the lower part of the mouth behind the teeth as you brush it. As soon as the tongue starts to wobble, stop, give it a few moments to retrieve your strength and try again.
Exhale through your mouth while brushing your tongue. At the same time, relax your tongue and throat muscles as much as possible. Keep practicing until it becomes a normal habit.

, Your gag reflex is your body's way of protecting you from choking or swallowing things you shouldn't, but you can try to outsmart your body by distracting your mind from what is going on in your mouth as you brush your tongue.


Distract yourself with pain. Clench the fingers of one of your hands into a fist, gently digging your nails into your palm. Don't hurt yourself badly, just enough to distract yourself from the gag reflex.
Distract yourself with thoughts. Before you begin brushing your teeth, find a riddle or difficult math problem to solve. While you begin to gently brush your tongue, starting in the front, mentally focus on the riddle or problem and try to solve it as you work your way back to the back of your tongue. Don't go too far back, and you might find that the mental distraction helped to alleviate the gag reflex.

You may see particles near the extraction sites that look grey, black, blue, green, or yellow. This is normal discoloration and is part of the healing process., Thoroughly brush and floss the rest of your mouth, but avoid the teeth closest to the wound., It's okay to rinse the first day, but you have to take certain precautions.Combine 1/4 teaspoon salt with one cup of warm water. Stir it well to mix.
Avoid swishing the saltwater rinse in your mouth or spitting it out. Gently move your head to move the rinse around your mouth or use your tongue to help move the saline solution around.
After rinsing, lean over the sink and open your mouth to let the rinse fall out. Don't spit.
Your doctor may also give you chlorhexidine gluconate (Peridex, Periogard) to rinse with. This is a germicidal mouthwash that helps kill bacteria., Don't use your tongue to prod the hole, either. Doing this may introduce bacteria to the wound, and could disrupt the healing tissue.Instead, stick to salt water rinses to remove food particles.

, Any kind of suction activity in the mouth could dislodge blood clots, causing a painful dry socket and potentially leading to infection., Salt water rinses are useful for cleaning wounds in the mouth, removing food, and reducing pain and inflammation.


Mix 1/4 teaspoon salt in eight ounces of water.
Stir completely, so that the salt is well-dissolved in the water.

, You may wish to focus your rinsing action on the affected side of your mouth, to most effectively remove debris and provide inflammation relief., You'll also want to rinse thoroughly before you go to sleep. Doing this will reduce inflammation and help ensure that your wound is kept clean and can heal properly., Using a syringe may help you control the flow of water and allow you to clean your wound more efficiently; however, if not used properly, an irrigator or syringe can dislodge the blood clot forming to heal the tissue. Ask your dentist whether you should use one.Fill the syringe with lukewarm water. You may also use the saltwater solution described above.
Aim the tip of the syringe as close as possible to the site of your wound without actually touching it.
Flush the site of the wound from any necessary angles to thoroughly clean the wound and prevent infection. Do not push too forcefully — expelling a powerful jet of water directly into the socket could be harmful.

, Food that gets caught in a wisdom teeth wound may be uncomfortable, but it alone should not cause an infection. Healing can still take place even if food gets caught, and it's more important to avoid touching or probing the wound., Clots in the gums may appear gray and fibrous, like food particles. Cleaning too vigorously in this case may remove the clot and cause further complications., This is especially important during the first 24 hours after surgery. Gradually move from soft foods to semi-soft foods as your wound heals. It's generally best to avoid hard, chewy, crunchy, and spicy foods, as these are most prone to pooling in the socket and causing irritation or infection.Chew on the opposite side or your mouth from the extraction site.
Avoid eating foods that are too hot or cold foods. Go for room temperature foods during the first two days.

Use cosmetic mouthwash to mask bad breath.,
Use therapeutic mouthwash to fight bacteria.,
Use fluoride mouthwash to prevent cavities.,
Use prescription mouthwash for medical purposes.,
Use herbal mouthwash to avoid dyes and chemicals.",How to Use Mouthwash1," If your aim is simply to freshen up your breath, there are a variety of products you can choose from to cover the bad odor. These leave your mouth tasting pleasant and temporarily make your breath smell better. Cosmetic mouthwash is a good choice for rinsing after you've eaten a particularly pungent meal, like garlic spaghetti sauce. It serves the same function as an after-dinner mint, with fewer calories.If you have chronic bad breath, cosmetic mouthwash isn't going to address the source of the issue nor will it help reduce plaque, gingivitis, or cavities. It masks bad smells, but it doesn't kill the bacteria that produces them. The point of cosmetic mouthwash is just to make your mouth taste and smell good.;
, Therapeutic mouthwashes fight bacteria that cause bad breath while reducing plaque and treating gingivitis. Some may even whiten teeth. If you're looking for a mouthwash that actually cleans your mouth, choose one with therapeutic agents that will reduce harmful bacteria in your mouth. Look for an over-the-counter mouthwash in the toothpaste aisle that is labeled as being antibacterial or antiseptic.


Using an antibacterial mouthwash may help you tackle the root of bad breath, which is often caused by bacteria. This is because it will kill bacteria and inhibit its reproduction in your mouth. That said, some antibacterial agents, such as such as chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium, may discolor your teeth.You might also want to try an antiseptic mouthwash. This will stop the growth of bacteria as well as fungi, protozoa, and viruses. However, antiseptic mouthwash contains a lot of alcohol, which can dry out your mouth and cause irritation., If your goal is specifically to keep your teeth from getting cavities, you might want to choose a therapeutic mouthwash that contains fluoride. It helps to reduce the lesions that lead to cavity formation.Fluoride is in most commercially available toothpaste, and it is also added to the water in many cities, but you might want to consider using extra fluoride if your teeth are particularly prone to cavities.While fluoride does help to reduce cavities, some scientists posit that it can be toxic to the body and the environment.Research the pros and cons of using fluoride before you decide to make it a part of your daily routine.

, If you have an infection, mouth pain, lack of saliva (xerostomia), or another medical condition, your doctor or dentist might prescribe a special mouthwash to treat the problem. Use the mouthwash as directed by your physician. Check the instructions that come with your prescription to learn about dosage and side effects.

, If you want to start using mouthwash, but would prefer to know exactly what you're using to rinse your teeth every day, choose one (or make your own) that is made with herbs that promote good oral health. Clove, peppermint and rosemary are all herbs that are traditionally used in preparations for the mouth and teeth due to their antibacterial, antiseptic and cooling properties."

Schedule a visit to the doctor’s office regularly.",How to Care for Dental Implants2," The dentist can examine your dental health in addition to making sure the implants are okay.

Avoid too much sugar.",How to Care for Dental Implants3," Dental implants are stronger than natural teeth. However, handling your implants with care is still critical., Although plaque may not cause oral hygiene problems, it might harm your gums, and that's why you need to brush your teeth with fluoride toothpaste after every meal., Lack of flossing might affect your dental implant adversely in addition to affecting your natural teeth. The fact that you have had dental implants on some of your teeth should not stop you from taking good care of your remaining teeth., Choosing a maneuverable toothbrush is an excellent idea because it helps you clean your dental implants with relative ease., One good thing about dental implants is that they do not decay. However, using too much sugar can result in plaque build-up, increasing the vulnerability of your gums."

Avoid foods that can irritate your mouth.,
Go for a healthy, balanced diet.,
Reduce your stress levels.",How to Avoid Getting Canker Sores2," Some foods have been shown to irritate your mouth, such as nuts, chips, and pretzels. You should also avoid citrus foods like lemons and limes so your mouth does not get irritated. Salty foods, spicy foods, and acidic foods like pineapples, oranges, and grapefruits can also irritate your mouth, leading to the development of canker sores.Try not to suck on candies or chew gum, as these products can irritate your mouth and encourage the development of canker sores.
You should also avoid foods you are allergic to, as you may develop allergic reaction that could lead to canker sores and swelling of your mouth or throat.

, Maintaining a healthy, balanced diet overall can help your immune system stay strong. This can then prevent the development of canker sores, among other health issues. Try to have a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables, such as salads with fresh vegetables.Foods that contain cultured dairy, such as yogurt, have been shown to help reduce certain bacteria in your mouth. This could then reduce your likelihood of developing canker sores. Make sure there is yogurt in your diet as well as cultured, sour dairy products.

, High stress levels can contribute to the development of canker sores. If you notice you tend to develop canker sores when you are stressed, take steps to calm down and relax so you are less prone to stressing out.When you start to feel stressed, anxious, or overwhelmed, try doing a relaxing activity like yoga or deep breathing exercises. Or go for a walk to your favorite park or focus on a hobby that you enjoy doing.

Gargle salt water or a baking soda rinse.,
Place wet tea bags over the area.,
Try over-the-counter numbing mouth gel.,
See your doctor if the canker sore does not go away after two weeks.",How to Avoid Getting Canker Sores3," Most canker sores will go away on their own, but if you would like to speed up the healing process you can try gargling with salt water or a baking soda rinse. Add one tablespoon of sea salt or baking soda to four ounces of warm water. Gargle with it twice a day to try to clean out and heal the canker sore.Do not swallow the mouth rinse, as this can lead to illness. Gargle by swishing it around in your mouth for 10 – 15 seconds and then spit it out.

, You can also try placing wet tea bags over the canker sores to help them heal. You may use herbal tea bags by steeping them in water and then letting them cool. Then, place them over the canker sore or hold them against the canker sore with your tongue., There are numbing mouth gels for canker sores that you can find at your local drugstore. They may be helpful if you want to numb the pain and be able to eat or chew without irritation.Follow the label instructions on the numbing gel when applying the mouth gel and do not apply too much of the product. The mouth gel should be safe for oral use and safe to swallow.

, If you notice the canker sore does not heal on its own after two to three weeks, you may want to see your doctor or your dentist. You should also see a doctor if the canker sore spreads to other areas of your mouth and become very large, or if you develop a high fever while having canker sores.You should also see your doctor if the canker sores are very painful despite the use of numbing gel or over-the-counter pain medication.

Try a tongue scraper.,
Try flossing your tongue.,
Try using a washcloth.,
Use mouthwash.",How to Avoid Gagging While Brushing Your Tongue2," Tongue scrapers or cleaners can be purchased at the pharmacy or big box stores like Target or Walmart. They may feel less invasive than a larger, wider-surfaced toothbrush.


A tongue scraper is a small tool made of plastic or metal that gently removes debris and plaque from the tongue. To use a tongue scraper, place its edge toward the back of your tongue and gently pull forward. Repeat as needed to cover the surface of the tongue, rinsing between scrapes.To reduce the gagging reflex, simply do not place the tongue scraper as far back into your mouth as you use it. Find the farther point you can place it without gagging, and start there.

, If the tongue scraper method does not work, you can use dental floss to clean the surface of the tongue.


Take a normal length of dental floss and drag it down across your tongue. This works well for individuals with a particularly high gag reflex, but it does not remove as much debris from the tongue as other methods.
As with the tongue scraper, to reduce the gag reflex you will need to find the farthest distance back on the tongue that you can place the floss without gagging.

, If a tongue scraper or floss still triggers your gag reflex, a simple wet washcloth might be all you need.


Use a soft, clean washcloth and moisten it with warm water. You can add a bit of toothpaste if you like, but it isn't necessary, especially if the taste of the toothpaste contributes to your gag reflex.
Wrap the cloth around one finger and gently rub the surface of the tongue to remove plaque and debris. Go as far back on the tongue as you can without gagging, rinsing the cloth periodically.

, People with very strong gag reflexes or sensitive tongues may not find a tongue cleaning method that works for them, but use of a good mouthwash can eliminate most of the problematic bacteria and leave the mouth healthy and clean.


Look for an antimicrobial mouthwash containing fluoride and alcohol. Be sure to rinse the teeth for 30 seconds then spit the mouthwash out completely. Do not drink water or rinse the teeth for at least 30 minutes after using mouthwash. Brands like Listerine Total Care are effective at reducing bacteria in the mouth and leaving the breath fresh.Ask your dentist about a prescription for an oral rinse of chlorhexidine gluconate. Using this twice a day may eliminate the need for tongue brushing and help you battle gingivitis.

Prevent bacteria build-up.,
Prevent bad breath.,
Prevent discoloration.",How to Avoid Gagging While Brushing Your Tongue3," The tongue's unique texture and large surface area makes it host to millions of bacteria, which can travel to the teeth and gums and cause cavities and gingivitis.


The teeth gather plenty of bacteria themselves, but unlike the teeth, the tongue is not a smooth surface. It follows that even more bacteria accumulate in the taste-buds and small pits on the tongue.Just rinsing the mouth with water is insufficient to remove the bacteria on the tongue, primarily because the bacteria gather in what is called a ""biofilm""-- a sticky, gooey, living layer of bacteria. It must be disrupted by rubbing or scraping to fully remove it., The bacteria that live on the tongue cause a chemical reaction that produces volatile sulfur compounds, which results in bad breath.Tongue brushing can also remove traces of odorous foods like garlic and onions, which can also improve your breath.
Many people with bad breath are not aware that they have it. Its a good idea to practice good oral hygiene, including regularly cleaning the tongue, in order to reduce the chance that you are one of them.

, Certain foods and health conditions can cause a colored or filmy appearance on the surface of the tongue. Brushing the tongue can eliminate this problem.


Foods containing dyes like cupcakes, lollipops, or popsicles can temporarily dye the surface of the tongue. Brushing the tongue can reduce the coloration of the tongue, making it less noticeable to others.
Some illnesses like oral thrush or syphilis can cause a buildup of bacteria or fungi on the tongue that cause a filmy, white appearance. In some cases, the white film cannot be brushed off. Be sure that you see your doctor if you suspect that your filmy tongue is caused by an illness.Certain medications like antibiotics or Pepto-Bismol as well as certain illnesses can also cause a startling discoloration of the tongue called ""black hairy tongue,"" which is caused by an overgrowth of yeast in the mouth. The condition is not serious and the discoloration can be brushed off with a toothbrush or washcloth, although it might be a good idea to see your doctor to determine the cause.

, In addition to whitening, cosmetic dentists use a variety of techniques to produce an even, white smile.Bonding involves applying tooth-colored resins to your teeth in order to fill in chips or excess spaces and to cover stains.
Veneers are porcelain or plastic covers that last longer than bonding and cost less than crowns. They also improve the appearance of chipped, stained, or misshapen teeth and create a perfect smile offering the same contour, shape and color. The dentist will take an impression of your tooth and then have a custom veneer made in a laboratory.
Crowns cover an entire tooth. In addition to cosmetic improvement, crowns are used to restore or protect a broken or weak tooth and in order to stabilize large fillings.
Implants replace the root of a tooth by fusing to the jawbone. Then, the implant will require a crown similar to the natural tooth. This is a surgical procedure which must be done by a specialist.
Inlays/Onlays are indirect fillings made from porcelain or other composite materials used to treat tooth decay or structural damage. They are created in a dental laboratory and then fitted and bonded into the damaged tooth.
Smile makeovers involve one or more cosmetic treatments, such as dental implants, dental veneers, teeth whitening to improve the overall appearance of your mouth.
Full mouth reconstruction is needed to correct functional problems of your teeth, muscles, bite and bone structure.

, If whitening your teeth is your main concern, you can start by trying at-home treatments, which may be significantly less expensive than professional whitening. Purchase whitening toothpastes, strips, or brush-on formulas from the drug store. However, before you use a kit with a strong bleaching agent such as peroxide, you should check with your regular dentist to be sure that there isn’t an underlying issue such as decay or disease, such as hypomineralization of the enamel, that should be addressed first., Cosmetic dentists can address uneven teeth using veneers and reshaping. However, if you have seriously misaligned teeth, you may do better with an orthodontist who can straighten teeth with braces. If you are not sure, consult with both a cosmetic dentist and an orthodontist and compare their answers.

, He may be able to undertake some basic cosmetic procedures himself. In addition, he should be able to refer you to specific recommended cosmetic dentists. Even if your dentist offers to do a cosmetic procedure, don’t hesitate to get a second opinion from a dentist whose practice focuses on cosmetic dentistry before making a final decision.

, The American Dental Association has state and local organizations that maintain lists of dentists by specialty, for example.Cross-check with your state’s licensing body to assure yourself that your prospective dentist in good standing., Accreditation requires further education and demonstration of knowledge and clinical experience.The qualifications for being accredited will vary depending on your location, but your dentist should be a member of a major national organization, such as the American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry. Such organizations may allow you to search their members., Dental training programs often offer low-cost services to local residents in order to allow their students to practice their skills under the supervision of experienced dentists., You want to be able to compare approaches, prices, and overall impressions. While one dentist might be a very compelling salesperson, another dentist might be able to address your major concerns with a less complicated or expensive approach. A consultation does not commit you to working with a dentist.


Pay attention to the surroundings as well as to the dentist herself. The waiting room and office should be clean and pleasant, and the dentist’s staff should be professional and courteous.

, Whitening can be done through one or two longer in-office visits, or by means of an at-home process that takes about a month, for example. Which method does the dentist prefer? If she uses both approaches, how does she advise her patients on selecting one?

, A good cosmetic dentist should be happy to let you see and speak with his satisfied clients. Ask references about the quality of the care they received as well as the results., Cosmetic dentistry is a constantly-evolving field. You want to choose a dentist who is up-to-date on new methods and trends, as well as in good standing in her state and professional organizations.

, Not all cosmetic dentistry procedures provide permanent solutions. For instance, whitening will be affected by the food and drink you subsequently consume. Dental bonding, although quicker and less expensive than veneers, may stain, chip, or break.Ask the dentist about how long the effects of whitening or other treatments can be expected to last.

, The prospective dentist should be willing to offer a detailed list of fees and an estimate of what his recommended treatments will cost you. He should also be open about the availability of appointments and the likely length of the course of treatment.

, Since most of the cosmetic dental treatments are not covered under the insurance plans, check whether the dentist offers flexible payment options or not.

Cabbage
Cauliflower
Lettuce
Onions
Fruits like apples, peaches, and pears
Replace gassy vegetables with those that don’t give you discomfort. You may need to experiment a bit to figure out what works best for you.

, Ease off on high fiber foods. High fiber foods can increase gas production as they are digested. These include whole-grain breads and bran.If you recently increased the amount of fiber in your diet, reduce it again and then add fiber more slowly so your body has time to adjust. It may take a few weeks.
If you are taking fiber supplements reduce the amount until your symptoms subside. Then increase again slowly at a rate you can tolerate.

, Some people become lactose intolerant as they get older. This can cause gas and bloating.If this is the case for you, you may need to reduce the amount of milk products in your diet such as milk, cheese, cream, and ice cream.

Chew some sugar-free gum.,
Chew herbs like mint, parsley, basil, or wintergreen.,
Chew nuts and seeds.",How to Fix Bad Breath on the Spot2," Sugar-free gum helps to stimulate saliva production. This will help stop your mouth from drying out. A dry mouth often leads to bad breath because bacteria responsible for the foul odor aren’t washed away. Gum can also help remove food particles from the crevasses of your teeth. Sugar-free gum isn’t a substitute for proper oral hygiene. Don’t stop brushing your teeth and flossing.It is possible to get natural gums made from peppermint and other herbs, which will help mask the smell of bad breath in addition to removing matter from your teeth., These herbs won’t clean your teeth, but they will counter your bad breath with a strong scent.

Ask your dentist to perform a gas chromatography test.",How to Fix Bad Breath on the Spot4," Most people try to breathe into their cupped hand in order catch a whiff of their own breath, but too often this just give you an idea of how your hand smells. Since our nasal passages are connected to our mouths, such a technique is not an accurate indicator of your breath’s odor. The best way to recognize bad breath on the spot is to consult someone you’re comfortable with. Find a loved one — someone you won’t turn off too badly — to quickly sniff your breath. Don’t make it obvious. Just a quick exhale will do the trick., Step to the side and lick the inside of your wrist. Because your wrist doesn’t rub up against many things, it’ll be a better indicator of your breath. Wait for your saliva to dry and then give your wrist a whiff. This is one of the most accurate ways of smelling your own breath., Take a spoon and place it upside-down on the back of your tongue. Slowly, but deliberately drag it to the front of your mouth. Now examine residue that you’ve collected on the spoon. If it is clear, then you probably don’t have bad breath. Most likely, it will be a milky-white or even a yellowish color. What you’ve collected is a film of bacteria that has accumulated on your tongue. This bacteria is what causes bad breath.It is important to scrape the back (posterior) of the tongue when you are brushing your teeth. This is prime real estate for bacteria that cause bad breath.
Similarly, you can perform this test with a piece of gauze — found at any pharmacy. Spoons tend to be more accessible in everyday situations.

, The Halimeter test looks for sulfide signatures in your breath. VSCs or sulfur compounds are commonly found in the human mouth, but high levels of sulfur signatures can indicate bad breath. Sulfur smells like eggs — this is not the smell you want in your mouth during an important meeting. Most likely, your dentist will have to administer the test, but if you really want your own Halimeter, you can purchase one. They are very expensive., This test measures sulfur levels and several other chemical compounds found in your mouth. This is the most effective test and its readings are considered to be the gold standard."

Bad breath is one of the most obvious signs of gum disease and plaque buildup. Your dental hygienist and dentist will be able to highlight any missing steps in your dental hygiene routine and help you combat any dental issues you might be having., Maybe you’ve been looking in your mouth, trying to figure out what is causing your bad breath. If you’ve noticed little white flecks stuck to the back of your mouth on either side of your uvula (the dangling ball in the back of your mouth), you should go visit a dentist. These white specks are known as tonsil stones. They are calcified food, mucus, and bacteria clumps. While they are not uncommon, they need to be removed with care.


French researchers discovered that around six percent of people have some degree of tonsil stone buildup., There are several causes of dry mouth induced bad breath. While dehydration is the primary cause, certain conditions, medications, and other systemic issues can cause dry mouth. Stuffy noses, diabetes, side-effects from antidepressants, antihistamines, and diuretics, radiotherapy, and Sjögren’s syndrome can all cause dry mouth. Your dentist will point you in the direction of a physician for many of these tests, but can help identify possible causes of your dry mouth."

Sniff your own breath.,
Do a lick test.,
Ask a trusted friend or relative.",How to Control Bad Breath1," It is difficult for you to assess your own breath because you become habituated to it.This is similar to how people can have body odor and not know it. However, if your breath is very bad, this may work:


Cup your hands over your nose and mouth.
Breathe into your hands from your mouth and inhale through your nose.
If your breath is very bad, you will probably be able to smell it.;
, This method can be used to determine whether your dry saliva smells unpleasant.Lick the inside of your wrist.
Allow the saliva to dry. This should only take a few seconds.
Go somewhere out of the wind, and then sniff the dried saliva on your wrist.
If the saliva on your wrist smells bad, then your breath does too.

, This is probably the most objective way to get an answer, as long as the person really will tell you if it’s bad.


Other people will be better at assessing your breath than you because they won’t already be used to it."

Brush and floss your teeth before bed.,
Invest in an electric toothbrush.,
Clean your tongue once per day.,
Gargle with non-alcoholic mouthwash.,
See your dentist regularly and get a teeth cleaning at least once per year.",How to Prevent Morning Breath1," Good oral hygiene is the key to fighting bad breath. Get in the habit of brushing and flossing your teeth after every meal and before bed to eliminate odor-causing bacteria in your mouth.To floss correctly: Cut off about 40 cm of floss. Wind the ends around the middle fingers of each of your hands.Hold the floss between your thumbs and first fingers to create a tight three to four cm section to pull between your teeth.
Place the section of floss between each tooth, gently scraping the floss against the sides of each tooth. Run the floss through each tooth in your mouth. Use a fresh piece of floss if it starts to accumulate debris.
Your gums may bleed a little when you floss between your teeth. They should stop bleeding after a few rounds of flossing. If the bleeding persists, talk to your dentist about gum disease.;
, Though a regular toothbrush will do the job if you use it regularly, electric toothbrushes are very effective at killing bad breath.Many electric toothbrushes have timers, so you know you are brushing your teeth for the right length of time to really get rid of smelly bacteria. Electric toothbrushes also distribute toothpaste in a uniform motion, which helps to remove plaque more efficiently.

, If you have morning breath, chances are you have a thick, white coating on the back of your tongue. This is an accumulation of bacteria on your tongue that causes bad breath. So it’s important to clean your tongue at least once a day to remove this bacteria.You can dip a soft toothbrush in non-alcoholic mouthwash and scrape your tongue, removing the bacteria.
You can also buy a special plastic tongue scraper from your local pharmacy. Place it as far back as you can on your tongue and then gently scrape forward to remove the bacteria.

, Mouthwash that contains alcohol will dry out your mouth, and a dry mouth will lead to the build up of smelly bacteria and bad morning breath. Look for mouthwash that is alcohol free, and with antiseptic or antibacterial properties.


Though mouthwashes may advertise minty fresh breath, if they contain alcohol or don’t have antibacterial properties, they will just act as a cosmetic rinse and won’t really keep your breath fresh overnight.You can also gargle with baking soda and water before bed. This will create an alkaline environment in your mouth, which is good for killing bacteria.Put a teaspoon of baking soda in a cup of water and gargle the solution for one minute. You can also swallow some of the solution to coat the back of your throat (it’s not harmful). Be sure to spit out the solution and avoid rinsing your mouth before going to bed.

, Your dentist will be able to keep tabs on your bad breath and suggest possible remedies for your bad breath. Yearly teeth cleanings will help remove plaque on your teeth and any buildup on your tongue. This will reduce your chances of developing bad breath."

Drink lots of water before and after coffee.,
Add less sugar and milk to your coffee.",How to Avoid Coffee Breath1," Water helps to clean out the odor-causing bacteria. Drink a small cup of water before and after your coffee.

Try flavored water. Are you bored of drinking plain water? Try flavored water. Flavored water does the same job by eliminating the bacteria in your mouth and giving you a fresh breath.
Lemon water, orange water, and clove flavored water are a good choices.;
, Sugar and milk can cause the bad odor bacteria in your mouth.Cut out the sugar and replace it with honey or other sweeteners. Avoid adding milk to your coffee. If you really want milk with your coffee then, add less milk than you usually do."
"
Lick the inside of your wrist.,
Smell the inside of your wrist where the saliva has dried.,
Try swabbing the back of your tongue.",How to Tell if You Have Bad Breath1," Wait 5-10 seconds for the saliva to dry. Try to do this discreetly–when you're alone–and not in a public place, or you may get strange looks from those around you. Avoid trying this test just after you've brushed your teeth, used mouthwash, or eaten something minty, as a freshly-cleaned mouth may give you inaccurate results.;
, This is, more or less, what your breath smells like. If it smells unsavory, then you may need to improve your dental hygiene. If it doesn't smell like anything, then your breath probably isn't too bad--but you might need to try another self-test to be sure.


Bear in mind that this method primarily pulls saliva from the tip (anterior portion) of your tongue, which is fairly self-cleansing. Thus, smelling your licked wrist will only tell you how the best-smelling part of your tongue smells--and most bad breath tends to originate from the back of the mouth where it meets the throat.You can wash the saliva off of your wrist, but don't worry if you don't have access to water or sanitizer since the smell will dissipate quickly as the skin dries.
If your breath problems are relatively minor, you may not be able to smell much. If you're still worried, consider trying another self-testing method to give yourself a ""second opinion"".

, Use a finger or a piece of cotton gauze to reach deep into your mouth–but not so far back as to trigger your gag reflex–and wipe the surface of your tongue at the back of your mouth. Any bad-breath bacteria lurking back there will come off onto the swabbing tool. Sniff the swab (your finger or the cotton) for an accurate sense of how the back of your mouth smells.


This method may reveal bad breath more precisely than merely licking your arm. Chronic halitosis is caused by bacteria that breed on your tongue and between your teeth – and most of these bacteria congregate near the back of your mouth. The tip of your tongue is fairly self-cleaning, and you may clean the front of your mouth more regularly than the back of your mouth.Try swishing with antibacterial mouthwash–in the front and the back of your mouth–to keep bacteria from hiding out on the back of your tongue. Gargle with mouthwash, if you can, to keep bad-breath bacteria from congregating in your throat opening. When you brush your teeth, make sure to brush your furthest back teeth, and be sure to brush your tongue and gums.

Brush your teeth properly.,
Floss your teeth.,
Try using baking soda.,
Get regular dental check-ups.,
Use sugar-free gum or mints.,

Eat foods high in fiber.,
Avoid smoking or chewing tobacco.,
Eat foods high in Vitamin D. Vitamin D helps to inhibit the growth of bacteria in the mouth.,
Use herbs and spices.,
Drink green or black tea.,
Do a test to see if you have bad breath.,
Recognize a bad taste in your mouth.,
Use a halimeter.",How to Prevent Bad Breath," Brushing your teeth properly is one of the best things you can do in your fight against bad breath. Brush at least twice a day, for at least two minutes and make sure to cover all the areas in your mouth. Especially focus on where the teeth meet the gums.Use a soft bristled brush and replace it every three to four months.
Brush either right before you eat or one hour afterwards (otherwise you might damage or erode the enamel of your teeth).
Make sure to brush your tongue, because your tongue gets a lot of build-up of bacteria which can cause bad breath. Brush from the back to the front of your tongue and be certain to get the sides, as well. You shouldn't do more than four brushes on your tongue and make sure that you don't go too far back.;
, Flossing is another important component to good mouth health. Flossing removes the plaque and bacteria build-up from between your teeth, which even the best toothbrushes can't get rid of. Do this at least once a day.Flossing also rids the mouth of food particles and debris. If these are left between your teeth, they'll rot, which smells bad.
When you're flossing you want to focus on where the tooth meets the gum, so make sure that you rub one way against the tooth and then against the next tooth.

, Brushing your teeth with baking soda once a week will help neutralize the bacteria that cause bad breath. Using your regular toothbrush, simply sprinkle a pinch of baking soda on the bristles, then brush as usual.Baking soda can also be used as a mouthwash. Dissolve a half-teaspoon of baking soda into a small glass of water. Fill your mouth with the liquid, without swallowing, and swish it around your gums and teeth.
Baking soda neutralizes the acids that build up on the backs of your teeth, and beneath your tongue.

, Going to the dentist is important to maintaining your oral health, a primary factor in bad breath. A dentist, or dental hygienist, will perform a thorough cleaning of your teeth, gums, and mouth.Your dentist will notice if your bad breath is caused by something more serious than simply food or drink, or not having brushed properly.
If you have a lot of bad breath issues and you're following a strict healthy mouth regime (with brushing and eating properly), then you should definitely make an appointment to see your dentist.

, Like water, sugar-free gum or mints can help speed up the production of saliva in your mouth and help flush out the bad bacteria. They can also cover up bad breath for a short period of time.Use sugar-free gum and mints. Sugars can help feed the bad bacteria, which will make your bad breath worse once the gum or mint is gone.
Sugar-free gum is preferred over mints, and you can experience the benefits of chewing gum after only five minutes.
Gums containing Xylitol, a sugar-free sweetener made from birch bark, can be especially useful for preventing bad breath. It helps reduce tooth decay and may help reverse the loss of tooth enamel by replacing minerals to the tooth., Mouthwash is another way to deal with the immediate effects of bad breath. This will only provide you with a temporary mask for the bad breath, but that can be enough to avoid offending other people.However, an antiseptic mouthwash will kill the bad bacteria, so it will help do more than just mask the bad odor. Look for mouthwashes with hlorhexidine, cetylpyridinium chloride, chlorine dioxide, zinc chloride and triclosan, as these kill bacteria.
Avoid using a chlorhexidine-containing mouthwash long-term as this can stain your teeth (although this is reversible).
Try not to use mouthwashes containing alcohol. Alcoholic-based mouthwashes may be a factor in developing certain mouth cancers.
Make sure you rinse and deep-gargle with mouthwash.

, One problem that can cause bad breath or make bad breath worse is having a dry mouth. Water is odor-free and helps to flush out the food that bacteria loves. It also helps promote saliva which cleanses the mouth and eliminates the stink-causing substances in food.Don't use coffee, sodas, or alcohol to cleanse your mouth. They will not help prevent bad breath and, in many causes, are actually the causes of your bad breath.
Dehydration is often a factor in halitosis. Drinking more water to stay hydrated throughout waking hours, will help prevent bad breath.

, Not only do foods that are fresh and crunchy help to clean the teeth, they prevent halitosis. They improve digestion and help your body release toxins.Avoid sugary foods and drinks. If you need a snack, grab an apple or some protein rather than a candy bar.
Avoid acidic drinks. These are bad both for your breath and for the health of your teeth, as acidic drinks can hurt the enamel on your teeth. Avoid sodas as much as possible and if you have to drink them, make sure to drink them through or straw or quickly, without holding them in your mouth. You should also follow with water to try and rinse away the remnants.
Avoid coffee and alcohol. Both of these drinks provide an environment in your mouth for bacteria growth, which causes bad breath. They also dry out your mouth, which causes the bacteria to linger.

, While there are many reasons to avoid or quit smoking or chewing tobacco (like cancer), bad breath is certainly one of them. Smoking causes the smoker's breath to retain the smells of stale tobacco smoke, sometimes described as ""smelling like an ashtray."" The easiest way to prevent this bad breath is to stop smoking.A tobacco habit can also lead to gum disease, which among other more serious things, causes bad breath.
Smoking stains your teeth and can irritate your gums. Stopping smoking will help you maintain a healthier mouth.

, Vitamin D can be consumed in the form of fortified foods and beverages, but it is most commonly and efficiently derived from exposure to sunlight.Try eating sugar-free yogurt once a day. Yogurt with good bacteria (probiotic bacteria) prevents bad breath by reducing the levels of bad breath causing sulfide compounds.
Stock up on vitamin-D rich foods through fatty fish, such as salmon, tuna or mackerel. Some mushrooms also contain Vitamin D.
Vitamin D can also be taken effectively through supplements. The recommended amount of Vitamin D is 600 IU for people between age 1-70, 800 IU for people over 70., Chewing raw parsley helps clean the teeth and mouth, and can help prevent bad breath. Cardamom, either in pods or ground, helps keep the breath fresh as well. Chew fennel seeds after a spicy meal, or grind them and sprinkle the ground seeds onto your toothbrush.Chewing mint leaves can also help clear your breath. You can also drink tea made by steeping mint leaves in boiling water.
Sprinkle salt on a wedge of lemon, and eat the lemon pulp. This negates the bad smell of onions, garlic, and other strong-smelling foods.

, Tea contains polyphenols that help eliminate sulfur compounds and reduce oral bacteria. They also aid in hydrating the mouth. Drink hot unsweetened tea several times a day for best results.Green tea is high in antioxidants, and helps fight bacteria in the mouth. Sipping green tea can also help neutralize scents from garlic.
Both black and green teas are made from an infusion of the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant. Black tea is one of the most commonly consumed beverage on the planet, second only to water.

, It's not always easy to tell when your own breath is foul-smelling to others. If you have bad breath, then these tests will transfer the sulfur salts from your mouth to something you can sniff and smell yourself.


Lick the inside of your clean wrist, then wait five minutes. Smell your wrist. If you have bad breath, you should be able to smell it on your skin.
Touch a clean gauze to your tongue and smell the gauze. If the gauze smells foul, you have bad breath.

, If you mouth tastes bad, then it's likely that your breath smells bad. Sometimes after you eat, you may notice that you continue to taste the food you've eaten. Certain strong tastes also are well-known for their odoriferous properties, such as garlic, onion, or heavily spiced foods.


Preventing bad breath after a meal is one of the simplest kinds of bad breath to treat.
If you notice a bad taste in your mouth that doesn't seem associated with the taste of food you've eaten, this may require additional treatment. Be aware that bad breath can be a sign of throat infections like strep throat.

, For persistent troubles with bad breath, your dentist may have a halimeter. A halimeter is a special machine that is designed to take a reading of your breath. It's like the breath analysis machine used to detect the presence of alcohol or other substances used by police.


The halimeter won't affect the conditions that cause bad breath, but can help you gather more precise data regarding the source of your bad breath. Learning more about the causes of bad breath will help you be able to treat it.
Halitosis is usually caused by three chemicals; dimethyl sulfide, hydrogen sulfide, and methyl mercaptan. When you find out which ones are present in your breath, you'll be better able to know what treatments will help improve your breath.

Brush your tongue with a paste of lemon juice and turmeric using your toothbrush. Use 1/4 of a teaspoon of lemon juice and add tumeric until a paste forms. Both have antibacterial properties.Brush your tongue with a paste of baking soda and lemon juice. Add baking soda to a quarter teaspoon of lemon juice until it has a toothpaste-like consistency.This will also kill bacteria and remove food particles or dead cells that are stuck on your tongue.
Don't do this more than once per day.

, Dentures also provide a surface that can trap food particles and harbor bacteria. Develop a routine for cleaning them:Use soap and warm water, denture cream, or denture tablets to clean them. Toothpaste may damage them and is not recommended.
Follow your doctor’s instructions or the manufacturer’s instructions for the cleaning materials that you are using.

, Not only does smoking itself have an odor that others will notice, but it lowers your immune system, making you more vulnerable to developing infections in your gums. The bacteria that grow often give off an unpleasant smell. If you need help quitting, you can:Talk to your doctor
See a counselor
Attend a support group
Get medications
Avoid places where you usually smoke
Develop alternative methods of stress management, like exercise and relaxation techniques

Go to a dentist if making dietary changes and improving your oral hygiene doesn’t help.,
Go to a doctor if your dentist recommends it.,
Ask your doctor whether any of your medications may be causing your bad breath.",How to Control Bad Breath4," Getting a teeth cleaning will remove any hard plaques and bacteria that are difficult get when brushing and flossing.Your dentist will also be able to tell you if your bad breath comes from an underlying dental problem such as:An abscessed tooth
Cavities
Gum disease
An impacted tooth
Periodontal disease
Mouth sores

, If your dentist thinks the underlying problem could be a condition that is not related to oral health, he or she may send you to your physician. The physician will look for many different conditions that can cause bad breath, including:Lung infection or abscess
Postnasal drip and inflammation of the nose, sinuses, or throat
Chronic kidney failure, which may produce a fishy or urine-like smell
Diabetes, which may cause a fruity smell associated with ketoacidosis
Gastrojejunocolic fistula which causes a fruity smell
Gastroesophageal reflux disease
Certain cancers, like stomach and lung cancer

, Some cause dry mouth, others may produce chemicals that smell as you metabolize them. If you think your medications are the source, do not stop taking them without consulting your doctor. Your doctor may be able to switch you to another medication that will still treat the condition, but not give you bad breath. Medications that may cause bad breath include:Insulin shots
Triamterene (Dyrenium)
Some medications for convulsive disorders, alcoholism, nervous, and mental conditions
Nitrates used to treat chest pain
Some chemotherapy medications
Some tranquilizers

Sleep on your side, rather than your back, to avoid snoring.,
Practice breathing through your nose, rather than your mouth before bed.,
Drink a glass of water before bed.,
Take saliva stimulants.",How to Prevent Morning Breath2," Snoring or breathing heavily through your mouth at night can increase the likelihood of bad breath. Most snorers and mouth breathers sleep with their mouth open, causing dry mouth and letting bad breath-causing bacteria flourish.Your saliva acts a biological cleaner, as it removes food particles in your mouth that cause bad odors. So drying out your mouth also means there is less saliva in your mouth, and this allows bad odors to linger.If you suffer from nasal congestion, take steps to remedy this so you can breath through your nose rather than your mouth while you sleep. Use a nasal drip, like a Neti Pot, or apply a decongestant, such as a chest rub, to open up your nasal passage., Before you go to sleep, think of the proverb: “The nose is for breathing, the mouth is for eating.” Try to train yourself to breath through your nose as you sleep by doing several rounds of conscious nose breathing.


Sit up straight in a comfortable position.Relax your upper body and close your mouth. Rest your tongue behind your bottom teeth, away from the top of your mouth.
Place your hands on your diaphragm, or your lower belly area. You should try to breathe from your diaphragm, rather than from your chest area. Breathing from your diaphragm is important because it helps your lungs with gas exchange and it massages your liver, stomach and intestines, working the toxins out of these organs. It will also relax your upper body.
Take a deep breath in with your nose and inhale for two to three seconds.
Exhale through your nose for three to four seconds. Pause for two to three seconds and breathe in again through your nose.
Practice breathing like this for several rounds of breaths. Extending your inhales and exhales will help your body get used to breathing through your nose, rather than your mouth.

, Dehydration is a big cause of bad breath; a dry mouth or a lack of saliva can lead to the development of odor-causing, volatile sulfur compounds. Drink at least eight glasses of water per day and have a glass of water before bed to clear your mouth of any lingering food particles or smelly bacteria.Drinking a glass of milk or taking two antacids can also help neutralize any bad odors in your mouth.

, Several dry mouth products on the market will increase the saliva in your mouth. You can also keep a stimulant in your mouth when you sleep to avoid dry mouth."

Eat fresh fruits and vegetables, such as raw carrots, celery or apples.,
Avoid garlic, onions and spicy foods.,
Reduce your sugar intake.,
Cut back on coffee and alcohol.,
Chew sugarless gum after a meal.",How to Prevent Morning Breath3," A watery vegetable or fruit, especially raw, can help clear your mouth of debris and any lingering food that could cause bad breath.Maintaining a healthy, balanced diet and eating regular meals can also help keep the bacteria in your mouth from piling up or drying out.
Certain diets, such as extreme fasting and very low-carb diets, can give you bad-smelling breath. This is due to chemicals called ketones, which are made by the breakdown of fat in your body. Breathing the ketones out of your mouth can create bad breath. So be aware of this unpleasant side effect before trying these diets., These foods will create very strong smells in your mouth. Chronic garlic eaters not only have chronic bad breath, they also have strong body odor because foods such as garlic and onions contain acids that stay in your body long after you eat them., Sugary foods leave traces of sugar in your mouth. These traces act as food for the bacteria in your mouth to thrive on, which then develop into acid that can contribute to tooth decay and tooth erosion, not to mention stale breath.Avoid snacking on sugary foods such as candy and sweets. Limit your consumption of fizzy drinks, including fizzy water and fruit juices, because these are usually very acidic.
If you do drink fizzy drinks such as soda, drink them quickly through a straw. Don’t swish them around in your mouth or hold them in your mouth for a long period of time.

, Coffee has a strong odor that leads to coffee breath and it can be difficult to get rid of the smell of stale coffee in your mouth. Caffeine can also cause you to become dehydrated and lead to dry mouth.Alcohol can also lead to dry mouth and will leave a stale odor in your mouth that is hard to brush away.
If you currently smoke, try to cut back. Tobacco products can give you very bad breath and the mouth odor from tobacco is difficult to get rid of.

, This will help to get the saliva flowing in your mouth and clear out any smelly bacteria. Look for gum that is 100 percent xylitol-sweetened, which not only gives you nice, fresh breath, it also reduces cavities.Be careful with breath mints. Sugar-free mints are fine for a quick fix after a meal. But they will only briefly mask the smell and don’t do anything to remove the harmful bad bacteria.
Skip the sugary after-dinner mint. The sugar will sit on your teeth and make your bad breath worse.

Talk to your dentist if your bad breath doesn’t go away.,
Speak to your doctor if you suffer from halitophobia.",How to Prevent Morning Breath4," If you’re taking good care of your mouth and are taking steps to prevent dry mouth at night but still wake up with bad breath, speak to your dentist. The mouth bacteria that causes bad breath can lead to several health implications, such as gingivitis and periodontitis.Some dental health issues can be linked to heart disease and stroke.

, Halitophobia is the fear of bad breath. It can become a serious issue and should be addressed with the help of a psychologist.People with this psychological condition think they have bad breath all the time. They may try to cover their mouth when talking or avoid talking to others. They may also become fixated with teeth cleaning and tongue cleaning, and frequently use chewing gum, mints, mouthwashes and sprays.

Eat an apple.,
Chew cloves.,
Eat ginger.,
Chew gum.,
Have yogurt for breakfast.",How to Avoid Coffee Breath2," Apple eliminates the odor causing bacteria by producing more saliva and it neutralizes the smell of your breath., Cloves have a pungent flavor. Chomp on a clove for a minute or two and then spit it out. This will give you a fresh breath and remove the coffee breath as well!, Ginger also has a really good flavor, so eat a small piece of ginger after coffee to remove that bad bacteria.Ginger cookies work well too. You can eat a cookie with or after coffee.

, This is one best cheap and affordable solution to your coffee breath. After your cup of joe, drink a glass of water and chew mint flavored gum. This will fight the bacteria as well as whiten your teeth.

Lemon flavor is also a good option.

, A Japanese study says that yogurt has the power to eliminate the odor causing smelly bacteria from your mouth.The bacteria in the yogurt replaces the odor causing agent in your tongue and mouth with good ones.

If you're not a fan of yogurt, probiotic pills can do the job but make sure to consult your physician before taking any.

Cover your mouth and nose with both of your hands.,
Breathe into a clean plastic cup or container.,
Get an accurate reading.",How to Tell if You Have Bad Breath2," Form a cup so that the air you breathe out through your mouth has nowhere to go but into your nose. Breathe out, slowly, from your mouth, and quickly inhale the hot breath through your nose. If your breath is especially rank, you may be able to tell – but the air can quickly escape through the cracks between your fingers, and it's difficult to get a precise diagnosis using this method.It is, however, one of the most discreet ways to check for bad breath in public.

, Take a deep breath, and then hold the cup so that it covers both your nose and your mouth, with minimal ventilation, so you can get a close to accurate answer. Breathe out through your mouth, slowly, filling the cup with hot breath. Inhale quickly and deeply through your nose--you should be able to smell your breath.


This step may be slightly more accurate than merely cupping your hands around your nose and mouth, but its accuracy is heavily dependent upon how tightly the cup seals in your breath.
You can try this out with any container that traps your breath in a circuit between your nose and your mouth: a small paper or plastic bag, a tight-fitting surgical mask, or any manner of air-retentive face-mask.
Be sure to rinse out the cup before breathing into it again. Wash it with soap and water before storing it or using it for anything else.

, Avoid trying these methods directly after you've brushed your teeth, swished with mouthwash, or eaten something minty. These things may make your breath smell better, but the way your breath smells immediately after brushing your teeth is not necessarily the way that it smells most of the time. Try smelling your breath at various times--right after brushing your teeth, but also in the middle of the day, when you're most likely to encounter people--to better understand the difference. Bear in mind that your breath may smell bad after eating a spiced meal

Consider asking a trusted friend or family member whether your breath smells bad.,
Be considerate.",How to Tell if You Have Bad Breath3," You can try to smell your own breath, but you can only ever approximate what someone else smells. The best way to know for sure is to swallow your pride and ask, ""Be honest. Does my breath smell bad?""Choose a person that you trust--someone that won't go around telling people, and someone that will be honest with you about your breath. Ask a close friend who you know won't judge you. Avoid asking a crush or a romantic partner, as serious bad breath might be a turn-off. Avoid asking strangers, unless you're feeling particularly bold.
It may seem embarrassing, at first, but you may find it a huge relief to get a trusted opinion on the matter. It's better to hear it from a close friend than from, say, someone you'd like to kiss.

, Don't just breathe into someone's face and say, ""How does my breath smell?"" Bring up the topic delicately, and always ask before demonstrating. If you spend a lot of time in close contact with the person, they may have already noticed that your breath smells bad; they may have just been too polite to bring it up.


Say, ""I'm worried that my breath might smell bad, but I can't really tell. This is embarrassing, but have you noticed anything?""
Say, ""This might sound strange, but does my breath smell bad? I'm taking Jenny out to a movie tonight, and I'd rather deal with it now than wait for her to notice.""

Determine whether you have morning breath or chronic halitosis.,
Keep good dental hygiene.,
Neutralize bad breath.,
Avoid using tobacco products.,
Speak with your dentist about the problem.",How to Tell if You Have Bad Breath4," Check your breath in the morning, in the afternoon, and in the evening, before and after you've brushed your teeth, and figure out how persistent the problem is. If you know why your breath smells bad, you can take steps to fix it.


Morning breath is normal. You can fix it by brushing, flossing, and rinsing with mouthwash right after you wake up.
Halitosis is a more serious bacterial infestation, but it is still common and still treatable. To fight halitosis, you'll need to keep your mouth clean and manage the bacteria that make your breath smell bad.
The most common causes of bad breath are dental cavities, gum disease, poor oral hygiene, and coated tongue (a white or yellow coating on the tongue, usually due to inflammation). If you can't tell from inspecting your mouth, your dentist should be able to tell you what's causing your bad breath.
If someone tells you that your breath doesn't smell so great, don't be embarrassed. Think of it as constructive criticism.

, Brush your teeth more thoroughly, gargle with antibacterial mouthwash, and floss between your teeth to keep plaque and bacteria from hiding out there. Drink plenty of water, and swish cool water around in your mouth to freshen morning breath.


It’s very important to brush your teeth before going to bed. You might try an additional round of brushing with baking soda to reduce the acidity in the mouth and make it difficult for the bacteria that cause bad breath to grow.
Use a tongue scraper (available at many drugstores) to remove any residue that may be building up between the taste buds and folds in the tongue. If you don’t have a tongue scraper, you can use your toothbrush to brush your tongue.Replace your toothbrush every two to three months. The bristles will become less effective over time, and your brush may accumulate bacteria. Replace your toothbrush after you've been sick so you don't give the bacteria a place to hide out., Chew gum, eat breath mints or use Listerine strips before sensitive social situations. Ultimately, you may want to treat the roots of your problem and banish your bad breath for good, but it never hurts to make your breath smell better in the meantime. Keep gum with you so that you can use it in emergencies.


Chew a handful of cloves, fennel seeds, or aniseeds. Their antiseptic qualities help fight halitosis-causing bacteria.
Chew a piece of lemon or orange rind for a mouth- freshening burst of flavor. (Wash the rind thoroughly first.) The citric acid will stimulate the salivary glands—and fight bad breath.
Chew a fresh sprig of parsley, basil, mint, or cilantro. The chlorophyll in these green plants neutralizes odors.

, If you ever needed another reason to quit, here’s an easy one: smoking contributes to bad breath. Tobacco tends to dry out your mouth, and it can leave an unpleasant smell that lingers even after brushing your teeth.

, Visit your dentist regularly to help maintain good oral hygiene. If you have chronic bad breath, your dentist can rule out any dental problems like cavities, gum disease, and coated tongue.


If your dentist believes that the problem is caused from a systemic (internal) source such as an infection, he or she may refer you to your family physician or a specialist.

Clean your teeth twice a day.,
Floss.,
Use mouthwash.,
Brush your tongue.,
Clean dentures or other dental appliances.,
Replace your toothbrush regularly.",How to Fight Bad Breath1," As bad breath is typically caused by the buildup of bacteria in your mouth, brushing your teeth twice daily can help. Brush your teeth when you get up in the morning and before you go to sleep at night. Use a toothpaste that contains fluoride.Brush both the inside and outside surfaces of your teeth. Spend at least two minutes brushing. You can use either an electronic or regular toothbrush. Both are equally effective at combating bad breath and bacteria in the mouth.Spit out any excess toothpaste when you finish brushing. Do not rinse your mouth out before spitting extra toothpaste. Rinsing your mouth with water too soon can dilute the fluoride in your toothpaste.;
, You should floss at least once a day. Flossing helps remove food particles that may be caught in your teeth. This can help reduce bad breath.Take 12 to 18 inches of floss. Grasp it, using your fingers, so you have a couple of inches of floss between your hands. Slip the floss between each tooth. Use 8 to 10 strokes to guide the floss down to the gums.As you go, periodically adjust your fingers to use a fresher portion of the floss you're holding.

, Mouthwash can help combat bad breath. Use an over-the-counter brand of mouthwash after brushing and flossing. Keep in mind that if your bad breath is caused by a dental problem, mouthwash will not cure it. It will merely cover up the odor. If bad breath persists, you should see a dentist to evaluate the potential cause., Many people neglect to brush their tongue when brushing their teeth. Your tongue can easily become coated with bacteria. Giving it a gentle brushing each time you brush your teeth may remove some of this bacteria, lessening bad breath., If you use dentures or something like a retainer, these supplies must be cleaned daily. If they're left unclean, bacteria can build up. This can cause bad breath and other dental problems.


When you got your dentures or retainer, your dentist should have provided you with information on cleaning. Follow these guidelines when cleaning dental appliances. If you do not remember the guidelines, call your dentist for clarification., Your toothbrush should be replaced every three to four months. Brushing your teeth with an old toothbrush will not adequately remove bacteria from your mouth. This can lead to bad breath and other dental health problems. If your toothbrush begins to look frayed and show signs of age, replace it with a new one."

Eat before or while you're drinking.,
Try onion and garlic.,
Chew gum.,
Drink coffee and water.",How to Cure Alcohol Breath1," Eating while you're drinking can help reduce alcohol breath. Food absorbs some of the alcohol you drink while also stimulating the production of saliva. This can prevent dehydration, which can heighten the presence of alcohol breath.


Bars often provide snacks like peanuts, popcorn, and other munchies to make sure patrons don't get sick from over-drinking. Try to periodically snack on these complimentary foods while you're out.
If you're drinking at a friend's place, offer to bring a snack for the group. Bring a couple of bags of potato chips or some microwave popcorn. This can benefit you by reducing alcohol breath and also make you look generous in the eyes of the host.;
, Foods that are highly aromatic can help override alcohol breath. Red onion and garlic both stay on your breath for a long time, reducing the smell of alcohol.


You can order bar foods that contain onion or garlic. Garlic-infused items, such as garlic fries or garlic bread, are often popular bar items.Add red onions to a sandwich, burger, or salad after drinking.Some people, if they're looking for a fast cure, simply eat onion or garlic raw. While this is quite effective, keep in mind the smell of garlic or onion can be quite strong. Not only does it radiate from your mouth it also comes out your pores. If you're trying to eliminate alcohol breath because you have somewhere to be, this might not be your best option. The smell of garlic, while more socially acceptable, can be as off-putting as booze breath., Gum can be helpful in eliminating alcohol breath. Not only does the strong smell cover up the smell of booze, it can cause you to salivate. This can also reduce alcohol breath.


Try sour flavored gums. This will cause excess salivation, which can eliminate alcohol breath faster. While the flavor may be initially hard to handle, keep in mind it gets milder the more you chew.
Mint gum is also a good option. A powerful menthol flavor can quickly cover up alcohol breath and is often used as a breath freshener.

, Drinking both coffee and water can help reduce alcohol breath. Water replenishes the hydration you lost drinking and promotes salivation, which can lessen alcohol breath. Coffee has a strong smell on its own, which can cover up the foul smell of booze. However, coffee is best used the morning after drinking. Mixing stimulants and depressants can cause a spike in energy, making you feel less drunk. This can lead to inadvertently drinking more than you can handle.

Quit smoking.,
Avoid foods and beverages that cause bad breath.,
Combat dry mouth.,
Try increasing your dairy intake.",How to Fight Bad Breath2," The biggest lifestyle change you can make to combat bad breath is to quit smoking. Tobacco, in addition to causing many other health problems, can seriously affect your breath. If you smoke, take steps to quit.


Both chewing and smoking tobacco products can leave an unpleasant smell in your mouth. You can mask these smells with mouthwashes and mints, but these only cover up the problem. Gum disease can result from smoking, which can worsen bad breath.Quitting smoking can be an incredibly difficult process. Talk to your doctor about taking steps to quit. He or she can recommend the proper course of action for you.
Seek support if you're quitting smoking. Let your friends and family members know you've made the decision to quit. Ask them to help distract you when you have cravings. If you have friends or family members that smoke, request that they not do so in front of you. There are many support groups, both online and in person, where former smokers go to talk about quitting, addiction, and recovery. Consider finding a support group online or in your area.

, Strong smelling or spicy foods, especially foods containing products like onions or garlic, can easily cause bad breath. If you have a diet high in these types of foods, consider cutting back. You may notice your breath improving if you cut out more pungent foods. Sticky or sugary foods can also cause bad breath., Dry mouth can cause bad breath. If your mouth feels dry, drink more water throughout the day. You should avoid coffee, soda, and alcohol as these things can increase dry mouth.


Chew gum or suck on candy during the day. This can stimulate saliva, lessening dry mouth.If your dry mouth does not improve with lifestyle changes, talk to your dentist. He or she may be able to recommend medication that stimulates the flow of saliva., While further research is needed, some studies suggest dairy products can neutralize odors in the mouth. Try adding unsweetened yogurt and low-fat cheese to your diet and see if you notice a difference."

Make an appointment with your dentist.,
Try a mouth rinse and toothpaste recommended by your dentist.,
Treat gum disease as your dentist advises.",How to Fight Bad Breath3," If your bad breath persists after you've made lifestyle changes, make an appointment with your dentist. Bad breath is rarely a medical concern, but chronic bad breath may be a sign of disease or infection.


Avoid eating, chewing gum, smoking, or drinking strong scented beverages within 3 hours of your appointment. Avoid perfumes, scented lotions, or strong smelling lipsticks as well.Your dentist will do a basic exam and teeth cleaning. He or she will also ask you questions about your lifestyle and symptoms. Your dentist will want to know when your bad breath started, whether it's occasional or continuous, what kinds of foods you eat, what health conditions you have, and how often you brush and floss your teeth.You may want to make an appointment with your doctor if your dentist can't pinpoint the problem. Bad breath can also be caused by underlying medical conditions.

, Your bad breath may be the result of a buildup of bacteria on your teeth. In this case, your dentist will likely recommend a particular mouth rinse or toothpaste.


Your mouth rinse will probably contain cetylpyridinium chloride, which combats the buildup of odors. If you need a prescription, you can get the mouthwash at your dentist's office or at a local pharmacy. However, your dentist may simply recommend an over-the-counter brand.The recommended toothpaste will probably contain an antibacterial agent. This can also help get rid of unwanted odors.Follow all your dentist's instructions exactly. If you have any questions about their products and their potential side effects, ask.

, Gum disease is often the cause of bad breath. If your dentist suspects gum disease, he will refer you to a gum specialist who can better address the issue. However, he may also just advise better cleaning to combat the disease.If you're diagnosed with gum disease or another infection, ask your dentist any questions you have. Treatments vary greatly based on personal medical history and the progression of the disease.

Shower.",How to Cure Alcohol Breath2," Brushing your teeth can help lessen bad breath associated with drinking. Spending a little extra time on your dental hygiene can help cover bad breath.


Use a strong-smelling toothpaste that contains menthol. This is most effective for covering alcohol breath.Spend an extra two minutes brushing your teeth. You'll need this extra time to get alcohol residue and alcohol-soaked food out of your mouth.

, Do not neglect flossing after a night of drinking. Food particles, which are diluted with alcohol, often get stuck between your teeth. This can contribute to alcohol breath even after you've brushed your teeth thoroughly.

, Mouth washes are designed to eliminate bad breath and tend to have a minty scent that will cover alcohol breath. Gargle for the recommended time listed on the bottle, usually around 30 seconds, and then spit into the sink and rinse with water.

, Alcohol does not just affect your breath. It also seeps through your pores, causing a boozy scent to come from your body. Always take a shower the morning or night after drinking.


Take a normal shower, paying special attention to washing your body.Strong-smelling soaps, shampoos, and conditioners may help eliminate or lessen the smell of alcohol."

Drink in moderation.,
Do not mix drinks.,
Stick to simple drinks.",How to Cure Alcohol Breath3," Drinking moderately rather than binge drinking can lessen the smell of alcohol. Try to stick to a few drinks over the course of the evening. Binge drinking can not only result in a strong smell but other health problems, especially when done frequently. Cutting back on drinking, and not drinking to get drunk, can help prevent alcohol breath.


Try to stick to drinking only two drinks per sitting.

, Different drinks have different odors. If you mix a variety of types of alcohol, this can make the overall odor worse. Stick to one type of alcohol you like for the night as this can lessen alcohol breath.

, Mixed drinks that contain herbs and spices can have a stronger odor than simple beer, wine, and liquor. Stick to simple drinks as this will lessen the smell of alcohol on your breath.

Consider a professional bleaching treatment.",How to Whiten Teeth With Hydrogen Peroxide1," Purchase a whitening toothpaste with hydrogen peroxide at your local pharmacy or grocery store. Brush with the product at least twice daily for at least one month to see results.Buy a product with at least 3.5% hydrogen peroxide, which is the standard amount. Be aware that the more hydrogen peroxide in a product, the likely it is to make your teeth sensitive.Brush your teeth twice a day with the toothpaste. It can take four to six weeks to notice results.Recognize that toothpastes only remove surface stains from activities like drinking or smoking.Consider using another peroxide product in addition to a toothpaste to get deeper stains and have better results.
Look for the American Dental Association’s Seal of Acceptance to minimize the risk of using an unsafe product.;
, There is some evidence that gel-filled trays with a 3% hydrogen peroxide gel can significantly whiten teeth.Buy an over-the-counter gel tray or have your dentist prescribe one.Buy either pre-filled trays or trays you fill with a product at your local pharmacy. Be aware that these products will fit most mouths and are not molded to your own teeth.Ask your dentist to mold a tray to your mouth and give you a higher concentration peroxide solution for more optimal results.Leave the tray in your mouth for the time suggested on the packaging. Most trays require application for 30 minutes three times a day for two weeks.Discontinue use if you experience serious sensitivity, though most will stop after the treatment. Talk to you dentist about whether or not you should continue use.Look for the ADA Seal of Acceptance to reduce the risk of getting an unsafe product., Whitening strips are similar to trays but are more flexible and come with the peroxide solution already on the product. Apply whitening strips to your teeth if you want a pre-filled treatment that is flexible and doesn’t necessarily touch your gums, which can be sensitive to peroxide.


Recognize that strips are just as safe as trays and provide better results than just brushing.Consider using strips if you’ve had gum sensitivity with trays. Simply place the strips below your gum line.
Buy whitening strips based on how much you want to whiten your teeth or mouth sensitivity. There are many different products available that offer results such as quicker and deeper whitening or strips for sensitive teeth.
Follow all of the packaging directions and discontinue use if you have serious sensitivity.
Check for the ADA Seal of Acceptance to help ensure you are getting a safe product., Some companies offer hydrogen peroxide whiteners that you can brush or paint on your teeth.These products come in different forms such as a pen or bottle of solution with brush.

Apply the product before bedtime for two weeks.Follow the package instructions and discontinue use if your teeth and/ or gums are very sensitive.

, Dentists offer professionally applied hydrogen peroxide treatments used in conjunction with light or laser. Consider this option if you have very stained teeth or if you prefer to whiten with peroxide under a doctor’s supervision.Be aware that dentists will use a hydrogen peroxide solution in the concentration of 25–40%, which is not available over-the-counter.Consider this option if you have sensitive gums — inform your dentist that you have sensitive teeth or gums. Your dentist will protect your gums with a rubber dam or gel before the procedure.Ask your dentist if this is the best option for you. It can be expensive and insurance may not cover the treatment.

It may be a good idea to invest in an electric toothbrush, as these are more effective than manual brushes at removing plaque and bacteria. In addition, most have timers that will help make sure you brush for the recommended two minutes.Consider keeping a travel toothbrush and tube of toothpaste with you when you are at work or school so that you can maintain your brushing regimen throughout the day.
Replace your toothbrush every three months and after every time you are sick.;
, After finishing with your teeth, run the bristles of your brush over your tongue as well. Or, if the back of your toothbrush has a rubberized tongue scraper, you can use this on your tongue instead. This practice will remove the odor-causing cells and bacteria from your tongue, just like brushing your teeth does for your pearly whites.You can also buy an inexpensive tool called a tongue scraper at most drug stores.

, Floss reaches between teeth where a toothbrush cannot, allowing you to remove food that would otherwise remain stuck there for bacteria to feed upon and grow on.

, Mouthwash can also reach areas of your mouth that a toothbrush can’t—on the insides of your cheeks and at the back of your throat, for example—allowing you to get rid of bacteria that otherwise would have remained in your mouth and contributed to bad breath. Use the amount specified on your bottle, and swish in your mouth for 30–60 seconds. Since alcohol is a drying agent, and a dry mouth creates an environment for bacteria, chose a non-alcoholic mouthwash.If a dental problem is to blame for your morning breath, then mouthwash will actually mask the problem rather than aid in curing it.It’s very important, therefore, that you see your dentist regularly to rule out any underlying cause of mouth odors.

, If brushing with regular toothpaste and flossing prove insufficient, you may want to try out dental products that are specifically designed for eliminating the germs and microbes that build up in your mouth overnight.

, Regular dental checkups are an important part of any good oral hygiene routine, and if you are experiencing trouble with morning breath, your dentist may be able to determine if it’s being caused by underlying problem such as a cavity, an infection in your mouth, or acid reflux., Food has a significant impact on your breath: As it is digested, the food that you eat is absorbed into your bloodstream and eventually exhaled by your lungs, which means the food odours come out of your mouth when you breathe. Foods like garlic, onions and spicy foods can lead to morning breath.Fruits and vegetables are an essential part of a healthy diet that helps to keep bad breath at bay.
Try chewing a sprig of parsley to freshen your breath. This herb contains chlorophyll, which helps remove odors from the breath., These modes of eating are no-no’s when it comes to friendly breath. When you don’t consume enough carbohydrates, your body shifts to breaking down fat at a high rate; this leads to the production of ketones and the phenomenon known as “ketone breath,” which is another way of saying “stinky”!, Eating stimulates saliva production, which in turn wets the mouth and creates an inhospitable environment for foul-smelling bacteria.Get an early start on the fight against morning breath and eat breakfast first thing in the a.m.

, Coffee has a very strong aroma that lingers in your mouth, and is difficult to brush off the very back of your tongue. For a quick pick-me-up with a less offensive smell, try tea in an herbal or green variety., Tobacco dries your mouth out and can raise the temperature of your mouth—both of these things contribute to bad breath by allowing bacteria to flourish.Smoking also increases the risk of gum decay, and a mouth with unhealthy gums is a mouth more prone to bad breath!

, Alcohol dries out the mucous membranes, so if you’re going to consume it, especially in the evening, you should try to drink one glass of water in between every alcoholic beverage—this way, you’re keeping your mouth moist., Bacteria flourish in dry, stagnate environments, so drinking lots of water and other fluids throughout the day helps to stave off odors in your mouth the next morning.


It is especially important to drink water right before going to bed, as the mouth dries out a lot over the course of the night when we’re sleeping and not consuming any food or fluids for many hours.
Aim for eight 8 oz. glasses of water a day.If you aren't able to drink that much, supplement with milk or 100% fruit juice as necessary.Owing to their high water content, fruits and vegetables offer another great source of hydration, in addition to water. Beyond this, the high fiber content of vegetables helps flush your body of toxins that may contribute to morning breath., Xylitol, the sweetener used in a lot of sugar-free gum products (and mints), can decrease bacteria that causes decay and bad breath.And flavored gum with Xylitol will not only help to eliminate bacteria that causes odor—it will also give your breath a scent of your choosing.


Chewing gum twenty minutes after you eat might help to stimulate saliva flow., Some medications, such as insulin, can cause bad breath on their own, while others, like antihistamines, cause your mouth to dry out overnight, and lead to morning breath that way.If you have concerns about any over-the-counter or prescription drugs you’re taking, talk to your doctor.

, Take rubbing alcohol put it in a cup, then mix it with water and drink it. Swish it around in your mouth like mouth rinse (you can use mouth rinse instead of, if preferred), then spit it out. Be sure to have a cup full of just water, then after you spit it out, swish the water in your mouth and spit it out. Repeat as necessary.

Brush your teeth regularly.,
Clean your tongue.,
Floss every day.,
Use mouthwash.",How to Get Rid of Bad Breath1," Two major sources of mouth odor are bacteria and decaying food particles. There are hundreds of nooks and crannies in the fertile landscape of your mouth where these offending bits of ""rot"" can get lodged.


Squeeze a pea-sized amount of toothpaste onto a soft bristled toothbrush, and hold the brush at a 45 degree angle to the gums. Brush your teeth on every surface in short, gentle strokes, being careful not to press too hard or irritate the gums. If done properly, brushing should take about three minutes.
Brush your teeth and rinse with mouth wash at least twice a day, and floss at least once a day.
Take care to brush all the areas of your mouth, including gums and tongue, and not just your teeth.;
, It is not enough to simply brush your teeth. Since your tongue has a lot of surface area and is covered with textured bumps and grooves, it harbors more bacteria than the rest of your mouth combined. Removing the bacteria on your tongue can go a long way in reducing your bad breath.You can buy Orabrush or other tongue brushes from stores, or simply use your regular soft bristled toothbrush.
Brush your tongue from back to front, rinsing the brush between strokes.
If you have a sensitive gag reflex, tongue-brushing may aggravate the problem. Read How to Suppress the Gag Reflex for some tips.

, Flossing your teeth is just as important to good oral health as brushing, and even more important for reducing bad breath. Make it as much of a mindless habit as brushing your teeth.


At first, your gums might bleed as you dislodge chunks of food that have ""stuck"" to your teeth and gum for who knows how long. But take a second to smell the floss after you pass it through your teeth, if you dare. You'll see (or smell) where the bad breath is coming from.

, Mouthwash helps to keep your mouth moist and helps to prevent bad breath.


Choose a mouth wash containing chlorine dioxide. Many of the bacteria that cause halitosis live on the back of the tongue, too far back to remove with regular brushing or scraping. Luckily, vigorous swishing with a chlorine dioxide-containing wash can neutralize those bacteria.Try rinsing with mouth wash before brushing, flossing, and brushing or scraping the tongue, and again when you're done. This will ensure that you neutralize any bacteria that remain after the process is complete."

Be aware of the risks of using hydrogen peroxide.,
Swish with a hydrogen peroxide mouthwash.,
Make a hydrogen peroxide and baking soda paste.,
Prevent staining if possible.",How to Whiten Teeth With Hydrogen Peroxide2," There is conflicting consensus about the use of hydrogen peroxide in non-commercial products to whiten teeth.Using non-tested mixtures with hydrogen peroxide on your teeth can cause oral sensitivity and other abnormalities on your gums.Talk to your dentist before you try whitening your teeth with hydrogen peroxide or any mixtures with it.Be aware that while these natural methods may be less expensive, they could cause damage that is expensive to correct.
Recognize that these solutions only clean surface stains and may not be as effective as commercially available hydrogen peroxide products.
Make sure to use the lowest concentration hydrogen peroxide possible to help protect your gums and oral cavity., There is some evidence that rinsing with a hydrogen peroxide and water mouthwash can be safe when used over a longer period of time. It may also whiten your teeth and help prevent stains.Swish a mixture in your mouth daily to help whiten your teeth and ward off bacteria.


Use 2–3.5% hydrogen peroxide, which you can get at your local pharmacy. Using anything higher in your mouth cavity can be dangerous.Pour 1 cup of the peroxide into a cup and mix it with 1 cup of distilled water.Swish around your mouth for 30 seconds to a minute.
Spit out the solution when you’re finished or if the solutions hurts. Rinse your mouth with water.
Avoid swallowing the mouthwash, which could cause health problems.Consider buying a commercially available mouthwash with hydrogen peroxide.

, Using a paste of hydrogen peroxide and baking soda can whiten your teeth and soothe sore gums.Brush with the paste daily or use it a couple of times a week like a mask.Make sure you’re using 2–3.5% hydrogen peroxide.
Put a couple of teaspoons of baking soda into a dish. Add a small amount of the peroxide and mix it with the baking soda. Keep adding a small amount of peroxide until you have a thick-ish paste.
Brush the paste onto your teeth in small, circular motions for two minutes.You can also apply it with your fingertips to stimulate your gums.Brush with the paste for a couple of minutes or leave it on your teeth for a few minutes for best results.Rinse the solution off of your teeth by swishing with water from the bathroom sink.
Rinse the paste off of your teeth., In addition to using your natural products, avoid anything that might stain your teeth if you can. Brushing or rinsing right after you consume them may help reduce staining.Things that can stain your teeth or make them more prone to staining are:


Coffee, tea, red wineWhite wine and clear sodas, which can make your teeth more prone to staining
Berries such as blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, and raspberries."
"
Purchase baking soda and hydrogen peroxide.,
Mix up a solution of baking soda and peroxide.,
Dip a toothbrush into the mixture.,
Brush your teeth with the paste.,
Rinse your mouth with water and spit.,
Brush your teeth normally.,
Repeat this only a few times a week.",How to Whiten Teeth with Natural Methods1," Both items can be found at local pharmacies and supermarkets.


Make sure that the peroxide you buy is a 3% solution. Anything stronger is not safe for use in your mouth. Read the label to confirm that the peroxide concentration is safe for use in the mouth. If you're unsure at all, consult the pharmacist.These two ingredients, while safe for use in the mouth, are potentially abrasive and can erode your tooth enamel over time. To prevent this, be sure to use this method no more than two times per week and brush very gently when you do.Since baking soda is an aggressive whitener, you will probably see results after your first few uses.;
, Add 1 teaspoon of each ingredient to a cup, then stir the mixture until it becomes a paste., Make sure you use a separate toothbrush from the one you normally use to brush your teeth.


Use a new toothbrush with soft bristles.

, Use gentle, circular motions. Brushing too hard can cause a receding gum line., Make sure you don't swallow this mixture.

, Using a separate toothbrush, brush with a fluoride toothpaste.

, This mixture is too harsh to use every day, as it can damage your teeth and gums. Don't use it more than two times a week."

Consider chewing gum.,
Keep your mouth moisturized.,
Stop smoking and chewing tobacco products.",How to Get Rid of Bad Breath2," Any gum will help with bad breath because the chewing action results in more saliva being produced. Some gums, however, have better bad-breath-fighting abilities than others:


Cinnamon flavoring seems to be especially effective in reducing bacteria counts in your mouth.Look for gum sweetened with xylitol (sugar only feeds the bacteria, causing more odor problems). Xylitol is a sugar substitute that actually works to prevent bacteria from replicating in the mouth., A dry mouth is a stinky mouth. That's why your breath is worse in the morning; your mouth produces less saliva as you sleep. Saliva is the enemy of bad breath because not only does it physically wash bacteria and food particles away, but it also has antiseptic and enzymes that kill bacteria.Chewing gum stimulates saliva production (in addition to covering up the odor with some kind of scent). Mints do not encourage saliva production.Drink water. Swish the water between your teeth from side to side. Water won't necessarily increase saliva production, but it'll wash out your mouth — and it is good for you. See How to Drink More Water Every Day.
Dry mouth can be caused by certain medications and medical conditions. Ask your doctor about switching medications, or addressing the underlying condition.

, In case you needed yet another reason to stop this dangerous habit, tobacco is notorious for causing bad breath.Tobacco addiction can be a hard habit to break, so visit this helpful wikiHow page for tips and advice.
In some cases, bad breath can be an early sign of oral cancer caused by smoking or chewing tobacco. It is vital that you stop smoking and see your doctor to be evaluated for this very serious condition.

Eliminate odorous foods.,
Eliminate or reduce coffee and alcohol.,
Eat some carbs.",How to Get Rid of Bad Breath3," Our bodies absorb the flavors and odors of the foods we eat, so particularly odorous cuisine can linger in your breath for hours after eating. Consider eliminating these foods from your diet, or at the least be sure to brush after eating.


Vegetables in the Allium family, like onion, garlic, leeks, and chives, have a notorious pungent aroma. Eating these foods and foods prepared with them like hummus or curry can leave your breath particularly aromatic. However, these foods also have many health benefits, so rather than eliminating them, try to limit them to times when you will be alone afterwards, like dinners at home.Recognize that even brushing won't be enough to really eliminate raw garlic smells and other pungent aromas. In fact, your body digests these foods, and the odor goes into the bloodstream and lungs and comes back out again as bad breath! If you eat a diet that is very high in these foods, reducing them (without completely eliminating them) may go a long way in improving your breath., The chemical compounds in these beverages alter the environment of your mouth, making it favorable for odor-causing bacteria to thrive.If you can't or don't want to quit drinking these beverages, be sure that after drinking them you rinse your mouth well with water or a mix of one part baking soda to eight parts water, and then brush your teeth well about 30 minutes later.Avoid brushing directly after drinking coffee or alcohol (or other acidic foods or drinks), as the acid in the drink can make your teeth vulnerable to abrasion from brushing., Did you know that if you're on a low-carb diet, you might have ""ketone breath""?Basically, as your body breaks down fats instead of carbs for energy, it creates ketones, some of which are released in your mouth. Unfortunately, ketones smell bad, and so will your breath. If you're on a strict carb-restricting diet, or any diet that forces you to burn fat instead of carbs, consider throwing healthy carb-rich snacks into the mix, like apples or bananas.


In addition, fruits with high vitamin C content will help you fight potentially harmful bacteria, which can be a cause of bad breath.
This will also happen to anyone who fasts, whether for religious reasons, or because they are anorexic. If you are anorexic, bad breath is only one of the reasons to stop starving yourself. Read How to Cope if You Want to Become Anorexic.

Talk to a doctor.,
Look for tonsil stones.,
Consider whether you have diabetic ketoacidosis.,
Consider other potential culprits.",How to Get Rid of Bad Breath4," If you've followed the above steps diligently and the bad breath persists, you may have a medical issue that needs to be treated.


Bad breath is a sign that something is not right in your body. If altering your hygiene practices and your diet do not improve your symptoms of bad breath, there is a good chance that there is some other imbalance, infection, or disease in your body that is causing it.

, These are lumps of calcified food, mucus, and bacteria that collect in the tonsils, and can be seen as white spots. They are often mistaken for a throat infection such as strep throat, although sometimes they are too small to be visible in a mirror.Tonsil stones are often harmless but cause a reeking bad breath. If you see a small white patch on the tonsil, try swabbing it gently with a cotton swab (be careful not to gag yourself, and don't press too hard). If it comes off on the swab and is a liquid or pus, you likely have a tonsil infection; however, if it doesn't come off or if it comes out as a solid chunk of white matter, it is likely a stone. Smell it and you'll know for sure.
You might also notice a metallic taste in your mouth or an obstructed feeling when swallowing.

, If you have type 2 diabetes, it may be causing your body to burn fat instead of glucose, which releases ketones, a chemical that results in bad breath.


Bad breath can be caused by metformin, a type 2 diabetes medication. If you take metformin, talk to your doctor about alternate treatment options., There are a vast array of illnesses that can cause halitosis, including the following:


Trimethylaminuria. If your body can't break down a chemical called trimethylamine, it will be released in your saliva, causing bad breath. It'll also be released in your sweat, so persistent body odor might be an accompanying symptom.
Infection: Several types of infections such as sinusitis and infections of the stomach can result in bad breath. It is important to have any unusual symptoms checked out by your doctor, including this one.Kidney disease or failure: In particular, a metallic or ammonia taste and scent to the breath can indicate severe problems with the kidneys. See your doctor if you have this symptom."

Try a tray or gel.,
Try whitening strips.,
Use paint ons.,
Try whitening devices.",How to Whiten Your Teeth Without Spending a Lot of Money1," Trays and gels designed to whiten teeth can be purchased over the counter at most supermarkets or drug stores. Such methods are fairly effective, 80% of users reporting results.


Read the instructions on the gel and tray you purchase so you know exactly how the product should be used. Some trays should be worn for a few hours a day while others are worn every night.Squeeze the recommended amount of peroxide gel onto the whitening tray. Insert the trays into your mouth. Place them into your mouth and gently close your mouth. The gel that is included with these rays is carbamide peroxide instead of hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide is the kind of gel used in a dental office and it is activated with a lamp. The carbamide peroxide does not require a lamp. If you feel extra gel running over your teeth, wipe it away. Remove the trays after the required amount of time has passed.While this method is effective for most people, some users report teeth sensitivity and sore gums as a result. If you have these side effects, cease use and talk to your dentist about whether the product is safe for you.;
, Whitening strips, which cost $20 to $30 per box, are a relatively cost effective way to whiten teeth and they can work even better if you have done a teeth whitening treatment in the past. Hydrogen peroxide is placed on a strip that's placed over the teeth and left on for a set amount of time to increase whiteness.


Read the instructions before using your whitening strips. The duration the strips are left on and how to apply varies from product to product. Some strips actually dissolve so they do not require removal but still it would be best to avoid swallowing your saliva during the procedure. Remember that any whitening substance has a certain amount of toxicity.Be careful when applying the strips. The hydrogen peroxide can burn hands and gums. Do not leave the strips on longer than recommended, as this can cause gum sensitivity and a burning sensation in the mouth.Check your gums in the mirror to see if there are any changes that usually look like white lines over the gum line. You can also breathe through your mouth or try drinking a bit of cold water to check your teeth sensitivity.
This method is best used if you're not trying to white teeth fast as it can take up to a few weeks to work., Paint ons are a popular, relatively inexpensive over-the-counter product that allow you to apply whitening gel directly to the teeth. However, this method is tricky as the chemicals that whiten teeth can leak onto gums and hands, causing burning and irritation, and the substance is also washed away by saliva. You must also order paint-ons via delivery, as the chemicals contained in them need to be delivered in a sealed package. This method also takes awhile to work. It might be a few months before you see results., Whitening devices are closed system mouth pieces that apply heat and light to teeth. This accelerates the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide, resulting in whiter teeth. While somewhat more expensive than other methods, whitening devices tend to work quicker. You can expect to see results in just a couple of days.Check with your dentist first to see if you can safely use one of these devices.

Consider using whitening toothpastes.,
Brush your teeth carefully.,
Floss your teeth once a day.,
Rinse your mouth with water after eating.",How to Whiten Your Teeth when You Have Braces1," Look for brands that are American Dental Association (ADA) approved, because they contain fluoride: a mineral essential for dental health.Whitening toothpastes contain special abrasives such as baking soda and peroxide to remove surface stains from teeth.
However, these products will only remove surface stains. They will not change the color of your enamel entirely.
Whitening toothpastes won't cause any problems for people with braces. The abrasives in the toothpaste won't cause any breakdown of cement or wear on your wires.;
, Start by putting a pea-sized amount of whitening toothpaste on your brush. You don't need a huge amount of toothpaste to clean your teeth! Dentists recommend a round-ended toothbrush with soft bristles.
Electric or sonic toothbrushes are preferable since they do a more thorough job; however, you may still need an interdental toothbrush to clean around your brackets.
Place your toothbrush at a 45 degree angle to the gums.
Gently brush in side to side strokes.
Be sure to brush the front, back, biting surfaces of all of your teeth.
Brushing your teeth should take at least two to three minutes.
If you have any stubborn areas around your brackets and wires, you can use a cone-shaped (interdental) toothbrush. Most orthodontists and dentists will be able to supply you with these. These brushes are small and are designed to fit under the wires of braces.
If your braces are shiny and all parts of the brackets are visible, you have done a good job.
Brush your teeth this way after each meal.

, This can be difficult when you have braces.Thread the floss under the wires of your braces. Then floss as you normally would, making sure you get deep into the spaces between your teeth.
It may take some time for you to get used to flossing with braces, but it's important that you continue to take this step.
Keeping your teeth flossed is essential for having white teeth. Food and other debris caught between your teeth can cause decay and discoloration. In addition, you can develop gingivitis or other gum disease.
If you have any difficulty getting the floss underneath your wires, you can use a floss threader. These are very inexpensive and are available at most pharmacies.

, When you eat food, your mouth temporarily becomes acidic. This softens the enamel on your teeth, so if you brush immediately after eating you can damage the enamel. Wait at least 30 minutes after eating to brush your teeth and, in the meantime, rinse with water to prevent stains. Whitening toothpastes can remove stains, but they won't prevent them.Coffee, tea, wine, and even blueberries can stain your teeth.
Smoking can also yellow your teeth.
Rather than avoiding healthy foods that might stain, you should rinse your mouth after eating.
Floss regularly to remove particles of foods from between your teeth and under your braces.

Get a bleach treatment at the dentist.,
Get a home bleaching kit.,
Use whitening strips.,
Use whitening toothpaste.,
Try a whitening mouthwash.",How to Whiten Your Teeth Fast1," Most dentists can perform an in-office bleaching treatment that will whiten your teeth in only one visit. Typically, the dentist will apply a gel to your teeth and use lights or a laser to activate the gel and bleach the enamel. If you need your teeth whitened instantly, make an appointment with your dentist for a bleaching treatment.These treatments will usually cost over $400, so if money is an issue this may not be the best option.;
, If an in-office bleaching treatment isn't a good option for you, you could get a home bleaching kit from a pharmacy or supermarket. These kits usually include a gel that contains hydrogen peroxide, a tooth-whitening chemical, and a mouth guard. Kits vary, but almost always involve placing the gel in the mouth guard and keeping it in your mouth for a specific amount of time.The whitening effect from these kits won't last as long as an in-office treatment, but they are a much cheaper option for a quick whitening.
Be sure to buy a product with the American Dental Association seal of acceptance to certify that the product has been tested and is safe.
Whitening kits sometimes lead to temporarily increased tooth sensitivity so make sure you consult your dentist before doing a home whitening., Another cheap option for whitening your teeth quickly is to use whitening strips. These products press a hydrogen peroxide gel against your teeth and protect it from removal. The strips are also sticky, so when you take them off they will remove any surface stains.One disadvantage of whitening strips is that they can't remove the stains in between teeth.
Usually you need to use whitening strips every day, sometimes multiple times.
Whitening strips work slower than bleaching methods, but you should see significant results within a week of the first application.

, Whitening toothpastes will only whiten your teeth a shade or two, and it will take longer (over two months) to see results. Using toothpaste alone won't give you dramatic results fast, but you can supplement faster treatments with toothpaste for good results., Mouthwashes that contain whiteners only remove the most basic surface stains from your teeth, but that also makes them perfect for quickly removing surface stains right as they form and giving your teeth a quick whitening boost.Swish the mouthwash around in your mouth for 30 to 60 seconds before spitting it out.
You can rinse your mouth out with water afterward, if desired, but doing so is not necessary.
A whitening mouthwash along with a whitening toothpaste can preserve the results of a previous whitening treatment for longer.

Buy activated charcoal.,
Dip a clean, wet toothbrush into the powdered charcoal.,
Rub your teeth in a circular motion.,
Spit out the charcoal.,
Rinse your mouth thoroughly with water.,
Brush your teeth normally.",How to Whiten Teeth with Natural Methods2," Activated charcoal is different from common barbecue charcoal in that it is specifically meant for use as a medicine. It works by absorbing chemicals, and as such is often used as a remedy for intestinal gas or acid.Since it works by absorbing toxins and chemicals, it also draws stains off your teeth.


You can find activated charcoal at some drug stores and natural health stores. It is also available for purchase online.
It is better to get activated charcoal in powder form rather than tablets. Not only will this give you more charcoal for the price, but it will be easier to rub on your teeth.
Since charcoal actively pulls off stains, you can see results within just a few uses. After a few weeks, the results should be easily noticeable.In addition, activated charcoal is a good pH neutralizer and reduces the acids found in the mouth, preventing cavities.

, Get a good coating of charcoal over the toothbrush — you'll need enough to cover all of your teeth.It may help to pour a small amount into a cup. This way you can avoid getting water in the main bottle of charcoal.
Make sure to use a separate toothbrush for brushing normally and brushing with charcoal. Use a new brush with soft bristles.

, Make sure to use gentle motions Keep this up for about two minutes., This may be a little difficult, since your mouth may be dry. Just try to accumulate as much saliva as you can to spit.


Don't be alarmed at the way your mouth looks. Before you rinse, it'll be all black from the charcoal. Don't worry — it will rinse off.

, You may need to do this a few times to completely wash away the charcoal. Be sure to swish the water around to remove any remaining charcoal in your mouth.It is considered safe to swallow this water with the charcoal in it once in a while or in small amounts; however, you shouldn't swallow any charcoal within an hour of taking oral medications. Since charcoal absorbs chemicals, it can absorb any medicine that is in your stomach and lessen its effectiveness., This will clean your mouth, freshen your breath, and remove any leftover charcoal on your teeth."

Gather some large strawberries.,
Mash the strawberries into a paste.,
Dip a new toothbrush into this mixture and apply it to your teeth.,
Rinse your mouth thoroughly.,
Brush your teeth normally.,
Repeat this treatment nightly.",How to Whiten Teeth with Natural Methods3," The vitamin C in strawberries can help break down plaque, and the malic acid in them can remove surface stains.You will need one to three large strawberries for this method.
If you're purchasing strawberries, look for berries with a uniform red color over the entire surface. Any white or green indicates that the berry is not ripe yet.
This is a slower method that will probably take a few weeks to show significant results.

, You can also add 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda. Baking soda will help this mixture whiten your teeth better. This is optional, however, and you can just use the strawberry paste if you want., Be sure to use a different toothbrush from the one you regularly brush your teeth with.


The point isn't to brush your teeth with this mixture, but just to apply it to the teeth.
Allow the mixture to sit on your teeth for five minutes., Have a glass of water handy and rinse the mixture off your teeth.

, You will probably have to brush more thoroughly than usual, since the strawberry remains may take some scrubbing to get off fully.If you don't floss regularly, you should do so after using this treatment. Strawberries have very small seeds that can get caught between your teeth.

, Remember that it may take a few weeks to see results."

Take a ripe banana.,
Peel the banana.,
Rub your teeth with the inside of the peel.,

Make sure the banana is yellow all over to ensure that it is ripe.This method will also take two to three weeks before you see noticeable results., You will only need a few small sections of the peel, so cut a few away after you peel the banana.

, Spend about two minutes rubbing the peels all over your teeth. After that, let the juices sit on your teeth for 15 minutes., Use your usual fluoride toothpaste and brush as you normally would. Be sure to remove any solid pieces of the banana if they've gotten stuck in your teeth.

, Don't use this treatment more often than that, or the acids from the banana could damage your teeth."
"
Use whitening toothpaste if you're on a tight budget.,
Look for a toothpaste with the American Dental Association (ADA) Seal of Approval.,
Look for an ingredient called blue covarine in your whitening toothpaste.,
Brush twice per day.",How to Whiten Teeth1," A tube of whitening toothpaste typically costs less than $10 at the drugstore or local supermarket.;
, ADA-approved whitening toothpastes use abrasive particles to polish teeth along with chemicals that bind to stains and remove them. Studies have proven that these toothpastes are no harder on your enamel than other toothpastes., Blue covarine binds to your teeth and creates an optical illusion that makes them appear less yellow.

, You should see some results within two to four weeks. For increased effectiveness, follow up with whitening mouthwash."

Mix the baking soda with water or lemon (they both work fine).,
Brush your teeth for one to two minutes.,
Rinse.,
Repeat every other day.",How to Whiten Teeth With Baking Soda1," In a small cup, mix half a teaspoon of baking soda with a few drops of either water or lemon. Be sure it is a paste, this way it will be easier to apply. For applying the paste to your teeth you can use a toothbrush or just your fingers. If it is a bad stain you want to remove, it's recommended you apply the paste directly to the stain and let it set for about two minutes. Just like with doing the dishes, some stains need a little extra scrubbing. This can also be the case with the stain on your teeth, use a toothbrush or your fingernails to scratch away that last bit of dirt.

For a better result you can dry the tooth surface with a gauze before applying the paste.
If you want an overall whitening effect, dip your toothbrush into the cup, to cover the bristles with the baking soda paste and start brushing.Alternatively, you can dip a wet toothbrush directly into some baking soda, and the powder will attach itself to the bristles; however, the taste of the baking soda will be very strong if you use this method.;
, Brush your teeth as you normally would, but really concentrate on getting the brush into all the cracks and crevices. Don't brush your teeth for any longer than two minutes, as baking soda is a mild abrasive and may begin to erode the enamel on your teeth. Ensure that no sideways destructive brushing occurs, purely up








Make sure you are using a soft toothbrush and low brushing forces.
Be aware that the taste of baking soda is not particularly pleasant!

, Spit out the baking soda and rinse your mouth with water or mouthwash. Give your toothbrush a thorough rinse as well.








, You should repeat the process of brushing your teeth with baking soda every other day for one or two weeks. You will notice a slight difference in the whiteness of your teeth after just a few days, and a substantial difference after a couple of weeks.








After a couple of weeks of brushing with baking soda every second day, you should cut back to doing it just once or twice a week. This is because the abrasive properties of the baking soda may damage the enamel on your teeth if used too frequently.Be aware that brushing your teeth with baking soda should not replace brushing your teeth with regular toothpaste. Regular brushing will help to fight cavities, plaque build-up, gum disease, and keep your breath fresh.Before starting the whitening with baking soda, check with your dentist if your teeth are healthy enough to do this. Some patients may have defects of enamel mineralization, which contraindicates this treatment due to an increased abrasive effect.

Use baking soda and hydrogen peroxide.,
Try apple cider vinegar.,
Experiment with peppermint leaf and coconut oil.",How to Whiten Your Teeth Without Spending a Lot of Money2," When combined with water, baking soda releases free radicals that break down molecules that cause stains and ultimately leads to a whiter smile. Making a simple toothpaste at home, using baking soda and hydrogen peroxide, can help whiten your teeth.Combine baking soda with hydrogen peroxide, using slightly less baking soda. Mix into a fine paste that is not too gritty.Brush the paste onto your teeth. Let it stand for about a minute and then rinse your mouth with water or mouthwash. If any of the paste remains on, brush your teeth again with an over the counter toothpaste.Do not use this paste more than two or three times a week as excessive use of baking soda can actually break down tooth enamel and cause soreness and tooth decay.Make sure to counter the abrasive effects of baking soda by using fluoride toothpaste once a day and leaving it on for two minutes before rinsing.

, Apple cider vinegar, especially when used with baking soda, can remove stains from teeth. You can make a whitening paste of two parts apple cider vinegar and one part baking soda. Use this paste to brush your teeth 2 to 3 times a week and you can expect to see results in a few weeks., Peppermint leaf and coconut oil, available for purchase at many health stores, can be used to whiten teeth. You can mash up a few leaves of peppermint into a few tablespoons of coconut oil and use this as a paste for your teeth 2 to 3 times a week. While consensus in the dentist community is still out, some of the chemicals found in coconut oil could potentially lighten teeth and also remove bacteria and prevent new stains from attaching on the tooth surface. Some people have found this method effective for them personally."

Change your diet.,
Practice good oral hygiene.,
See a dentist once a year.",How to Whiten Your Teeth Without Spending a Lot of Money3," Changing your eating and drinking habits can help maintain white teeth. Some foods are more likely to stain teeth and some can help maintain whiteness.


Most types of berries, like blueberries, blackberries, and cherries, can stain teeth with streaks of blue, purple, or red. Strawberries, however, are acidic enough that they can actually whiten by breaking down bacteria causing stains and can also be used with baking soda to brighten your teeth.Be careful when drinking wine and coffee. Both tend to stain teeth. If you really want a cup of coffee with breakfast or wine with dinner, sip water while drinking. Slosh the water around in your mouth to remove any excess coffee or wine to prevent staining. Adding milk or cream to coffee can also reduce staining.Seeds, nuts, and other harder grains that require chewing can help whiten teeth. This helps rub off plaque, which contributes to tooth decay and staining., Perhaps the best way to keep teeth white is simply through proper care. Brush, floss, and use mouth wash on a regular basis.


Most people brush their teeth in the morning and before bed. Sticking to a routine like this can help you maintain regular care, but you should also brush your teeth after eating anything high in sugar. The acids from sugary snacks require prompt removal.Replace your toothbrush every 3 to 4 months and make sure to floss daily. You should also use some kind of mouthwash, such as chlorhexidine mouthwash, to combat bad breath and add extra protection to your teeth., Regular dental checkups are important for a variety of reasons. In order to keep your teeth white and healthy, make sure to see a dentist at least once a year.

Consider using at-home whitening trays.,
Try paint-on whitening gels.,
Understand that at-home bleaching treatments may have some minor side effects.",How to Whiten Your Teeth when You Have Braces2," These are generally prepared for you by your dentist. This is the only at-home whitening treatment that carries the seal of approval from the ADA.Schedule an appointment with your dentist or orthodontist to discuss this procedure.
Your dentist will fit you with a custom-made tray that fits over your teeth and braces.
You will put a 10% carbamide peroxide solution in these trays.
Some treatment plans recommend using the trays twice a day while others recommend overnight use for one to two weeks.
The average cost of this treatment is $400.00. This is a very effective and more affordable option than in-office whitening. Plus, it is done from the comfort of your own home, and you should not experience any sensitivity or other major side effects.Simply slide the tray with the bleaching solution in it over your teeth and let it sit.
If you have Invisalign braces, this option is very easy. Just remove your Invisalign tray while you use the whitening tray.

, These products are available without a prescription at most pharmacies. These paint-on gels don't have the seal of approval from the ADA as effective teeth whitening products.These products require you to paint a bleaching gel onto your teeth that then hardens within 30 minutes.
To remove the gel, you simply brush your teeth.
These can be hard to apply around brackets and wires if you have braces.
These gels contain lower concentrations of hydrogen peroxide than in-office or dentist prepared options.
Paint-on bleaching gels don't have the same effectiveness as tray treatments. Results may vary from person to person.

, These range from gum irritation to increased tooth sensitivity.Bleaching agents in tooth whitening kits are chemicals that can irritate the soft tissues in your mouth. If the concentration percentage of carbamide or hydrogen peroxide is under 15%, then any discomfort should be minimal. If you are using whitening trays, irritation usually only occurs if your trays do not fit properly or you overfill the trays.
You may experience sores or swelling in your gums as a result of these treatments.
Another side effect of some whitening treatments is increased sensitivity. If you are using a whitening treatment that is under 10% carbamide or hydrogen peroxide and you experience sensitivity, then you should not proceed with treatment.
The increased sensitivity can be bothersome to patients with braces, especially around the time your braces are tightened.
Avoid using these products several days before and after your braces are tightened.
If you find the side effects hard to deal with, call your dentist or orthodontist for some solutions. They may be able to provide you with a new tray or ways to keep the whitening products off of your gums.

Consider in-office professional whitening treatments.,
Prepare to spend at least an hour to an hour and a half at each treatment.,
Understand that with this method you might have darker areas under your brackets.,
Be aware of the drawbacks of this procedure.",How to Whiten Your Teeth when You Have Braces3," These are the quickest and most effective treatments for whitening.During these treatments your dentist will put a protective gel on your gums and put an oral shield on your mouth to protect your gums and cheeks.
They will then apply a bleaching agent to your teeth around your braces. Typically, these are made of varying concentrations of strong hydrogen peroxide.
Most in-office treatments will use a special light to activate the bleaching solution, though other treatments are available using in-office bleaching trays.

, The bleaching solution needs to sit under the special light for at least an hour in most cases.Sometimes the treatments will cause discomfort in the short-term.
Bleaching gels can irritate gums and make teeth more sensitive.
You may need more than one treatment for optimal results, depending on your dietary habits and the shade you want.
These can be expensive and whitening treatments are not always covered by dental insurance.

, Since these treatments are done only once or twice, the bleaching solution may not soak into the enamel under your brackets.For optimal results, wait to use this method until after your braces are taken off.
However, if your brackets are on the back of your teeth this method is ideal as bleaching gel is only applied to the front of your teeth.
This method might be a good option for you if your teeth have darkened since you got braces.

, Since it might not bleach the area under your brackets, it may be best to try other alternatives first. In-office whitening can be very expensive.The average cost of in-office whitening procedures is $650.00.
Compared to other very effective at-home treatments, this procedure costs much more.
You will have to go to a dentist's office to get this treatment done. Not all dentists offer this service.
The gel can have a very unpleasant taste and the cheek guards can be uncomfortable, as you will have to keep your mouth open for an hour or so.
It may require more than one session to completely whiten your teeth. The best results come from changing the whitening gel every 40 minutes and repeating the session.

Scoop 1/2 to 1 Tbsp (7.5 to 15 ml) of into your mouth. You might need to let solid oil melt for a few seconds (coconut oil, for example, is often solid at room temperature).
Swish the oil around your mouth, letting it coat your teeth and gums. Avoid letting it come into contact with your throat.
Do not swallow the oil. If you have trouble swishing around the oil without getting the urge to swallow, you're probably using too much. Spit it out and start over with less.
After five to 20 minutes, spit the oil into a trash can. Avoid spitting it into the sink, since the oil could clog the drain.
Rinse your mouth with clean water a couple of times or brush your teeth with your standard toothpaste. Repeat daily.
You can also try brushing while holding the oil into your mouth — keep your lips closed and, using a soft bristle toothbrush, try brushing the external surface of your teeth. This can help your teeth look shiny and polished.

, Activated charcoal powder has chemical properties that remove stains and whiten teeth. Mix it in with your toothpaste to harness these properties.


Sprinkle the powder onto your toothpaste before brushing, then brush normally.
You can buy activated charcoal at health stores or on the internet.
Activated charcoal powder is not the same as the charcoal you would use in the barbeque. Do not substitute activated charcoal with barbeque charcoal.

, Most whitening products contain both of these ingredients, so you can use them together to whiten your teeth. Making your own toothpaste with these products is easy.Pour some baking soda into a cup. Then add peroxide and stir until you get a thick, pasty mixture.
Dip your toothbrush into this mixture and use it to gently brush your teeth. Allow it to sit on your teeth for a minute or two, then rinse.
Brush with regular toothpaste after this, with a separate toothbrush.
Since both ingredients can be corrosive to tooth enamel if used too much, use this treatment only twice a week to protect your teeth.
Do not swallow this mixture.

Make your teeth look whiter with blue undertones.,
Wear bronzer.,
Wear shiny jewelry.,
Wear an off-white shirt.",How to Whiten Your Teeth Fast3," Blue undertones fall under a cool color palette, while yellow tooth stains classify as warm colors. By placing blue undertones around your face, on on your lips in particular, you can offset any stains on your teeth and instantaneously make your teeth look whiter.When choosing lipstick, go for a red lipstick with blue undertones. Think cherry red, wine, and berry shades.
Avoid matte lipsticks and go for glossy products. Matte lipsticks can actually make your teeth look dingy by making your mouth look dry, but glosses and glossy lipsticks make your lips look moist, which also promotes the illusion of shiny teeth.
Be aware that the accessories you wear by your face can also make a difference. Opt for silver-toned jewelry over gold, and look for cool-toned gems and beads instead of warm-toned ones.

, Bronzer makes your face look darker, thereby accentuating the contrast between your skin tone and your teeth. As a result, your teeth will appear whiter than they might when your face is bare or dusted in blush.


For bronzer, a matte finish is the way to go. Matte bronzer makes your skin appear healthy and firm without giving it an oily look. Moreover, matte bronzer creates a contrast with glossy lips, accentuating your sparkling teeth.
Apply the bronzer in the shape of the number ""3."" Brush it over your temples, the hollow of your cheeks, and over your chin.

, Shiny jewelry, especially silver-colored, accentuates the white shades in your teeth while covering up the yellow ones. This can mask any stains or imperfections in your teeth.Focus on placing these accessories around your face, like with earrings and necklaces.
Avoid gold-colored jewelry, however — this will accentuate yellow sections of your teeth.

, Wearing white will accentuate the darker sections of your teeth. Instead, wear a darker or cream-colored shirt. This will accentuate the white sections of your teeth and help cover up any imperfections."

Alternatively, you can rinse out your mouth with a cap full of hydrogen peroxide (which also helps to kill bacteria and freshen breath) or dip your toothbrush in the hydrogen peroxide and use it to brush your teeth.

, After a meal, you should munch on a couple of strawberries for dessert. Strawberries contain folic acid, which actually helps to clean and exfoliate teeth, making them appear whiter.You can also mash a strawberry and mix it with some baking soda for a natural whitening toothpaste.

Always read the instructions fully and be aware of any side effects before using any whitening strip or whitening product.Misuse can cause damage to your teeth, gums, and health.
Instructions can vary between brands, always fully read the instructions before use.;
, Before you apply your whitening strips, you will need to brush your teeth. If you apply them without brushing your teeth, you may inadvertently trap food or bacteria under the strip and the surface of your teeth will not be in contact with the whitening substance, which can lead to an unappealing looking result. Brushing your teeth can also help remove any plaque that may block the whitening effects of the strip on the enamel.Never brush your teeth right before you apply the whitening strips.
Brush your teeth at least a half hour before you apply the strips to let saliva clean away any excess fluoride and get the enamel ready for whitening.

, Before you apply the strips to your teeth, take a moment to make sure you are applying the right strip to the correct location. Some whitening strips will have special strips for top and bottom teeth and all will have a certain side of the strip that must contact the teeth. Take a moment and learn which strip goes where.Apply the side with any gel to your teeth. This gel is the whitening agent and must contact the entire surface of your teeth except the gums to work properly.
The smooth side of the strip will have no whitening gel and is there only to help you apply the strip.

, Having determined which way your strips need to be applied, place them over your teeth, with the gel coated side making contact with the surface of your teeth. Make sure the strip covers your teeth entirely, working out any bumps or uneven areas.Try drying the surface of your teeth with a napkin or towel before applying the strips. This will help increase the whitening effect. You can also use a cheek retractor to spread your lips and control the flow of saliva during the whitening treatment. Less moisture in your mouth will give you a better result.
A tooth brush can be used to smooth the strip out if needed.
Completely covering your teeth without any irregular areas will help evenly whiten your teeth.
Avoid allowing the strips to reach up and cover your gums, as this can cause irritation or even slight burns that will make your gums look white.

, Once you have applied the strips you will need to patiently wait as they work on your teeth. Most brands will have a slightly different amount of time they recommend you wear the strips, so carefully read your instructions. Avoid touching the strips to allow them to work uninterpreted.In general, you will wait for around 30 minutes, before removing the strips.
In order to keep your teeth dry during the whitening procedure you can try lying in bed on our back, keeping your mouth a little bit open. This will reduce the quantity of saliva, which may interfere in the whitening process. Try breathing through your mouth for a while as well to help dry out your mouth.

, After the amount of time that your specific strips have instructed you to wear them has passed, you will need to remove the strips. Peel them away from your teeth and throw them away when it is time to remove them.Don't leave them on longer than specified as this can cause irritation and sensitivity in the teeth and gums.
Leaving the strips on for a longer amount of time won't increase the whitening results.
Clean your mouth after using the strips. Try rinsing with water or brushing your teeth to ensure that all the whitening gel is out of your mouth. Try not to swallow too much of the gel as it can be toxic.

, Whitening strips work over time, utilizing slow exposure to the chemicals responsible for the whitening process. You will need repeated use of the strips before you see any noticeable difference in how white your teeth are. Keep using the strips for the recommended amount of time to get the most out of them.Use twice daily for 30 minutes at a time.
A minimum of 14 days is the recommended length of use.
Sustained results can be expected at around four months, but they also work well after a professional teeth whitening in a dental office.

, Some whitening strips contain hydrogen peroxide, which is poisonous if swallowed. Try to avoid swallowing any of the gel or saliva that is produced when wearing the whitening strips.Don't worry if you accidentally swallow a small amount of gel. Small amounts will likely not produce any symptoms.

, The chemicals in whitening strips can cause some sensitivity in the teeth and gums to occur. This may be the result of the gel coming into contact with the gums directly, applying the strips for too long or too much, or a sensitivity to the gel.Take a break from whitening strips if you notice your teeth or gums becoming sensitive.
Ask your dentist if you are able to use whitening strips safely.

, Not all tooth whitening strips use the same chemicals and processes to achieve results. Some may actually exacerbate preexisting dental issues or cause new ones to arise. Ask your dentist if whitening strips and other whitening products are a good fit for you., Keeping up with regular brushing of your teeth is a great way to help keep them white and healthy. Make sure you are brushing your teeth properly and often enough to get the full benefit. Remember to take your time when brushing and reach every tooth completely.


Brush twice daily, for around two minutes each time.
Don't brush too hard as this can remove enamel or damage the gums. Also try to avoid using a toothbrush that is too hard (always use soft) and do not use a new toothbrush immediately after the treatment or after drinking a soda as the enamel is weakened and very sensitive to abrasion.
You can try using whitening toothpaste in addition to your whitening strips but make sure you are also using toothpaste with over 1100 ppm of fluoride, which may help with any sensitivity. Try using strips and whitening toothpaste for two weeks to start, but alternate the whitening toothpaste with the fluoride toothpaste (best used before bed).

, Using mouthwash in addition to regular brushing and flossing can help improve the health of your mouth and teeth. Mouthwash is used to kill bacteria as well as wash away any loose debris knocked loose by brushing or flossing.


Try to swish your mouthwash for at least 30 seconds before spitting it out.
If the mouthwash is too strong, you can water it down, or dilute it with water from the start using a 50:50 dilution.
You may want to use whitening mouthwashes in addition to your whitening strips.

, Although flossing can be difficult and takes time, it is an important step in maintaining the health of your teeth and gums. Flossing works by removing built up plaque and tartar that brushing might have missed. Keep in mind that it is better to prevent any future problems than spend loads of money to repair the damage.


Start with a long piece of floss, about arms length.
Wrap the floss around your middle fingers, spanning the gap between your hands.
Work the floss down in between teeth on both sides of each gum papilla (the gum triangle which is located between teeth).
Pull the floss to one side of the tooth, forming a “c” shape.
Move the floss up and down the length of the tooth to clean it.

, Some foods can cause your teeth to become stained, resulting in a yellowish coloration, which is more likely to produce results much faster than normal if you are using strips. Other foods can cause your enamel to wear down, which can lead to tooth damage and pain. Try to avoid some of the following foods and drinks as you work to whiten your teeth:


Coffee, tea and wine can cause your teeth to become stained.
Sugary foods or highly acidic drinks, like orange juice or soda, can wear the enamel away on your teeth. This can cause cavities or other dental issues.

, Making regular appointments with your dentist is a great way to keep your teeth healthy. Your dentist can help you to catch small dental issues before they become serious, as well as maintain regular care practices.


Your dentist may be able to provide whitening services for you and help you to track their progress.

Chew the bark off of one end of the twig.,
Chew the center until it becomes soft and forms bristles.,
Soak the tip in water.,
Hold the miswak twig with one thumb underneath.,
Brush your teeth with the bristled end.,
Cut off old bristles every few days.,
Store the twig in a dry place.",How to Use Miswak1," Using a miswak twig to brush your teeth is easy and fun! If you have a ""fresh"" twig — one that hasn't been used yet — start by chewing off of the bark at either end of the twig. Stop when you've exposed an inch or so of the wood underneath. Spit out and discard the bark.


A slight ""spicy"" or ""burning"" taste can result from chewing on a miswak twig. Though some find this slightly unpleasant, it's not harmful.;
, When you've exposed the wood underneath the bark at the tip of your twig, start chewing on it. You're aiming to soften this wood so that it breaks up into thin, fibrous bristles. This should only take a minute or two — you'll know you're ready when the tip of the wood is soft enough that it can be fanned out slightly like a small brush.


Ideally, you want a very slight resistance to the bristles (similar to what you'd get from a soft-bristled toothbrush).

, Traditionally, miswak is performed without toothpaste or other oral health products, though you may use these if you wish. To perform miswak in the traditional style, simply dip the bristly end of the twig in water (like you would before adding toothpaste to a toothbrush).


Alternatively, many traditional miswak practitioners use rosewater in place of ordinary water for its pleasant scent.

, You're now ready to brush. You can grip the stick however feels comfortable to you — keep in mind that you'll be brushing with the tip of the stick, rather than the side, as with a toothbrush. Traditionally, miswak sticks are held by putting the thumb of the right hand just below and behind the bristly tip, putting the little finger under the back of the stick, and wrapping the remaining three fingers over the top., Now, start brushing! Press the bristly tip of the stick into your teeth and move it gently up and down to scrub their front surfaces. Move slowly around your mouth, taking your time and hitting every surface of your teeth with the bristles. Don't press extra-hard — your goal is to gently scrub the teeth, not scrape or gouge them. To someone who's used to using a toothbrush, miswak may feel somewhat awkward at first, but after a few attempts it quickly becomes intuitive.


Don't forget to clean the backs of your teeth just as you would with a toothbrush!

, Keep your miswak stick fresh by using a knife (or your bare hands) to cut or break off the old bristles when they become worn. Depending on how often you clean your teeth and the type of stick you're using, your bristles' average lifespan will vary. In general, you'll want to cut your stick's bristles away every time they get the appearance of an old, ratty broom. Usually, this will mean cutting them every few days.There are some notable exceptions to this rule. Some types of processed, commercially-sold miswak sticks have lifespans of over six months due to the preservatives added to them.

, When you're done cleaning your teeth, quickly clean your miswak of any debris and give it a brief rinse. Keep the miswak in a clean but open space, not in a bag or container, which can encourage mold growth by trapping moisture next to the stick. Keep miswak sticks away from any sinks or toilets to avoid the accidental transfer of bacteria due to splashes.

Use whitening toothpaste.,
Use whitening strips.,
Use a whitening pen.,
Use a whitening tray.",How to Whiten Teeth in an Hour2," Although whitening toothpastes will not dramatically improve the whiteness of your teeth in the space of an hour (they are more effective over time), they can still help to remove stains and make teeth look brighter.


Whitening toothpastes contain abrasive particles which polish the teeth and wear away stains (without damaging tooth enamel). They also contain chemicals (such as blue covarine) which bind to the surface of the teeth, making them appear whiter.To use whitening toothpaste, place a pea-sized amount on your toothbrush, and brush using small circular motions, holding the toothpaste at a 45 degree angle from the gums.

, Whitening strips are coated with peroxide gel, which bleaches the teeth and helps them to look whiter. You will typically use two sets of strips per day, for 30 minutes each -- giving you a whiter smile in only 60 minutes!


Whitening strips can be purchased over-the-counter at the drugstore or supermarket. Avoid purchasing a brand that contains the ingredient ""chlorine dioxide"" as this can damage the enamel on teeth.
To use the strips, remove them from the package and apply one strip to your top teeth and one to your bottom teeth. Leave them on for 30 minutes. Some strips will dissolve by themselves after use, while others will need to be removed.
For best results, continue to use the whitening strips twice a day over a two week period.

, Like the whitening strips, whitening pens use a gel containing peroxide in order to bleach the teeth.


To use, remove the cap and twist the pen to release the gel. Stand in front of a mirror and smile widely, then use the pen to ""paint"" the gel onto your teeth.
Keep your mouth open for about 30 seconds to allow the gel to dry. Try not to eat or drink anything for 45 minutes following the treatment.
For best results, repeat this process three times a day for up to a month.

, A whitening tray is another great option for quickly whitening your teeth. They can be purchased over-the-counter or can be custom-made by your dentist.


To use a whitening tray, squirt a small amount of the concentrated peroxide gel provided into the tray (which looks like a plastic retainer) and fit it over your teeth.
Depending on the type of tray, you may only need to wear it for half an hour, or you may have to leave it on overnight. Although a single use will leave your teeth looking brighter, if you want significantly whiter teeth you will need to use the tray multiple times.
Although custom-made trays from your dentist can be pricey (usually costing around $300), they are specially molded for your teeth, making the treatment more effective than store-bought ""one size fits all"" trays.

Get a professional cleaning.,
Get laser treatment.",How to Whiten Teeth in an Hour3," Book an appointment for a professional cleaning with your dentist, every six months.


This will help to keep your teeth in tip-top condition, preventing tooth decay and gum disease in addition to making your teeth nice and white.
Your dentist can also perform an in-office bleaching treatment which is similar to the whitening trays you use at home, except the bleaching solution is much stronger.

, Another very effective option is to get a laser whitening treatment. These can be expensive, but are quick and will produce very effective results.


A bleaching gel is applied to your teeth, then a rubber shield is placed over your gums. A laser or white light is then directed towards your teeth, activating the bleaching gel.
Depending on how white you want your teeth, you may need to return for several sessions. However, each session only lasts about 30 minutes.

Use hydrogen peroxide as a quick rinse before you brush.,
Use baking soda as a before toothpaste brushing, it works great as a stain remover if you were originally a coffee or tea drinker or a smoker.,
Use lemon or lime juice with your toothpaste or baking soda.,
Eat a lot of strawberries.,
Mix things up.",How to Whiten Teeth6," Using an enamel protecting toothpaste afterward is a good idea due to the abrasiveness of hydrogen peroxide, but after a month you will see amazing whitening results. Make sure you use a soft bristle toothbrush and gentle, light pressure.

, Remember to rinse with water after brushing with it and to brush gently as rough brushing can harm gums and rip the enamel off your teeth.

, It is recommended to use an enamel-protecting toothpaste afterward due to lemon or lime juice's acidity.

, Increase your intake of strawberries or make a paste by mashing up two or three strawberries and applying the paste to your teeth. Make sure you remember to floss afterwards, as strawberries contain many tiny seeds that can get lodged between your teeth.

, Try mixing baking soda and hydrogen peroxide, or baking soda and lemon juice.

, Also, brush your teeth after you drink a beverage that can darken your teeth. Maintain your whitened teeth by using whitening toothpaste and whitening mouthwash.


If you have consumed something acidic, wait about 30 minutes before brushing. Acidity can weaken your enamel, and brushing before it has a chance to harden can actually cause more damage.

, A professional cleaning will help you to keep your teeth white as well as preventing many common dental problems.

Use miswak as part of wudu.,
Understand the importance of oral purification.,
Study miswak usage in the Hadiths.,
Alternatively, use an ordinary toothbrush for wudu.",How to Use Miswak2," For some, miswak is just a way to keep the teeth clean. However, for observant Muslims, miswak often plays a more serious role in religious worship. Muslims are required to wash themselves in a ritual form of purification (wudu) before certain acts of worship (most commonly, the daily prayers known as salat). Though cleaning the teeth isn't explicitly required as part of a Muslim's wudu ritual, it is considered optional and is often strongly encouraged. Thus, for serious Muslims, the use of a stick for performing miswak prior to prayer is something that can occur multiple times per day.

, Achieving a state of purity before prayer is very important for Muslims. The Quran explicitly states that ""loves those who purify themselves.""Cleaning oneself shows devotion to God, observance of Islamic scriptures, and emulation of Muhammad the prophet, who himself practiced miswak and recommended that others do so.


In addition, Miswak usage before prayer is often seen to make the prayer more worthy or desirable in God's eyes. According to one Hadith, ""The preference for prayer in which a 'siwak' (miswak) is used to prayer in which it is not used is seventy times."", Though use of miswak for oral purity is not discussed at great length in the Quran, it is referenced many times in the Hadiths (the scriptural accounts of the practices and sayings of the prophet Muhammad). Below are just a few quotes from the Hadiths where miswak usage is mentioned as being especially desirable or praiseworthy in the eyes of Muhammad:""The Messenger of Allah said, 'Had I not thought it difficult for my nation, I would have commanded them to use the miswak before every Salat.'""
""The first thing that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah bless him and grant him peace) did on entering the house, was Miswak.”
“Ablution is part of faith and using a Miswak is part of ablution.”
“There is a cure for every illness in Miswak besides death.”

, If you are an observant Muslim but you live somewhere it is difficult to get a genuine miswak stick or you have misgivings about using a twig to clean your teeth, don't worry! Many Muslims achieve the same level of oral purity by using an ordinary toothbrush (with or without toothpaste) as they would with traditional miswak practices. The most important aspect of wudu is to sincerely intend to purify yourself in the eyes of God and to make the best possible effort to do so. The precise tool you use to clean your teeth isn't nearly as important as the simple fact that you're cleaning your teeth as a sign of devotion to God.


Islamic practices even make special allowances for people who don't have any oral cleaning tools available to them before they pray. In this case, it's generally recommended to do the best job you can with your index finger."

Find a tree from which miswak twigs are traditionally taken.,
Cut a small, sturdy twig from the tree.,
Wash thoroughly before using.,
Avoid poisonous or harmful trees.,
When in doubt, buy or order a miswak twig.",How to Use Miswak3," One of the great things about using miswak to clean your teeth is that the stick you use can potentially be free! Though most majority-Muslim countries will have cheap, easily-available miswak sticks for sale, it's also possible to make your own miswak stick just as traditional practitioners would have. To start, find a suitable tree. Traditionally, miswak sticks are taken from Salvadora Persica trees (also called ""toothbrush"" or ""arak"" trees). Below are just a few suitable alternatives that are native to the Mediterranean, Middle East, and Levant where miswak is most frequently practiced:Olive trees
Palm trees
Walnut trees

, Next, simply take a small twig or stick from the tree's branches or any exposed roots using a knife or your bare hands. Your stick doesn't need to be especially big — traditionally, miswak sticks are about as long as your hand is wide. Be careful not to take more than you need or to hurt the tree more than necessary — this is wasteful and disrespectful.

, When you take any sort of plant product out of the wild, you run the risk of exposing yourself to harmful chemicals or germs, no matter how clean the plant looks. To reduce the chance of this risk happening to you, be sure to thoroughly wash any miswak sticks you cut directly from the tree before using them. Use disinfectant soap or an equivalent antibacterial substance to clean the stick and rinse with water to remove the soap. Repeat several times for cleanliness.


Be sure to store your miswak sticks in a clean, dry place before using them. Since you've just washed them, they will be wet and can potentially pick up dirt or dust if you're not careful.

, Never take your miswak stick from a tree you know to be poisonous or otherwise harmful. No matter how much you clean a miswak stick from a poisonous tree, using the stick will expose you to chemicals that can make you sick. You will also want to avoid any trees that you know to have been treated with a pesticide or any other potentially harmful chemicals. Below are just a few types of trees from which you should not take miswak sticks (this list is incomplete, so consult a botanical resource if you're ever unsure whether a certain tree is unsafe).Pomegranate trees
Bamboo trees
Chambelle trees
Raihaan trees
Myrtle trees

, Though people in certain parts of the world have been taking their own miswak sticks from nature for thousands of years, for the inexperienced, this can be an intimidating task. If you're ever worried about whether or not a certain miswak stick is safe to use, consider buying yours from a reputable vendor. Miswak sticks are available both online and from specialty brick-and-mortar stores (most commonly in Muslim countries and communities) — in developed countries with modern health regulations, these commercially-sold sticks will be sanitary and reliably safe to use.

, Choose the tip that works best for you. The options are the classic jet tip, the toothbrush tip, the plaque seeker tip, the orthodontic tip and the pik pocket tip.

, There should be a way to lock the tip in place, either by twisting it or pressing a button on the handle. Consult the product manual if necessary.

, Start with your back teeth. Hold the tip away from the teeth and gums rather than touching them directly.


Lean over the sink so you don’t splash water on your countertop.
You can either start with the outside of the teeth or the inside, but make sure you spray every interdental area where a regular brush can't reach.

, There will be either an on-button or a dial that adjusts the water pressure. Start with the low pressure setting. Increase the water pressure as you go along to a rate that is comfortable.

, Go tooth by tooth to ensure you get everything. Aim for the top of the tooth, the baseline of the gum and the space between each tooth.

Hold the Waterpik for about two second over each tooth.
The entire process should last for about two minutes but take your time to rinse if you feel like it.

, You should pour out any remaining water. Leaving stale water in the reservoir can cause bacteria to grow., Each Waterpik unit comes with an instruction manual. If you lose it, you can download another copy on the Waterpik website., The Waterpik is an elaborate device with several parts that can break and require replacement. The Waterpik website includes a section where tips, accessories and replacement parts are available for sale separate from the main units.You should replace the tips every three to six months.

, A common issue is that the device sometimes loses water pressure. You can attempt to fix this issue before having to replace the device.Ensure the black valve in the reservoir tank is inserted with the dome side facing up and the four-pronged side facing down.
Fill the reservoir at least half full to support pressure. Confirm that the unit is plugged into a fully functioning electrical outlet.
Regularly clean the unit by adding a few teaspoons of vinegar or chlorhexidine mouthwash to a full reservoir of warm water. Then drain the reservoir through the handle into the sink until it is empty.

, A reservoir leak is another common issue. You can attempt to fix this issue before having to replace the device.


Remove the black rubber valve from the water tank by pushing it out from the bottom. Run the valve under warm water and massage with your fingers.
Return the valve to the tank. Ensure the dome side is facing up and the four-prong side is showing on the bottom.

Begin brushing with a desensitizing toothpaste.,
Brush and floss before whitening.,
Line your tray with a small amount of gel.,
Wear your trays for the designated amount of time.,
Remove your trays.,
Avoid food and drinks that will stain your teeth.,
Visit your dentist.,
Determine whether you want your dentist to perform the whitening.,
Be careful when using whitening gel at home.,
Follow up with your dentist.",How to Use Prescription Gel to Whiten Teeth," At least a few weeks prior to beginning your whitening regimen, switch out your regular toothpaste for a tube of desensitizing toothpaste. Brands like Sensodyne, for example, work to make teeth less sensitive to outside factors, like extreme cold, and even the chemicals present in whitening gels.Since whitening gels can soften your enamel and cause sensitivity, this is a way to be proactive and keep your teeth from being too sensitive during and after your whitening process.
Fluoride gels are also a good treatment for enamel protection and remineralization, but make sure you do not swallow the gel.;
, Each time you are ready to use your whitening gel, make sure you thoroughly brush and floss your teeth before you begin. This will clean the surface of your teeth and allow the gel to penetrate the enamel more effectively without leaving any stains.Maintain good brushing and flossing habits, even after you finish your whitening process. This will keep your enamel strong and your teeth healthy, as well as help maintain your new, brighter smile.

, You want to make sure not to overfill the trays. A thin line of gel along the inside of the tray should be enough. Some dentists recommend about 10 – 12 drops of gel, but make sure you follow any specific instructions included in your kit, or given to you by your dentist.If you took home a kit from your dentist’s office, you may have found trays inside that need to be molded to your teeth. Follow the instructions with the kit, or have your dentist help you with these molds.

, Generally, you will need to wear your whitening trays for about two to three hours each day during the whitening process. Choose a time of day when you won’t need to eat or drink for a few hours. Some dentists may advise you to wear the tray overnight. Check the specific instructions in your whitening kit, or ask your dentist if you aren’t sure.If you experience gum irritation during the time you’re wearing the trays, it may be due to excess gel, or a tray that hasn’t been properly fitted. See your dentist if you experience this, as damaging your gums may lead to serious problems of your teeth.
Most whitening processes take about 14 days to reach the results you’re looking for. Skipping days during the process could result in not achieving the best results possible.

, After you’ve worn your trays for the allotted amount of time, carefully remove them. Use your finger or a clean washcloth to wipe off any remaining gel or residue on your teeth after removing your trays, and rinse your mouth with water.Be careful not to accidentally swallow too much of the gel, as it contains chemicals that can be harmful in large amounts. Promptly rinse your mouth and wipe excess gel from your teeth after removing your trays.

, During and after the whitening process, stay away from things that can stain your teeth. Coffee, cigarettes, and wine are examples of things to avoid in order to keep your teeth as white as possible for as long as possible.You may also want to avoid acidic food and drinks while whitening, as well. The acid in things like citrus fruits and soda pop could potentially weaken your enamel, which may, in turn, cause the whitening process to be less effective. You may also be especially sensitive to acidic food and drinks while whitening, which can make consuming them a bit uncomfortable.

, Before taking on a whitening routine, you will need to see your dentist to make sure you are a good candidate for whitening or bleaching. There are some dental health factors that might cause whitening processes to be less effective, or even harmful for you. For example, if you have any crowns, veneers, or otherwise fabricated material on your teeth, whitening and bleaching agents will not work effectively on these areas.Certain gels that contain chlorine dioxide can actually be very harmful to the enamel on your teeth. A dentist will be able to guide you to whitening products that are safe and effective.Further, there are clinical cases of internal discoloration or enamel mineralization defects you may not be aware of, so whitening may not work or worse, it can even harm your tooth structure. Your dentist will be able to tell you if this is the case.

, In many cases, your dentist can do the whitening for you in their office. Or, they can provide you with a kit to take home and use on your own. If you feel like you will need some assistance, or don’t feel comfortable doing it without your dentist’s supervision and advice, it might be best to schedule a few sessions in your dentist’s office.The whitening products provided by your dentist may have the ADA Seal of Acceptance, which means the American Dental Association has deemed them to be safe and effective. Talk to your dentist if you want to specifically use a product that has the ADA Seal of Acceptance., Since whitening gel is made up of many different chemicals, it’s important that you practice caution and safety when using these products at home. Follow all instructions given to you by your dental professional. Do not use the gel more than instructed, or for longer amounts of time, as doing so could cause serious damage to your teeth.Opt for an in-office whitening session if you are not happy with the result, but never exceed the length of whitening treatment at home.
Gum irritation from whitening gels is similar to a chemical burn, as the irritation is a result of the peroxide in the bleach. This is temporary and should subside after you complete the whitening process. You could also be experiencing irritation from an ill-fitting tray. See your dentist for help with this., If you experience any issues with the whitening product while using it at home, be sure to contact your dentist right away. They may be able to adjust the gel to a lower concentration of the bleaching chemicals, which are likely the cause for tooth and gum pain following a whitening session. They can also correct or re-make a tray that doesn’t fit properly, which could be causing discomfort.

Apply toothpaste to the bristles.,
Brush your teeth for two minutes.,
Rinse after brushing.,
Use the tongue cleaner.",How to Use a Silicone Toothbrush1," Typically, you can use any type of toothpaste when you brush your teeth. For certain electric silicone toothbrushes, you should avoid using toothpaste that contains bleach. Before use, apply the toothpaste to the toothbrush like you would on any toothbrush.Read the instructions before use to see if your brush works best with a certain kind of toothpaste.;
, Brush your teeth in the same way you would use any other toothbrush. Use wide, circular motions for two minutes as you brush your teeth and gums. Some electric toothbrushes will vibrate when it is time to switch to a new section of your teeth.If it is an electric toothbrush, you will have to turn it on and off by pressing the power button to begin.

, Rinse your mouth out when you are done brushing. Then, rinse your toothbrush under warm water. Rinse your toothbrush with water after every use. , Check your toothbrush to see if it comes with a tongue cleaner on the back of the head. Many silicone brushes will come with a tongue cleaner, or have a separate cleaner that came with the kit. If you do have one, gently scrub your tongue with the cleaner for about a minute.You should repeat all of these steps twice a day in order to maintain healthy dental hygiene.

Use a soft-bristled toothbrush.,
Brush with a gentle circular motion.,
Use fluoride toothpaste.,
Use desensitizing toothpaste.,
Make sure you to brush and floss every day.",How to Treat Sensitive Teeth1," It might seem like using a medium or hard-bristled brush will get your teeth cleaner, but using such an abrasive brush can wear away the enamel on your teeth. When the enamel gets worn off, the teeth feel sensitive because the dentin has been exposed. The dentin contains nerves in small dentinal tubules that are instantly stimulated by external factors, such as hot and cold liquids.Switch to a soft-bristled toothbrush, which will get your teeth just as clean without causing further sensitivity issues or hurt your gums. Use gentle pressure and remember that power is nothing compared to good technique.


Avoid toothbrushes with tough plastic bristles - those aren't necessary for getting your teeth clean.;
, The way you brush your teeth matters as much as the toothbrush you use. If you tend to press hard and use a back-and-forth sawing motion, you're probably wearing away the enamel and causing gum recession by exposing the root of your teeth. This creates a double negative effect by affecting the look of your teeth and causing increased sensitivity. Instead, use a gentle circular motion to brush your teeth. Always brush with vertical strokes which should start from the gum line covering the entire tooth surface. Run the brush over the gums above your teeth and this way you will prevent gum recession and also stimulate the blood circulation in your gums for better protection against bacteria. Take your time and spend about three minutes going over all of your teeth in one brushing session.


If you have trouble applying the right amount of pressure and using a circular motion while brushing your teeth, it might be helpful to get an electric toothbrush. The bristles spin in a circular motion and all you have to do is hold the head of the brush next to your tooth. Your teeth will get perfectly clean with little effort on your part.

, Fluoride strengthens tooth enamel and leads to reduced sensitivity and pain.Start using a fluoride toothpaste so that your teeth get coated in fluoride every day. In addition, you can use a mouthwash with fluoride.


Your dentist may recommend doing a fluoride treatment using a more concentrated amount of fluoride applied directly to the places where your enamel has worn away. However, this should only be applied locally and you must take care not to ingest the fluoride.
Note that some organizations advise against the use of fluoride, stating that it has negative effects on human and environmental health. Conduct your own research and talk with your dentist about the right choice for you.

, Desensitizing toothpaste is formulated to coat the teeth and shield them from the substances that cause them to feel sensitive and painful.They basically seal any porous enamel or exposed dentinal tubules. After using it for several weeks, you should notice a decrease in sensitivity. If this doesn't work, then you should ask your dentist about other treatments for sensitivity.

, Sensitivity can also be the result of gingivitis, which results from the buildup of plaque and tartar on the teeth. Gingivitis causes the gums to bleed, swell, change their color, and sometimes cover various portions of your teeth and feel sensitive. Gingivitis can be avoided by practicing good dental hygiene, including brushing your teeth twice a day using the proper technique and flossing once a day.


Be sure to get regular dental cleanings as well, since it's not possible to remove plaque that accumulates with flossing and brushing alone.

Replace the brush head.",How to Use a Silicone Toothbrush2," Clean the electric toothbrush by rinsing it under warm water and running your fingers through the bristles. Do not use any cleaning products that contain alcohol, petrol, or acetone, as it may damage the silicone.Some brands will come with its own cleaning spray that you can purchase.
Do not run the toothbrush through the dishwasher to disinfect/clean unless the instructions say it is dishwasher-safe.

, The way you charge your toothbrush depends on the type of brush you have. Many silicone electric toothbrushes will come with a USB charging port so that you can charge it in a variety of situations. With some, you will have to plug it into an outlet.

Clean the toothbrush.",How to Use a Silicone Toothbrush3," There are a few different types of silicone toothbrushes you can use for a baby. You can find a regular handheld toothbrush, an electric toothbrush, or a “finger brush” that slides over the index finger. You may want to start out with a finger toothbrush and then move on to a regular toothbrush as your baby grows and more teeth come in.You should start brushing a baby’s teeth when the first tooth comes in.

, Babies and very small children can play with the toothbrush, but brushing is most effective when performed by an adult. Begin by massaging the gums with the silicone toothbrush.

Eat less sugar and starch.,
Limit acidic foods and drinks.,
Use a straw.,
Drink more milk and water.",How to Treat Sensitive Teeth2," The bacteria that causes cavities to form feeds on carbohydrates - sugar and starch. If your diet is high in sugar and starch, cutting back can help reduce your cavities and go a long way toward treating your sensitivity.


Bread, pasta, snack foods, and beans are starchy foods that could lead to cavities.
Ice cream, candy, baked goods, and other sugary foods should also be avoided.
When you do eat sugar and starch, make sure to drink water and brush your teeth afterward so that the substances don't remain on your teeth. Also, don't rinse your mouth right away if you are using a fluoride toothpaste. Leave it on for two minutes before rinsing.

, Acidic foods can contribute to wearing away the enamel on your teeth. Cutting back on acidic foods and drinks will help keep your enamel intact. Consider limiting or eliminating the following:


Wine
Citrus
Tea
Coffee
Tomatoes
Carbonated drinks

, When you do drink liquids that are highly acidic, like tomato juice, orange juice or tea, use a straw so that the beverage deposits at the back of your mouth instead of swishing around your teeth. That way, you'll be able to enjoy your favorite beverages without worrying that they're wearing away your enamel.

, After indulging in an acidic food or beverage, rinse out your mouth with water and drink a bit of milk. The water rinses away the acid and the milk, which is basic, changes the chemistry in your mouth to prevent your enamel from eroding.


You can also swish for one minute with an alkaline solution made out of a spoon of baking soda dissolved into a glass of water.

Consider having a sealant applied.,
Ask your dentist if you grind your teeth.,
See if you need a root canal.",How to Treat Sensitive Teeth3," The most common way to treat teeth with spots bare of enamel is the application of a sealant, which coats the tooth and serves the same purpose as the enamel. Once the sealant is applied, the sensitivity and pain will go away and the occlusal surface of your back teeth will be easier to brush, making bacteria go away faster. Talk with your dentist about whether this treatment option is a good choice for you.

, Many people grind their teeth in their sleep without even knowing it. If you grind your teeth you could be wearing away your enamel bit by bit. A dentist will be able to tell whether you grind at night by examining your teeth with a magnifying tool. If you do grind your teeth, it is likely that your dentist will recommend that you wear a mouthguard at night to prevent further damage from occurring.

, If your teeth are extremely sensitive as the result of a deep cavity, you might be in need of a root canal to fix the problem. A root canal fixes issues with the tooth's soft core, which can become very sensitive. Your dentist will assess whether getting a root canal is necessary.

Floss daily.,
Use mouthwash.,
Clean your tongue.,
Don’t smoke.",How to Take Good Care of Your Teeth1," Brushing is important and it shouldn’t be skipped or rushed. When you brush, do so for at least two minutes. This will give you time to thoroughly clean each tooth.Replace your toothbrush when it gets worn out. After about three months the bristles get permanently bent and they don’t clean as well — in fact they get also sharpened and will hurt your gums making bleeding easier. A new toothbrush will keep your teeth clean and sparkling.
If you use an electric toothbrush the head should also be replaced every three months.
Children should start brushing as soon as they get their baby teeth. Baby teeth are also vulnerable to cavities and the brushing will teach them how to take care of their teeth for when they get their permanent teeth.You can also bring a toothbrush to work or school and give your teeth a quick brush after lunch. This will prevent bits of food from sticking in your teeth and giving you bad breath. But don’t brush immediately after eating. Wait a half hour first. The food in your mouth produces acid which softens your enamel making the enamel vulnerable to being worn away.;
, Fluoride is important because it increases the strength of the enamel on your teeth. This helps protect your teeth from decay. Look for a toothpaste brand that has 1,350–1,500 ppm of fluoride in it. Children can brush with it, but an adult should supervise them to make sure they don’t swallow it. Only use a pea-sized amount of toothpaste for children between two and six years old.Children’s toothpaste doesn’t always contain enough fluoride to be effective in preventing tooth decay. It needs to have at least 1,000 ppm of fluoride.
Put a small blob of toothpaste on the brush and then brush it over all surfaces of your teeth. Spit it out afterwards instead of swallowing it.

, Flossing removes food particles, plaque, and bacteria that build up between your teeth. When you start flossing, your gums may bleed a little bit, but after few days that should stop.It is best to floss before you brush. The floss will then scrape the sides of your teeth clean, making it easier for the fluoride to get in and strengthen the enamel there.
Use about 18 inches (46 cm) of floss. Wrap it around one finger on each hand, and then gently slide it between your teeth. Curve the floss around one of the teeth and move the floss up and down along the tooth. Don’t press too hard when you go below the gum line. It shouldn’t hurt; however, you can expect a slight bleeding which is absolutely normal. This also relieves the micro inflammation created in the papilla
Some people find floss to be awkward. If this is the case for you, try using an interdental cleaner. This is a small brush, pick, or stick that lets you get between your teeth without dealing with long strings of floss., Mouthwash can kill bacteria and keep bad breath under control. You can buy different commercially prepared solutions or make a salt solution at home. Swish the mouthwash around in your mouth for at least two minutes.Dissolve about a half a teaspoon of table salt into a cup of water. The salt will dissolve faster if the water is slightly warm and you stir vigorously.
Check the ingredients on commercially prepared mouthwashes. Some have antibacterial properties or fluoride in them. The flavors can be strong, so choose one you can tolerate.
Even if you use mouthwash, you still need to brush.
You can also put mouthwash in a water pick and use that to more thoroughly clean between your teeth.

, You can do this with a tongue scraper. Many toothbrushes have tongue scrapers on the back of them. If you need to, you can even brush your tongue with the bristles of your toothbrush. Cleaning your tongue will remove food particles and bacteria that are on the surface of your tongue.Scrape lightly from back to front along your tongue, being careful not to gag yourself.
Rinse your mouth out when you are done. Don’t swallow the bacteria that you have scraped off of your tongue.

, Smoking increases your risks of mouth cancers, gum disease, and it gives you bad breath and stains your teeth. It can also decrease saliva flow, which allows bacteria to thrive in your mouth. If you already smoke, quitting will improve your oral hygiene tremendously. If you need help quitting there are many resources available including:Hotlines, counseling services, and support groups
Medical assistance such as medication, nicotine replacement therapy, and residential treatments

Limit your sugar consumption.,
Reduce the amount of alcohol you drink.,
Eat snacks that will clean your teeth.,
Eat fewer sticky foods.,
Clean your teeth with sugar-free gum.",How to Take Good Care of Your Teeth2," As sugar is broken down by your saliva and the bacteria in your mouth, it generates acids. These acids dissolve the enamel on your teeth. You can reduce the damage this causes by eating less sugar. Foods to avoid include:Desserts like candy, pastries, ice cream, cakes, chocolate or sticky sweets
Sugary breakfast cereals
Sugary tea, coffee, and sodas

, Alcohol increases your vulnerability to tooth decay by degrading your enamel. If you do drink, do so in moderation. The recommended daily limits are:One drink per day for women and one to two for men.
A drink is a beer, a glass of wine, or a shot of hard alcohol.

, Fresh, crunchy fruits and vegetables are healthy ways to satisfy your hunger. While they can’t substitute for brushing, they will help scrape your teeth clean and massage your gums as you eat them. Foods to try include:


Apples
Broccoli
Carrots
Celery
Peppers
Lettuce
Cucumbers

, Sticky foods leave sugary residues that cling to your teeth, are difficult to remove from between your teeth, and will make your teeth prone to decay. If you eat these foods, do so in moderation:Raisins, prunes, dried mangos, dried pineapple, and other dried fruits, especially if they are coated in sugar.
Taffy, gummy bears, and gooey candy bars
Granola bars

, Chewing gum causes you to produce saliva. The saliva will break down and remove food particles that may be left in your teeth.You can purchase sugar-free gum at your local grocery store, convenience store, or pharmacy.
If you don’t have sugar-free gum, don’t chew sugary gum instead. It will coat your teeth with sugar and raise your risk of getting cavities.

Watch for signs of problems with your teeth.,
Let the dental hygienist clean your teeth.,
Ask your dentist about fluoride varnish and fissure sealants.,
Locate dental care that you can afford.",How to Take Good Care of Your Teeth3," Many problems start out as minor discomfort and then progress to conditions that are more serious and more difficult to address. Schedule a dentist appointment if you have:Pain or swelling in your jaw
Loose permanent teeth
Gums that hurt, bleed, or are swollen when you brush or floss
Gums that are pulling away from your teeth
Teeth that are sensitive to hot or cold foods
Constant bad breath
Pain or discomfort when you bite

, Make an appointment to go for a check-up and cleaning every six months. Take your child to the dentist as soon as he or she begins getting baby teeth. Your dentist or hygienist will:Show you the best way to brush and floss
Scrape away the hard plaques that form in places that are hard to thoroughly clean
Examine your gums for gum disease
Look for cavities

, These are treatments that protect your teeth over the long-term. They can be given to both children and adults.Fluoride varnish can be given every half year. During this treatment, fluoride is put on the teeth to strengthen the enamel.
A fissure sealant is applied about once per decade. It is a thin composite covering that creates a smooth and slippery surface which protects the crevices of your teeth from bacteria and food that could get trapped there.

, Many people have to pay out of pocket for dental care. Ways to find affordable options include:Calling or searching the websites of the US Health Resources and Services Administration, your county or state health department, or community health center. These places may be able to point you towards local clinics that charge on a sliding-scale based on income.
Check with dental hygiene and dentistry schools near you to see if they offer low-cost treatments or free clinic days as a way of drawing patients to give their students experience. It should always be supervised by dentist or hygienist. Look online at the American Dental Association or the American Dental Hygienists Association.

Floss.,
Make a paste.,
Concoct a scrub.,
Rinse with hydrogen peroxide.,
Raid the refrigerator.,
Buy a whitening toothpaste.,
Get in a routine.",How to Remove Yellow Between the Teeth1," You might accumulate yellow matter between your teeth if you are not flossing regularly. Flossing can instantly remove a lot of the build-up between your teeth that causes discoloration. Make sure to make flossing part of your daily routine.


Use a good amount of floss — it should be about 18 inches in length. Grip the floss tightly in each hand, and move the floss up and down between each tooth. Curve the floss into a ""C"" shape, so that you are covering the entire surface. Use fresh sections of floss as you move around your mouth.Do at least six up and down movements on each tooth surface. Be gentle — don't damage your gums.;
, Whitening your teeth does not have to be expensive. You can use several items that you probably already have in your own home. One effective method is to make a paste out of baking soda and lemon juice. Baking soda can help balance the Ph levels in your mouth, and lemon juice is a natural sort of bleach.You will need a few teaspoons of baking soda and a small amount of lemon juice. Mix them together until you reach a paste-like consistency (partly liquid). Then use a toothbrush to spread the paste onto all of your teeth. Leave on for one minute, then rinse your mouth thoroughly with water.
Be careful not to brush your teeth too hard with this paste, as you may produce some abrasion on enamel.

, Baking soda can also be used to create a scrub by combining it with salt and strawberries. The salt will act as sort of an exfoliant to scrub gunk from your teeth. Strawberries contain a lot of vitamin C, which is good for breaking down plaque.To make this scrub, you'll need two to three strawberries. Mash them together, and add a sprinkle of salt and a dime-sized amount of baking soda. Spread the scrub onto your teeth using a toothbrush. Let sit for five minutes, then rinse.

, Hydrogen peroxide is common in most homes, and is often used for minor scrapes or cuts. It can also be used as an inexpensive method for whitening your teeth. Simply swish a very small amount in your mouth for a few seconds, then spit it out. Then brush your teeth as you normally would., In addition to strawberries and lemons, there are other foods that can help remove the yellow from between your teeth. Try using an orange peel. Before you go to bed, rub the peel of an orange across your teeth for a few minutes. The vitamin C will help to break down the yellow. You should see results within a few weeks.

, If you don't want to make your own whitening products, there are many that you can buy. Look for a toothpaste that specifically promotes its whitening agents. Also, look for a brand that has been approved by the American Dental Association. Your local drugstore will have many options for you. , Some of these methods will give you instantly whiter teeth. But for best results, you should get in the habit of taking steps to remove yellow from between your teeth. If you take regular steps to promote the health of your teeth, you will see more significant and longer lasting results.

Look for the right ingredients.,
Make your own toothpaste.,
Add whitening to your toothpaste.,
Try oil pulling.",How to Reverse Tooth Decay Naturally1," If you want to help reverse tooth decay naturally, try looking for natural toothpastes. These toothpastes contain a combination of all natural ingredients, which accomplish the same thing as fluoride. They work by reducing the bacteria in your mouth with xylitol, a sugar alcohol that reduces how much plaque-forming bacteria attaches to your teeth. These pastes also contain calcium and phosphate, which are lost during demineralization of your teeth.Common commercial natural brands include:


Redmond Earthpaste
Dr. Collins Restore
Apagard Premio
Tom’s of Maine Cavity Protection;
, If you don’t want to buy your toothpaste, you can make your own out of natural ingredients. Start with four tablespoons of calcium (carbonate) powder, which come as tablets or powder. Mix it with two tablespoons of baking soda, ½ to 1 packet of stevia or Xylitol powder, and one teaspoon sea salt. To the dry mixture, add enough coconut oil to make it into a paste. Next, add a few drops of peppermint oil to help freshen your mouth. Mix the ingredients completely.


To use this mixture, just dip your toothbrush into the paste and brush like normal.
You can make this in bulk and seal it in a jar to use over time. To avoid any possible spoiling of the ingredients, keep it in your refrigerator. , You don’t have to do without whitening if you make your own toothpaste. To make your toothpaste whitening, add two teaspoons of 3% hydrogen peroxide to the toothpaste recipe. When you use it, there will likely be foaming and perhaps some tingling, but this is how it should feel in your mouth.


Hydrogen peroxide works as a bleaching agent and is also antibacterial.

Don’t use anything stronger than a 3 % solution. The stronger concentrations may burn and irritate your mouth and gums., In addition to normal brushing, oil pulling can help reduce bacteria in your mouth. First thing in the morning, take one tablespoon of coconut oil or sesame oil into your mouth. With your mouth closed and without swallowing, swish the oil around in your mouth, getting between your teeth and around your mouth. Continue for 15 to 20 minutes. After you’re done, brush your teeth normally, then drink two to three glasses of water.


Do not gargle the oil.
Make sure you do this before you have eaten or drank anything in the morning.
This method has not been tested to see if shorter periods of time are beneficial, so try to perform it for the full length of time. "

Choose a dentist you trust.,
Use bleaching gel.,
Use abrasive strips.,
Try the laser method.,
Visit a dental spa.,
Know the risks.",How to Remove Yellow Between the Teeth2," Picking a dentist is just as important as choosing any other health care professional. Ask your friends or co-workers if they have a dentist that they like. You can also get a lot of information from reading online reviews. When you visit your dentist, make sure he is willing to thoroughly answer all of your questions about the procedure you are interested in., Your dentist is likely to recommend a whitening procedure that utilizes a bleaching agent, which will most likely be in the form of a gel. Your dentist will make an impression of your teeth, and use that to make a mold that will fit your mouth. The gel will be placed into the tray, and you will keep the gel-filled tray in your mouth for a specific amount of time.This is a painless procedure, but you should still feel free to ask your dentist any questions or concerns you may have.

, Your dentist likely has these finishing strips, which are thin strips of sandpaper-like material that can be slid between your teeth and used to remove yellowing. The dentist will slowly pull the strip back and forth and up and down to polish your tooth. Because these strips are abrasive, it's best to let your dentist do this and not try it at home or you risk damaging your enamel.

Don't drink colored drinks (like wine, coffee, cola) after this treatment.

, Laser whitening is one of the newest methods that dentists use. It involves painting your teeth with a peroxide solution and then exposing the teeth to very strong light. This procedure is fast and painless; however, it can be pricey and your insurance might not cover the procedure. Make sure to ask your provider before scheduling a laser whitening., Many people have a fear of going to the dentist. If that sounds familiar, try going to a dental spa. These dentist's offices will be able to whiten your teeth, but they also include spa-like services. Think soft blankets and maybe even a little shoulder massage. This option is great for those nervous about any sort of oral procedure., Before you undertake any whitening process, make sure to discuss the possible side effects with your dentists. Although teeth whitening is mainly considered safe, there could be potential problems. The most common include increased sensitivity of the teeth and gums.Your dentist will tailor the whitening procedure according to your case. The way you bite or smile are some of the most important features of a proper whitening treatment.

Practice good oral hygiene.,
Avoid certain foods.,
Pay attention to medications.,
Stop smoking.,
Use products regularly.",How to Remove Yellow Between the Teeth3," The best way to prevent yellowing teeth is to take good care of your mouth. Ask your dentist for tips about proper oral care. Make sure that you know the proper way to brush and floss.Brushing is the single most important thing you can do for your teeth. Make sure to brush at least twice a day, using a soft bristled brush and a toothpaste that contains fluoride. Make sure to get a new brush at least every two months.
Flossing is another great way to keep your mouth healthy and prevent yellow stains. You should floss every day, making sure to pay attention to the area between each tooth. Be gentle, but firm.

, The items you eat and drink can impact the color of your teeth. If you are worried about discoloration, limit your intake of coffee, dark sodas, and red wine. You will also want to avoid potatoes — the starch can raise the acid levels in your mouth and erode your enamel.Whenever you can, try using a straw when drinking coffee or dark colored drinks, as it will reduce the interaction between tooth enamel and pigments.

, If you notice a dramatic yellowing of your teeth, ask your doctor if medication might be the cause. Certain antibiotics are known to cause discoloration. Other culprits are certain antihistamines and some blood-pressure regulators., Tobacco stains your teeth. There are many reasons to stop smoking, and oral health is one of them. If you smoke, ask your doctor about safe methods of quitting., In addition to whitening toothpastes, you can also use whitening strips and mouth rinses to keep yellow teeth from developing. Ask your dentist to recommend a product that he trusts. Get in the habit of using whitening products regularly, and you can prevent yellow from forming between your teeth. "

Avoid all sugar and processed starches.,
Eat citrus fruits in moderation.,
Chew your food properly.,
Take a mineral supplement.,
Get more vitamin D. Another way to increase the health of your teeth is to increase your daily vitamin D intake.",How to Reverse Tooth Decay Naturally2," Sugars create food for bacteria, causing plaque, which then causes tooth decay. Processed starches work in the same way as sugars. Avoid all processed and pre-packaged foods, including snacks, cakes, breads, chips, cookies, and crackers. These foods contain a lot of added sugar. Always look at the label, even if you think something is healthy. If sugar, cane syrup, high fructose corn syrup, or another artificial sweetener is listed in the top five ingredients, do not eat or drink it.


Sugar is a major component in sodas and other sweetened drinks as well, so avoid those when you can. Plus, the extra, artificial ingredients in sodas break down tooth enamel.If you need a sweet fix, try honey, which is antibacterial, and the natural, calorie free sweetener stevia, which is an herb 200 times sweeter than sugar., Citrus fruits have a high acid content, which leads to tooth decay. Because of this factor, you should moderate the amount of citrus fruits you eat, especially lemons, which have an extremely high acid content. If you do eat them, rinse your mouth out with water to help decrease the amount of acid that is left to sit on your teeth.


Although fruit has natural sugars in it, the sugar is fructose, which is not as popular with bacteria. This means you can enjoy apples, pears, peaches, or any other non-citrus fruit without harming your teeth. , One way to help prevent tooth decay is with saliva production. To help increase your saliva production, chew every bite completely because chewing stimulates the production of saliva.


Sour foods also tend to increase saliva production, but sour foods are also acidic, so avoid them if you can. , One way to remineralize your teeth is to put more minerals back into your body. To help with that, pick a daily multivitamin that has minerals in it, especially calcium and magnesium.


Most people need at least 1,000 mg of calcium. Men older than 71 and women older than 51 should get 1,200 mg every day, so look for this amount if you fall within those age ranges.
Also make sure the supplement has 300 to 400 mg of magnesium., Adults and children should get about 600 IU of vitamin D every day. Adults over 70 years should get 800 IU every day. Vitamin D and calcium work together to strengthen bones and teeth, so you can buy a supplement that includes both. There are multiple ways to get more vitamin D naturally, however, which include:


Spending about 10 to 15 minutes every third day in the afternoon sun without sunscreen on your arms, legs, and back
Eating foods high in vitamin D, such as fish, soy milk, coconut milk, cow’s milk, eggs, and yogurt"

Brush your teeth.,
Leave the toothpaste in your mouth.,
Floss daily.",How to Reverse Tooth Decay Naturally3," You should brush your teeth at least twice a day to help fight off tooth decay. When you brush, make sure you get the inner and outer surfaces of your teeth, the teeth in the back of your mouth, the chewing surfaces of your teeth, and your tongue. Scrub long enough that all the plaque comes off your teeth, but don’t push so hard that you hurt your gums and teeth.


Also use a soft toothbrush. Teeth can also be damaged by using toothbrushes with bristles that are too hard., After you brush your teeth, spit out the toothpaste like normal. Instead of washing your mouth out with water, leave the toothpaste remnants of your toothpaste in your mouth without rinsing. This gives the minerals in your toothpaste some extra time to be absorbed by your teeth., Along with brushing, you should also floss every day. Start with around 18 inches (46 cm) of floss. Take the end of the floss and wrap most of it around the finger of one hand, leaving the rest around one finger of the other hand. Hold a section of floss between your thumb and your forefinger, gently guiding the floss between all your teeth using a gently back and forth motion and curving along the bottom of each tooth.


Once the floss is between the teeth, use a gently up-and-down motion to get the sides of each tooth.
After you do one tooth, unwind more floss and move on to the next tooth."
"
Learn about teeth.,
Understand how bacteria affect your teeth.,
Know the causes of decay.",How to Reverse Tooth Decay Naturally4," Your teeth are a type of tissue made up of minerals with a hard exterior called enamel. The enamel covers dentin, which is softer than enamel. These layers protect the pulp, which is made up of nerves and blood supply to your teeth. This enamel can be damaged by bacteria in a process called demineralization, leading to cavities, tooth decay, and other dental problems., Tooth decay is caused by bacteria, which is prevalent on your teeth, gums, tongue, throat, and inside your cheeks.This is perfectly normal and helpful to overall health, but it can also damage the your teeth and mouth if it becomes overgrown.


These bacteria form colonies, called dental plaques, which feed on sugars you consume. The bacteria then produce acids that cause your teeth to decay., Your teeth will naturally demineralize if exposed to too much acid, the leading cause of the issue, as well as from bacteria. Major causes of decay include:The formation of bacteria plaques
Abundant ingestion of overly acidic beverages, such as flavored waters with added citric acid, sports drinks, and sodas
Eating a lot of citrus fruit, such as lemons, oranges, grapefruit, and limes
GastroEsophageal Reflux Disease (GERD), in which stomach acid can come back into your mouth
Use of drugs such as methamphetamines
Improper or inadequate dental hygiene
Smoking
Systemic inflammation or infections

Use dental floss.,
Use a toothpick.,
Brush your teeth.",How to Remove Popcorn from Your Teeth1," The American Dental Association recommends using dental floss at least once every day, but especially when you know there is debris stuck between your teeth.This may also include soft debris, which can include bread. The starch will turn into sugar and bacteria will grow.


Try to work the floss as close to the gum as possible between the teeth where the popcorn is stuck.Form the floss into a c-shape around one tooth, then around the next tooth.Work the floss back and forth or up and down keeping contact with your tooth to loosen the popcorn.
Rinse your mouth out with water.;
, Take great care to avoid stabbing or otherwise injuring your gums.


Insert the flat end of a toothpick between your teeth at the site where the popcorn is lodged.Gently work the popcorn out from between your teeth, moving it either upward or forward.If this doesn't work or if the toothpick doesn't have a flat end, use a pointed end and gently work the toothpick along your gums. Use extreme caution to avoid injuring your gums or the poking the inside of your mouth.If your teeth are too crooked, then you may need to look for a strong fabric wire that can act like a floss.

, Brushing is highly effective at removing dental debris like popcorn.Wet the bristles of your toothbrush.
Toothpaste is optional for removing debris, but the foaming action may help. Squeeze out a pea-sized blob of toothpaste onto the bristles of your toothbrush.
Hold the toothbrush at a 45 degree angle to your gum.Try to work the popcorn out from between your teeth using the bristles in various strokes and movements. Once you remove the popcorn, rinse the bristles of your toothbrush to avoid reintroducing the debris into your mouth.

Look for a fluoride rinse.,
Look at the added benefits of the rinse.,
Do not overuse a fluoride rinse.,
Do not use a fluoride rinse immediately after brushing.,
Open the fluoride rinse packaging.,
Pour about 3 tablespoons, or about 20ml, of the rinse into a clean glass.,
Swish the fluoride rinse around in your mouth for 30 seconds.,
Spit the rinse out into a sink.,
Research fluoride’s benefits.,
Check if your drinking water is fluoridated.,
Talk to your dentist.,
Practice good oral hygiene.,
Get fluoride from other sources.",How to Use a Fluoride Rinse," There is a difference between a fluoride rinse and a mouthwash. Some mouthwashes do contain fluoride, but you should purchase a fluoride rinse over a general mouthwash if you want the fluoride benefits.Ask your dentist if there is a fluoride rinse that they recommend. They may also have fluoride rinse samples at their office.
Fluoride rinses and mouthwashes with fluoride added are found in most retailers that sell health and beauty products.
Fluoride rinses are available both as over the counter products and as prescriptions.
Check to make sure that the fluoride rinse that you’ve selected has been certified by a regulatory agency like the American Dental Association.;
, There are dozens of different fluoride rinses available over the counter and many will offer different added benefits to set them apart from others.


Some fluoride rinses are whitening. If you have sensitive teeth, you may want to avoid a whitening rinse since it can alter the sensitivity of your teeth.
If you avoid alcohol for personal, religious, or health reasons, you can select a rinse that is alcohol free. These rinses, like mouthwashes without alcohol, don’t have the same “sting” that many people experience with traditional rinses that have alcohol in them.
Rinses do come available in different flavors, though the majority are minty.
Some rinses will be breath freshening, much like a mouthwash. Look for odor neutralizers in the active ingredients list of the rinse. Often, the label will say that the rinse will freshen your breath if it contains odor neutralizers.Some common odor neutralizers are chlorine dioxide and zinc., It is possible to have too much fluoride. If you have fluoridated water, use fluoridated toothpaste, and use a fluoridated rinse you may be using too much fluoride. Too much fluoride can pose health risks.


Dental fluorosis is a condition caused by an excess of fluoride. It does not compromise your oral health or your tooth function, and is generally mild.
Dental fluorosis usually appears as small whitish flecks on your teeth. In more severe cases, it can turn your teeth brown and damage your enamel.Fluoride is not harmful in small amounts, but if you or your child swallows a significant amount of a fluoride rinse you should contact your local poison control or hospital.

, If you brush your teeth with a fluoridated toothpaste, you should not use a fluoride rinse immediately after. This will make the fluoridated toothpaste less effective by diluting it.After you brush your teeth, do not rinse with water or use a fluoride rinse. These will both remove the concentrated fluoride that the toothpaste has just applied to your teeth. You don't need to rinse your mouth out with water at all with a fluoride rinse.Your teeth need time to absorb the fluoride that has been applied to them so they can receive its tooth strengthening benefits. Dentists recommend that you do not eat or drink anything for at least twenty minutes after using a fluoride rinse.

, Read the directions on the back of the fluoride container to see if there are any special instructions. Your fluoride rinse should have a safety seal, if the seal is broken or damaged return the product to the store that you purchased it from and buy another one.


Children under the age of six shouldn’t use fluoride rinses because they may swallow it.Fluoride rinses are safe to use daily and for extended amounts of time. If you are prone to cavities, your dentist will most likely recommend that you use a fluoride rinse every day., You can also sip a small mouthful and hold it in your mouth., Some manufacturers may recommend swishing the rinse for up to a minute; check the packaging for directions.


It is best to use the rinse 30 minutes after eating or drinking.

, Do not rinse your mouth or gargle with water immediately after using the rinse. This will dilute the fluoride that the rinse has just left on your teeth and make it much less effective.

, Fluoride has been found to substantially prevent tooth decay. Fluoride has been added to drinking water across the world as a cost-effective way to prevent tooth decay.Fluoride prevents tooth decay by strengthening the enamel of your treat
Strong tooth enamel helps to prevent dental cavities, which are small holes that damage the structure of your teeth. They can be prevented through good oral hygiene.Exposing our children to fluoridated water helps them to maintain healthy teeth throughout their lifetime., This will vary depending on the country you are in. If you are receiving a healthy amount of fluoride from your drinking water, you may not need to use a fluoridated rinse.


If you receive your water through a municipal source, contact your local municipality and ask whether your water is fluoridated.
If you use a personal water source, like a well, there will not be fluoride added to your water. Fluoride occurs naturally in almost all water sources, but not in a level that is significant to your health. Unless your water source has a high amount of fluoride that is naturally occurring, you won't receive the same tooth strengthening benefits of fluoridated water.If your municipality does not fluoridate your water, consider asking that they begin doing so. Adding fluoride to water is a cost-effective and efficient way to protect your teeth without much investment on the municipalities’ part.If your municipal drinking water does not have fluoride added, ask the municipality to test the water to see how much fluoride is naturally occurring. It is possible to have too much fluoride, and your municipality should make this information known., Your dentist is your best source of information about oral hygiene and for personal dental recommendations. They are educated and licensed to give medical recommendations, including whether you should use a prescription or over the counter fluoride rinse.


Let your dentist know whether you use fluoridated toothpaste or get your water from a fluoridated drinking source. This will help them to gauge how much fluoride you are receiving from other sources.
During a dental exam, a dentist will examine your teeth for enamel damage and for cavities. If they feel that you are prone to cavities, they may recommend a fluoride rinse to strengthen your teeth.
You should consult your dentist to see if they think that you would benefit from a fluoride rinse before you begin to use one.
They can prescribe a fluoride rinse to you or give recommendations for an over the counter rinse to purchase.

, To protect your teeth, you need to follow good oral hygiene. If your teeth are unhealthy, a fluoride rinse is not going to be of much benefit to you.


Brush your teeth at least twice daily with a fluoridated toothpaste. Brushing your teeth regularly helps to remove plaque buildup. Plaque is damaging to teeth and is caused by the bacteria in our mouth.Use a toothbrush with soft bristles. Hard bristles can damage the enamel on your teeth and should be avoided. You can use either an electric or a manual toothbrush.
Floss daily or every other day. Flossing helps to remove plaque and food buildup from between your teeth where your toothbrush can’t reach. It is also important for healthy gums and to prevent gum diseases like gingivitis.Brush each of your teeth on all sides. Brushing your teeth should take you, on average, about two minutes.

, Fluoride is naturally occurring in water and is added to some oral hygiene products. If you are at a high risk of having cavities, ask your dentist about other ways that you can receive fluoride.


Some dentists will offer a fluoride treatment for individuals with a high risk for cavities. During this treatment, the dentist applies fluoride directly to your teeth with a gel, foam, or rinse.A dentist can also recommend a fluoride supplement, which comes in either a tablet, a lozenge, or in the form of a drop. Fluoride supplements are generally recommended for children that live in areas without fluoridated water.Most commercially sold toothpastes have fluoride added to them. You can check the ingredient label on most toothpastes to see if fluoride has been added.

Move your tongue over the affected teeth.,
Rinse your mouth.,
Try chewing gum.",How to Remove Popcorn from Your Teeth2," Try to gently ""pick"" at the popcorn using your tongue. Do not overdo this, as it may cause pain and inflammation to your tongue.

, You can use plain water, but using a salt water rinse will help ease any inflammation you're experiencing and reduce the chances of an infection.The gritty texture of salt may provide additional assistance in removing food debris.Mix one tablespoon of salt into an eight ounce glass of warm water.Stir until the salt is well-dissolved.
Swish the salt water on the affected side of your mouth. Try to focus your rinsing around the location of the popcorn. You can also use an oral irrigator or WaterPik if you have one.

, Chewing gum increases salivation in the mouth, and can also help physically dislodge debris from your teeth.Sugar-free chewing gum has even been shown to reduce dental debris by up to 50%.Focus your chewing on the affected side of your mouth for optimal results.

An over-the-counter pain reliever like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help reduce inflammation and relieve the pain until you can see a dentist.Maintain good oral hygiene but avoid any excess trauma by trying to pull out the debris

, Clove oil has been shown to have pain-relieving and antibacterial properties.Clove oil may help relieve dental pain until you can visit a dentist.Dab some clove oil onto a cotton ball or the tip of a cotton swab.
Apply the clove oil cotton to the site of the pain.
Repeat as needed until you can see your dentist.

, Applying a cold compress to the outside of your mouth may help reduce inflammation and relieve pain.Wrap an ice pack in a towel. If you don't have an ice pack, wrap several ice cubes in a towel, or soak a towel in cold water.
Hold the towel over the affected side of your face.
Use the cold compress for no more than 20 minutes at a time. Then leave it off for at least 10 minutes before reapplying.You can do this 3 to 4 times a day.

, Your dentist will be able to remove the irritating popcorn debris, and may perform a routine cleaning to ensure that there are no other problem areas in your mouth. If an abscess or infection has formed, your dentist will also be able to treat the problem, and may recommend a prescribed medication to help manage the pain.

Locate plaque using a stain.,
Use the right kind of toothbrush and toothpaste.,
Use the correct brushing technique.,
Focus on each tooth individually.,
Remember to brush your tongue.",How to Remove Plaque1," Plaque is practically invisible, so it can be very difficult to know how much is on your teeth. To overcome this, you can purchase ""disclosing tablets"" in the grocery or drugstore. Once chewed, these tablets will stain the plaque on your teeth bright red, making it easy for you to examine your teeth for plaque and identify the areas you need to target with a toothbrush.


Green food coloring applied to your teeth with a q-tip will have the same effect, staining your teeth green for easy plaque identification.;
, To effectively brush your teeth and ensure that you are getting rid of as much plaque as possible, it is important that you have the right tools. Although there are many fancy toothbrushes on the market, the American Dental Association states that any ""soft nylon brush with rounded-end, polished bristles"" will do the trick.Hard bristled toothbrushes can be too abrasive and wear away tooth enamel and hurt your gums. Even if you are not using the correct brushing technique, soft bristles will still be better.


You will also need a good fluoride toothpaste. Fluoride strengthens teeth and protects them from decay and from the formation of cavities.
Electric toothbrushes are not any more effective at cleaning teeth than regular manually-operated ones. However, some people find that they are inclined to brush their teeth more regularly and for longer when they own an electric toothbrush, so investing in one may not be a bad idea.
Dentists recommend that you should replace your toothbrush every 3 to 4 months, as they become less effective at cleaning over time.

, When brushing your teeth, hold the toothbrush at a 45 degree angle against the gum line and sweep the brush away from the gums, in a short vertical, back-and-forth, or circular motions. Try not too scrub too hard, as this can actually damage the enamel on your teeth and cause high sensitivity to any type of stimulus., Pay attention to each tooth as you brush, making sure that you don't miss any. Remember to brush the outer surfaces, the inner surfaces and the chewing surfaces, and pay some special attention to those hard to reach teeth at the back. Brushing your teeth properly should take about two minutes -- try using a stopwatch to get a feel it, and hum a song to yourself to pass the time.

, Plaque can easily build up on the surface of the tongue due to food residues, so make sure to give it a little gentle scrub too. This will also help to freshen your breath.


When you brush your tongue, go from the back to the front of your mouth and repeating the gentle brushing motion 4 or 5 times.

Make a fake mouth.,
Have kids floss your fingers.,
Floss for your child.,
Use floss picks.,
Consider a water flosser.,
Visit the dentist.,
Remind your child every day.,
Watch them floss.,
Let them shop for floss.",How to Teach Kids to Floss," Use 10-12 painted egg carton dimples on construction paper or a large plastic construction block such as a Duplo or Mega-Block single-rowed block to create a fake mouth. Use playdough to mimic food and plaque between the teeth, and let your child pick it out using dental floss.Once you have your block or dimples set up, simply place playdough between each of the ""teeth"" to mimic plaque.Have your child floss out the dough the same way they would floss out plaque. Teach them to scrape gently along the sides of the fake teeth to dislodge the dough.;
, Teach your child about how much pressure to apply by having them floss your fingers. Loop some floss around your middle finger and then press all of your fingers firmly together. Have your child gently practice the flossing motion on your hand, and let them know when they are applying too much pressure.To create a better visual, you can also wear a rubber glove and spread peanut butter or a similar paste between your fingers.
If your child is flossing too hard, let them know not to pull so much. Demonstrate gentle flossing on their hands so that they better understand.

, Show your child the proper flossing technique by demonstrating how much floss to cut, how to wrap it around your fingers, and move the floss around in between teeth. Have them watch you floss a few times before trying it on themselves.The recommended amount of floss one should use is around 12 to 18 inches (30 to 46 cm), so that there is enough floss for a clean segment to be used on each tooth.
Teach them to slide the floss gently up and down the side of each tooth, rather than simply pulling it back and forth between teeth.

, When your child is first learning to floss, it may be helpful for them to use floss picks or floss holders, which are picks with small bands of floss pre-secured between a u-shaped curve. This way, they can get used to the motion between the teeth without having to focus on moving and re-wrapping a length of floss.Floss picks are widely available at most drug stores and supermarkets.

, Water flossers represent more of an investment than a roll of floss, but they allow your child to safely and comfortably get in between their teeth. Water flossers are particularly useful for a child with braces who can’t get ordinary floss all the way up the side of the tooth.The water flosser works by spraying a pressurized stream of water in between the teeth to remove food and buildup. On most models, the pressure can be controlled to allow for greater comfort.
Water flossers are available online, as well as at many big box retailers.

, No one knows oral hygiene better than a dentist. Make an appointment with a practice that specializes in pediatric dentistry, and request that the dentist demonstrate proper flossing practices for your child.Dentists generally have more tools at their disposal, including accurate oral models, to help your child better learn proper oral hygiene techniques.
Request that the dentist or an oral hygienist demonstrate flossing techniques for your child, then supervise as your child attempts to floss for themselves.

, Gently remind your child to floss every day. When they are getting ready for bed, ask them, “Did you remember to brush your teeth and floss today?”Try not to scold or reprimand your kid if they forgot to floss. Instead, ask them “Will you please go floss?” if they forgot.

, For the first few weeks or even months that your child flosses for themselves, watch them while they floss. This not only helps ensure that your child is flossing, but also allows you to monitor them and make sure they aren’t being too aggressive.A little bit of bleeding is normal when your child first begins to floss, but if bleeding does not stop or gets worse after the first week or two, your child may be flossing too hard.
If your child is flossing too hard, practice with them to encourage more gentle, healthy flossing.

, Allowing your child to go with you and pick out their own floss can help instill a sense of pride and make your child more eager to use their new floss. Take them with you to pick out floss picks or rolls of floss and allow them to choose flavors and designs that suit their personality.Encourage your child to pick something that will help them enjoy flossing, rather than providing them with something they had no say in and creating a new obligation.

Keep it in sight.,
Write yourself notes.,
Write it in your calendar.,
Set an alarm.,
Sync up.,
Ask for a reminder.",How to Remember to Brush Your Teeth1," Leave out your toothpaste and toothbrush so that it is more apparent to you. Make sure they are somewhere you will see during the times of day you would like to brush your teeth. Keep them in a cup by the sink in the bathroom, for instance. A brightly colored cup might help draw your attention.;
, Put post-its or other notes in places you are likely to see them. Change them routinely so that your eyes don't learn to skip them. Put one note on your bathroom mirror, and another by your bed, on your lamp, or on your kitchen table. Put a note on the back of your front door to remind yourself to brush before leaving the house.


Write something like ""brush!"" or draw a picture of your toothbrush.
Some toothbrushes have a clock and a timer that you can use to set alarms and measure the brushing time. This might help you to remember to brush as well.

, If you have a pocket agenda, write ""brush teeth"" into your daily schedule. A to-do list with items you check off could also help. If you have a wall calendar, you can put it there. Any document you are likely to refer to frequently is a good place for a reminder.

, Use an alarm clock, your phone, or your computer to set an alarm for the times of day you would like to brush your teeth. You can look up free alarm systems online. Always brush as soon as your alarm goes off, or it will lose power.

, If you live with someone, brush your teeth when they do. Ask them to brush at the same time as you, or immediately before. Observe when they brush, or have them tell you when they are going to brush their teeth so you can brush after.


Another idea may be to keep the toothbrush on one side of the sink and place the toothpaste parallel to it, but on the other side of the sink so it will draw your attention.

, Ask someone to remind you every night. If you know someone who really looks out for you, such as a parent, partner, or best friend, ask them to remind you to brush your teeth. If they live far from you, they can call you.

Brush your teeth twice daily.,
Floss between your teeth.,
Use a mouthwash that targets plaque.,
Avoid sugary and starchy foods.,
Get regular, professional cleanings.",How to Remove Plaque2," Brushing your teeth is by far the most effective way of removing plaque, and brushing properly and regularly will help to ensure that less plaque builds up over time. This is important as built-up plaque can calcify into tartar, which is a lot harder to remove. You should brush your teeth once a day at the very least, but dentists recommend brushing twice; once in the morning and once before bed.It is important to brush before bed because during night, bacterial flora becomes more active eliminating acids that are hard to neutralize because of the reduced flow of saliva.

, Flossing is an essential component of effective oral hygiene, though unfortunately it is often neglected. Flossing removes bacteria and food particles from between the teeth, helping to prevent the formation of plaque. It should be done once a day, at bedtime, before brushing your teeth. Floss between teeth using a gentle sawing motion, and lifting the floss along the sides of the teeth. Avoid ""snapping"" the floss into place, as this can irritate the delicate gum tissue.


Make sure to use a clean section of floss for between each tooth, otherwise you are just moving bacteria from one part of your mouth to another.
If you find dental floss awkward to use, try using a dental pick instead. This is a small wooden or plastic stick which can be inserted between the teeth, achieving the same results as flossing., Though plaque-busting mouthwashes are not effective enough to remove plaque all by themselves, when used as part of a teeth cleaning routine involving brushing and flossing, they can help to loosen plaque, while giving you minty-fresh breath in the process.


Chlorhexidine digluconate is the most effective mouthwash against any type of oral bacteria, but it should not be used for more than two weeks in a row.

, The bacteria found in plaque thrive on sugary and starchy foods. In fact, every time you eat these kinds of foods, the bacteria release an acid which leads to tooth decay and cavities. To avoid this, try to minimize your consumption of these types of processed foods and pay special attention to your brushing and flossing routine if you decide to indulge., Even if you implement the most rigorous oral hygiene routine at home, you can still benefit from a visit to the dentist every six months or so. Only a dentist can give you the thorough, professional cleaning which will remove the most hard-to-reach plaque and stubborn tartar.

Use baking soda.,
Eat apples and melons.,
Rub orange peel on your teeth.,
Chew sesame seeds.,
Apply tomatoes and strawberries to your teeth.,
Make a homemade toothpaste.",How to Remove Plaque3," This is one of the oldest natural remedies for home plaque removal. Simply shake a small amount of baking soda into a bowl, wet your toothbrush, then dip the bristles into the baking soda to coat. Brush your teeth as normal. If you like, you can also mix a pinch of salt into the baking powder.Avoid brushing with pressure when you use baking soda as toothpaste. Also, do not use baking soda for more than five days in a row because it is abrasive and may damage your tooth enamel if you use it too often.

, Eating an apple or some melon directly after a meal will help to clean your teeth naturally and prevent plaque from building up on the surface of your teeth. This will also help to keep gums healthy and prevent them from bleeding.

, The vitamin C in citrus fruits such as oranges may help to prevent microorganisms from growing on the surface of teeth. Try rubbing the rind of the orange over the surface of your teeth before going to sleep at night.

, Chew a spoonful of sesame seeds, but do not swallow. Then use a dry toothbrush to brush your teeth, using the sesame seeds as a kind of toothpaste. They will help to remove plaque and polish your teeth at the same time., Tomatoes and strawberries, like oranges, are rich in vitamin C. Cut them open and rub the juice on the surface of the teeth, leaving it to sit for about five minutes. Do not use strawberries or tomatoes or apples or oranges or any other plaque removing foods if you're allergic to them. Rinse out your mouth with a solution of baking soda dissolved in water., If you prefer to stay away from the array of chemicals found in most store-bought toothpastes, it is possible to make your own plaque-busting natural version, using just a few simple ingredients. Combine 1/2 cup of coconut oil with 2 to 3 tablespoons of baking soda, 2 little packets of stevia powder and 20 drops of your chosen essential oil, such as peppermint or cinnamon. Store your homemade toothpaste in a small glass jar and use just like regular toothpaste."

Choose the right toothbrush.,
Brush your teeth properly, at least twice a day, to maintain their strength.,
Be sure to floss your teeth daily.,
Use a tongue scraper, cleaner, or a brush to gently clean your tongue.,

Take care of your toothbrush.,
Maintain good dietary habits to protect your teeth and gums.,

Think of your dentist as a partner in health.",How to Strengthen Teeth and Gums," Selecting a toothbrush from a store can be overwhelming; the variety of special features, let alone colors, is enough to leave you scratching your head in the dental care aisle. Picking a brush that is right for you is more important than buying the most expensive brush with the most features. Things to look for in a toothbrush include:An appropriate size. Larger toothbrushes can be more difficult to maneuver in your mouth. Most adults are well-served by a toothbrush that is about half an inch wide an one inch tall.
The right bristle strength. Bristles are generally categorized as ""soft,"" ""medium,"" or ""hard/firm."" Most people do well with a soft-bristled brush, which has the flexibility to clean near gums without causing excess bleeding.
An endorsement. Check to see if a toothbrush you're considering bears a seal of approval from the American Dental Association (ADA). A brush without such an approval is likely fine to use, but it can give you extra peace of mind knowing that your selection has been endorsed by a respectable dental health agency.
Manual or electric? There is no right answer when choosing between a manual and an electric toothbrush. As long as you use either regularly, you will probably have healthy teeth. If you do choose to go electric, be sure that you find an electric brush that oscillates, which is more effective at removing plaque.;
, Brushing your teeth regularly prevents cavities and tooth decay, ensuring the strength and functionality of your teeth. With proper care, your teeth and gums can stay healthy throughout your life. The healthier your teeth and gums are, the less risk you have for tooth decay and gum disease. Brush after meals when possible.Your toothbrush should be placed against your teeth at a 45-degree angle to the gum line, and moved on the tooth surface in a circular and up-down motion.
Do not use too much force or pressure when brushing. Allow the tips of the bristles to reach between the teeth.
Cover all the inner, outer, and chewing surfaces of all your teeth, making sure the grooves and crevices are cleaned well.
Take particular care to clean the inside of the lower front teeth and the outer surfaces of the upper back teeth, as these are the surfaces that tend to collect the most tartar.
Brush your teeth for two to three minutes. Once you finish, rinse your mouth with water or mouthwash.

, Flossing your teeth regularly (usually about once a day) and thoroughly is a great way to ensure that your teeth remain free of cavities and decay. You can choose either Nylon (or multifilament) floss or PTFE (monofilament) floss. Although PTFE is slightly more expensive and shred-free, either floss should effectively remove plaque and debris.Dispense around 18 inches (45.7 cm) of floss from the dispenser.
Wind it tautly around the middle fingers of each hand, keeping a one inch section open for flossing.
Floss the upper teeth first, then the lower teeth.
Hold the floss tightly between the thumb and forefinger and gently guide it between your teeth in a rubbing-sliding motion.
Never use force, as it can damage the gum tissue.
Once it reaches your gum line, make a ""C"" shape around an individual tooth and then manipulate it in the space between the tooth and gum.
Rub floss against the side of the tooth, moving it in an up and down motion, away from the gums.
Keep using a fresh section of floss as you move from tooth to tooth.
Floss the back of the last molars carefully.

, In addition brushing and flossing to clean your teeth, you can make your mouth fresher and cleaner by using a tongue cleaner. Your tongue can house germs and food particles, so cleaning it thoroughly can help your overall dental hygiene. Use a tongue scraper by placing the edge of the scraper against your tongue and dragging it forward.
A toothbrush, though less effective than a tongue scraper, can still improve your oral health if used to brush the tongue.
A tongue brush with bristles may clean your tongue as well as a tongue scraper. You might even be able to find a toothbrush that includes a tongue brush on the opposite side.

, Gum massage is associated with increased blood flow to the gums, increasing the availability of nutrients and oxygen while removing waste from the gum tissue. You can massage your own gums with your fingers in order to loosen additional food.


Press your index finger on your gum and use a gentle circular motion to stimulate the gums.
Massage all around, and end by using a mouth rinse or warm salt water rinse.
Be aware that massaging your gums can lead to increased sensitivity. The American Academy of Periodontology warns that increasing circulation to the gums can also intensify the sensitivity of irritations from plaque and food particles.

, Fluoride, a naturally occurring mineral, can help strengthen enamel and fight cavities. It can even aid in repairing tooth decay if it is still in an early stage.You may be able to increase your fluoride intake by drinking tap water. Many public water systems add fluoride to the water to help the dental health of community members.You can also apply fluoride directly to your teeth. While it is an ingredient in many commercially available products, you may be able to get a stronger fluoride concentration from a prescription toothpaste or mouthwash product., Brushing your teeth is an important part of everyday oral hygiene, but it's important to take care of your toothbrush to avoid any risk of infection or contamination. Replace your toothbrush when it's worn or frayed, about every three or four months. You should also get a new toothbrush after you have had a cold, strep throat, or similar illness.
Don't share toothbrushes. Sharing a toothbrush may put your mouth at an increased risk of infection. Those with diminished immune systems or infectious diseases should take particular care not to share toothbrushes or any other oral care items.Rinse your toothbrush with tap water after every brushing to remove any remaining toothpaste or other debris. Store your toothbrush upright and allow it to air dry. Keep toothbrushes separate to prevent any possibility of cross contamination.Do not cover toothbrushes or store them in closed containers for long periods of time. If your toothbrush does not have the opportunity to dry out, it becomes more susceptible to the growth of microorganisms. A closed container may accelerate your brush's exposure to these, increasing the risk of infection.

, Be sure to eat a variety of healthy foods, limiting foods that are starchy or high in sugar. Starchy and sugary foods increase mouth acid and can ultimately damage your teeth.


Limit your consumption of junk food/soda or any sugary, sticky foods. These foods stick to teeth and are turned into acid by the bacteria that live in the mouth. Bacteria, acid, food debris, and saliva combine to form plaque, which acts as a base for tartar formation by clinging to the teeth. Acids in plaque also dissolve the enamel structure, creating holes in the teeth called cavities.Eat more fruits and vegetables, and healthier options like brown, whole wheat, or multigrain bread.
Drinking a glass of milk is an excellent source of calcium, which is critical in maintaining good tooth density.
Although Vitamin D has been linked with helping to reduce tooth decay, it has not yet been proven conclusively. It’s important not to rely on vitamin supplements exclusively for maintaining your teeth’s health., You can help ""wash down"" your food after eating by swigging some refreshing water. In addition to the many other health benefits of water, it can help prevent your teeth from developing plaque., Using cigarettes and other tobacco products can be extremely damaging to your gums. People who smoke are far more likely to develop gum disease. You may find that your smoking habit gives you a number of gum problems, from sensitive gums that bleed to painful sores., Severe heartburn may cause stomach acids to reach your mouth and erode your tooth enamel. A similar effect happens with untreated bulimia, an eating disorder that involves purging, or vomiting, after eating. Get treatment for either condition before your health continues to erode., Know what your mouth looks like when it is normal so that you can better evaluate any changes or problems that may pop up later. Be sure to watch out in changes of color, including spots or growths. Check your teeth for any chipping or discoloration, and report any persistent pain or changes in your bite (jaw alignment) to your dentist.

, Go to the dentist every six months to get a professional cleaning and polishing.The dentist will clean the plaque and tartar from above and below the gum line using special instruments.
This ensures the health of your gums in the long run and prevents any gingival/periodontal/gum disease from developing.

, Medical conditions that seem unrelated to your mouth can nonetheless affect your oral hygiene, so be sure to alert your dentist about:Cancer treatments
Pregnancy
Heart disease
New medications

, A sealant is a coating that is placed over the teeth to protect them from decay. It can only be used on a healthy tooth without decay and it lasts a long time.Sealant is often a good option for children who are getting their healthy, permanent teeth.

, Talk to your dentist openly about any concerns, changes, or questions you may have about any procedures or treatments. You should never be afraid to advocate for yourself and ""arm"" yourself with information. The following questions can be useful in learning more about your dentist's services and your overall oral care.What is your recommended treatment?
Are any alternative treatments available?
What differences in cost or durability do different treatments have?
How urgent is treatment? What would happen with a delay?
Are there any flexible options for payment, like insurance, discounts, or payment plans available?

Observe your habits.,
Integrate brushing into your list.,
Follow your list.,
Follow your routine.",How to Remember to Brush Your Teeth2," Draw up a list of things you do every night before bed. You probably have a routine, even if you don't keep it consciously. Maybe you always watch TV, or you always change into pajamas. Write a list of everything you normally do before bedtime.


Do the same for your morning routine. You should be brushing your teeth twice a day.
In the morning, it may be easiest to brush teeth when you first get up, like washing your face to refresh yourself.
If you groggy when you first wake up, try brushing your teeth after you have had breakfast.

, Look at the list and ask yourself ""when would it make sense to brush my teeth?"" You should brush your teeth after you have finished eating and drinking for the day. It is a good idea to brush your teeth before you get into bed, as you may fall asleep without completing your routine. Add ""brush teeth"" to the list.


Brush your teeth as early as makes sense for your routine. If you never eat or drink anything but water after dinner, brush immediately after dinner.
Add ""brush teeth"" to the list before you get too tired to brush your teeth and remember it is the most important thing you need to do before sleeping.
Attach your brushing to something you do reliably. If you always eat at certain times, set your brushing to happen right after you eat.
If you shower daily, try always brushing your teeth while you shower.

, Your list is now an ""order of operations."" Make copies of your list, and check off each item as you do it. Do this every night for a week, or until you feel that brushing is a part of your routine. Next, try leaving the list by your bed. Don't look at it until you have gotten into bed. Did you brush your teeth?


If you keep forgetting to brush your teeth, use the list again. Use it until it is no longer useful for you.
It is important to list things beside ""brush teeth"" to the list, because otherwise you may forget the list entirely.

, Once you have established an order of operations that makes sense to you, follow it. You are trying to break one habit and establish another. Losing track of your new routine could put you right back where you started. Re-introduce the list whenever you fall out of your new habit.


Let yourself know that not brushing isn't an option. When you realize you forgot to brush, brush. Do this even if it means you'll have to get out of a warm bed or interrupt your workflow.
Also, make sure to use a mouthwash to rinse before going to bed. You might try leaving the bottle in awkward places, such as your desk or close to your bed to remember that you have to brush. Then, move the bottle to another place to catch your attention the next day.

Get comfortable.,
Brush before you get too tired.,
Take care of yourself when you're down.",How to Remember to Brush Your Teeth3," You may be forgetting to brush your teeth because you have an aversion to it. If brushing your teeth hurts or gums or overwhelms your senses, you may let yourself ""forget"" more than otherwise. Do everything you can to make brushing a comfortable act. Get a toothbrush that you like.If you are frustrated with the time brushing takes, try setting a timer or playing a song of a certain length while you brush.
If your gums are sensitive, try an electronic toothbrush, or a soft toothbrush. However, also make sure you visit a dentist or a periodontist to teach you the proper brushing technique.
Get a kind of toothpaste that smells and tastes good to you. Pick a flavor you like, or choose an unscented, neutral toothpaste.
Create a pleasant tooth cleaning environment. Listen to music while you brush your teeth. Wear slippers if your feet are cold.
Ask yourself ""do I like being in the bathroom?"" If you share your bathroom, if it's dirty, or if you don't like looking at yourself in the mirror, you may be avoiding it. Find another place to brush your teeth, or make improvements to your bathroom.

, If you tend to do a lot of activities in bed before you fall asleep, you may fall asleep where you are. Brush your teeth before you get into bed. You may not be a morning person, and may wake up too groggy to remember to brush. Set a reminder, or brush every day after breakfast or lunch.


If you work or hang out until late and come home exhausted, either set a reminder or bring a toothbrush and toothpaste with you and brush as soon as you are done with food and drink. Even if you are in a hurry for work after breakfast, never brush your teeth in a rush because it can do a lot of harm to your gums and teeth. Take the toothbrush and the toothpaste with you and brush before entering your office.
If your routine is making it impossible for you to complete basic acts of self-care, consider making larger changes.

, It may be hard to remember to care for yourself when you are feeling depressed, anxious, or demoralized. Remind yourself that anything you can do to take care of yourself will help your mood, albeit slightly. Take care of all parts of your body: brush your teeth, eat three solid meals a day, move around, and get a full night's sleep. Spend time with people you love, and get counseling if you are feeling stuck.Frame your acts of self-care as self-love. Say ""I deserve clean teeth,"" or ""everything I do for myself is worth doing.""

Allow your denture adhesive to loosen naturally.,
Use water to loosen the adhesive further.,
Try using mouthwash.,
Learn how to effectively remove your dentures.,
Use a washcloth to clean your gums once your dentures are removed.,
Try using a toothbrush.,
Use your fingertips.,
Use a cream denture adhesive.,
Try a powder denture adhesive.,
Be cautious when using denture adhesive.",How to Remove Denture Adhesive from Gums," Denture adhesive loosens naturally in the presence of water or moisture. As a result, most denture adhesives contain a substance that absorbs saliva in order to prevent the moisture in your mouth from loosening the adhesive. This works for most of the day, but eventually loses its capacity to absorb any more saliva. At this point, your denture adhesive will naturally start to loosen. You should ideally be able to remove your dentures easily with no adhesive remaining on your gums, and only some adhesive left on the dentures themselves (which can be subsequently cleaned)., If you find that your denture adhesive does not loosen enough on its own throughout the day, you can rinse your mouth with warm water. Before you place the water in your mouth, ensure that you can tolerate the temperature and that it is not too hot.Take a sip of the water and swish it around in your mouth for 30 seconds to one minute. The longer you hold it in your mouth, the more it will help to loosen the adhesive from your gum surfaces.
After a minute spit it out into the sink.
Repeat this same procedure a couple of times and most of the adhesives will be washed away.

, Another option instead of water is to use a mouthwash such as Crest Pro-Health. The moisture from the mouthwash can serve to loosen your denture adhesive, while providing you with fresh breath at the same time.You can also use a mixture of salt and water by creating a saline solution to rinse your mouth before taking off your denture. Simply mix about half spoonful of salt into a glass of water for two minutes or until is completely dissolved.

, Remove your lower dentures first by gripping them between your thumb and your fingers and using a gentle rocking motion from side-to-side. The lower dentures should come out easily without needing much force.Your upper dentures may be slightly more challenging to remove.Use your thumbs to press your front dentures upwards and outwards in the direction of your nose.
You can also pull them by placing your index fingers on the sides. If you manage to let air pass between your dentures and the soft mucosa, then they will fall off easily. The highest suction is found in the back of your dentures where the border with the soft palate is found, so when removing them try to go as far back as you can.
If you have challenges removing your dentures, stop by your dentist's office for advice and guidance. A dental assistant will likely be able to help you, or the receptionist may even have advice that improves your technique and helps you to get your dentures out.

, If any adhesive remains on your gums after your dentures have been removed, you can easily get rid of this using a warm washcloth. Gently wet the cloth and rub it in gentle circular motions over your gums to clear off any remaining adhesive., Alternatively, you can use a toothbrush to remove any remaining adhesive from your gums. Place a pea-sized amount of toothpaste on your brush and proceed to gently brush your gums with it.


This serves both to remove any remaining adhesive, and also to promote optimum gum health.
Cleaning and brushing your gums daily is recommended as part of good oral hygiene.

, Once your dentures are out, rather than using a washcloth or a toothbrush, you can simply use the tip to massage the roof of your mouth and other gum surfaces that hold the dentures in place. Use a firm and circular motion as it helps to remove the adhesive from the gums. Rinse your mouth out and, if needed, massage your gums more than once to ensure your gums are completely adhesive free.


Massaging your gums also increases the blood circulation to the gums and keeps them healthy.
Take care not to hurt your gums with your fingernails! If you have long nails, you'll be better off with a different method.

, To apply a cream denture adhesive, it is generally recommended to dab three to four small circles of cream (approximately the size of a pencil eraser) on both your upper and lower dentures prior to inserting them in your mouth. Do not use more than this if you want to be able to easily remove your dentures later. You know you used too much if excess cream drips off your dentures after you have inserted them., Another option is to use a powder adhesive. Sprinkle some powder on both your upper and lower dentures prior to inserting them in your mouth, and shake the dentures to spread the powder around. You will want to use an amount similar to sprinkling icing sugar on a cake., There is no benefit to using more than the recommended amount of denture adhesive. Using more will not improve the hold, so follow the instructions on the label or the directions from your dentist. Also, do not use adhesive more than once per day. Finally, adhesive is not to be used as a substitute for poorly fitting dentures.If you are concerned about the fit of your dentures, book a visit with your dentist as soon as you can. When you no longer have your teeth, your jaw bone will dissolve over time. This will cause the fit of your dentures to change as well as they lack the support of the jaw bone.

Brush your teeth twice per day.,
Floss your teeth once daily.,
Use mouthwash.,
Visit your dentist for regular cleanings.",How to Reverse Tooth Decay1," Regular daily brushing is crucial for maintaining good dental health and it may also help to reverse the decay process. Make sure that you brush your teeth at least twice per day, such as in the morning and before you go to bed.Choose a toothpaste that contains fluoride. Fluoride is necessary for remineralizing teeth and reversing tooth decay. It can also help to protect your teeth from future decay.Use a soft bristle toothbrush. Hard-bristled toothbrushes can damage your teeth and gums.Brush all surfaces of your teeth (front, back, and tops). Use short, swift strokes as you brush your teeth. You should spend about two minutes brushing, and for a better action you can also leave the toothpaste in your mouth for the next two minutes before rinsing so fluoride can remineralize your enamel.;
, Flossing is important because a toothbrush does not clean between your teeth, but bacteria often hides between your teeth and causes tooth decay. That is why you need to floss between your teeth at least once per day as well.To floss your teeth, wrap and 18 inch piece of floss around each of your index fingers. Then, use the floss to clean between all of your teeth.
As you floss your teeth, try to rub the floss up and down the sides of your teeth to pull out any remaining plaque underneath your gums. Do not just move the floss back and forth.
Try using a water flosser if you have trouble using floss. For people who have braces or other dental work that gets in the way, a water flosser can be a useful tool for cleaning between your teeth using the pressure of water to stimulate the blood flow in the gums for better protection against bacteria., Mouthwash can help to reduce decay causing kill bacteria inside of your mouth, so it is a great addition to your dental hygiene routine. Some mouthwashes also contain fluoride, so they can help to strengthen your teeth as well.To use mouthwash, pour the recommended amount into the cap (usually about 30 mL) and then swish the amount in your mouth for about one minute. After you have finished swishing the mouthwash, spit it out. Do not swallow the mouthwash.
Do not rinse with water afterwards so the antibacterial effect will last longer. If the mouthwash is too strong and gives a burning feeling, then dilute it with 50:50 water.

, Regular visits to your dentist will also help to protect against tooth decay. Make sure that you visit your dentist for a cleaning and exam at least twice per year to stay on top of your dental health.


Ask your dentist about fluoride treatments and other protective measure for your teeth. Your dentist can even apply a dental sealant to your teeth to help protect them from tooth decay."

Get more vitamin D and calcium.,
Stick to unsweetened, non-carbonated beverages.,
Limit citrus.,
Switch to stevia or honey.,
Choose whole foods over processed foods.",How to Reverse Tooth Decay2," Vitamin D and calcium are essential to healthy teeth, so getting enough of these two vital nutrients may help to reverse tooth decay. Make sure that you are getting plenty of vitamin D and calcium from your diet, supplements, and other sources.To get more calcium and vitamin D in your diet, try to eat two to three servings dairy products each day, such as milk, yogurt, and cheese.
You can also look for a daily multi-vitamin that includes 100% of your recommended daily intake of calcium and vitamin D.
You can also spend 10 to 15 minutes in the sun each day to get your recommended daily intake of vitamin D. Just make sure that you put on sunscreen if you will be out in the sun for longer than 15 minutes.
If your body has plenty of minerals, including calcium, then you will see an increased rate of calculus deposits on the back side of your lower front teeth, this means you will have to go for a professional cleaning at least twice a year.

, Carbonated and sugary beverages can lead to tooth decay, so make sure that you avoid these if you are trying to reverse tooth decay. You should also try to avoid fruit juices, sodas, sports drinks, and any other fizzy or sweetened beverages.Instead of drinking soda, try drinking water flavored with a few berries or sip some unsweetened iced tea with a sprig of mint. Tea (hot or cold) contains polyphenols, which seem prevent bacteria from producing acids that lead to tooth decay.The antibacterial effect is from the increased hydration of your body and this results in a higher flow of saliva.

, Citrus fruits contain a lot of acid, which can increase tooth decay. While you are trying to reverse your tooth decay, stop drinking citrus fruit juices and limit citrus fruits to a couple of servings per week.Citrus fruits include:


Lemons.
Limes.
Oranges.
Tangerines.
Grapefruits.

, Sugar is a major culprit of tooth decay so try to eliminate as many sources of sugar from your diet as possible.Instead of adding sugar to your foods and beverages, try using stevia (a calorie-free herbal sweetener) or honey (an antibacterial sweetener) to sweeten your foods and beverages.

, Foods that are highly processed are more likely to contain extra sugars and lots of starch, which can get stuck in your mouth (making them hard to remove) promote the growth of decay causing bacteria.To reduce these sources of tooth decay, stop eating processed foods as much as possible. Instead, stick to whole foods such as:


Whole grains.
Lean meats.
Vegetables.
Fruits.
Dairy products.

Gather ingredients.,
Mix all of the ingredients together in a bowl.,
Keep the toothpaste in your refrigerator.",How to Reverse Tooth Decay3," Making your own remineralizing toothpaste is easy and it only takes a few ingredients. You can use this toothpaste in place of your normal toothpaste, but keep in mind that this recipe does not contain any fluoride and being abrasive should not be used for more than 3 to 4 weeks in a row. Fluoride is an important mineral for reversing tooth decay and protecting your teeth from further damage. To make your own remineralizing toothpaste you will need:


4 tablespoons of calcium (carbonate) powder (crush calcium carbonate tablets or buy calcium powder in bulk).
2 tablespoons of baking soda.
½ to 1 packet of stevia.
1 teaspoon sea salt.
1/4 cup of coconut oil.
a few drops of peppermint oil (optional).

, You can just use a strong fork to mix everything together. Make sure that they are well combined and that you have created a uniform paste. If the paste looks too thick, then you can add another tablespoon or two of coconut oil to thin it out.


Transfer the paste to a mason jar and seal it tightly when you are finished.
Use the paste just like your regular toothpaste.

, The toothpaste will keep longer in the refrigerator, but you will need to set it out about 15 to 20 minutes before you want to use it so that the coconut oil can return to room temperature. Otherwise, the paste may be too solid to use.

Use some floss.,
Try a flossing-stick.,
Consider an interdental brush.",How to Pick Your Teeth Without a Toothpick1," The absolutely ideal thing to use to tackle anything stuck between your teeth is some dental floss. If you have some handy, or keep some in your desk drawer at work, this is your best choice. This is the safest and most effective way to clean out food from between your teeth. Break off a length of floss that is about a foot long.Then wrap each end around your two index fingers so you have about two inches of floss between your fingers to work with.
Pass this through the gap between your teeth to work the food out. Try to keep the floss tightly pressed against your tooth so you don't risk cutting your gums.;
, If you don't carry floss around with you, or you find it awkward to use when you are out and about, there is a more convenient alternative. Flossing-sticks are small plastic devices that have Y shape at the end. Between the two points of the Y there is a small length of floss which you can use discreetly to clean up any stuck food.


If you have a couple of these in your desk they are even preferable to a toothpick.Flossing-sticks will mean you can avoid fiddling around with long lengths of floss and get the job done quickly and efficiently.

, If you don't have floss but still want to have a dentist-approved device to pick your teeth, you can try using an interdental brush. These are smaller than a normal toothbrush and are specifically designed to get in between your teeth. They are available in a variety of sizes from your pharmacy or dentist, are a good alternative to floss, and a safe way to clean out any food that has gotten stuck between your teeth."
"
Try using a piece of thread.,
Search around for an alternative.,
Try using your finger nail.",How to Pick Your Teeth Without a Toothpick2," If you don't have floss, you can use a piece of thread as a substitute. It will basically do the same job but will be less strong and is more liable to get stuck or break. One good thing about thread is that it's not hard to find. You might be able to tease out a short length of thread from whatever you are wearing to use as makeshift floss.


Wrap the ends around your index fingers as you would with floss and work it through your teeth. Take extra care because it doesn't take much to break it.

, If you don't have any toothpicks, floss or an interdental brush, it's time to start looking around for things with a flattened point that are not sharp and which you can safely put in your mouth. There are number of options that can work if you are lucky. Try folding over a piece of paper and using this as a makeshift toothpick, or alternatively try using a business card.


A drinking straw can be manipulated to fit between your teeth and dislodge and bit of food, but be careful. There is a danger that you could get whatever you use as a toothpick stuck between your teeth.
Be sure only to use something that is disposable and not important.

, If all else fails and you have long finger nails, you can try to work out some stuck food by sliding a finger nail down the side of the affected tooth. If you do this be sure to slide down from just below the gum line if the food is stuck in the upper layer of teeth. If the food is stuck in one of your bottom layer teeth slide your nail upwards away from the gum line.


Doing this will ensure that you are not moving your nail towards your gums which could result in your finger slipping and you cutting the gum.
Be sure to wash your hands before and after doing this.
Because of the risk of damaging gums, many dentists don't recommend the use of toothpicks at all."

Brush your teeth.,
Remember to floss.,
Use mouthwash.,
Go to the dentist.,
Get sealants.,
Avoid refined sugar.,
Reduce starches.,
Moderate consumption of oxalic acid.,
Balance your diet.,
Avoid dry mouth.,
Remove plaque.,
Know that there is no way to completely prevent fuzzy teeth.",How to Prevent Fuzzy Teeth," Dentists recommend brushing twice daily for a total of two minutes each time. It's recommended that you imagine your mouth is divided into four quadrants — two upper, two lower — each of which is brushed for 30 seconds each. Use a soft-bristle toothbrush and use the proper movements — up and down, not side to side, like you see in the movies. Use short strokes and hold your brush at a 45 degree angle. Brushing incorrectly can damage your enamel.
Most electric toothbrushes are now pre-programmed with a timer to help you keep track of how long you've brushed each section and when to move to the next one.;
, Regular brushing can remove build up on the surface of your teeth, but what about the gaps between teeth? That's why flossing is important, preventing residual plaque from hardening into tartar or calculus.In order to floss effective, follow these steps:


Use enough floss. The American Dental association recommends 18 inches (45.7 cm). Wrap most of the length around the pointer or middle finger of one hand. Wrap of the rest around the index or middle finger of your other hand.
Grasping the floss, use a seesawing motion to work the strand down between your teeth.
When you reach the gum line, wrap the floss around the back of the tooth in a ""C"" shape.
Pull the strand firmly against the tooth and, tugging back and forth between your fingers, rub the strand against your teeth until area near the gum line is free of plaque.
Repeat with your other teeth, using fresh sections of the floss as needed., After brushing and flossing, what your mouth needs is a good rinse to wash away the residue of what you just cleaned off your teeth. Mouthwash is formulated to kill and reduce the number of bacteria that cause plaque and can help prevent gingivitis., Dentists recommend making a cleaning appointment every six months. This cleans up any plaque that was missed from your daily regimen. It also gives the dentist a chance to check your overall oral health and address any cavities or other problems., Sealants are a treatment that fills the crevices in molars with a composite compound, which has almost the same physical properties to your natural tooth structure. This means that even if your teeth do get fuzzy from time to time, it will cause less damage. Consult your dentist to see if you are a candidate for sealants. , The bacteria that live in your mouth use sugar as a form of energy. When you eat sugary foods, their population explodes, more acid is generated in your mouth, and the rate of tooth decay increases dramatically.The protective compounds you in saliva are overwhelmed by the fast growth in the acidic environment.

, Starches like those found in breads, grains, and potatoes are a type of sugar and promote the same effect as refined sugars. Starches are also more prone to collect in the areas between your teeth., While oxalic acid doesn't actually harm teeth, eating food like spinach, beets, and parsley that contain high levels of oxalic acid will result in a fuzzy or chalky feeling on teeth., Eat a variety of nutritious foods, including fruits and vegetables. Many vegetables — like celery, beans, and cabbage — actually have a neutralizing effect on the acids produced by the bacteria in plaque. This reduces the amount of fuzzy build up on your teeth.Hard vegetables like carrots have a cleaning effect due to their fibrous texture and also increase antibacterial protection by stimulating the blood flow in the gums.

, Your mouth naturally produces saliva to rinse your teeth free of bacteria-created acids. When you have dry mouth, it is because saliva production has been reduced. This increases the frequency of fuzzy teeth and promotes tooth decay.Make sure you are drinking enough water every day (about eight 8-oz glasses) to avoid dry mouth. Factors that contribute to dry mouth are:


Medication: Many medications list ""dry mouth"" as a side-effect.
Smoking: Smoking dries out the mouth and requires increase saliva production to counteract the effects.
Drinking alcohol: The dehydrating effect of alcohol reduces saliva production.

, Plaque is the medical term for the combination of elements that coats our teeth between cleanings. It causes the irregular or fuzzy feeling on teeth and the reason that we brush, floss and rinse is to banish it from our mouths., Mucopolysaccharides are a naturally occurring long-chain sugars that the body uses to make joint movements smooth and fluids more viscous. They are present in saliva to coat food, lubricating it for swallowing and digestion. Without them, digestion would take longer and we would be more prone to choking on food. Unfortunately, they are also why plaque adheres to your teeth, creating that fuzzy feeling. "

Measure out four tablespoons calcium (carbonate) powder.You can crush calcium carbonate tablets or buy calcium powder in bulk.,
Add two tablespoons baking soda.Baking soda reduces the acid content in your mouth, so it is a vital ingredient in any tooth powder recipe.,
Include ½ teaspoon of stevia.,
Sprinkle in one teaspoon sea salt.Sea salt adds minerals to the tooth powder, which can help to re-mineralize your teeth.,
Mix all of the ingredients together.,
Add two tablespoons of bentonite clay.Bentonite clay may also help to re-mineralize teeth and fight cavities.,
Stir in a teaspoon of herbs and/or spices of your choice.,
Include two teaspoons of 3% hydrogen peroxide solution for whitening.,
Create a paste by adding 1/2 cup of coconut oil.,
Seal your powder in a jar.,
Dip your toothbrush into the powder and brush.,
Provide a separate jar for each family member.,
Adjust the ingredients to meet your needs.",How to Make Tooth Powder," Adding calcium to your toothpaste helps to rebuild the calcium in your teeth. Put four tablespoons of baking soda into your bowl.;
, Measure out two tablespoons of baking soda and add them to your bowl.

, Stevia helps to improve the flavor of the tooth powder by making it a little sweeter. You can add a little more stevia if you prefer a sweeter tooth powder. Measure out ½ teaspoon and add it to your bowl.

, Measure out one teaspoon of sea salt and add it to your bowl.


Make sure the salt crystals are not too large, as these can be too abrasive to use on your teeth.

, After you have added all of the ingredients to the bowl, use the wooden spoon to mix them together. Make sure that the ingredients are well combined.


You can add additional ingredients if desired, or just transfer the mixture to a mason jar and seal it until you are ready to use it.

, Try adding in two tablespoons of bentonite clay to your tooth powder. Stir it in until it is well combined with the other ingredients.

, You can add just about any herbs or spices that you want to improve the flavor of your tooth powder. Make sure that any herbs or spices that you use are ground into a fine powder. Some good herbs and spices to try include:Peppermint
Spearmint
Cinnamon
Cloves
Ginger
Sage
Aloe

, If you want to whiten your teeth a bit or if you have stubborn stains, then you can add two teaspoons of 3% hydrogen peroxide. Keep in mind that adding hydrogen peroxide will turn your powder into a paste. The hydrogen peroxide will also cause some foaming and tingling, but that is normal.Hydrogen peroxide is antibacterial and works as a bleaching agent and, along with baking soda, will have an increased whitening effect.
Don’t use anything stronger than a 3% solution because higher concentrations can burn and irritate the gums and mouth and increase tooth sensitivity.

, If you would prefer to have a toothpaste to brush your teeth, you can add coconut oil to your tooth powder. The coconut oil serves as a natural carrier for the other ingredients. Mix the coconut oil with the dry ingredients until they are all well-combined., If you have only used dry ingredients to make your powder, then you can seal it in your mason jar and keep it in your bathroom for daily use. If you have added wet ingredients to your paste, then you may want to keep it in the refrigerator.

, When you use the tooth powder, wet your toothbrush a little bit and dip it in your tooth powder. Brush gently and rinse. Remember that the powder is going to be a little bit abrasive, ideal for stain removal and whitening, but it may harm your enamel if you use it with force. Brush your teeth with the tooth powder twice daily for best results.Use a soft-bristle toothbrush. If it is older than three months, throw it out and use a new one.

, Since you will be dipping your toothbrush in the tooth powder, you may want to provide a separate jar for each member of the family. Try putting about a half cup of tooth powder into small mason jars and adding labels to them., After your first batch, you may decide that you want to adjust the ingredients to change the flavor or properties. Try out different herb combinations or increase/decrease the amounts of some of the ingredients.

Take an over-the-counter-painkiller.,
Apply benzocaine directly to the painful area.,
Rinse the painful area with hydrogen peroxide.",How to Numb a Tooth1," A painkiller like ibuprofen or acetaminophen should be your first step in trying to numb a painful tooth.These painkillers will alleviate the pain from your tooth, and should also decrease any swelling in the infected area. These are all readily available at your local pharmacy.


If you’re treating a toothache in a child younger than 18, do not give him or her aspirin. This medication can cause Reye’s syndrome in children and teens.
Do not exceed the maximum dose required when taking an over-the counter painkillers and be aware of the potential adverse reactions or allergies, which can include severe internal bleeding.;
, Benzocaine is a numbing gel that can be purchased over the counter at any pharmacy or drug store. Although the effects of this gel are temporary, it will effectively decrease tooth pain by numbing the sensitive, inflamed, and infected tissue.The inside of your mouth is naturally a wet place, and this moisture will cause the Benzocaine to wear off quickly. To prolong the effect, first dry the painful area with a clean cloth, and then apply the numbing gel to the dry area.
Over time, the Benzocaine will be diluted and wear off. To prolong its effect, do not lick at the numb area, and do not prod the numb area with your fingers. Do not swallow the medicine either or it will numb your throat. Check and see if your gums hurt or if you notice anything from using the gel. If something goes wrong, stop using it.

, This will temporarily numb the toothache, and can also kill some of the bacteria in your mouth that are causing the infection. Purchase 3% hydrogen peroxide from your local drugstore or pharmacy, and mix with water at a 1:1 ratio. Swish this in your mouth until you feel the pain start to numb.Spit the peroxide out; never swallow it. Hydrogen peroxide can be very unhealthy if swallowed.
You can also rinse your mouth with straight hydrogen peroxide, as long as you then rinse with water several times. Use this no more than three times a day and never more than five days in a row because hydrogen peroxide can cause teeth sensitivity.

Choose an activity you do every day.,
Place your toothpaste and toothbrush where you’ll see them.,
Set an alarm.,
Make your routine fun.,
Brush every day for thirty days.,
Make brushing enjoyable.,
Reward yourself.,
Visit the dentist.,
Notice any changes in how you feel.,
Learn how brushing affects your teeth.,
Learn the other health benefits of brushing.,
Look at pictures.,
Get insight from your dentist.",How to Motivate Yourself to Brush Your Teeth Everyday," Dentists recommend brushing your teeth twice a day-- sometimes more. However, if you’re struggling to even brush once a day, you may want to start there. Over time, as brushing becomes a habit and you feel its benefits, you’ll likely start brushing more often naturally. , This can be washing your face, brushing your hair, or taking a shower. Determine to brush your teeth every time you do that activity.


Be realistic about your schedule. If you tend to oversleep and run late to work, adding something else into your morning routine might be difficult.
If you usually come home in the evening feeling exhausted, that might not be the best time to add in a new routine. You may feel too lazy or tired to stick with your plan. However, as soon as brushing becomes routine for you, it will feel like a normal part of your day.

, If you plan to brush every time you shower, keep your toothbrush and toothpaste near the shampoo. If you’re going to brush when you wash your face, keep them right on top of your face wash, so you’ll have to pick them up! You can also try brushing while you are in the shower. This may help you to make it a habit.

, Set an alarm to remind you to brush each day in case you skip your designated time. Choose a time when you’re likely to be home, so there’s no excuse to not brush.


An alarm can be like a backup plan. For example, if you ended up not showering today, the alarm will still remind you to brush your teeth.

, It's difficult to keep to routines that aren't enjoyable. If you make your routine fun, you're more likely to stick to it.


You can listen to your favorite song each time you brush. This can even help you mark how much time you spend brushing!
Brushing your teeth doesn't take too much focus, so feel free to watch TV or listen to the radio while you do it. Imagine that you will be getting a Hollywood smile if you keep on brushing.
Take some silly selfies while you brush and send them to friends. You can even add captions like, ""sticking to my routine!"" to let them know about your commitment.

, Thirty days is an achievable and admirable goal. Doing something for thirty days straight helps to turn that activity into a habit. Keep track on a calendar or in a date book. Make a mark on your calendar for each day that you brush. Keep your calendar in the bathroom, so you’ll see it when you’re tempted to skip brushing.
If you miss a day, don’t beat yourself up. Just resolve to get back on track the next day.

, If you see brushing your teeth as a chore, you’re less likely to keep at it. Do what you can to make the process enjoyable. Choose products that you like, and that are comfortable for you.Choose a toothpaste that you like. Toothpastes come in many flavors including mint, anise, and cinnamon. They’re all essentially the same in terms of effectiveness as long as they contain fluoride. Be sure that your toothpaste has the ADA seal of approval.Choose a toothbrush that fits comfortably in your hand and in your mouth. Soft bristles can feel good on sensitive gums and teeth and they will also protect your gums against gum recession.

, Rewards can be big or small, but they should be significant to you. Decide ahead of time what your reward will be, and how long you’ll have to keep up your routine to earn it.Tell a friend or loved one what your reward will be. They can remind you if you start to lose motivation.
When you earn your first reward, take the time to enjoy it. Then set a new reward for a new goal.
Rewards don't have to be related to your teeth at all! You can take yourself out to a great meal, or splurge on a purchase you wouldn't otherwise make.

, No one can give you more accurate feedback on your progress than your dentist. Regular appointments for checkups and cleanings are essentially feedback sessions to see how your brushing has improved your dental health. Talk to your dentist about your efforts to brush regularly and the progress you’ve made.Ask your dentist to tell you what you might be doing wrong and how you can improve your brushing habits.

, Once you’ve been brushing your teeth regularly for a while, you may feel more confident. Your smile and breath are likely more clean and fresh than they were before. Take the time to enjoy that newfound confidence; it’s just what you need to stick with your new habit. , The more you know, the more motivated you’re likely to feel. There are plenty of websites about the importance of good dental hygiene. Find reasons that are personally compelling to you. Here are some examples:


Brushing your teeth daily helps prevent cavities. Cavities can make eating painful, and are costly to get filled. A cavity that grows too big due to negligence can require a root canal, which costs an average of $900.If a tooth gets so bad that it’s unable to be saved, it may need to be pulled. When a tooth is pulled, the teeth and jaw around that spot become weaker over time and the bone suffers resorption.Forces on your teeth will change and an entire series of problems will occur.
If your teeth are sensitive to hot or cold, a toothpaste for sensitive teeth can help change that. These toothpastes contain minerals that help protect the nerves in the teeth and make them less sensitive., Brushing your teeth doesn’t just affect your mouth. Good dental hygiene has been linked to other benefits as well:Poor dental hygiene can be linked to respiratory diseases, like pneumonia and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). These diseases can be quite serious, and good dental hygiene can help prevent them.
Poor dental hygiene leads to gum disease, or gingivitis. Gingivitis has been linked with an increased risk of preterm birth in pregnant women. Periodontitis, which follows gingivitis, can be linked to heart disease and this creates a constant level of bacteria in the circulatory system.
Oral bacteria have also been linked to knee arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis in a 2012 study.

, Taking care of your teeth also leads to a better looking smile. Compare images of people with healthy teeth to those who’ve neglected their teeth. The difference is likely to be a great motivator.Find strong visuals that will leave an impact on you.
Some people may be missing teeth, or have yellowed, cracked, or blackened teeth. Without daily brushing, your teeth could eventually look like this as well.

, Dentists have seen it all. If you’re having trouble believing how important dental hygiene is, ask your dentist or dental hygienist. They will have plenty of knowledge and experience to share.Dentists may have useful charts or pamphlets that you can bring home. These can serve as reminders of the importance of dental hygiene.

Wash your baby’s gums before the first tooth erupts.,
Brush teeth gently with a soft-bristled brush with a small head.,
Floss when two teeth grow in next to each other.,
Avoid letting your baby nap with a bottle of juice or milk.,
Take your child to their first dentist exam.",How to Protect Your Child's Teeth1," Use a soft, moist washcloth to clean your baby’s gums and mouth. Begin washing gums even before the first tooth appears. Applying toothpaste isn’t necessary before your baby’s first tooth erupts.You can also use a piece of sterile gauze that has been soaked in a saline solution, such as ¼ teaspoon of salt mixed with a cup of water.;
, Even if only one tooth has grown in, you can start brushing using a very small amount of fluoride toothpaste, such as a smear on the toothbrush, preferably at 1000 parts per million (ppm). However, this can be extremely hard to do. If your child is agitated, then avoid trying to brush their tooth. The first tooth appears at about 6 months and it is the lower central incisor, which has plenty of protection from the continuous flow of saliva.


If you do decide to brush your baby's first tooth, then get an infant toothbrush, which has soft bristles and a small head, and apply a tiny smear of toothpaste. Gently brush the tooth or teeth twice daily, once in the morning and once at night.Sit your baby on your lap and rest their head on your chest in order to brush their teeth. Slightly lean their head forward, so they won't swallow any of the tiny amount of toothpaste you're using.
Encourage your baby to spit out the tooth paste. Children typically master spitting between ages 2 and 3, but begin teaching them to spit when they begin to respond to vocal instruction. Try to make the experience as fun as possible for your baby so they will laugh and enjoy it.
A tiny smear or dot of toothpaste will leave a small amount of residue that you can simply wipe away with cloth. There's no need to rinse with water, since this will just wash protective fluoride away., Begin flossing as soon as two teeth erupt close enough to risk trapping food particles. Use a few inches of unwaxed floss if only a couple teeth have grown, or a longer length if more teeth have erupted. Be very gentle, and try to avoid irritating your baby's sensitive gums as you remove any buildup between the two teeth.When you floss and brush your child's teeth, examine them for small white dots. These are the first indicators of cavities or deficiency of enamel mineralization.

, Filling a baby’s naptime or bedtime bottle with water helps prevent tooth decay. Don’t give your baby juice before they are 6 months old, and limit juice to meal times rather than before they sleep. Establish routines like only drinking water after brushing teeth at night as early as possible.Steer clear from giving your baby sticky or sugary snacks like candy or soda, especially before naps or bedtime.

, Your baby is due for their first checkup when their first tooth grows in, or before their first birthday at the latest. Remember that children are not simply small versions of adults, so don’t assume you can take your baby to your own dentist. Make an appointment with a pediatric dentist.You can find a local pediatric dentist using the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry’s website. http://www.aapd.org/finddentist/

Apply a few drops of clove oil to the tooth.,
Apply a mix of powdered ginger and cayenne pepper to the aching tooth.,
Rinse your mouth with salt water.",How to Numb a Tooth2," Clove oil kills bacteria, and will remove some of the bacteria infecting a cavity. Clove oil will also numb the area it’s applied to, as the oil contains the chemical eugenol, which functions as a local anesthetic.Drip the clove oil directly on the aching tooth and gums. Alternately, place several drops on a clean cotton cloth, and apply the cloth to the aching tooth and gums.
Clove oil can be purchased at your local pharmacy or drugstore.

, Combine the powdered ginger and cayenne in a bowl at a 1:1 ratio, add a couple of drops of water, and stir into a paste. Saturate a cotton ball (or a corner of a clean cotton cloth) in the paste, and then apply directly to your aching tooth.This mixture will have a similar effect to the clove oil and will numb the pain from your toothache.


Both powdered ginger and cayenne pepper can be purchased in the spice section of your local grocery store.
Do not use fresh or raw ginger, as the mixture needs to be powdered.
Make sure to apply this mixture directly to the tooth to calm down the nerve pain. If you get cayenne pepper on your gums or tongue, it will cause a burning sensation on the sensitive tissue.

, Salt will cleanse the inside of your mouth and can kill some of the bacteria infecting your tooth, and can also provide temporary numbness and pain relief. Warm a glass of tap water, and add a teaspoon of salt, then stir to dissolve the mixture.Once the salt has dissolved, swish the salt water in your mouth for 30–60 seconds. If the pain is not sufficiently numbed after the first rinse, repeat as often as needed. You may find that cold or warm water works better for you, so use the temperature that works for you.


Make sure to spit the salt water into the sink. Ingesting excessive salt can be unhealthy.

Place a piece of already-chewed gum over a broken tooth.",How to Numb a Tooth3," This works best if you do not apply ice directly to the tooth, so place 3–4 cubes in a plastic bag, wrap a clean cotton cloth around the bag, and then apply directly to your aching tooth. The ice should be held in place for at least 15 minutes, and will provide temporary relief for the pain.Repeat as often as necessary.


If your aching tooth is near the front of your mouth, you should be able to apply the ice directly to the base of the tooth. If the tooth is nearer the back of your mouth, you’ll need to press the ice against your cheek in the area closest to the painful tooth.

, While you don’t need to have made a cup of tea with this teabag, it should be wet before you apply it to the tooth. Use black tea, as it contains astringent tannins, which will decrease both pain and swelling around your infected tooth.To wet the tea bag, dip it in a glass of warm water for about 5 seconds.
Hold the tea bag inside your mouth for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the pain begins to numb. Just don’t use too much pressure, such as by biting on the teabag.

, While this remedy will not numb the tooth or decrease the pain from toothache, it can prevent a broken tooth—or a tooth with a loosened or missing filling—from fracturing further. Chew the gum on the side of your mouth away from the aching tooth, and then gently press the gum over the broken tooth.If possible, use sugar-free gum. The sugar in regular gum could work its way into the broken tooth and accelerate the decay, whereas sugar-free gum will not harm the tooth.
Avoid eating with the broken tooth, as this can be very painful, and will also further harm the tooth.

Provide your child with a children’s brush and fluoride toothpaste.,
Help your child to brush and floss.,
Wean off pacifiers and thumb sucking by age 3.,
Schedule regular visits to the dentist.",How to Protect Your Child's Teeth2," Give your child an age-appropriate brush, which will be indicated by the product’s label. Using a brush with their favorite cartoon character, color, or other fun design will help encourage them to brush. Children’s toothpaste is great for younger toddlers who have difficulty spitting, but they aren’t all that effective.Fluoride-free children’s toothpastes are great while your child is just starting out brushing their teeth on their own, generally around 2 to 3 years of age.
Fluoride toothpastes are necessary after your child has mastered spitting out excess toothpaste, generally around age 3.

, Assist your toddler with their tooth care while they’re just starting to learn. They should be capable of brushing on their own sometime between the ages of 3 and 6. You might need to offer help flossing even if they’ve mastered brushing.Kids typically master brushing before flossing. Continue to floss your child’s teeth for them as long as they require assistance in order to ensure it continues to be part of their hygiene routine after they’ve started brushing on their own.
Take your child’s hand and exercise the correct movements in the mirror until they start doing the movements properly. Reward your child with a toy or give them a surprise for motivation.

, Pacifiers and thumb sucking is typically harmless, as kids will stop the habits on their own by their toddler years. However, if either continue past age 3, they can cause tooth decay and increase the need for braces later in life.Sippy cups also fall into this category. Filling sippy cups with sugary drinks increases the risk for tooth decay, so monitor sippy cup use and try to fill them with water when your child drinks from them.

, The most common checkup schedule is every 6 months. However, work with your doctor to determine the best exam routine for your child. Every set of teeth is different, and some that are more prone to decay require more frequent professional care.Try to make going to the dentist as fun an activity as possible. Tell your child that the dentist has to count their teeth, or take pictures of them. Help them to understand the situation in their terms and try keep it from being scary.Turning dental visits into an annual habit is going to have a huge impact on your child as an adult who will be more likely to find regular visits natural and relaxing. Prevention is less expensive and invasive.
Make it exciting for them, and make going to the dentist something to be proud of. Tell your child that it’s a sign that they’re growing up.

Teach proper techniques.,
Reinforce the importance of dental care from an early age.,
Provide them with a tooth-friendly diet.,
Protect teeth during sporting events.,
Consult with your child’s dentist about applying sealants.",How to Protect Your Child's Teeth3," Make sure your own brushing technique is on point so you can instill in your kids. Brush for at least two minutes, at least twice a day. Use a soft-bristle brush to prevent abrasion, and use circular motions. Floss once a day using floss without wax., Whether your child responds to incentives or warnings, find the right carrot and stick combination that’ll motivate them to brush. Conveying to them as early as possible how important it is to take care of teeth will help them keep up with hygiene as they mature.Remember there are limits to how fun of an activity you can make it out to be. In the end, you might have to simply be strict about tooth care and make them brush and floss.

, Keep sugary foods to a minimum and teach your child to rinse or brush after they have eaten any sugary foods. Try to cut out the juice boxes, too: keep juice intake to a maximum 4 ounces a day.One cup of juice, two cups of milk, and three cups of water, or 1-2-3, is the best guide for kid’s beverages.


Swap candy for healthy snacks like fruits and veggies.
Don’t peel apples and other fruit. The peel is full of nutrients, and helps to scrub teeth.

, If they’re involved in a contact sport, have your child use a soft, plastic mouth guard during practice and games. A mouth guard will protect teeth, gums, lips, and cheeks from injury. You can find one at a local convenience or drugstore, or have your pediatric dentist develop a custom-fitted guard., It’s increasingly common for dentists to apply a sealant to school-age children’s back molars. Sealants work by filling the crevices of back teeth where food particles can get stuck. The application process is fast and easy, and can protect teeth for many years if your child has a regular dental check-up at least once a year."

Talk to your doctor.,
Buy a pre-measured kit.,
Have one prepared to order by your pharmacist.",How to Make Magic Mouthwash1," Radiation and chemotherapy treatments for cancer often cause a side effect called oral mucositis. This is a painful and sometimes debilitating side effect, which causes soreness, swelling, and sensitivity in the mouth, sores on the mouth, gums, or tongue, and difficulty swallowing or talking. It can make it hard or even impossible to eat.Ask your doctor whether a magic mouthwash could help to relieve some of your discomfort. If she agrees, she will write you a prescription.;
, Your doctor may write you a prescription for a pre-measured kit of magic mouthwash, which you will need to have filled at a pharmacy. First Mouthwash BLM or First BXM Mouthwash are two commonly stocked compounding kits. They contain a pain killer, usually “viscous lidocaine”; an anti-acid or coating agent like Maalox (this will coat the lining of your mouth); and an anti-inflammatory agent like Benadryl.The idea of the mixture is to provide pain relief (anesthetic) while killing bacteria, soothing the mouth, and coating its lining with an antacid. Some formulas also contain Nystatin, a drug that kills fungus and is used to treat conditions like oral thrush.You pharmacist will take the kit and mix it for you. Note that these formulas are not FDA approved.

, Another option is for your pharmacist to prepare you a made-to-order magic mouthwash. There are many recipes with different names, including “Duke’s Magic Mouthwash,” “Radiotherapy Mixture,” “Miracle Mouthwash,” and others. However, all follow the basic recipe: ingredients that will relieve pain, relieve inflammation, and coat your mouth."

Use a straw when drinking beverages that cause stains.,
Quit smoking.,
Rinse with water after eating or drinking.,
Eat crunchy fruits and vegetables.,
Brush well.,
Soak your dentures in water overnight.,
Ask about ultrasonic cleaning.",How to Prevent Stains on Dentures1," When drinking something that will stain your dentures – coffee, tea, carbonated drinks, fruit juices, and, when blended into beverages, fruits like berries – remember to use a straw. Drinking through a straw allows the beverage to bypass your teeth, and you’ll avoid stains, especially at the front.;
, Tobacco can stain your dentures, so quit smoking if you can. Otherwise, try, at least, to limit the number of cigarettes you smoke.

, After meals, and especially if you have coffee, tea, wine, or something else that will stain, rinse your dentures thoroughly under running water.


If you can’t get to a place to rinse your dentures well, having a drink of water will help remove any colorants.

, Foods like berries, tomatoes, soy sauce, and balsamic vinegar will stain your dentures, but you can mitigate the damage by eating crunchy fruits and vegetables, like apples and celery. These foods will naturally cleanse your dentures.

, You should brush your dentures at least twice daily, just as you would brush your teeth. Make sure that your brush reaches every part of the dentures, but don’t push down too hard: you don’t want to break them.


Consider buying a special toothbrush made for dentures.
Use a toothbrush with soft bristles. Hard ones can scratch your dentures, reducing their sheen.

, When you go to bed, remove your dentures and leave them to soak in a glass of water, or fill your denture container with water and soak them there. Soaking will loosen any plaque and food debris that could cause stains.


Do not put your dentures in hot water – this could warp the shape of your dentures or cause them to shrink.
Do not soak your dentures overnight in anything but plain water. Prolonged exposure to soaps and detergents will harm them.

, When you go to the dentist, ask if ultrasonic cleaning might work for you. Your dentist can use this technique to cleanse your dentures with sound waves. It sounds strange, but ultrasonic cleaning is one of the most effective means of eliminating stains and preventing deposits from forming.

Get a prescription for 2% Viscous Lidocaine.,
Buy Diphenhydramine and liquid antacid.,
Mix ingredients in a 1:1:1 ratio.",How to Make Magic Mouthwash2," Lidocaine is a common treatment for mouth sores caused by cancer therapies. Many doctors will write you a prescription for this fairly readily, as it is not a controlled substance and has few negative side effects in adults.Ask for a 100 mL vial. Viscous lidocaine is also fairly cheap and covered by most insurance plans.


Get your prescription filled by a pharmacist. Lidocaine will reduce the feeling in your mouth, possibly making it difficult to chew, so avoid eating for at least one hour after using the drug.
Lidocaine may not be safe for children under age 3, so make sure to keep the contain tightly closed and stored where children cannot access it., The common brand name for the first medication is Benadryl. You can find this easily at drug stores and it is often available in a generic or store brand. Make sure that you are purchasing the liquid (children’s) kind. One bottle of at least 100mL will be enough.Get a bottle of liquid antacid, as well, like Mylanta or Maalox. Again, you’ll be able to find these at any drug store, usually in a generic or store brand. A bottle of 100mL is again enough.You’ll see that these ingredients are fairly cheap. A vial of lidocaine will cost you about $20 and may or may not be covered by insurance.Children’s Benadryl and Maalox will cost about $10 each.

, Viscous lidocaine usually comes in a 100mL bottle. It is easier to use the entire bottle in a batch, since the medication is thick and difficult to measure. Mix 100mL of each of the other two ingredients with the lidocaine.


For the last two ingredients, measure using a sterile medical measuring cup or, if you have purchased the proper amount in a bottle, use the entire bottle. Never measure medicines with household utensils. They are not always standard size and could give you the wrong dosage.Now, shake the solution until it appears uniform. Once you’ve done this, the mouthwash is ready to use.
Be sure to follow your doctor’s advice on dosage. Since this medication is used to treat a wide variety of conditions, your physician will give your instructions based on the specific treatment you are seeking. Usually doctors recommend that you use it once every four to six hours, for two minutes at a time."

Purchase a denture cleaning product.,
Follow the manufacturer’s instructions.,
Rinse well.",How to Prevent Stains on Dentures2," If stains form on your dentures, you can purchase a denture cleanser from a drugstore or supermarket. These cleansers are available in cream, gel, and liquid formulas, and they work for full and partial dentures.


Look for a product approved by the American Dental Association, as these cleansers are proven to be safe and effective.

, In general, gels and creams are brushed onto the dentures, then rinsed; for liquids, you’ll often drop a tablet into water or another solution, which will fizz and remove stains.

, Whatever product you choose, be sure to rinse your dentures with plain tap water before patting them dry and putting them back in your mouth.

, Leave your dentures soaking in the mixture of baking soda and water for 20 minutes.

, After soaking, rinse your dentures with plain tap water. Don’t scrub them with anything abrasive.

, Use a towel or other cloth to gently dry your dentures.

, You can use this method to clean your dentures regularly, but don’t do it too frequently. Baking soda itself is somewhat abrasive, and it can scratch the surface of your dentures. Limit yourself to once weekly.

Mix vinegar and water.,
Soak your dentures in the solution for eight hours, or overnight.,
Brush your dentures.,
Rinse.,
Pat dry.,
Repeat as desired.",How to Prevent Stains on Dentures4," Because it contains acetic acid, vinegar also works to remove some stains. Start by mixing one part distilled white vinegar to one part water in a bowl large enough to fit your dentures.

, Allowing at least eight hours to pass will give the acetic acid time to dissolve all tartar.


If you don’t have eight hours, you can try a shorter soak. Even half an hour will dissolve some tartar.

, Remove your dentures from the solution and, using a soft-bristled toothbrush, brush them as you usually would. Don’t scrub them with anything too abrasive.

, After brushing, rinse your dentures with plain tap water.

, Use a towel or other cloth to gently dry your dentures.

, Some people soak their dentures in vinegar and water as frequently as every night.

Brush and floss.,
Drink water.,
Eat an apple.,
Chew sugarless whitening gum.,
Rinse with peroxide.",How to Get Whiter Teeth Fast1," Brushing and flossing immediately lifts stains that have recently been left on your teeth. Use a whitening toothpaste and brush well, focusing on the front of your teeth to remove the most obvious stains and film.;
, Flooding your mouth with water as often as possible helps wash away bits of food, sugars, and other debris that builds up on your teeth throughout the day and causes them to look dull by the end of it. If you need a quick brightener, get a big glass of water and swish it around in your mouth before each swallow.

, When you bite into an apple it actually brightens your teeth by lifting off the film that can make them look dingy. Use your front teeth to bite into the apple, sinking them in all the way up to your gums. This is a good technique to use if you're out during the day and need a quick way to brighten your smile.


This technique works best with the freshest, firmest apple you can find. Use a tart apple instead of soft, sugary one.
Celery and pears can also help whiten teeth. They cause your mouth to produce a lot of saliva, which washes away stains and film., Buy a pack from the drugstore and chew a few pieces during the day. The gum will remove bits of food from your teeth and temporarily brighten them up.

, Measure a few tablespoons of hydrogen peroxide into a cup, pour it into your mouth, and swish for one minute. Spit it out into the sink and rinse your mouth with clean water.


As an alternative, dip a cotton ball in peroxide and rub it on your teeth, making sure they get completely coated. Let it sit for about a minute, then rinse your mouth out with water.
Do not swallow the peroxide. It's safe to use peroxide on your teeth, but swallowing it could make you sick.This technique should not be used often, as it may degrade your teeth over time. Use it when you need a quick whitening fix, but turn to more sustainable techniques in the long term.

Use a soft-bristled toothbrush that fits your mouth.,
Use a fluoride toothpaste.,
Use a non-fluoride mouthwash prior to brushing.,
Brush your teeth twice a day.,
Hold the brush at a 45 degree angle to the gums.,
Brush with short, gentle strokes.,
Turn the brush to a vertical position to brush the exterior and inner tooth surfaces.,
Brush the top surface of each of your teeth.,
Brush your tongue.,
Rinse the toothpaste out of your mouth using a small amount of water.",How to Improve Your Oral Hygiene1," If you have a hard time reaching your brush into the back corners of your mouth, or if the brush is too large to fit behind your teeth to clean their backs, you should consider purchasing a new one. Make sure that the brush has soft bristles, which fit more easily into the gaps between teeth and will cause less irritation of the gums.If your brush's bristles have ""flattened out"" during use, you should buy a new one. Bent bristles will not clean between your teeth, allowing plaque to build up over time. They can also scratch your gums, making them susceptible to bacteria buildup and infection.
Flattened out bristles may indicate that you are pressing down too hard as you brush.
Toothbrushes should be replaced routinely every three to four months.
Brush at least twice a day, once before having breakfast in the morning and once after dinner at night, to avoid acid buildup due to breakdown of food by bacteria.;
, Fluoride is a nutrient which strengthens teeth, slowing and reversing tooth decay. Choosing a toothpaste with fluoride will ensure that you get the most out of each tooth brushing.If you live in the United States, look for toothpastes marked ADA Accepted. These toothpastes have been evaluated by the American Dental Association, and they all contain fluoride.

, While many people use mouthwash after brushing, this should be avoided, as it has been shown to remove the valuable fluoride which remains on your teeth after brushing. Using mouthwash before brushing will ensure that you retain fluoride on your teeth, and the mouthwash will ""loosen up"" any plaque or food particles on your teeth, making it easier to remove them with a toothbrush.Alternatively, you can use a mouthwash containing fluoride after brushing or wait a few hours and then use a regular mouthwash that doesn't contain fluoride.

, Teeth accumulate food particles and plaque (a sticky, bacteria-carrying substance) throughout the day. Regular brushing prevents accumulation of these substances, reducing bad breath and tooth decay.Brushing after a meal is a good idea, but refrain from brushing immediately after eating an acidic food, or drinking an acidic drink, such as coffee or fruit juice. Acidic foods temporarily weaken your teeth's enamel, allowing your toothbrush to remove it during brushing. In time this will cause your teeth to become sensitive.

, While it is common to hold the brush parallel with the gums, this should be avoided, as it can make it more difficult for your brush to penetrate the gaps between your teeth. A straight angle may also prevent you from covering the whole surface of each tooth as you brush. , Brushing with too much force can irritate your gums, and will prevent the tips of your brush's bristles from penetrating the gaps between your teeth. Use a back-and-forth motion, and focus on two teeth at a time until you have brushed the outer surface of each of your teeth., Using a gentle up-and-down motion, clean the back sides of each of your teeth. You will not be able to hold the brush vertical when brushing the inside of your back teeth, but try to maintain the same up-and-down motion.


The back and forth movement is used only to loosen any food particles left on your teeth, while the vertical brushing helps your gums stay attached to your teeth.

, The chewing surfaces of the teeth can often accumulate food that has been chewed throughout the day. Use the same gentle, side-to-side motion you used for the front surfaces., The tongue can harbor small food particles, plaque, and odor-causing bacteria. Use gentle strokes to brush the entire top surface of your tongue, being careful not to stick the brush too far back into your throat, which can cause gagging., Using too much water can rinse the fluoride off of your teeth, reducing the benefits of using a fluoride toothpaste. Instead of gargling a mouthful of water, simply sip a small amount to create a toothpaste slurry in your mouth. Swish this slurry around your mouth for one minute, then spit it out.Avoid rinsing more than once after brushing, as the best results are obtained from a single rinse.
While swallowing fluoride toothpaste in very large quantities can be hazardous to adults, swallowing a little now and then poses no risk to your health.

Use baking soda directly on your teeth.,
Make a paste of baking soda and hydrogen peroxide.,
Mix baking soda and lemon juice.,
Make a paste of baking soda and vinegar.",How to Make Teeth Whitener1," Baking soda is a mild abrasive that can scrub plaque and surface stains off of your teeth. You can apply it to your teeth as a whitener in a number of ways:


Dip a dampened toothbrush directly into powdered baking soda.Brush your teeth as you normally would, spit out the baking soda, and rinse your mouth with water.
Make a paste of baking soda and water.Put some baking soda in a small container that you can close (to store the paste). Slowly stir water a few drops at a time into the baking soda until a smooth paste forms. Apply to your toothbrush, then brush and rinse your teeth as normal.
Baking soda might irritate the tissues of your mouth. If you notice any inflammation or soreness, use this treatment less frequently.;
, Baking soda combined with hydrogen peroxide makes a very effective teeth whitener.This treatment, however, should not be used frequently. Hydrogen peroxide can irritate the tissues of your mouth, and prolonged use may cause serious problems.To make this whitener:


Pour a teaspoon of baking soda into a bowl or small dish.
Stir five to seven drops of hydrogen peroxide into the baking soda until a smooth paste forms.
You can also add a drop of peppermint extract to improve the flavor of the mixture.Apply to your toothbrush, then brush and rinse your teeth as normal.
Be sure to spit out all of the peroxide—do not swallow it. Rinse your mouth well afterwards.

, Since the citric acid found in lemon juice is a natural bleaching agent, it can make a great whitening agent.You can make a paste by combining the two ingredients, and use it infrequently as a whitener.


Pour a teaspoon of baking soda into a bowl or small dish.
Stir lemon juice a few drops at a time into the baking soda until a smooth paste is formed.
Apply the paste to your teeth (using a finger is fine) and let it sit for two to three minutes.
Rinse your teeth with water afterwards.
Use this treatment no more than once a week, as citric acid can also damage the enamel of your teeth, and irritate the tissues of your mouth.

, Vinegar is acidic, like lemon, and so it can help to whiten your teeth, especially when combined with baking soda. A mixture of the two can be used as a paste to brush your teeth clean.Pour a teaspoon of baking soda into a bowl or small dish.
Stir vinegar a few drops at a time into the baking soda until a smooth paste is formed.
Dip a dampened toothbrush in the paste and brush as normal.
Rinse your mouth with water afterwards.

Use teeth whitening strips, gels or rinses.,
Use a tray whitening system.,
Have your teeth professionally whitened.",How to Get Whiter Teeth Fast2," Available for purchase at drugstores, these whitening products contain small amounts of peroxide to whiten your teeth. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for apply the strips or gels to your teeth. Rinses are used the same way you would use mouthwash. It usually take several applications before you see results.


Whitening strips and gels are not recommended for people with gum disease and other dental problems. Talk to your dentist before using these products if you're concerned.Whitening strips and gels are best for people with a yellow tone to their teeth, and don't necessarily help remove darker stains., Tray whitening systems, also available at drugstores or from a dentist, use a slightly more aggressive approach to whitening teeth. A concentrated peroxide solution is poured into teeth trays, which look like plastic retainers, and the trays are worn over the teeth for several hours.Tray whitening systems may also be used overnight. Depending on how white you want your teeth to be, you can continue using tray whitening systems every day for several weeks.
Dentists may provide an at-home tray whitening kit. In some cases, the trays may be custom-made for your teeth using a mold so that they fit your teeth better than ""one size fits all"" trays.

, Many dentists offer whitening treatments that are very effective for removing dark stains. This is the most expensive technique, but it is also the quickest and offers the most dramatic results.


Lasers or heat are applied to the bleaching solution to make it work more quickly.
Depending on the level of staining, repeated dentist visits may be necessary, but each session lasts only about 30 minutes.

Stop smoking.,
Drink less coffee, tea and other dark drinks.,
Eat fewer sweets.,
Go easy on your enamel.",How to Get Whiter Teeth Fast3," Tobacco is one of the main culprits that causes teeth to become yellow or stained.The smoke fills the mouth and chemicals stick to the teeth. Try using a patch or an electric cigarette to avoid staining your teeth with smoke.

, Coffee and tea both have ingredients that lead to stained teeth. If you drink them every single morning, they're bound to eventually leave their mark. Try cutting back to a single serving or removing them from your diet entirely.


When you do drink coffee or tea, brush your teeth afterward to remove the residue.
If you don't have a toothbrush or sink handy every time you drink coffee or tea, drink a glass of water afterward to rinse out your mouth.
Rinse your mouth after drinking fruit juice, wine, and other alcoholic beverages as well..

, Eating a lot of sugar is tough on your teeth and gums since it leads to the buildup of plaque and eventually cavities and gum disease. All these factors can make teeth look more yellow, so avoid eating candy and drinking soft drinks as often as possible. When you do eat sweets, brush your teeth or rinse your mouth out with water immediately afterward., As we age, our the enamel on our teeth begins to erode; since the layer underneath isn't as bright, our teeth end up looking yellow in hue. Once the enamel is gone, it's difficult to get that youthful brightness back. Whitening your teeth too often can cause them to look bluish, so you can't rely on that as a backup forever.Prevent enamel erosion in the following ways:


Limit acidic foods, such as sour candy.
Treat acid reflux promptly.Don't drink too much alcohol or practice other behaviors that lead to excessive vomiting."

Choose a wide, waxed floss.,
Floss after brushing at least once per day.,
Break off 18 inches of floss.,
Gently rub the floss between your teeth until it reaches the gums.,
Notice any pain or bleeding.",How to Improve Your Oral Hygiene2," So-called ""ribbon"" or ""tape"" flosses cover a wider surface area than narrower thread flosses, allowing you to remove more material with each stroke. You should use waxed floss instead of non-waxed, since waxed floss slides more easily between teeth, and is less likely to shred or break during flossing., While the bristles of your toothbrush will remove some of the food and plaque from between your teeth, only floss can remove the deepest materials. Food materials and plaque left between the teeth for long periods of time can accelerate tooth decay, and lead to the buildup of tartar, a hard substance which is much more difficult to remove. Tartar also causes bad breath and gum recession. Daily flossing is as important to good oral hygiene as brushing., Wrap about 1/3 of this length around each of your middle fingers, leaving around 6 inches of floss between them. This will ensure a tight grip on the floss, allowing you to control it more easily. , Don't use sharp, snapping motions, which can cause irritation and hurt your gums. Once the floss is between your teeth, curve it around one tooth into a C shape, gently moving it into the space between the gum and the tooth. Finally, using gentle motions, move the floss back away from the gum, holding the floss tightly against the side of the tooth. Repeat this motion for each of your teeth, and make sure to clean the rear side of your back teeth.Make sure to throw away all used floss. Recycling the same length of floss can re-introduce bacteria to your teeth which you have previously cleaned off.

, A little irritation or blood is normal, especially if you haven't been flossing regularly. The pain and bleeding should cease after a few days. If they do not, this may be a sign of gingivitis, a gum disease. Talk to your doctor about treatments for gingivitis, but continue brushing and flossing daily. "

Use baking soda to whiten teeth at home.,
Use a whitening product.,
Avoid problem foods.,
Brush and floss teeth daily.,
Rinse your mouth after consuming staining food.,
Avoid smoking.,
Visit your dentist regularly.",How to Improve Your Oral Hygiene3," Baking soda functions as a natural bleaching and cleaning agent, which can help remove staining on your teeth. Start with 1/4 tsp of baking soda, mixing it with just enough water to form a paste (or mix with your regular toothpaste). Once a week, use baking soda paste to brush the surfaces of your teeth. After a few weeks, you should notice that your teeth have become whiter, and that stains have been reduced. You can use lemon juice, hydrogen peroxide solution, or white vinegar instead of water to make the baking soda paste. These liquids will enhance the cleaning and whitening power of the paste, but can also be unpleasant to taste. Use them with care and stop if there is any type of teeth sensitivity

, Many over-the-counter options are available. Whitening toothpastes and mouth rinses contain bleaching agents which will help loosen and remove staining substances from your teeth during brushing. Make sure to follow all instructions on the product's package, and expect to wait a few weeks before you notice any results.At-home tooth bleaching kits are also available. These kits use a bleaching agent such as carbamide peroxide to change the natural color of your teeth, making them whiter while removing food-related stains. These kits can be a hassle to use, adding time to your everyday oral health routine, but they are the strongest over-the-counter product available for whitening teeth and reducing stains.

, Acidic food and drink, and food and drink with strong colors, can stain teeth, especially if consumed regularly. If you're concerned about staining your teeth, you should avoid consuming food or drink which would cause a stain to a white cotton garment, as they will likely also stain teeth over time. When you do consume these things, you should do your best to keep them off your teeth as much as possible. Using a straw for staining beverages is a great way of doing this.Strongly-colored sauces, such as pasta or curry sauce, as well as brightly colored fruits such as many berries, are examples of foods which can lead to stained teeth if consumed too frequently.
Dark, acidic drinks such as coffee, tea, wine, fruit juice, or sports drinks can all cause tooth stains over time. Because they are liquids, they can seep into the spaces between teeth and cause even more staining than solid foods.

, Tooth stains are caused when food or drink penetrate the surface of your teeth and are allowed to stay there. Brushing and flossing regularly are essential for your overall oral health and hygiene, and are the first steps in preventing food matter from remaining on your teeth long enough to cause staining.


Brushing immediately following a meal is a good idea, but don't brush right away after eating an acidic food, or drinking an acidic drink, such as coffee or fruit juice. Acidic foods temporarily weaken your teeth's enamel and your toothbrush may remove it during brushing.

, It is difficult to avoid strongly colored food and drink, and indeed you may not wish to, since brightly colored fruits and vegetables can have health benefits. If and when you do consume such foods, simply rinse your mouth out with water immediately afterwards. This will help remove any staining food matter from your teeth before they can set in.Eating celery, an apple, pear or carrot after a meal will trigger the production of saliva in your mouth, helping to naturally wash away potentially staining food from your teeth. Chewing sugarless gum is another good option.

, Smoking tobacco can be extremely problematic for your health for many reasons, and can also lead to tooth stains. The tar in tobacco smoke can easily get into any grooves or holes in the surface of your teeth, leading to long-lasting, difficult to remove staining., Your dentist will be able to recommend and explain products and practices to fit your specific needs. Having your teeth regularly cleaned by dental professionals will also help remove any deep-set food particles which your daily brushing and flossing regime might fail to remove. For severe or hard-to-remove staining, your dentist may recommend professional teeth whitening."

Use an antiseptic mouthwash.,
Drink water.,
Beware of pungent foods.,
Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables.,
Avoid tobacco.,
Ask your dentist for help.",How to Improve Your Oral Hygiene4," Smelly breath can have many causes, but is often caused by bacteria that can grow in the mouth when food particles are allowed to remain too long. Plaque, the sticky substance which forms on your teeth between cleaning, is a byproduct of these bacteria and with any remaining food particles. Taking care of your teeth by brushing at least twice daily and flossing at least once, is essential for preventing bacteria from growing. , Food particles and the bacteria that feed on them can often become trapped in the narrow gaps between teeth. Swishing an antibacterial mouthwash allows you to clean these harder to reach areas, potentially reducing bad breath. Many varieties are available, but be sure to pick a variety labeled ""antiseptic"" or ""antibacterial."" These mouthwashes will help kill bacteria in your mouth which may be causing bad breath. Be sure to follow any instructions on the label.When gargling mouthwash, make sure to swish it all around your mouth, over your teeth and into both cheeks. Then tilt your head back, and briefly gargle the mouthwash in the back of your mouth before spitting out.
Some mouthwashes contain a high percentage of alcohol. If alcohol irritates your mouth, you should instead opt for an alcohol-free mouthwash.

, When you are dehydrated, your glands produce less saliva. When your mouth is dry, dead cells, food particles and other debris can accumulate, encouraging the growth of bacteria which can cause bad breath. Remaining hydrated will help ensure that your glands produce enough saliva to keep your mouth moist.For an adult in normal health, drinking eight 8-oz. cups (1.9 liters) of water per day is recommended.
Eating an apple or raw celery, chewing on sugar-free gum, or sucking on sugar-free candy will stimulate the salivary glands and encourage a cleaner, more moistened mouth.

, Not all bad breath is caused by the presence of bacteria. When you eat strong-smelling food, such as garlic or raw onions, some of the chemicals responsible for the food's smell can be released into your lungs as a part of the natural digestion process. Coffee and alcohol can also lead to bad breath when consumed, since they tend to encourage dry mouth and can coat your tongue., Raw fruits and vegetables are naturally abrasive, helping to remove plaque and debris from your teeth as you chew. Fruits and vegetables which contain a lot of vitamin C, such as oranges, broccoli, and bell peppers, can also help reduce the presence of bacteria in the mouth., The pungent chemicals in tobacco can leave a displeasing odor in the mouth. Smoking and chewing tobacco have also been linked with oral cancer, as well as many other illnesses affecting many different parts of the body. Quitting tobacco is difficult, but comes with a host of health benefits, including a cleaner, and less smelly, mouth.Ask your dentist or doctor for ideas and suggestions on quitting smoking.

, If regular oral hygiene practices have proven ineffective, be sure to mention your issues with bad breath to your dentist on your next visit. Your dentist will help you determine if the odor is being generated in your mouth, or if it is due to some other factor. It may be helpful for you to make a log of what foods you have eaten in the week prior to your visit, as this can help your dentist determine if the odor is due to problems with your diet.

Eat crunchy fruits and vegetables.,
Eat more dairy products.,
Use sage to scrub your teeth.,
Make a strawberry paste.,
Use fresh lemon.",How to Make Teeth Whitener2," Apples, celery, and carrots are crunchy, and eating them can help scrub surface stains off of your teeth.In addition, they may kill bacteria and improve your breath.

, These products (milk, cheese, yogurt, etc.) contain lactic acid, which might help protect your teeth.Some of them can also help whiten your teeth and/or prevent some stains:


Hard cheeses can scrub some surface stains from your teeth, and block some stain-causers such as wine or coffee from discoloring your teeth, if you eat some prior to drinking.
Eating dairy products is good for your teeth, but don’t consume too much of sugary foods such as ice cream, as these can contribute to tooth decay.

, Sage has an antiseptic effect, and for this reason is even found in some mouthwashes and gargles. It can also help to whiten your teeth.Simply rub fresh sage leaves on your teeth., Strawberries contain an enzyme called malic acid that may help to whiten your teeth.You can simply rub a sliced strawberry on your teeth, or mash fresh strawberries into a paste and rub it on your teeth. Leave it on your teeth for five minutes, and then rinse with water. Brush and floss your teeth as normal afterwards.


You can add half a teaspoon of baking soda to the paste, if desired.Research shows that a strawberry paste will only remove surface debris.If you want more intensive whitening, seek other treatments.

, Natural bleaching agents found in lemon can help whiten your teeth; however, the citric acid found lemons can also wear away your tooth enamel, so you should not overuse this method.Simply take a slice of lemon peel and rub it on your teeth.

Start with baking soda.,
Include some sea salt.,
Add peppermint to taste.,
Mix the ingredients with filtered water.",How to Make Baking Soda Toothpaste1," Acidity in the foods we eat is the main culprit in damaging our teeth. Baking soda is one of the best defenses because it helps to neutralize acids, encouraging healthy bacteria and protecting your teeth’s enamel. Further, it is also much less abrasive than many commercially available toothpastes, while still capable of providing enough abrasion to clean your teeth., Baking soda stimulates saliva and minerals, which helps the natural process of remineralization. This creates a stronger cohesion with the enamel.
To make a roughly 5 oz batch of baking soda-based toothpaste — about the size of a standard toothpaste tube — start with 2/3 cup of baking soda in a medium-sized bowl.;
, Though it may sound like an unpleasant component of toothpaste, sea salt provides minerals that can help your teeth remineralize and rebuild. Go with fine sea salt. Add 1 tsp directly to the baking soda.Enamel is the only protection that coats the surface of our teeth and acts like a shield against bacteria, temperature, or abrasive factors. As an organic tissue, enamel is constantly suffering from trauma of all types. Minerals are the only ""ingredients"" that can help a fast recovery of the enamel's surface.

, You can use either peppermint extract or peppermint essential oil to improve the toothpaste’s effectiveness and flavor. Other essential oils, such a spearmint, will also help you combat plaque and gingivitis when featured in a consistent brushing and flossing routine.If opting for extract, add 1 or 2 tsp.
If using essential oil, add 10 to 15 drops.
You can pretty much use as much flavoring as you like. Add the flavoring little by little and taste your toothpaste along the way to find your ideal amount of flavor.
Keep in mind that you are not supposed to swallow toothpaste.
If you're making a batch of toothpaste that will be used by children under ten, do not include essentials oils., The amount of water you use is up to you. Shoot for a consistency that’s comfortable for you to use.Don’t worry about it being too thick, as the drier it is, the longer it will last. If it begins to dry out too much, you can always add more filtered water.


Start by mixing in about 1/2 a cup of water.
If the paste is too thin, add a bit more baking soda until you reach the desired consistency.
If the paste is too thick, add a bit more filtered water.

You can also add a third toothbrushing in the middle of the day if you like.Brushing your teeth properly will help prevent tooth and gum disease and can help remove food stains, leaving you with a healthier, cleaner, whiter smile.


The acid in certain foods, such as sodas or some types of fruit, can weaken your teeth's enamel temporarily. Wait at least 30 minutes after eating these foods before brushing your teeth. Otherwise the brushing may have an unhealthy effect on your teeth, weakening your enamel and leading to damage and wear.;
, Brushing has to be done methodically and carefully, for at least two to three minutes each time. Do not skimp on your brushing.If you have a hard time brushing for the right amount of time, play one of your favorite songs that lasts two to three minutes. Use this as a guide to make sure you are brushing for long enough.Angle the toothbrush toward where your tooth meets the gum, at about a 45 degree angle, in order to get the best result.Brush the inside, outside, and chewing surface of each tooth. Make sure you brush your tongue and the back teeth as well as your front teeth.Clean the surface using rotational movements (clockwise and counter-clockwise motions) and avoid back-and-forth movements.

, Toothpaste with fluoride is the most effective way to clean your teeth.There are other toothpaste options, but a fluoridated toothpaste will prevent cavities more effectively than non-fluoridated toothpastes.

, Old toothbrushes become less effective at cleaning your teeth. Be sure that you buy new, fresh toothbrushes every three months or so.Replace your toothbrush when you notice the bristles bending or fraying, or after a tooth extraction or oral surgery.You should also replace your toothbrush after illness to prevent the spread of disease.Keep your toothbrush cool and dry to make sure that it doesn't breed harmful bacteria or mold.Store your toothbrush upright so that it can be exposed to the air and dry properly., Soft bristles are the best way to clean teeth without damaging them.Scraping too hard against the teeth can hurt or scratch the enamel: be gentle with your teeth.Use a soft touch and a soft brush to keep your teeth as clean, healthy, and strong as possible.


An electric toothbrush can also help you to brush effectively and can reduce tooth and gum disease.Even better, invest in a sonic toothbrush. This type of electric toothbrush vibrates at a high speed, which allows fluids (saliva, water, toothpaste) to reach places where the bristles cannot.

, Flossing helps to remove plaque and bacteria that your toothbrush might miss. Flossing requires using a special waxed thread to clean tight spaces in between your teeth that a toothbrush cannot reach. You can floss before or after brushing: both methods work well.Use at least 18 inches (46 centimeters) of floss each time. Be sure that you are using fresh, clean floss on each tooth.Floss gently in between every tooth. Do not skip any teeth, even if they are hard to reach (such as your back teeth). Make sure you gently scrape the floss against the gumline to remove plaque and buildup.Special flossing tools can be purchased to help those who have trouble getting a good angle., If you would like to provide your teeth and mouth with extra protection, you can use an over-the-counter mouthwash. Make sure the mouthwash has fluoride.Most people do better with an alcohol-free mouthwash. Rinse your mouth with the mouthwash for 30–60 seconds using a swishing motion. Then spit out the mouthwash into the sink: never swallow mouthwash.


If you find it hard to remove plaque from your teeth, try using a chlorhexidine mouthwash for two weeks, then take two weeks off. This can increase antibacterial protection and prevent brown chlorhexidine stains from forming.

, Some people have a particularly difficult time getting their teeth cleaned. If you have trouble brushing and flossing effectively, you can buy a special tooth irrigator to assist you, such as a water pick. These tools spray water in a directed way into your mouth, removing harmful food particles and keeping your mouth clean and healthy., Make sure your mouth is healthy before undertaking an at-home whitening regime.Your dentist will be able to tell you whether your teeth are discolored because of disease or other underlying causes. Your dentist should also be able to recommend safe, effective products that will not irritate your mouth.


Women who are pregnant or nursing should not use whitening products., Over-the-counter whitening products are all designed to place bleaching agents on the teeth for several minutes at a time in order to lift stains. Use products with a low concentration of peroxide to get a whitening effect without causing irritation.Look for products that have been approved by your national dental association to ensure their safety. Whitening products take several forms including:


Strips. These strips adhere to your teeth, allowing your teeth to be exposed to whitening agents.Paint-on products. By brushing the whitening product on your teeth before bed, you can lift stains overnight.Gel trays. You fill a tray molded to your teeth with the whitening gel. You bite the gel tray and hold it in your mouth for the recommended amount of time in order to expose your teeth to the bleaching agent.You can also purchase an accelerator light, which uses LED lights to activate the gel and enhance the whitening process.

, Each whitening product works slightly differently. Some have to be removed after just a few minutes. Others can be left overnight. Read instructions on the package carefully to make sure that you receive the maximum benefit without causing harm to your teeth or mouth. It is essential that you do not leave products on for longer than the recommended time.Avoid acidic foods and drinks after use. These can hurt the effectiveness of the whitening product as well as irritate your sensitive teeth.Repeat whitening treatments as necessary. Don't whiten your teeth too often: simply provide touch-ups as needed every six months or so., Whitening toothpastes are a gentler, slower way to whiten teeth. They will not work as quickly or effectively as other whitening methods, though they can be a great way to preserve your desired shade of teeth once you've achieved it in other ways.Whitening toothpastes do not have bleaching agents, but rather use polishing and other chemical reactions in order to remove surface stains.Look for a whitening toothpaste that has been approved by the American Dental Association or other professional dental group in order to ensure that the product is safe and effective., Some studies show that toothpastes with baking soda might be more effective at cleaning teeth than other toothpastes.Baking soda has also long been used as a natural tooth-whitening agent; however, baking soda can also irritate your delicate skin around your mouth. A toothpaste with baking soda should have concentrations low enough that you will receive some benefit from the baking soda without experiencing irritation.

, There isn't solid data about the usefulness or safety of natural tooth-whitening treatments; however, some individuals report positive effects from their use.Be wary when using these treatments, and it is a good idea to talk to your dentist first. These natural treatments include the following:


Applying mashed strawberries to your teeth. Strawberries have an enzyme, malic acid, that supposedly brightens teeth. Mash fresh strawberries and apply them to your teeth. Let them sit for five minutes and then rinse.Using lemon juice and baking soda. Shake a small amount of baking soda onto a thick fresh lemon wedge. Bite into this wedge and let it sit for a few minutes, until the fizzing subsides.Note that strawberries and lemons both contain citric acid, which can cause your teeth to become weaker and predisposed to developing sensitivity. Use natural tooth whitening treatments with caution, and be suspicious of their claims., In order to take care of your mouth, see your dentist every six months. Your dentist will be able to give you advice about how to care for your teeth and will let you know if she sees any developing tooth problems. Moreover, your dentist and hygienist will give you a deep cleaning and air polishing of your teeth. A professional deep cleaning will help remove surface stains from your teeth as well as unsightly plaque: even without bleaching treatments, your smile will likely be brighter after a visit to a dentist.


You might need to see your dentist more often than twice a year if you experience bleeding gums, tooth pain, or tooth discoloration. If these symptoms occur, make an earlier dental appointment to nip tooth decay in the bud.

, Professional tooth-whitening treatments often work more quickly than at-home care; however, these treatments can be pricey and are not often covered by dental insurance. Most professional whitening treatments involve a higher concentration of a bleaching agent along with lasers or other lights to aid the whitening process.Because you will undertake these treatments in a dental office, your gums will be protected from the harsh chemicals used on your teeth.Be aware that some studies show that at-home treatments can be just as effective as professional treatments, though they do take longer to cause a positive benefit., Most developed nations have licensing systems to ensure that practicing dentists and other dental professionals are safe and responsible. Only see a fully licensed dental professional who has been trained in a certified dental program. Do not go to a salon or kiosk for tooth-whitening treatments: these might be less expensive but also carry risks., Food particles on your teeth help to lead to tooth decay and staining. For this reason, you want to minimize the amount of time that your teeth are exposed to foods.Try to avoid snacking in between meals in order to maximize the amount of time that your teeth are totally clean and particle-free.

, Sugar is one of the most harmful substances for teeth, and it can hurt your mouth's health and appearance.Try to avoid products with added sugars to minimize tooth decay and staining. This includes table sugar as well as other sugars including: molasses, honey, maple syrup, corn syrup, and brown sugar. Your teeth and body will thank you.


Be aware of ""fermentable carbohydrates,"" which begin to break down and turn to sugar in your mouth instead of further down your digestive tract, which can be very damaging to your teeth. Fermentable carbohydrates include crackers, bread, bananas and breakfast cereals as well as the more obvious things like cookies, cakes, and candy., Beverages sweetened with sugar are particularly bad for teeth. Sipping sugary drinks exposes your teeth to harmful substances for long periods of time, hastening tooth decay.Even healthy-sounding beverages like sports drinks are chock full of sugar.Find unsweetened alternatives to sugary beverages. Plain tap water (which is treated with fluoride in most U.S. cities) is the healthiest beverage option for your mouth health and the best option for your teeth's appearance.Beware of drinks like:


Sweetened teas and coffees
Soda
Cocktails and other alcoholic beverages
Energy drinks
Sports drinks
Fruit juices

, Coffee and tea can cause unsightly yellow stains;however, coffee and tea are not too bad for your mouth health as long as you drink them without sweeteners. Still, if you want your smile to remain bright and white, try to keep your consumption of tooth-staining drinks to a minimum.

, Fresh foods with a lot of fiber and water, such as fruits and vegetables, provide your body with essential nutrients for keeping your teeth strong. They also help naturally clean and brighten your teeth.Apples, carrots, and celery can all help remove food particles from your teeth while nourishing your mouth health.


Limit citrus fruits, but don't cut them out completely. They contain citric acid, which can damage tooth enamel, but they also help create a slightly alkaline pH environment in your mouth (the bacteria that cause tooth decay thrive in acidic environment). Try to eat citrus foods as part of a larger meal instead of on their own., Sticky foods remain on your teeth longer, leading to additional staining and decay.Stay away from sticky, chewy foods like raisins, chewy granola bars, candy bars, and caramel. Try to find healthy, natural alternatives instead; however, if you absolutely must eat sticky foods, be sure that you rinse your mouth with water soon afterwards: this can minimize the damage they can cause.

, Low-fat dairy foods (such as yogurt and hard cheeses) and nuts help clean teeth naturally.The proteins and calcium in dairy can help strengthen teeth as well.Instead of reaching for a candy bar, try some plain yogurt and a handful of almonds instead.

, Plaque development is the worst overnight, when your saliva flow is reduced. Refrain from eating or drinking anything (other than water) in the hours before bedtime.Not eating before bedtime can also reduce the likelihood of acid reflux, which hurts your tooth enamel.

, Tobacco products can stain teeth and lead to mouth diseases, including mouth cancers.Cigarettes, cigars, and chewing tobacco are all harmful to your smile. Quit them if at all possible, or at least cut down considerably in order to have clean, white teeth.


Try sugar-free gums as an alternative to cigarettes. Gums without sugar can help clean and brighten your mouth.

Be sure to brush the full surface area of your teeth accessible with your toothbrush; this includes the cheek side, the tongue side, and the chewing surface of your teeth. Angle the toothbrush 45 degrees where your teeth meet your gums, and gently massage the toothbrush over this area to ensure it is cleaned as well. Do not press too hard here as it can be damaging. Brush your teeth for two minutes.;
, This helps to clear away plaque and bacteria, and to keep your teeth clean and shiny. Flossing should be done at least once a day.


Flossing cleans an additional 33% of tooth surface area that cannot be reached with a toothbrush alone. Flossing also removes plaque before it hardens into tartar, which keeps your teeth looking cleaner and healthier. For optimum flossing, take a piece of floss about 12 inches long and wrap it around your index finger on each hand, leaving at least 2 inches in between. Slide it between each of your teeth, being sure to go from the top of the tooth all the way to the base. Repeat two to three times to ensure plaque is removed.

, This can help to keep your mouth and teeth clean. Some mouthwashes have additional ""whitening"" properties, but it depends on which brand you buy - read the product label for more information.

, This is critical in maintaining good oral hygiene, and your dentist can provide you with additional information and suggestions specific to you.

, In general, they whiten teeth only at the superficial level; however, some contain stronger chemicals that can induce whitening in the deeper layers of the tooth. These toothpastes can lighten the color of your teeth by about one shade. In contrast, some prescription whitening techniques (ask your dentist about options that may apply to you) can lighten your teeth by about three to eight shades.

, These can help to freshen your breath as well as to improve the color of your teeth. However, since a rinse is in contact with your teeth for only a brief period of time, it may be less effective than whitening strips and gels, which are discussed below. , These are substances that contain hydrogen peroxide, which has a chemical effect on whitening the teeth. Generally they are used for about 30 minutes at a time (instructions vary depending on the brand and method chosen) about twice a day for a couple of weeks. The final results should last for a few months. These are some of the most effective over-the-counter methods for whitening your teeth. ,


Procedures done ""in-office"" with your dentist are definitely more costly, but also more effective.
The strength of the hydrogen peroxide solution is notably higher in the dentist's office (and therefore more effective).
The tools used to apply the solutions can be specifically designed to optimally suit your mouth and teeth shape. They will be tailored to maximize the surface area on your teeth that receives the whitening treatment, while minimizing potential damage from whitening treatments to other areas of your mouth.
Your dentist will also be able to use his or her expertise to provide additional oral health suggestions specifically for you. , While you may be trying to avoid a costly trip to the dentist, you may end up spending more in the long run — and causing yourself a considerable amount of pain — if you try something that damages your teeth or gums. Even just a call to your dentist's office to verify the safety of your chosen at-home method is a good idea.

Whitening your teeth at home without a consultation with your dentist is risky and could damage your teeth or mouth.

, Put some toothpaste on a toothbrush and then sprinkle some baking soda on it. Brush your teeth with this. Baking soda helps to remove the stains from the enamel, which is the outermost layer of the tooth. Do this step regularly, and you'll be on your way to having those Pearly Whites for the rest of your life! , Mix baking soda and hydrogen peroxide to form a sort of ""toothpaste."" Brush your teeth with this paste, but not too often.


Use 3% hydrogen peroxide in your mixture. Hydrogen peroxide is the active ingredient in many over-the-counter teeth-whitening remedies. It functions by the process of ""oxidation,"" which is a chemical reaction that helps to whiten teeth.

, There is a substance called ""lauric acid"" found in coconut oil; this can help to prevent bacteria-induced discoloration of the teeth. It may sound unpleasant, but the taste is actually not too bad when you try it! "

Use an airtight container for storage.,
Brush your teeth correctly.,
Floss every day.,
Opt for a soft-bristled toothbrush.,
Go with just baking soda and water.",How to Make Baking Soda Toothpaste2," Once you’ve achieved the desired consistently, store the paste in a glass or plastic receptacle that you’re able to close. A glass jar with a screw-on lid are ideal, especially if you included essential oils in your batch.Keep your toothpaste away from excessive heat or direct sunlight.

, Next time you want to brush, simply wet your toothbrush, slather on as much of your baking soda toothpaste as you wish, and brush as you normally do. A dollop the size of a miniature M&M is likely plenty, though it doesn’t hurt to use more.Hold your toothbrush at a 45-degree angle to your gums.
Brush gently, in short, back and forth strokes. Gently brush your gums as well.
Get the outside, inside, and all chewing surfaces of every tooth.
Use up and down strokes to get the inside of your upper front teeth. Try to do at least 10 per surface.

Brush your tongue too! This will remove bacteria from your mouth that causes bad breath.
Be sure to brush at least twice a day.

, Don’t just brush: floss once a day as well. It doesn’t matter whether you brush or floss first, just make sure you’re removing all of the plaque that’s gathered on your teeth since your last brush. You can use plaque-disclosing tablets to check your teeth-cleaning abilities. These are available at pharmacies, and should be used if your doctor has mentioned that you need to do a better job brushing., Firmer bristles risk removing the enamel that protects your teeth. Rinse your toothbrush immediately after using, and store it upright and uncovered. Replace your brush every three to four months, or whenever the bristles become noticeably disfigured., In a pinch, you can also simply blend baking soda and filtered water to the consistency you desire and call it good. You’re still getting the alkaline and odor-fighting components of baking soda with the added comforts of an undeniable simplicity. This approach, however, will give you a toothpaste that only lasts about a week."

Add some coconut oil.,
Consider other healthy supplements.,
Crush up some cacao nibs.,
Polish with bentonite clay.,
Test the pH of your toothpaste.",How to Make Baking Soda Toothpaste3," Many personalized recipes for baking soda toothpaste call for a bit of coconut oil as well. Coconut oil is a worthy addition because it can help fight certain infections of the mouth. Further, it will improve texture, and has the added benefit of helping to boost your digestive health.It has also a slight whitening effect, is a good pH-neutralizer, and is an effective antibacterial substance.
Do not replace flossing and brushing with coconut oil mouth rinsing. Though some recommend the practice, coconut oil alone is insufficient to keep your mouth clean and healthy.

, If you drink primarily water that is purified via reverse osmosis, trace mineral drops can provide some of the beneficial minerals that you may not be getting in the water you drink. Consider adding a dash or two of xylitol to sweeten your toothpaste, as well as boost the anti-cavity properties of the paste as well., You’re likely familiar with the common toothpaste flavors: various sorts of mint, an aggressive grape, maybe a variation of tutti-frutti; however, arguably the best re-mineralizing compound around is cacao — which works even better than fluoride, without the dangers.If you’re tempted to add cacao to your toothpaste, talk to your dentist about the degree to which you should grind the nibs, as this will affect their abrasiveness.

, Like baking soda, bentonite clay is alkaline, so it helps fight the acidity that destroys your teeth. Clay has the additional capacity to serve as a natural polishing agent without being too abrasive. The bacterial balance in your mouth that clay promotes also helps you fight illness and boosts remineralization of your teeth.Simply add a small amount of bentonite clay to your toothpaste.

, You want to ensure that none of the ingredients you add to a homemade batch of toothpaste are acidic. In fact, it’s likely a good idea to get some pH test strips to test for acidity.Make sure all readings have a pH of seven or higher.


If you toothpaste has a pH lower than seven, dispose to the batch and make a new one, perhaps removing any ingredients that may have contributed to the acidity.

Apply a moderate amount of paste.",How to Get the Most from a Tube of Toothpaste1," Start using a tube by pressing the far end, and working your way toward the cap. Flatten the tube as you go, to extract every last bit of toothpaste.;
, A roller is an inexpensive metal or plastic device that slips onto the end of the tube to assist with rolling. Also called a “winder,” “key,” or “wringer,” this will squeeze out the last little bit of paste.


If you like gadgets, a wall-mounted dispenser delivers a small blob of paste with the touch of a button.
Rollers and dispensers are very helpful if you suffer from arthritis of the hands.

, If you're at the very end of a tube and can't get any more out, try cutting it open with a pair of scissors. You'll usually get one or two additional uses out of a tube this way.

, Moistening your toothbrush first lets you get the same cleaning effects with less paste. If you put toothpaste on a dry brush, running water may wash the paste off into the sink. It might also help the toothpaste taste a little better.

, That thick, caterpillar-sized serving you see in toothpaste ads is three or four times the amount you really need to brush effectively. Apply a small amount to the brush, about the size of a pea. If it foams up and feels like it's doing its job, that's probably enough paste.


Don't skimp too much. Any toothpaste is cheaper than getting a cavity filled, so don't skimp too much on paste. Most dentists recommend using a pea-sized amount."

Make your own remineralizing toothpaste.,
Create a homemade remineralizing tooth powder.,
Rinse with green tea a few times each day.,
Try oil pulling.,
Apply lemon juice to the teeth.",How to Get Rid of White Spots on Teeth1," Reintroducing nutrients like calcium into your teeth may help strengthen them. One way to get rid of white spots and other signs of damage on your teeth is to make a remineralizing toothpaste that is rich in calcium and other basic elements. Ingredients like baking soda will also act as abrasive elements to scuff off the white spots and normalize the pH balance in your mouth. To make remineralizing toothpaste:Combine 5 tablespoons (74 mL) of calcium powder, 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of baking soda, and 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of food-grade diatomaceous earth in a small bowl. You can also add 3 tablespoons (44 mL) of xylitol powder to help keep the paste from tasting too bitter.
Add enough coconut oil to the powdered ingredients to form a paste-like consistency. This is typically about 3 – 5 tablespoons (44 – 74 mL) of coconut oil.
If desired, you can also add one or two drops of food-safe essential oil for taste. Popular options include mint, lemon, and cinnamon.
Store the paste in a sealed jar, and brush your teeth with it two to three times daily.;
, If you prefer to use tooth powders to brush your teeth instead of toothpaste, you can create a homemade remineralizing powder using bentonite clay, which has the ability to draw out heavy metals and toxins from your teeth and mouth and restore the pH balance of your mouth. The clay is rich in minerals like calcium, magnesium, and silica, which help get rid of white spots on your teeth. To make remineralizing tooth powder at home:Combine 4 tablespoons (60 mL) of bentonite clay, 3 tablespoons (44 mL) of calcium powder, 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of cinnamon powder, 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of clove powder, 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of xylitol powder, and 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of baking soda in a small bowl.
If desired, you can also add 2 teaspoons (10 mL) of mint leaf powder or a few drops of peppermint or cinnamon food-safe essential oil to improve the flavor of the tooth powder.
Store the powder in a sealed jar, and apply to the teeth with your finger or a toothbrush two to three times daily.

, Green tea is a natural ingredient found in a number of homeopathic remedies, and it also has properties that can help get rid of white spots on your teeth. Green tea is a mineral- and vitamin-rich food source that may help remineralize teeth. Green tea also contains antibacterial catechins, which may prevent the buildup of plaque. Green tea is also a natural source of fluoride. To use green tea:Soak one tea bag of green tea leaves in 1 – 2 cups (0.2 – 0.5 L) of warm water, keeping the leaves submerged for about five minutes before removing the bag.
Let the tea cool till it tolerably warm, but not too hot. When it has cooled, take a swig of tea and swirl it all around your mouth for 30 seconds to one minute. Repeat until all of the tea is gone.
Repeat this process about two to four times daily.
Keep in mind, however, that green tea can stain your teeth gray if you drink too much of it, so use this method sparingly.

, Oil pulling is an ancient remedy that uses essential oils to remove toxins and bacteria from the mouth. Oil pulling can also whiten the teeth, prevent dry mouth, and restore the mineral content in teeth. Regular oil pulling may help get rid of white spots on the teeth as well as strengthen your teeth and gums. Oil pulling is best if done first thing in the morning after waking up, but you can also do it again at night for speedier results.Take roughly 1 – 2 tablespoons (15 – 30 mL) of organic coconut oil or sesame oil into your mouth.
Swish the oil around your entire mouth for about one to two minutes to start. As you get more accustomed to oil pulling, gradually increase this time to about 20 minutes if you can.
After pulling the oil for your set amount of time, spit it out and rinse your mouth with warm water.
Follow up oil pulling by brushing your teeth with a remineralizing toothpaste or tooth powder.
Remember that oil pulling does not replace brushing your teeth. You can either do this before or after brushing your teeth.

, Some ingredients in over-the-counter products can cause damage to teeth and result in more white spots. This is because these products contain bleach and other chemicals that resurface and recolor the enamel on your teeth, which weakens the enamel in the process. Since white spots are already an indication of weakened tooth enamel, trying to get rid of white spots by inflicting more damage on the teeth is counterproductive.


Try dipping a cotton swab into freshly squeezed lemon juice and applying it to the teeth. Freshly squeezed lemon juice is a natural form of bleach, so this is a safe way to naturally whiten the teeth and help the white spots to blend in.Even so, make sure you stop if you feel any sort of pain or tooth sensitivity.
The process will take longer but the results can be promising

Have your teeth professionally bleached.,
Ask about air abrasion techniques.,
Consider chemical microabrasion.,
Have your spots treated with the Resin Infiltration System.,
Undergo topical remineralization therapy.",How to Get Rid of White Spots on Teeth2," A dentist can look at the white spots on your teeth and determine if bleaching may help and whether this procedure is safe based on the current state of your enamel. Your dentist will also be able to seal the enamel with fluoride and other enamel treatments once the whitening process is finished. This will help to strengthen your teeth., Another common way dentists remove white spots from the teeth is by gently scuffing the spots from the teeth with an abrasive material, usually baking soda. This is best for white spots that are small, as too much abrasion on the teeth will wear away a thin layer of enamel.The procedure uses a special device that blows crystal particles directly at the calcium deposit. The abrasive particles gently lift away the calcium deposit. The spot is then fixed with filling to cover the calcium deposit and seal the enamel.

, Like air abrasion, the goal of chemical microabrasion is to remove the white spot by gently removing the calcium deposit causing the discoloration. This is appropriate for small- to medium-sized white spots only, because applying the abrasive chemicals to larger areas will only damage the tooth further.During the procedure, the dentist applies a special acid that eats away the calcium deposit on the tooth. The acid is only applied directly on top of the discolored spots to avoid extensive enamel damage. Then, the dentist will drill in the spots post-etching to seal the enamel of the teeth and protect it from further damage.

, During this procedure, the dentist will use a special resin gel to open the pores of the tooth where the white spots are located. After the resin has penetrated and treated all of the levels of the discolored teeth, the dentist will cure the resin with a special light. After about 15 – 20 minutes, the white spots should blend with the remaining tooth enamel. This procedure also blocks enamel-eating acid from penetrating the tooth and helps preserve the tooth from additional decay and future cracks in the enamel structure., These treatments are similar to homemade remineralization remedies, except that they contain prescription only ingredient levels. These treatments work faster than home remedies by using prescription pastes and gums to reintroduce high levels of minerals to treat the microscopic holes creating the white spots.These products contain high levels of fluoride that help treat the white spots, and they can also help prevent future cavities and spots from forming.
Some products options include casein phosphopeptides (CPP) and amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) powders, gums, and pastes.

Practice good oral hygiene.,
Avoid foods and drinks that damage your teeth.,
Eat mineral-rich foods to remineralize teeth.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Avoid tobacco products and caffeine.",How to Get Rid of White Spots on Teeth3," Because white spots are also an indication of enamel damage and early stages of tooth decay or can also be produced by fluoride ingestion at an early age (childhood fluorosis), preventing these spots from forming is almost always preventable with regular brushing and flossing.Improving your dental hygiene habits will reduce the likelihood of getting white spots in the future. Some tips to help you have great oral hygiene habits include:


Always brush your teeth after waking up, after eating, and before going to bed.
Check the fluoride content of your toothpaste. You need enough fluoride to reduce acid and balance out your mouth's pH levels, but you don’t want to have so much fluoride that it is damaging. Try to aim for amounts of fluoride between 1,000 and 1,500 ppm unless your dentist says otherwise.
Floss every night. If you have difficulty using standard floss, try using a pre-threaded flosser, instead.
Visit the dentist every six months. Good care at home can prevent most problems, but a dentist can diagnose early signs of plaque buildup and other related issues.

, Certain foods can damage tooth enamel and make the mouth acidic and dry, allowing more bacteria to grow as a result. This can damage the enamel on your teeth and allow harmful bacteria to infiltrate the pores of your teeth, leeching nutrients and minerals from the teeth and causing white spots. Some tips to reduce your intake of these products include:Avoid sugary drinks, especially carbonated drinks like soda. Also be wary of candy and products that contain artificial sweeteners.
If you need to sweeten something, opt for natural alternatives like honey or maple syrup, and use as little as possible.
If you do consume anything that is high in sugar or carbohydrates, be sure to rinse your mouth with water immediately, then brush after about 30 minutes.

, In addition to remineralizing your teeth with home remedies or in-office professional treatments, another great way to prevent white spots is to eat foods that are heavy in teeth strengthening minerals.


By consuming vitamin D- and calcium-rich foods like milk, cheese, and yogurt, your teeth and body will absorb nutrients that help make your teeth strong and prevent white spots.
Also look for foods that are high in magnesium, like dark leafy greens, nuts, seeds, fish, soybeans, and avocado, because magnesium helps the body absorb and retain more calcium., Staying hydrated helps your body perform at its best and it may also help prevent white spots. When your mouth is dry, the lack of saliva throws off the pH balance in your mouth and allows bacteria to grow and attack your teeth with their acid.


Try to drink at least eight 8-oz (250-mL) glasses of water daily. Avoid hydrating with liquids like fruit juice, soda, or other beverages. If you do drink one of these damaging liquids, be sure to rinse your mouth with water or brush your teeth afterward.Add a few drops of lemon juice which can help promote saliva flow.

, Two of the most damaging substances you can introduce to your mouth are tobacco and caffeine. Caffeine is extremely acidic and damages the enamel on your teeth, allowing bacteria to enter the pores of your teeth and cause white spots and other decay. Smoking and chewing tobacco increase plaque and tartar build-up on your teeth, which can cause more damaged areas and white spot formation.Tobacco and caffeine will also stain your teeth, and any white spots you currently have will only appear more pronounced against the yellowing enamel.

This is part of the reason that coffee, tea, wine, and soda can all stain your teeth.Also make sure to wait at least thirty minutes before brushing your teeth after eating or drinking something acidic.Fruits that are especially harsh on teeth include lemons and citrus. You shouldn't keep these in your mouth for too long. Fruit juice can also wreak havoc on your teeth.Pickles, vinegar, and some salad dressings are also highly acidic.;
, Chromogens are substances that have a lot of concentrated pigment and easily stick to the enamel. In other words, they are likely to stain your teeth.Both coffee and red wine contain chromogens, and it’s part of the reason they are so good at staining your teeth.Other things that contain chromogens include berries, dark sodas, and artificially colored candies and treats, like popsicles.One way to think about it is this: if a food stains your tongue, it can stain your teeth., Black tea has tannins and can be worse for your teeth than coffee. Red wine also has tannins, making it a triple-threat in terms of teeth staining. Tannins work by making chromogens more effective at staining teeth.Lots of foods have tannins such as chocolate and some fruit juices, but red wine and black tea are some of the most effective at staining teeth., Not only do tobacco products stain teeth, they can lead to gum disease and even oral cancer.Chewing tobacco is even worse for teeth and gums than cigarettes. It's also sugary and highly acidic, which can contribute tooth staining and tooth loss."

The peppermint leaves help keep your breath fresh throughout the day. Since coconut oil is gentle and non-abrasive, it can be used daily and is safe for people with sensitive teeth and gums., Instead of using toothpaste, dip your toothbrush into a sea salt mixture for 3–5 minutes, made by dissolving ½ teaspoon of salt in 1 fluid oz. of water, and brush your teeth with it. The salt temporarily increases the pH balance of your mouth, turning it into an alkaline environment in which germs and bacteria cannot survive. A salt water mouth rinse after meals can also help keep your mouth and throat clean while soothing and healing mouth sores., Neem twigs and miswak sticks are used in many cultures to clean teeth. After chewing the bark off the end, you can separate fibrous bristles in the pulp of the wood, which can be used to brush the teeth as normal. The act of chewing and sucking on the twigs likewise helps to clean the mouth."

Ask questions.,
Stop grinding your teeth.,
Schedule regular appointments.,
See a specialist.",How to Get Stronger Teeth2," You should see your dentist regularly, so it's important to choose someone with whom you feel comfortable. Try asking friends or family if they have a dentist they like. You can also ask your primary care physician or pharmacist for a recommendation.Choose a dentist whose office is convenient to your home or place of work. If it is easy to get to the office, you'll be more likely to keep appointments.
Make sure the office accepts your insurance plan. If you don't have dental coverage, ask the office staff if they offer payment plans.
Ask for an initial consultation. This will give you a chance to see if you feel comfortable in the office and with the doctor.

, When you are visiting your dentist, make sure that you are prepared to get all necessary information. You might find it helpful to jot down a list of questions to ask. Your dentist should be willing to take the time to thoroughly answer all of your questions.


Ask her if your mouth looks healthy. This is a good general question that should give you a good overview of your oral health.
Ask if there are any issues that you need to talk to your primary care physician about.
If your dentist recommends a procedure, don't be afraid to ask if it is necessary or optional.

, Clenching or grinding your teeth can seriously weaken them. Grinding can cause chips and cracks in your teeth. Stress often causes people to clench. Many times, you grind in your sleep without even knowing it. The only symptom may be a headache in the morning and pain in the masseter muscles.


If you grind or clench, your dentist will be able to tell. If this is happening while you sleep, talk to your dentist about the possibility of wearing a mouthguard while you sleep.
If you grind or clench while awake, be mindful of the issue. Consciously think about keeping your teeth from rubbing together. Your top teeth should not be touching your bottom teeth unless you are chewing food.

, It is recommended that most people visit the dentist twice a year. This is so your dentist has an opportunity to treat any recurring issues.

Nicotine can stain and weaken teeth.
Ask your doctor to recommend a smoking cessation program that is right for you.

, Tooth loss is a problem for many older adults. It is connected to osteoporosis, which causes loss of bone density. You can take several steps to combat the weakening of your teeth and bones.Maintain a healthy body weight.

, Try adding some new elements to your routine. For example, start chewing gum after meals. This will increase the saliva in your mouth and help prevent buildup of acids. Just make sure the gum is sugar-free.


Drink your beverages through a straw. A straw helps your drink bypass your teeth, thereby keeping acid from them.

, You can use an irrigator, or a small plastic syringe, to rinse the areas around your wisdom teeth. Employ this instrument after meals and at bedtime if you like to help effectively clean out any lingering debris that could infect your teeth.You can use the simple saline solution to fill the irrigator. If the water pressure is too strong and your gum bleeds, increase the distance between the tip and tooth and do rotational movements for about 30 seconds
Place the tip of the irrigator close to your partially erupted wisdom teeth.

, Drink plenty of water throughout the day to keep your mouth moist. This can help minimize bacteria production and the risk for infection., Part of maintaining oral health is seeing your dentist every six months. If you are experiencing the eruption of your wisdom teeth, you may want to see your dentist more frequently to help ensure the health of your mouth.

, You may experience pain with partially erupted wisdom teeth. Use either an over-the-counter pain reliever or a prescription pain medication from your doctor to help relieve pain and possibly even swelling.Ibuprofen or acetaminophen may minimize or remove any pain you have. Ibuprofen may also help reduce swelling associated with swollen gums.

Rinse your mouth with water immediately after eating.,
Use a water pick to pressure wash your teeth.,
Try oil pulling.,
Experiment with oil pulling.",How to Clean Your Teeth Naturally2," Removing any leftover food or residue from your teeth will help prevent stain and decay. This is an especially good idea if you're away from home and can't squeeze in a good tooth-brushing. Drinking water throughout the day and rinsing with clean water after meals is the most underrated method of overall oral health.Always avoid brushing right after very acidic foods, which can weaken your enamel. Instead, rinse with water.

, A water pick helps blast stuck-on food from the surface and between the crevices of the teeth and gums. It's an excellent and healthy way to cleanse the mouth after meals., Oil pulling is an Ayurvedic remedy in which you swish oil in your mouth to remove harmful germs and bacteria from your mouth. Vegetable oil contains lipids that absorb toxins and pull them out of saliva, as well as stopping cavity-inducing bacteria from sticking to the walls of your teeth.Take a spoonful of oil and swish it in your mouth for one minute to gain the benefits. If you can, try to swish the oil longer for 15-20 minutes. To make sure the oil absorbs and detoxifies as much bacteria as possible, aim to do this with an empty stomach.
Spit it out and wash your mouth nicely, preferably with lukewarm water.
Buy organic, cold-pressed oil. Sesame oil and olive oil can work, however coconut oil is the most popular, because of its taste and natural antioxidants and vitamins, such as Vitamin E., Oil pulling is an Ayurvedic medicine technique for detoxifying your mouth and cleaning your teeth and gums with oil.

Brush with baking soda.,
Make a vegan toothpaste.,
Use a diluted soap.",How to Clean Your Teeth Naturally3," Baking soda help whiten teeth and promote overall oral health. Take a teaspoon of baking soda and mix it in 2 teaspoons of water to make your own toothpaste, which you can brush with a few times per week. Make a new mixture for every use. Baking soda can also be used as a mouth rinse after meals by dissolving 1 teaspoon of baking soda in a cup of water and swishing it in your mouth for 2–3 minutes.Add a drop of peppermint extract and a half teaspoon of sea salt for added taste.When you are done adding the ingredients, just plop a pea-sized amount onto a tooth brush and brush away.

, Many toothpastes uses glycerin, which can be derived as a byproduct of animals. Unless its vegetable or synthetic glycerin, these toothpastes won’t be vegan. To make a vegan toothpaste, simply mix four tablespoons of baking soda, eight tablespoons of water, two teaspoons of vegetable glycerin, a half teaspoon of guar gum for a thicker toothpaste, and five drops of peppermint extract together.


Put your concoction in a small pot and cook on a stove at a low temperature. Stir for about five minutes or until it achieves a paste-like consistency., Soap made from natural ingredients and oils, like Dr. Bronner's popular brand, is a great alternative to commercial toothpaste. Dissolve about a teaspoon of soap in water and dip your toothbrush in the mixture. Peppermint-scented soap is preferable, for most people, but tea-tree, almond, rose, and other flavors might appeal to your own tastes.


In some places, tooth soaps are available, which are manufactured to be specifically palatable forms of soap, made without fluoride or other ingredients people have questions about."

Choose a thick floss when you have large gaps.,
Pick a smaller floss for smaller spaces.,
Choose waxed or unwaxed.,
Decide on flavored or unflavored.,
Choose between materials.,
Look for the American Dental Association (ADA) seal.,
Use floss picks for easier access.,
Try electric flossers for more removal.,
Look at water flossers.,
Consider wood plaque removers.",How to Choose Dental Floss," If you have large spaces between your teeth, pick an extra thick floss. Some options include dental tape or super dental floss. Choosing a thicker floss will help ensure that you are actually flossing all the surfaces of your teeth and makes flossing easier.You'll know you have gaps if a normal dental floss slides in very easily, and you see ample space around it.
The most likely reason for gaps is you've had teeth removed or you had a large amount of tartar (calculus) that was removed by your dentist after scaling and cleaning. Or you could just naturally have larger spaces between your teeth. You may also need it if you've had bridge work.;
, If your teeth are more tightly pushed together, you may need a thinner floss. That is, you don't want to pick one that says ""tape"" or ""super"" dental floss. Those flosses will be too thick to fit between your teeth., You can really use either of these on your teeth, depending on your preference; however, the waxed kind can make it easier to floss if your teeth are packed more tightly together, so you may want to reach for waxed if that's the case with your teeth.The kind you choose won't make a difference to how your teeth are flossed, as long as you are flossing.One benefit of unwaxed floss is that it makes squeaking noises against clean teeth, so it helps you know when your teeth are clean.It's important to use waxed if you have braces, as unwaxed is more easily tangled in your teeth., Whether your floss is flavored is really up to you. It doesn't make a difference to how the floss works, and it doesn't add sugar or calories. Flavoring can make it more enjoyable to floss, though, which may encourage you to floss more often., Floss generally comes in two types: multifilament and single filament. The multifilament floss is usually made of nylon, while the single filament is usually made of rubber or plastic. Once again, it really comes down to your preference.The nylon version is more common, and it's what's mostly used in generic flosses; therefore, it's cheaper.
If you have fillings that are not properly adapted between your teeth or if there are small pieces of tartar, the multifilament floss will come out worn off, even after a single use. This can be a good sign that you need to see your dentist.
The single filament version hasn't been around as long, so it's more expensive; however, some people feel like it glides more easily. Also, it's stronger than the nylon version, so if you have problems with floss ripping, it's a better bet.

, When picking out a floss, check to make sure you see the ADA seal on it. That means that the American Dental Association has reviewed the product and determined it is effective and safe. In addition, it means the claims that the product makes have also been reviewed for truthfulness., Some people have trouble flossing the teeth in the back of their mouth. Floss picks stretch a piece of floss between two small plastic arms attached to a stick. This can make it easier to floss, as you only need a single hand to hold the floss.Floss picks may not work quite as well as regular floss because they limit the angles you at which you can floss. On the other hand, they can make it easier to floss further back in your mouth where it is harder to reach holding the floss with both hands, especially if you have a small mouth opening.

, In some ways, an electric flosser is much like a pick, in that it has a short piece of floss suspended between two small arms; however, an electric flosser has the added benefit of vibration, so it can help remove plaque more thoroughly, as well as massage your gums.Make sure the handle is long enough so you can reach teeth in the back.
Also, look for a smaller head, as that will make it easier to get into hard-to-reach places., If you are opposed to the idea of floss altogether, you should look into water flossers. As their name implies, these flossers use a blast of water to help clean plaque off your teeth and between your teeth. Because they use water, you don't need to mess around with getting the floss between your teeth.Water flossers are highly recommended in patients that have dental implants, braces, crowns or bridges.

, Another type of plaque remover is a wooden plaque remover. In some ways, this product is similar to a toothpick, but it's designed for removing plaque. After softening it in your mouth, you insert the stick with the flat side to your gums and gently move it in and out. This product works best for people who have wide gaps between their teeth."

Use products that contain fluoride to remineralize the teeth.,
Chew a pack of sugar-free gum.,
Give your teeth a break between whitening treatments.,
Visit your dentist if the sensitivity persists.",How to Cope with Teeth Whitening Sensitivity," At least 10 days before your treatment, start brushing three times a day with a desensitizing toothpaste. Sensodyne and Colgate Sensitive are two good options. These toothpastes help to block pain signals from the tooth surface to the inner nerve.Look for GC Tooth Mousse, which has an active ingredient called CPP ACP that works very well to remineralize enamel.
Use a soft-bristled toothbrush to rub the toothpaste into the teeth in a circular motion (not back and forth). Ideally, you should brush your teeth for three minutes each session.
Fluoride and desensitizing agents work even better if you do not rinse your mouth right away. Leave the toothpaste to act on your teeth for another three minutes before rinsing.;
, Wipe your teeth so that they are dry. Then get a clean cotton swab. Place a large dot of the product on the tip of the swab and rub it onto the surface of your teeth. Leave the product on your teeth for the recommended length of time before rinsing your mouth out with water.These products usually contain potassium nitrate, which numbs the nerves in the teeth, limiting sensitivity. Two good products include AcquaSeal and Ultra EZ which can be purchased at the drugstore. You can also use them both before and after your whitening treatment.

, About 30 minutes before your treatment, fill the tray with a desensitizing gel and place it on your teeth. When you are ready to begin your treatment simply take out the tray, rinse it out, and refill it with the bleaching agent. You will also want to rinse out your mouth to remove any gel residue.


Make sure the whitening tray fits properly — it should only cover your teeth, not your gums. If it reaches the gums, some of the whitening agent could come in contact with them, causing increased sensitivity or even slight burns, which can be seen as a white contour along the gum line.

, About an hour before treatment take the suggested dosage of an anti-inflammatory medication, such as Advil or Aleve. Taking the medication this early allows it to kick in and start working before your procedure. You can continue the medication after the treatment, should you experience any lingering sensitivity.If you are unsure as to what medications to take, ask your dentist for a recommendation. In general ibuprofen works well on all types of teeth sensitivity.

, Most at-home teeth whitening kits use carbamide peroxide as the main bleaching ingredient. Peroxide is effective, but it can irritate the nerve endings of your teeth and cause sensitivity. Choose an in-home kit that contains a low peroxide level of 5 – 6%. A higher peroxide dose will not guarantee effectiveness and might cause a great deal of pain.There are a wide variety of at-home whitening options: strips, paint-ons, mouth trays with gel, whitening toothpaste, and even whitening gum and mouthwash. If you have any concerns about the safety of these products, ask your dentist.
If you do choose a tray-based whitening method, make sure that the tray fits securely over your teeth. If it is loose the gel can leak out and create widespread gum irritation and increased sensitivity., It may be tempting to use more gel to get quicker, whiter results. Don’t do it. Instead, follow the directions carefully and make the health of your mouth the priority. Using too much agent can cause gum irritation and even vomiting if swallowed.

, Extending the time beyond the package recommendations will not make your teeth any brighter or whiter. It will, however, possibly erode your tooth enamel, causing future issues with sensitivity and decay caused by fractures in the enamel.The recommended length of time will generally depend on the percentage of active peroxide, which varies from product to product.

, For the first 24 – 48 hours after treatment your teeth will feel very sensitive, regardless of your previous dental history. It is best to avoid drinks that are either too hot or too cold. Try to drink and eat foods at room temperature. For example, instead of eating ice cream you might try some room temperature gelatin.


Even if you feel no pain after your procedure, it is best to be cautious and avoid exposing your teeth to extreme temperatures.
It is good if you can avoid acidic foods and drinks as well. Soft drinks and citrus juices can irritate and inflame a healing mouth.You should also avoid smoking and drinking or eating colored foods, so as not to stain the enamel, which is very vulnerable for the first 48 hours.

, It is always advisable to use a soft-bristled brush on your teeth before and after whitening procedures. Brush in a gentle circular motion. The soft bristles will clean your teeth without irritating the surface of your teeth. You will want to wait 30 minutes to an hour after your treatment before brushing your teeth. In the meantime, you can rinse your mouth out with water, if desired.When rinsing and brushing, use lukewarm water to minimize your discomfort.
If you are not comfortable brushing, you can place some toothpaste on a cotton swab and apply a thin layer to your teeth before going to bed. This will give you the benefit of fluoride without the irritation., Particular brands of toothpaste and mouthwashes contain varying degrees of fluoride. It is believed that fluoride helps to block the pain signals from your oral nerves, leading to less sensitivity. If you use fluoride, try not to eat anything for 30 minutes as this will give it more time to take effect.Apply a fluoride gel over your teeth for five minutes and do not swallow. This will also help to increase salivary flow for a better remineralization of the enamel.
Some good examples of mouthwashes and rinses that contain fluoride include: Listerine Fluoride Defense, Fluoride Listerine, Colgate Neutrafluor and Colgate Fluorigard.

, Immediately after your treatment, pull out your pack of sugar-free gum. Begin chewing a single piece at a time. Every 10 minutes spit out the chewed piece and begin working on a new one. Do this until you go through the whole pack. This cycle is believed to lessen tooth sensitivity after whitening treatments.Avoid this method if you have stomach problems or if you did not eat anything. Mastication (chewing) influences the release of the gastric acid in your stomach, increasing the risk of ulcers.

, It is generally okay to have one to two tray-based or dental office whitening procedures per year. Any more than that can compromise the integrity of your teeth and will increase sensitivity. Try to consider whitening as a serious procedure and not a regular part of your dental routine.If you are using whitening toothpastes or strips at home, try to cut back to every other day. This will give your teeth more time to recover in between treatments.

, If your teeth continue to bother you more than 48 hours after your procedure, it’s a good idea to make a dental appointment. Your dentist will take a close look at your teeth to determine whether the whitening amped up your sensitivity or if there is another underlying issue, such as a cavity.When you visit your dentist it may be helpful to bring along the packaging or the actual strips/toothpaste that you use to whiten at home. Your dentist may be able to recommend a better alternative.

Try out several models.",How to Choose a Tongue Cleaner," The tongue brush is most effective at loosening unwanted material from between the papillae and taste buds that cover the surface of your tongue.Because a tongue brush is best used to loosen material from the surface of your tongue, you will need to swish water in your mouth for approximately 10 seconds after brushing and spit it out to remove the material that was loosened from your tongue.You can also use a tongue scraper after a tongue brush for extra cleaning power.A study has shown that a tongue brush is just as effective as a tongue scraper, so have no reservations about using a tongue brush if it is most comfortable for you.;
, These will be less likely to trigger your gag reflex and are specifically designed to get the residue out of the grooves and crevices of your tongue.

, The tip of your tongue is self-cleaning because it rubs against your hard palate (the “roof” of your mouth); however, the back of your tongue doesn’t create enough friction against your soft palate to result in significant cleansing.Therefore, when you choose a tongue brush, be sure that it will reach to the back of your tongue.


The average human tongue is approximately four inches long.Therefore, you should make sure that the handle of your tongue brush is at least this long (preferably longer) so that it will reach the posterior of your tongue comfortably.

, If you wish, you can use a toothbrush as a tongue brush as well. If you decide to use a traditional toothbrush as a tongue cleaner, it has been shown that toothbrushes that have soft bristles work better to clean your tongue than toothbrushes with rigid bristles.Be aware that a regular toothbrush may not be as effective as a specialized tongue brush. Studies have shown that regular toothbrush bristles may not do a thorough job of cleaning your tongue when compared to a specialized tongue brush., If you have a strong gag reflex, a tongue brush may not be the best tongue cleaner for you; instead, you may want to try a tongue scraper.Even if you have an active gag reflex, you might find that it diminishes over time with consistent tongue brushing., Unlike a brush, which works to loosen food particles and bacteria from the crevices in your tongue, a scraper can actually be used to remove this unwanted material from your mouth. If you have a particularly strong gag reflex, a tongue scraper may be the right tongue cleaner for you.

, Check the size of your tongue in a mirror in order to find the right sized cleaner. A wide tongue scraper can clean the tongue in fewer strokes. A smaller scraper is suitable for older children and smaller tongues while a wider-angled scraper is ideal for adults. The average tongue is approximately four inches long, and chances are that your tongue is around that length.Because it has a lower profile, a tongue scraper is less likely to trigger a gag reflex, even if you have a small tongue or short tongue., Tongue scrapers can be made of plastic, or a more durable material such as stainless steel or copper. The type of material you choose for your tongue scraper will determine how long you should keep the scraper and how you should clean the scraper.


Tongue scrapers that are made out of plastic should be thrown away routinely because they are more likely to harbor germs.
Stainless steel tongue scrapers can be easily sterilized with boiling water or antibacterial solutions, but they can be more expensive. Stainless steel or copper tongue scrapers are relatively easy to keep germ free with the proper care.Pick a plastic tongue scraper if you have a sensitive tongue. They tend to be gentler on the tongue than metal scrapers.

, If you aren’t interested in buying a specialized tongue scraper, you can use an inverted spoon.Hold the spoon so that the tip is facing the back of your throat and the concave part of the spoon is facing toward the surface of your tongue.
Press the tip of the spoon into the back of your tongue, and drag it along the surface of your tongue until you reach the front.
Rinse any debris off the spoon and repeat the scraping motion across the rest of the surface of your tongue.

, Your dentist may have samples of various tongue cleaners that you can try out before making a purchase, or may be able to advise you regarding the tongue cleaner that may work best for you.


Ask your dentist if you have a geographical, hairy, or coated tongue. These tongue conditions may require more frequent cleaning to prevent bad breath and bacteria growth.

, If you are looking for a tongue cleaner online, a website such as Amazon or a pharmacy website may have opinions from people who used the product and can provide pros and cons.

, You may need to take your tongue cleaner for a “test drive” before finding the one that is best for you. Once you purchase a tongue cleaner, try it out for a few months and be willing to try another model if it does not adequately meet your needs."

Use a washcloth or paper towel.,
Find a twig.,
Make do with your finger.",How to Brush Your Teeth Without a Toothbrush1," A rough washcloth will to a better job of cleaning, but a paper towel will do if a washcloth is not available.Wrap the washcloth or paper towel around your index finger, dampen it, and add toothpaste if you have some.
Brush your teeth as if using a toothbrush: begin at the gums and work down, cleaning each individual tooth with a circular motion.Don’t forget to brush your tongue.
Rinse your mouth thoroughly when done, swishing back and forth.;
, Before there were toothbrushes, most people brushed their teeth with twigs. In many parts of the world, they still do, using twigs from oak, arak, or neem trees.Research shows that twigs from the arak tree contain natural fluoride and antimicrobial agents, and brushing with them is as or more effective as brushing with a toothbrush and toothpaste.Pick a young, flexible branch about 6 to 8 inches long (15 to 20 cm). You want one without real bark, only a thin skin.Peel the skin off and chew on one end of the stick until the fibers separate, turning the end into a little brush. Use it to brush your teeth.You can also use a toothpick to clean between teeth, but use caution so as not to hurt your gums and make them bleed.

, If no paper towels, washcloths, or twigs are at hand, you can always use your finger. Be sure to wash your hands very well first, then use your index finger as you would a toothbrush: begin at the gums and work down for the upper arch and work up for the lower arch, cleaning each individual tooth with a circular motion.Be sure to rinse your finger before moving from your top to bottom teeth, and from the front to the back of your teeth.Rinse your mouth thoroughly when done, swishing back and forth and from one cheek to another for at least 30 seconds."

Understand the components of homemade toothpaste.,
Try a basic recipe.,
Cook your ingredients to form a paste.",How to Brush Teeth Without Toothpaste1," Homemade toothpaste can be adapted to your specific needs and tastes, but ensure you are including the following types of ingredients:


A cleaning substance.
An abrasive to loosen plaque.
An emulsifier to help the various ingredients mix well.
A sweetening agent to make the toothpaste palatable.
A flavoring agent (optional, but helpful both for taste and freshening your breath).;
, Start with a proven method and experiment from there to determine your tastes and preferences. One common recipe includes the following ingredients:


1/2 teaspoon glycerin (a sweetener)
1/8 teaspoon mild neutral soap powder (a cleanser)
1 tablespoon calcium carbonate, which is often sold as chalk of Paris White (an abrasive)
1/2 teaspoon gum arabic, commonly sold at health food stores (an emulsifier)
A couple drops of peppermint oil (a flavoring agent)
1/8 cup water

, Combine all ingredients, then heat and stir for five minutes over medium heat, or until your mixture has achieved a paste-like appearance. You can make a year's supply of homemade toothpaste for one-tenth the price of purchasing a market brand.Experiment with different flavorings. Making your own toothpaste can be an especially useful solution if you harbor a strong dislike of the mint flavoring used in most commercial toothpastes.
As your homemade toothpaste doesn't have all the ingredients found in commercial toothpaste (for better and for worse), consider alternating between your homemade toothpaste and a commercial toothpaste every two weeks.
When using a homemade toothpaste, consider following with a mouthwash.

"
Choose your toothbrush.,
Brush the outer side of your teeth.,
Brush the inner side of your teeth.,
Brush the crowns of your teeth.,
Focus on other areas of your mouth.,
Check your teeth.,
Rinse your mouth.,
Floss your teeth.,
Use mouthwash.,
Gargle with salt water twice a day.,
Rinse your toothbrush before and after brushing.,
Replace your toothbrushes regularly.,
Watch what you eat.,
Eat a well-balanced diet.,
Clean your teeth after every meal.,
Get regular cleanings with your hygienist/orthodontist.",How to Brush Your Teeth With Braces On," Though a regular toothbrush will work, you might consider an electric or sonic toothbrush designed for cleaning around braces, and make sure you are using the right amount of pressure, allowing the head to rotate completely. This will provide a more effective cleaning and save you time.


Use an interdental brush with an angled head and brush that can fit around your braces. Oral-B has an Interdental Brush System with a triangular replaceable brush head that will work well.If you choose a regular electric or sonic toothbrush, know that it can be very difficult to maneuver the brush well enough in your mouth with braces on. The bristles will also likely wear down a lot faster because they will catch in your braces.
If you use a regular toothbrush, you will need to brush your teeth with the bristles angled both upwards and downwards to get a good clean over your braces.
Remember that you have several sides to your teeth — outer (near your cheek or lip), inner (facing your tongue), crown (on the bottom teeth, it's the part of the tooth facing the top of your mouth and on the top teeth, it's the part facing your tongue). All sides must be cleaned, so get a toothbrush small and flexible enough to move easily around your mouth.;
, This is the front side of your teeth that is seen when you smile. Don't forget to remove the plaque along the part of your tooth closest to the gum line.









Begin on the outside of your bottom teeth. Bite your teeth together. Rub the toothbrush back and forth across your teeth while gradually moving the toothbrush across your bottom teeth. Make sure you reach all the way back to your molars. Spit if necessary.
Now brush the outside of your top teeth. With your teeth still together, gently brush in circular motions. Make sure you move the toothbrush across all your front teeth and back to the outsides of your molars as well. It may be easier to reach the back of your mouth if you open your mouth a little.
If you are using a regular toothbrush, you will want to slant the brush both towards your gumline and toward the top of your tooth as well. This helps dislodge any food particles stuck directly on the top or bottom of your brackets.
Use small circles to brush the braces. Spend at least 25 – 30 seconds on each bracket. You can also use your interdental brush to brush over the tops of your brackets. Most brackets have holes in them (very hard to see) so try wiggling the interdental brush down into each bracket

, Move the toothbrush back and forth, up and down and then with circular motions on the inside of your top and bottom teeth. When you have braces, the inner side of your teeth are usually the easiest to brush because they are not crowded with braces.








, Turn your toothbrush perpendicular to the spaces between your teeth. Rub the brush back and forth and also use a circular motion. This helps get the hard to reach crevices that can harbor plaque and food particles.








, Your mouth is full of germs and plaque that feed gingivitis. You need to brush and massage your gums, cheeks and tongue as well. Spit if necessary before you begin.









Using your toothbrush, start to gently brush the gums above (or below) your teeth. Do a gentle, vertical brushing in the direction of the brackets.
After this, turn the brush 180 degrees to face your cheek. The cheek is harder to brush. Secure it with your other hand if it gets too difficult. Spit.
Turn the brush downwards and brush the soft bottom and gums where your tongue lays. Brush underneath your tongue, and then the roof of your mouth.
Finally, stick your tongue out and brush it. Be sure to breathe out of your mouth, otherwise you'll start gagging. Spit and rinse your mouth and toothbrush.

, Do they look clean? If you see any plaque or food, take your rinsed toothbrush and brush it away. If you feel like it, brush them over (any way you'd like) really quickly to get rid of anything you might have missed.

, It can be helpful before you brush your teeth to swish some water around in your mouth. Spit, and repeat. This gets some of the loose particles of food out of your mouth. You’ll also want to rinse with water after brushing.









Warm water can soothe teeth and soften bristles when you have the bands on your braces changed. Remember to not brush too hard or the brackets could get damaged.

, Flossing can seem like a difficult task to do with braces. You may want to consider Plackers, which are like floss on a stick, Platypus Orthodontia Flossers or water flossers. These flossing tools are much faster and easier to use than regular flossing and can be purchased at most stores.









Take a long piece of string floss (about 18 inches or 46 cm), wrap it around your index finger on each hand, and wiggle it between each tooth space. Try to bend the string around the teeth on each side of it, forming a ""C"" shape, instead of flossing straight. That will remove any plaque stuck there.
If you have finishing wires, it can be almost impossible to get the floss underneath or over your double sets of wires, so just push the floss down, as described, into the tooth space; however, if you do not have your finishing wires, it's recommended to thread the floss underneath or over your wires because this is the most effective way to get rid of gingivitis and clean your teeth.
Consider using a water flosser — a device with an electronic water jet ideal for those with braces. These items work like flossing by getting rid of food and plaque in crevices toothbrushes can't reach.

, After flossing, put a capful of mouthwash (or follow directions) in your mouth and swish it around for at least 30 seconds. Use mouthwash that specifically states it helps rid your mouth of gingivitis.









A fluoride mouthwash rinse may also be beneficial. The rinse can get into spaces that a toothbrush is not able to reach and help protect against cavities. Try filling the tank of your water flosser with half mouthwash, half water. This allows you to get mouthwash in the crevices of your teeth.
Spit the mouthwash out and do a quick rinse with some warm water.

, Gargle once in the morning and once in the evening. It may sting at first if you have a sore, but can actually be soothing to minor mouth injuries. This also works to prevent gingivitis.

, The last thing you need to do is feed gingivitis with bacteria and food particles left on your toothbrush. Always rinse your toothbrush under hot water. Run your finger up and down the bristles to rid of any food particles you left behind from last time. Store your toothbrush upright and where it the bristles can air dry.
Consider soaking your toothbrushes in chlorhexidine mouthwash to kill more germs.

, It is recommended that you replace your toothbrush every three months or more often if the brush becomes worn down. When the bristles are frayed, the toothbrush won’t clean your teeth as well. If you have an interdental toothbrush, you will also want to replace the head often. If your orthodontist doesn't give you a replacement, they are available at some stores. It's great to carry one around with you!

, The best way to protect your teeth to damage is to keep food that damages teeth or braces out.


Avoid foods that are hard or difficult to chew, like apples, taffy, caramels, corn on the cob, hard pretzels, popcorn, nuts, carrots or bagels.
Don't chew on ice or bubble gum.Cut back or avoid sugar completely. Sugary foods and soda rot your teeth and cause plaque that can lead to gingivitis., Vitamins and minerals found in a healthy diet of fiber, protein, good fats and some carbohydrates will help you fight and keep gingivitis away. Eating well also sustains good health overall, which is just as important. Look for nutritious, high fiber foods like raspberries, whole grains, bananas, greens, squash and other soft fruit., It may seem like a pain, but it is crucial! Gingivitis forms in 48 hours. It can happen from lack of brushing, flossing or improper technique. Not brushing after eating can also cause stains on your teeth when you get your braces off. , You should have a yearly exam and cleaning at minimum and more often if you have bleeding or a history of gingivitis. If you can, get an appointment after your tightening. Chances are, you'll have to get the hydro-cleaning as it is sometimes tricky for hygienists to manipulate around your device.


The use of water instead of the pick by dental personnel is very helpful for those with gingivitis. Ask if they can use the water jet or do air polishing, which involves baking soda.

Clean a removable tooth with cleaner.,
Use a cloth to polish your tooth.,
Avoid smoking.,
Refrain from using gold jewelry cleaners.",How to Clean Gold Teeth2," If you have a removable gold tooth, you should clean it daily. You should do this with a non-abrasive cleaner. After cleaning it, you should rinse the tooth with warm water and pat dry.Talk to your dentist about the proper cleaner. You can buy cleansers specifically designed for cleaning gold teeth online.

, After you have cleaned your tooth, make sure you pat it dry. Then, use a soft cloth to polish your tooth before placing it back in your mouth. This helps the tooth retain its shine and luster.Try a soft cotton microfiber cloth.

, If you have gold teeth, you should stop smoking. Smoking will tarnish your gold tooth and cause it to lose its shine. If you don’t want to quit smoking, then you should choose a higher quality gold for your tooth.For example, you should choose 18 or 24 karat gold if you want to continue smoking. It won’t tarnish as quickly as lower quality.

, Though you may think that cleaning your solid gold or gold-plated teeth with jewelry cleaner is a good idea, it is not. Jewelry cleaners are toxic when ingested. This means you should never clean your gold teeth with jewelry cleaners.Additionally, you should never use gold polish on gold teeth.

Clean your grill daily.,
Wash your grill with soap and water.,
Limit how long you wear a grill.,
Remove your grill when eating.",How to Clean Gold Teeth3," If you wear a removable grill, you should remove it each day to clean it. Brush the grill with toothpaste to clean it and remove any debris. Rinse it with warm water. Then, between uses, place the grill in antiseptic mouthwash to sanitize it.Cleaning it each day removes bacteria that can accumulate in the grill, along with removing remnants of leftover food.

, Another way to clean your grill is to use mild dishwashing liquid. Remove your grill and soak it in a bowl of warm water mixed with dishwashing liquid. Let it soak for about an hour or two, and then let it air dry.You can also pat it dry.

, Grills are removable gold-plated covers you snap over your teeth. Make sure that you don’t wear your grill all the time. Food and bacteria can get trapped beneath the grill, and if you wear it for extended periods of time, it can lead to tooth and gum decay., To keep your grill and teeth clean and healthy, remove your grill before eating. Eating while wearing a grill can cause food to get trapped beneath the grill, leading to the growth of bacteria and tooth decay.Food caught under the grill can also injure your sensitive gum tissue.

Rinse with mouthwash.,
Use floss to clean your teeth.,
Clean your mouth in the shower.,
Chew gum to clean your teeth.,
Drink or rinse your mouth with green teas.,
Eat fruits and vegetables that clean your teeth.",How to Brush Your Teeth Without a Toothbrush2," While mouthwashes should not be used as an alternative to brushing and flossing, they have been shown to kill microbes in the mouth and inhibit plaque formation.Put some in your mouth and swish it around for a minute to clean your teeth., If you forgot your toothbrush but remembered floss, then you’re in luck. Many dentists believe that flossing alone is more beneficial than brushing alone in fighting tooth decay.Floss helps remove bacteria and food between your teeth and around your gums. Rinse your mouth thoroughly afterwards for a more complete clean.Flossing leads to better blood flow in the gums in order to create an antibacterial barrier of protection surrounding your tooth

, Open your mouth and let warm water stream over your teeth. The shower will act like a water pick system, helping to rinse out your mouth and flush away plaque.Combine this with brushing with your finger for a more thorough cleaning.

, Chewing sugar-free gum has been shown to be as effective as flossing in removing food particles, plaque, and bacteria from teeth. It also freshens your breath. The optimal length of time to chew is one minute, after which bacteria begin to be released back into the mouth from the gum.Chewing sugar-free gum can also create the optimal balance of the salivary pH which disables the bacterial formation., Green tea contains polyphenol antioxidant compounds that reduce plaque and fight gum disease.Simply drink the tea, or for a deeper clean, use it as you would mouthwash., The abrasive nature of fibrous vegetables can help to clean your teeth, while the vitamins and acids they contain have benefits for whitening teeth and fighting cavities.Apples – Apples contain vitamin C, which is necessary for health gums, as well as malic acid, which helps to whiten teeth.Carrots – Carrots are rich in vitamin A, which strengthens tooth enamel.The fibers in carrots can act as micro-bristles on the tooth surface and also in between your teeth, creating a natural massage of your gums.
Celery – Chewing celery produces a lot of saliva, which helps to neutralize the acids that cause cavities."

Substitute baking soda for toothpaste.,
Try a mixture of salt and water.,
Make a toothpaste with strawberries.",How to Brush Your Teeth Without a Toothbrush3," If you forgot your toothpaste as well as your toothbrush, you can use baking soda as a substitute. It is an ingredient in many toothpastes because of its ability to whiten teeth and remove plaque. Simply place some on your finger, paper towel, or washcloth before brushing your teeth., Salt has natural antibacterial qualities and can eliminate some of the plaque-causing germs in your mouth when you don’t have any toothpaste. Combine 1–2 teaspoons of salt to 8 ounces of lukewarm water and allow the salt to dissolve in the water. Then dip your finger, paper towel, or washcloth in the saltwater before brushing your teeth. You can also use the salt water to rinse your mouth out after brushing.Don’t use too much salt or use this method frequently if you have metal fillings, as salt is corrosive., Strawberries contain vitamin C to maintain gum health, a powerful astringent that helps remove plaque, and malic acid which whitens teeth. Alone or combined with baking soda, crushed strawberries are a good substitute for toothpaste.Be sure to rinse thoroughly after brushing, as strawberries also contain sugar, which can contribute to tooth decay.

Recognize the benefits of tooth powder ingredients.,
Combine ingredients and mix thoroughly.,
Apply the dry mixture to your toothbrush.",How to Brush Teeth Without Toothpaste2," As with homemade toothpaste, tooth powder can be made using a variety of recipes. Often these natural products may sound a bit baffling — clay on your teeth? — so understanding the reasoning behind the ingredients in a sample tooth powder recipe is important:


Bentonite clay: this natural clay can bind to toxins in your body — including the mercury that may be found in dental fillings. It is also rich in materials that can nourish teeth and gums.
Baking soda: baking soda is a wonderful natural abrasive, and its alkaline qualities neutralize damaging acid.
Sage: sage is a natural tooth-whitener and astringent.
Xylitol: this natural sweetener is an important pH neutralizer and will help make homemade tooth powder more palatable. Be aware that xylitol is toxic to cats and dogs, so keep it out of your pet's reach.
Sea salt: sea salt contains tooth-strengthening minerals and can alleviate gum inflammation. Don't use too much salt as large amounts may lead to swollen gums.
Peppermint: peppermint has antibacterial, antiseptic, and pain-relieving properties in addition to its breath-freshening qualities.

, Use a non-metal spoon as some metals may react with your ingredients.


Mix 2 tablespoons bentonite clay, 2 tablespoons baking soda, 1 tablespoon dried, finely ground sage leaf, 1 tablespoon xylitol, and 1/2 teaspoon sea salt.
Drip 15 to 20 drops of peppermint essential oil into mixture and stir thoroughly to combine.
Place in a container or jar with a tight-fitting lid, or consider placing in a squirt-top container (the grain of your mixture will be fine enough to ""squirt""). Avoid metal containers.
Store in a dry location.

, Dip your toothbrush in the powder, or squirt from your squirt-top bottle onto your damp toothbrush. Use just as you would commercial toothpaste."

Scrub with sea salt.,
Brush with baking soda.,
Use a natural soap.,
Try coconut oil.",How to Brush Teeth Without Toothpaste3," Sea salt contains trace minerals such as calcium, magnesium, silicon, phosphorus, sodium, nickel, and iron that can strengthen your gums, fight tartar build-up, freshen your breath, and possibly even whiten your teeth over time. The iodine in sea salt has antibacterial properties and can neutralize acids that cause tooth decay.


Dip a wet toothbrush into 1/2 teaspoon of sea salt and brush very gently. Try to avoid your gums, as sea salt may cause your gums to become inflamed and painful — especially if you are not used to this method. Use extra caution the first time you try this method.
Alternatively, try rinsing your mouth with a saltwater solution. Dissolve 1/2 teaspoon of sea salt in 4 ounces of warm water, then swish for 30 seconds. Spit out the solution when you're done. This saltwater rinse can help heal swollen or inflamed gums and rinse away bacteria., Baking soda, or sodium bicarbonate, has long been recognized as a natural way to clean and whiten your teeth. Because baking soda is highly alkaline, it works to neutralize acids that can cause tooth decay. It also kills bacteria and freshens your breath.


Mix baking soda with water until it reaches a paste-like consistency, then use it to brush as you normally would.
You may also consider combining baking soda with sea salt to make a variation on homemade toothpaste., While we aren't usually accustomed to the taste of soap in our mouths, natural soaps are an effective tooth cleanser. Try a mild product such as unscented olive oil soap., Coconut oil has antibacterial and antifungal properties — and it tastes, of course, like coconut. You may also consider combining it with ingredients such as baking soda."
"
Use a miswak stick.,
Irrigate your mouth with a water pick.,
Try oil pulling.,
Purchase a Misoka toothbrush.",How to Brush Teeth Without Toothpaste4," Humans have used the sticks of the Salvadora persica tree to clean their teeth for over 4,000 years. The fibers of this tree contain sodium bicarbonate and silica — both abrasive enough to remove stains. These twigs also contain natural antiseptics, resin that may form a protective barrier over your teeth, and essential oils to freshen your breath.To use a miswak stick, use your back molars to chew the bark off the end of one of the sticks and separate the fibrous ""bristles"" by chewing on the pulp. Use the resulting bristles to clean your teeth.
Never bite hard things with your front teeth, as they are not able to support high-pressure forces and can easily chip or break.

, A water pick is a kind of a pressure washer for your teeth, commonly recommended by orthodontists to supplement brushing for patients with braces. Anyone, however, can benefit from using a water pick. Oral irrigation cleanses below the surface of your gums to reduce harmful bacteria and eliminate loose plaque.A water pick massages your gums, which increases blood flow. This can help protect your gums from bacteria — follow up with mouthwash.

, Oil pulling is an old wellness technique for detoxifying and cleaning your teeth and gums. Vegetable oils such as olive or coconut oil can whiten your teeth, reduce sensitivity and alleviate bad breath. They also bear some antibacterial properties.


Swish with a teaspoonful of oil for approximately 20 minutes, then spit into a trash can to avoid clogging your drains with oil., The Misoka toothbrush uses nanotechnology to clean your teeth. These brushes are made with extremely fine bristles coated in mineral ions. When you dampen the brush and pass it over your teeth, the ions remove stains and form a protective coating over your tooth enamel."

Schedule an appointment with the dentist.,
Talk to the dentist about laser treatment.,
Give your dentist your medical history.,
Determine where the deep cleaning is needed.,
Ask about anesthetics.,
Let the dentist do the scaling.,
Undergo root planing.,
Control the bleeding.,
Take your medication.,
Return for a check-up.,
Practice good oral hygiene.",How to Deep Clean Your Teeth," A deep cleaning is usually recommended after periodontitis has already been diagnosed. Set up an appointment with your dentist for your deep cleaning. You may want to do it soon after diagnosis to prevent deeper pockets from developing in your gums.

If you are diagnosed with severe periodontitis, your dentist may refer you to a periodontist for the deep cleaning. This is a dentist who specializes in gum disease.;
, In some cases, your dentist may able to remove the plaque using new laser techniques. These are less painful, and they cause less bleeding and swelling after the procedure. If your dentist has access to the technology, ask them if laser treatment might be a good option for you., Certain conditions may increase your risk of an infection after the deep cleaning. Inform your dentist of your medical history, including any family history of gum disease. If your dentist knows that you are at increased risk, they can prescribe you an antibiotic to prevent infection. Be sure to tell them if you have:

Any heart problem that puts you at risk for endocarditis such as HIV, damaged heart valves, or a congenital heart defect
Any disease or problems with your immune system
Recently undergone surgery
Implants, such as an artificial hip or heart valveA history of smoking

, Before you begin, the dentist should ascertain which parts of your mouth actually need the deep cleaning. For some people, only one part of the mouth may be affected, and they may not need the procedure in other areas. Other people may be affected throughout the mouth. They will need a full scaling and root planing., In most cases, a local anesthetic will be applied to your gums to numb them during the procedure. The most common type of anesthetic is injected into your gums. It will numb your gums, lips, and tongue. Alternatively, your dentist might use a gel. This will only numb your gums.If your mouth is numbed, you should not eat until the numbness wears away, as you might accidentally bite yourself.
You do not need anesthetic, although it is typically recommended. If you are uncomfortable with the use of anesthetics, you can ask your dentist if you may skip it.

, The first part of the deep cleaning is the scaling. Your dentist will ask you to open your mouth as wide as you can. Using a hook-shaped tool, the dentist will scrape away plaque from below the gumline. Some dentists may use an ultrasonic device that will remove plaque in a similar manner. Both tools are worked around the tooth at the gumline., Root planing is the second part of the deep cleaning. During planing, the gums around your teeth are smoothed down with a tool to reduce pockets that may have formed between the gum and the teeth., If your gums are tender or bleeding, you can help treat them by rinsing your mouth with warm salt water. Pressing a piece of damp gauze or a moistened tea bag to the bleeding spot can reduce or stop the bleeding.Bleeding will usually stop after a day or two, although some tenderness and soreness may last for up to a week. Call your dentist if you notice bleeding after two days.

, Your dentist may prescribe a pill to help prevent infection and reduce pain, or they may give you a special prescription mouthwash. No matter which treatment they provide, follow their directions carefully for using it.Sometimes, instead of prescribing you a pill, your dentist will insert medicine directly into your gums. If they do this, avoid eating for twelve hours after the procedure, and do not floss for a week. You may also need to avoid tough, hard, chewy, or sticky foods., At your appointment, your dentist will ask you to schedule another appointment so that they can follow up on your gum care. They will measure how deep the pockets of your gums are following the deep cleaning. If the pockets have gotten larger, they may need to take more drastic action, such as periodontal surgery.This second visit may happen a few weeks or months after the procedure.

, Good mouth hygiene can prevent gum disease from getting worse, and it will reduce the problems that you have in the future. Brush your teeth twice a day, and floss at least once daily.Quitting smoking can also help reduce gum problems.
You should visit your dentist at least once or twice a year for cleanings and check-ups. Your dentist can continue to check the depth of your gum pockets to make sure that the disease is not progressing.

Make sure your toothbrush works for the shape of your mouth.,
Keep the size of your mouth in mind.,
Look at the angle of the toothbrush.,
Select a handle you like.",How to Choose a Toothbrush1," Based on past toothbrushes, you should have some idea of the general shape of your mouth. Some mouths are more narrow or wide than others, and you need a toothbrush that works for your mouth and teeth.You want a brush that can comfortably reach the back of your molars. The shape of your mouth, and whether it's wider or narrower, will affect how easily a given brush can reach your molars.
Go for a brush with an appropriate sized handle. If you, for example, have a very narrow, somewhat long mouth, you will need a toothbrush with a wider handle. You will probably feel more comfortable with smaller toothbrushes, but make sure the handle also has a good grip.;
, Mouths vary in size. If you have an average-sized mouth, most conventional toothbrushes will probably work for you. However, if you have a very big or very small mouth, take this into consideration when selecting a toothbrush.Most people can use a toothbrush with a head that measures 0.50-inch wide and 1-inch high. This can reach the back of most people's mouths without problem. However, if you've had issues with toothbrushes being too big or too small in the past, take this into consideration.
If you have a bigger or smaller than average mouth, opt for a slightly bigger or slightly smaller toothbrush.

, Some toothbrushes are designed to be held at a particular angle. Some consumers find a slightly tilted toothbrush allows them to more easily hit certain areas of the mouth. However, you should not purchase a toothbrush you do not know how to use. Unless you have a strong preference for an angled brush, and have used one before, opt for a standard toothbrush. The ideal toothbrush is always one you can easily use.Also, keep in mind that the more plastic bristles you can see, the better the cleaning will be. This is because rubber bristles are less effective when brushing a tooth surface.

, You're less likely to brush your teeth effectively if you dislike your toothbrush's handle. Go for a toothbrush with a soft handle that's easy to hold. If you struggle to hold your toothbrush, you're likely to stop brushing your teeth prematurely and also to use bad brushing technique, which can damage your teeth.Unfortunately, you usually cannot remove a toothbrush from the package to examine it. However, you can inspect the toothbrush's handle closely from inside the box.

Also, be sure to clean your toothbrush protector regularly. Chlorhexidine (found in mouthwash) is the best antibacterial substance to clean the container.;
, This allows water to drain from the bristles. It also keeps them away from bacteria that grows in even trace amounts of water. If you store your toothbrush in a container like a cup, you may have noticed that scum collects at the bottom. If you store your toothbrush on its side or with the brush facing down, it will be lying in that scum., When you flush, tiny water particles containing fecal matter escape the toilet and may land on your toothbrush if it is too close to the toilet.While there is insufficient evidence that these trace amounts of bacteria cause illness, it is best to be safe., Bacteria that accumulates on the toothbrush holder can be transmitted to the brush, and then to your mouth. It is particularly important to clean your holder regularly if it has a closed bottom, like a cup.Wash your toothbrush holder or cup with soap and water. Do not run it through the dishwasher unless it says it's dishwasher-safe. Never put your toothbrush itself in the dishwasher., If you are storing multiple toothbrushes in one container, make sure they do not touch, as this will allow for the transfer of bacteria and bodily fluids from one brush to another., If you share a toothbrush, you are also sharing bodily fluids and germs, which might lead to an infection., It seems rather obvious, but all too often people reach straight for the toothpaste tube before washing their hands.

, Rinse the brush with hot tap water after brushing your teeth.Make sure you remove all toothpaste and debris., The wetter your toothbrush, the more welcoming an environment it will be for bacteria., According to the American Dental Association, there is no clinical evidence that soaking your toothbrush in antibacterial mouthwash has any effect on your oral health.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) adds that soaking your toothbrush could lead to cross-contamination if you use the same disinfectant over a period of time, or share disinfectant between users., If it is electric, replace the head every three to four months. Do so sooner if you notice the bristles are bent or fraying, or if colored bristles are fading.Kids' toothbrushes may need to be replaced more often than adult toothbrushes, as children have often not learned how to best care for their teeth and may press too hard., Throw away their toothbrush and any other brushes it came into contact with to prevent the sickness from spreading.Soaking your toothbrush in antibacterial mouthwash for ten minutes after your illness ends may kill germs that might cause a return of the illness; however, it is a better idea to simply replace the toothbrush., Even trace amounts of bacteria can be dangerous for those with compromised immune systems, so keeping your toothbrush disinfected is advisable.Use an antibacterial mouthwash before you brush your teeth. This may help reduce the amount of bacteria that gets onto your toothbrush when brushing.
Rinse the toothbrush with antibacterial mouthrinse before brushing. This may reduce the amount of bacteria deposited on the toothbrush.
Replace your toothbrush more frequently than every three to four months. This may help reduce your exposure to bacteria over time.
Consider a toothbrush sanitizer. While studies do not show any particular benefit to these devices, you can purchase one that has been cleared by the FDA. Toothbrush sanitizers kill up to 99.9% of bacteria on the brush. (Sterilizing means that 100% of bacteria and living organisms have been killed, and no commercial toothbrush cleaner can claim this.)

, Studies show that people who are wearing appliances on their teeth collect more germs on their toothbrushes.Rinse with antibacterial mouthrinse before brushing to reduce the amount of bacteria deposited on the toothbrush.If you have braces, you may also find it helpful to also use a water flosser or waterpik to clean between your braces and your teeth."

Collect your ingredients.,
Mix together 2/3 cup baking soda and 1 teaspoon sea salt.,
Add in a few drops of the essential oil of your choice.Many people will choose peppermint or spearmint, since it is what they are used to.,
Begin mixing in the water.,
Store the toothpaste in a glass jar.,
Scoop a bit onto your brush.",How to Make Toothpaste1," For this recipe, you will need 2/3 cup of baking soda, 1 teaspoon fine sea salt, 1 to 2 teaspoons peppermint extract or other essential oil, and filtered water.Sodium bicarbonate (commonly known as baking soda) polishes the teeth and eliminates bad breath eliminating acids and creating an alkaline pH. Another great advantage is that it is relatively inexpensive.Salt acts as an abrasive that helps remove plaque. It also causes you to salivate, and saliva is nature’s method of protecting teeth.It also provides minerals that help protect your enamel, and this effect is increased when combined with baking soda.
The essential oil is for taste.
The water is for consistency.;
, Make sure that the sea salt is mixed thoroughly with the baking soda. When you look closely at the mixture, you should not see clumps of sea salt among the baking soda, but rather the salt should be dispersed so that it is difficult to pick out from the baking soda.


This can be accomplished using a fork or whisk, which will help break up any clumps of salt. Leaving big clumps of sea salt can be harmful when brushing, so make sure to mix everything together until it is the same consistency.

, However, you can try other “flavors” too.


Other essential oils commonly used include: lavender, which has shown to provide calming effects when used orally; orange, which has also been shown to reduce anxiety; and eucalyptus, which has antiseptic and antibacterial properties.These are all also used in dentistry for similar effects.

, Do this a few drops at a time, and stir well after each addition.You can make it as thick or thin as you like, but be aware that if it is too thin it will be difficult to keep it on the brush and it will get diluted faster by the saliva, making it difficult to brush your teeth.

, Essential oils should be stored in glass containers, so this is especially important if you have chosen to include oil. Store the paste near your toothbrush, out of direct sunlight in a cool dry place., You can dip your brush right into the paste if you wish, or you can use a small spoon to heap it onto your brush. Experiment with using different amounts. Start with a pea-sized drop, and add more if you don’t feel it is enough.

Get a different type of toothbrush.,
Don't let your mouth dry out.,
Tell your dentist about any medical problems you are experiencing.,
Let your dentist know about medications you are taking.,
Consider going to a dentist that specializes in elderly care.",How to Maintain Healthy Teeth As You Age1," As you age it may become difficult or improper for you to brush your teeth as you used to. You should use a soft bristled brush as you get older. Also, if you have arthritis, it can be difficult to brush with a normal toothbrush. In this instance you can use a toothbrush with an extra long handle or invest in an electric toothbrush instead.A soft toothbrush can protect your gums and the aging enamel on your teeth.
A toothbrush with a longer handle will allow you to keep your arm lower while you brush.
An electric toothbrush will allow you to use less pressure when brushing and still get a thorough cleaning.;
, As you age you are more likely to have dry mouth. This could be due changes in your mouth or due to medications that cause dry mouth. Having a dry mouth can impact your dental health because saliva protects teeth from decay and helps clean your teeth.To offset dry mouth, you should drink more water and hold it in your mouth for a few seconds as you drink it.
Also, you can suck on sugar-free candies or lozenges or chew sugar-free gum to stimulate the production of saliva in your mouth.

, If you develop medical conditions as you age you should let your dentist know, as it could impact that way that they care for your teeth. Conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer can have a real impact on your dental health and these impacts need to be addressed by your dentist., As you age, you are likely to take more medications. Some medications can impact your teeth and dental health. Let your dentist know about all of your medications so that they can consider them when giving you dental care.For example, medications that thin the blood, such as aspirin and warfarin, can cause excessive bleeding in the mouth when your dentist is caring for your teeth., There are some dentists that focus on caring for the dental health of the elderly. This allows them to provide expert care for the particular needs of the elderly.You can usually find a dentist that specializes in dental care for the elderly, called geriatric dentistry, through a specialty dental association's website or through a referral from your original dentist.

Use the most effective dental floss.,
Wrap the ends of an 18-inch (46 cm) to 24-inch (61 cm) section of floss around your middle fingers.,
Hold the floss between your thumbs and forefingers of both hands.,
Use your thumbs to floss your upper teeth.,
Gently slide the floss between your teeth.,
Move the floss gently in a ""C"" motion when it makes contact with the gums and use a gentle up and down motion to clean the area.,
Repeat the process between each tooth.,
Don't forget the backs of your rear molars.,
Rinse your mouth out with mouthwash or water when you're done flossing.,
Floss your teeth at least once every day.,
Consider other options if you can't or don't want to floss the traditional way.",How to Floss," There are several varieties available and you can choose the one that best matches your personal preference, including waxed, unwaxed, flavored and unflavored. Here's what you need to know to make a decision about which type of floss is best for you:








Floss comes in two basic forms:

Nylon (multifilament) floss. This floss is made up of many strands of nylon fabric, making it stringy and possible to break apart.Nylon floss comes in waxed and unwaxed.
PTFE (monofilament) floss. This floss is made up of a single strand or thread, and glides in between even the tightest of spaces.If you have wider gaps between your teeth, then tape floss or even superfloss, which is used for cleaning orthodontic braces and dental bridges, may work best.
Single-filament floss is slightly more expensive, but it will be able to slide between teeth more easily and will be less likely to shred. Each container of floss lasts a long time, so using non-nylon floss is a worthwhile investment.;
,









Many people like to floss after brushing. This will allow the toothbrush to start removing the stray particles of food from your teeth before you even begin to floss; however, brushing your teeth after flossing may allow more fluoride from the toothpaste to reach between teeth and removes any debris left after flossing., You should leave about 3 – 4 inches (7.5 – 9 cm) of the floss exposed. This is the area you'll be using to floss your teeth. Once you wrap the floss around your index fingers, you can grab it with your index fingers and thumbs.








, Using your thumbs can be more helpful in flossing your upper teeth and using your index fingers can be more helpful in flossing your bottom teeth, but do whatever is most comfortable for you.








, It doesn't matter which tooth you start with as long as you cover every tooth before you finish. Most people like to start in the middle between the two top teeth or the two bottom teeth. Once you've picked an area, slide the floss gently between your tooth and the gum line. You should do this carefully instead of being too aggressive, or you'll increase the chances of bleeding or hurting your gums.


Do not snap the floss down into the gums. Think of it as gently rubbing the floss between the gum line and the teeth, not vigorously yanking it around.

, After you slide the floss between your teeth, you should curve it around the bone and let it dip below the gum line (ideally, it should dip about 2 – 3 millimeters down). Once the floss is in place, move it up and down to agitate the area carefully. This will help reach the contours of each tooth.


Additionally, floss in a back and forth motion to help scrape additional plaque and debris. When you're done, gently move the floss back out the way it came.

, Make sure to floss your teeth one at a time — don't wrap your floss around the gum of one tooth as well as the gum of another. This will make the process less precise, and you'll be more likely to hurt your gums. Clean floss can be acquired by unraveling the extra floss that is wrapped around the index finger. Make sure you use a new piece of floss for each tooth. If you're really getting in there and run out of clean floss, pull out some new floss to finish the process.


Unwind new floss from one hand to the other as you go, so that you are flossing with a fresh piece of floss.
You may experience some bleeding in your gums. This is a sign that your gums actually need to be flossed more often. Bleeding gums often discourage people from flossing because they don't want to deal with the pain, but you should know that your gum bleeding and swelling should go down once you make a true habit of flossing.

, Gum disease and tooth decay frequently occur on the back teeth. It can be a little bit harder to get in there, but you shouldn't neglect this crucial part of flossing. Gently slide the floss between your rear molars and your gums, and carefully pull both sides of the floss toward you as you agitate the area., After you floss, rinsing out your mouth can help you remove any stray particles that were nearly dislodged from your gums, or that you were able to remove but were left in your mouth. This will also help give your mouth a fresh, clean feeling.


Using chlorhexidine mouthwash destroys almost completely any trace of bacteria and creates a protective barrier around the gums and teeth that have been flossed.

, The American Dental Association (ADA) suggests flossing for two to three minutes, but even 60 seconds of flossing daily can significantly improve your gum health. Most people floss before bed. If you know you've had a meal that led you to have more food stuck in your teeth than usual (such as having corn on the cob for lunch), then you can floss earlier, too, to get out the stray particles of food. That being said, you don't want to overdo the flossing, either, or you may damage your gums. Just once a day should be the perfect amount.

, Flossing significantly lowers your likelihood of gum disease and decay, making it an essential part of your hygienic routine. If you can't floss the traditional way, try flossing with:









Floss holders, small Y-shaped devices that hold floss. For those who aren't coordinated enough to handle traditional floss.
""Superfloss,"" which expands in larger spaces and contracts to fit through smaller spaces. Super floss may be beneficial for people with wipe gaps between several of their teeth.
Floss threaders, which make it easier to work around any dental work that you might have gotten.
Consider using a water flosser in addition to flossing. A water flosser, also known as a water pick or an oral irrigator, is a device that aims a stream of water at your teeth. It can help remove particles of food from your teeth and can also help reduce gum disease as well as bleeding. It can also make the process a bit more fun. Be aware that it can work in addition to flossing, but should not be used as a substitute."

Pick out the extras you want.,
Think about a manual versus an electronic toothbrush.,
Remember cost when selecting special features.",How to Choose a Toothbrush2," Is there a special feature you feel you'll use? If you're, say, preoccupied with bad breath, you may want a toothbrush with a tongue cleaner. If you're environmentally conscious, you may want a toothbrush that's easily recyclable and made from organic materials.Most drug stores and supermarkets sell a wide variety of toothbrushes, so finding special feature is rarely a problem. You can browse the selection at a drugstore near you to find a toothbrush that suits your needs.
However, not all special feature are available at every store. If you're looking for a very niche feature, you may have to purchase a toothbrush online.

, Manual toothbrushes are operated just with your hands. Electronic toothbrushes have a motor that moves the bristles for you as you move the toothbrush over your mouth. Decide whether you want an electronic or manual toothbrush.The main benefit of an electronic toothbrush is it can give you a deeper clean. It's also great if you have a condition like arthritis, as electronic toothbrushes do much of the work for you.
Electronic toothbrushes tend to be expensive, however, and the heads need to be replaced every three to four months. If you're on a tight budget, and do not have any health conditions that make brushing your teeth difficult, you may want to opt for a manual toothbrush.
Another major disadvantage of having an electronic toothbrush is that you might forget how to brush properly. The most effective brushing technique is still the manual one where you can brush your teeth and gums using vertical strokes.

, Most toothbrushes should be replaced every three to four months. When selecting special features, keep the cost in mind. While a toothbrush with a tongue cleaner may seem convenient, if it's twice as expensive as a regular toothbrush, it may not be worth the money. Instead, you could spend a few bucks on floss or and interdental brush. You can clean your tongue with a conventional toothbrush and save yourself some money."

Check the label.,
Opt for softer bristles.,
Avoid very cheap toothbrushes.,
Remember other fundamentals of tooth care.",How to Choose a Toothbrush3," You should see a seal from the American Dental Association (ADA) on the label of any quality toothbrush. These toothbrushes have been examined for safety and efficiency. Do not get a toothbrush without an ADA seal., While toothbrushes come in a variety of bristle strengths, you should usually opt for softer bristles. This is less taxing on your gums and tooth enamel. Go for a soft bristle brush over a hard or medium bristle brush., Some toothbrushes sell for less than a dollar. You can also sometimes find packs of toothbrushes for very cheap. These toothbrushes are not as high quality as other types of brushes, and some of them may not even have an ADA seal. It is worth paying a little extra money for a quality product., A toothbrush is just one component of oral hygiene. Make sure to also invest in quality floss and mouthwash. This is important for optimal tooth health."

Collect your ingredients.,
Begin by stirring together the coconut oil and baking soda.,
Add a few drops of essential oil at a time.,
Add Stevia for sweetness, if desired.,
Store the toothpaste in a glass jar.,
Scoop a bit onto your brush.",How to Make Toothpaste2," For this recipe, you will need equal parts coconut oil and baking soda depending on how much you want to make. For example, you can start with 6 tablespoons of coconut oil and 6 tablespoons of baking soda. Essential oil to taste. Stevia if you wish, to add a bit of sweetness.Coconut oil is believed to be effective against fighting a big cause of tooth decay, Streptococcus mutans, which is a bacterium that lives on sugar and also clings to teeth creating cavities.Coconut oil is supposed to pull all the bacteria away from your teeth, similar to how mouthwash works.
Stevia is a natural sweetener that comes from a plant of the same name. It has antibacterial properties that are believed to fight against tooth decay., Mix them together until the baking soda and oil are thoroughly incorporated. This means that you will have a mixture that is a moist glob of coconut oil and baking soda. For this task, it is probably best to use a whisk, but a fork can work as well.

, Stir well after each addition, and put a tiny amount on your tongue to taste it.

, If you want to make the toothpaste a bit more palatable, add a few drops of Stevia at a time and stir well. Then, repeat the process of tasting a small amount before adding more. It will take at least half an hour for the substance to dissolve completely, so make sure you don't add too much. Stevia is known to be sweeter than processed sugar, so be careful! You don't want your paste to be too sweet! , Essential oils should be stored in glass containers, so this is especially important if you have chosen to include oil. Store the paste near your toothbrush, out of direct sunlight in a cool dry place., You can dip your brush right into the paste if you wish, or you can use a small spoon to heap it directly on the brush. Experiment with using different amounts. Start with a pea-sized drop, and add more if you don’t feel it is enough.

Collect your ingredients.,
Mix the baking soda and salt.You can do this by stirring them together or by putting them in a sealable container and then shaking vigorously.,
Add in essential oil.If you wish to add essential oil for flavor, you can do this now.,
Store your powder.,
Use your powder.",How to Make Toothpaste3," For this powder, you will only need three parts baking soda, one part salt, and a few drops of essential oil (optional).Be aware that this is a powder, not a paste. If you prefer a paste, choose one of the other recipes, or add a bit of filtered water to the powder. However, also understand that in terms of effectiveness, there is no difference between them.
A part can mean whatever amount you want it to mean, what is important is the ratio. For example, if you use 3 tablespoons of baking soda, you will then use 1 tablespoon of salt. If you use 6 tablespoons of baking soda, you will use 2 tablespoons of salt for an increased whitening effect. For a better taste, you can also add a few drops of lemon juice.

,


The shaking method may be better for making sure the two ingredients are well mixed.

, Add a few drops of your favorite to the powder and stir or shake thoroughly.

, If you added essential oil, you should store the powder in a glass jar.If you didn’t, you can store it in a plastic bag or a plastic or glass container. Either way, make sure you store it in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.

, You can wet your brush in the sink and then dip it into the powder until you have a generous layer on your brush, or you can do it without water. If you wish to do this, simply put some of the powder on the brush (without wetting it first) or in your mouth and brush normally for two minutes.


Experiment with and without water to see which method you prefer.

Get a dental cleaning every six months.,
Go to the dentist if you have a dental problem.,
Discuss protective treatments for your teeth.",How to Maintain Healthy Teeth As You Age2," It is important to get regular dental cleanings as you age. Not only will it keep your teeth nice and healthy, it will allow your dentist to identify any problems that are emerging before they get too serious.As you age, the nerves in your teeth become less sensitive. This means that you may not be able to feel it when problems begin to emerge. This is why it is so important to have regular exams as you age.

, If you do think that you have a problem with your teeth, you should get it looked at as soon as possible. Even if you are scared of the potential pain of a dental visit or you have a limited budget and you are concerned about the cost of dental procedures, it is still a good idea to get your issue checked out.


Paying for small dental problems to be fixed will cost you less in the long run than paying for larger dental problems. However, there may be budget options that you can employ, such as paying in installments, using insurance, or going to a dental school for treatment.
Having dental pain can also impact your ability to eat enough food. If you have dental pain and it is impacting your life in this way, you should get it treated right away., Talk to your dentist about options of protective treatments that could give your teeth extra protection from wear and tear. Two common treatments are fluoride varnish and fissure sealants.Fluoride varnish is a treatment in which a strong fluoride is applied to the teeth. This application makes the enamel on the teeth stronger and less likely to decay. It can be applied every six months.
A fissure sealant is a plastic or resin coating that is applied to the crevices of the teeth. This coating protects the teeth from bacteria and food that might get stuck in the crevices. This coating can last up to 10 years.

Brush your teeth twice a day.,
Floss your teeth every day.,
Make sure you get enough fluoride.,
Clean dentures.,
Avoid smoking.,
Be gentle on your teeth.,
Avoid beverages that can damage your teeth.",How to Maintain Healthy Teeth As You Age3," As you age it is important to keep up with good dental hygiene. The core part of good dental hygiene is brushing your teeth twice a day. This removes food particles and bacteria that causes tooth decay.Your tooth sensitivity may increase as you age. This can be minimized by using a soft toothbrush and desensitizing toothpaste., In addition to brushing your teeth, you need to clean between them. This can't be done effectively with a toothbrush. Instead, it is done with floss or a flossing device.If you don't floss, plaque, food, and bacteria can build up between your teeth.
Be careful when you are flossing below the gum line that you don't damage your gums, especially if you take medication that causes you to bleed more easily.

, It is important that you get enough fluoride as you age, as it can help protect your teeth from the wear and tear that comes with use. For older people, it is especially important in protecting the delicate teeth surface below the gum line, as the gums usually recede as one ages.You can get fluoride from fluoride toothpaste, a fluoride rinse, or from fluoridated water, which is common in many cities.

, If you have full or partial dentures it is important for you to clean them as well. Take them out every night, be sure to clean them thoroughly, soak them, and rinse them before putting them back in your mouth.When you get your dentures you should be instructed on how to clean them properly. This usually includes soaking them over night and brushing them with denture cleaner.
You should also clean the inside of your mouth after you take your dentures out. Be sure to brush your gums, tongue, and the roof of your mouth.

, Smoking can cause severe damage to your teeth over time. If you are a smoker you have a higher chance of getting gum disease, tooth decay, and tooth loss, in addition to other health problems.Talk to your doctor about smoking cessation programs that might be available to you. It is never too late to stop smoking.

, In order to keep your teeth healthy for a long time, it is important to treat them well. In addition to good dental hygiene, you should avoid biting or chewing hard food, such as ice. Chewing on hard foods can chip or break your teeth, creating damage that needs to be fixed by a dentist.


If you have chipped your teeth, go to the dentist right away. If you chip the enamel off of the teeth, they become more susceptible to cavities. Your dentist can help protect any areas that are chipped and repair them.

, Fizzy or acidic drinks, such as soda pop or juice, can erode the enamel off of your teeth.Also, drinking alcohol can damage your teeth as well. If you are concerned about the health of your teeth, you should avoid these items whenever possible.


If you really want to drink things that will damage your teeth, drink them through a straw. This will keep the beverage off of your front teeth, minimizing the damage.

Use a whitening toothpaste.,
Consider using strips and rinses.,
Use natural ingredients.,
Rinse with hydrogen peroxide.,
Be patient.",How to Fix Nicotine Stained Teeth1," Head to the drugstore and look for a toothpaste that specifically advertises whitening properties. These toothpastes can lessen the appearance of surface stains, such as those caused by smoking. Often, they contain chemicals that break down the stains.Ask your dentist for his recommended brand. Be aware that certain toothpastes can heighten the sensitivity of your teeth.;
, In addition to toothpastes, there are other over-the-counter products that can help reduce the appearance of nicotine stains on your teeth. Purchase whitestrips, and follow the directions on the package. You can choose from those that dissolve in your mouth or strips that you remove after a specific period of time. Strips are an effective and inexpensive way to brighten your teeth., There are many items in your home — especially your kitchen —which are natural whitening agents. Lemon juice acts as a natural bleaching agent and can make your teeth appear shiny and clean. Mix some lemon juice with water, and rinse your mouth with this solution.


You can also make a paste using baking powder and strawberries. Just mash two to three berries together with 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder. Use a toothbrush to cover your teeth with the paste. After five minutes, rinse your mouth with water. These ingredients will help to brighten the appearance of your yellow teeth.There are also certain foods to avoid. Too much coffee, cola, and red wine can increase the discoloration that occurs with nicotine use. Try to avoid them., Another common household product that can brighten your teeth is hydrogen peroxide. Dilute a small amount (less than an ounce) of hydrogen peroxide with water and rinse your mouth. After several seconds, spit it out, and thoroughly rinse with water. This solution is an easy way to lighten yellow stains.Another way to create a shiny look to your teeth can be achieved by holding mouthwash in your mouth and then start brushing your teeth, pushing the brush in past your closed lips. In short, you brush your teeth with the mouthwash. The final result can be surprising.

, Nicotine stains are often more difficult to treat than discoloration caused by food or other factors like medication or discoloration following a root canal. Because nicotine stains are so stubborn, it can take longer to reduce their appearance. Be aware that it may take two to three months to see results. Don't give up if you can't see an immediate impact."

Have a professional bleach your teeth.,
Stop smoking.,
Avoid sugary snacks.,
Avoid toothpicks.,
Pay attention to your gums with dentures.,
Visit your dentist often.",How to Avoid Hurting Your Gums1," Bleaching your teeth can help whiten your teeth, removing stains from food and drinks. You may have noticed bleaching kits at the drug store. However, it's a better idea to have your dentist bleach your teeth. For one, it's usually more effective. More importantly, you can damage your gums at home if you don't bleach your teeth properly.Your dentist will always make sure to protect your gums with special barriers before a whitening treatment.;
, You probably know that smoking is bad for your health overall. However, you may not know that smoking is bad for your gums. Smoking can worsen gum disease, as a well as make it harder for your gums to heal. It can also lead to throat cancer or oral cancer, which usually affects the lip or tongue.Chewing tobacco is just as detrimental as smoking.

, All sugary snacks can be detrimental to both your teeth and gums, as they breed bacteria that cause damage. However, sticky or chewy foods with sugar are even worse, such as barbecue sauce, frosting, or granola bars. These foods tend to stick to your teeth, leaving the sugar there to do its damage.Though you don't need to cut these foods out altogether, try to limit your intake. It's best to eat something sugary in one sitting instead of in several small doses, as eating it over a longer period means the sugar will have longer to sit on your tooth.
Always try to brush or at least rinse your mouth after eating sugary foods to help the remineralization process of your salivary glands.

, While it's tempting to pick up a toothpick after dinner, it's not a good idea. Poking at your teeth with a toothpick can damage your gums. However, when there is nothing you can do to clean your teeth or get food out from in between them, a toothpick may be your only option. Just keep in mind that your gums are soft and sensitive, so it's best to avoid poking them with a toothpick., Dentures sit up against your gum line, which can cause problems if you're not careful. For one, it's important to keep your dentures clean, so you're not pressing bacteria into your gums. In addition, you should take your dentures out at night and clean your gums.To clean your dentures, scrub them gently with a soft cloth or brush. You can use toothpaste or even diluted mouthwash to get rid of bacteria and other debris. Never use hot water, as it can make your dentures lose their shape.
Also, brush your gums with a soft cloth or brush every night, and then rinse your mouth.

, While your dentist can't keep you from harming your gums, they can help identify problem areas, so that you can stop doing things that are hurting your gums. You should visit your dentist at least twice a year, possibly more if you are having gum problems."

Choose your dentist carefully.,
Have a laser treatment.,
Try chemical whitening.,
Consider veneers.,
Prepare a budget.",How to Fix Nicotine Stained Teeth2," For many people, going to the dentist can be an unpleasant experience. But it you do your research and find a dentist who makes you feel comfortable, you'll likely feel much more at ease. Ask your friends and relatives for recommendations. You can also read online reviews from previous patients. Make sure to choose a dentist who listens carefully and thoroughly explains all of your options., Your dentist might recommend laser whitening to help eradicate the nicotine stains on your teeth. This process involves painting your teeth with a peroxide solution and exposing your teeth to very strong light. This is a painless procedure that takes anywhere from 15 minutes to one hour., With this option, your dentist will use a bleaching agent to whiten your teeth. Sometimes, you might be sent home with a mouth tray and a supply of bleaching gel. Your dentist will instruct you to wear the tray for a certain amount of time each day. Other times, she might do the entire bleaching procedure in the office. Either way, it is painless.Be aware of risks. One of the most common side effects is increased sensitivity in your teeth. Ask your dentist about this possibility.In addition, in some cases, depending on the bite or the concentration of the whitening substance, tooth structure becomes weak and teeth may experience small cracks or even chip.

, Porcelain laminate veneers are paper thin ""shells"" made from porcelain that are used to create the appearance of bright, healthy teeth. The dentist will remove some of your tooth enamel, then apply a layer of adhesive, followed by the veneer. Veneers are considered one of the most effective ways to whiten and brighten your smile. Plus, they are stain-resistant. Ask your dentist if they are an option for you.There is also an option for ""no-prep"" veneers, which does not require the dentist to remove enamel before applying the veneer. This is not appropriate for everyone, however, so talk to your dentist to see if you are a candidate.
There are also composite veneers, which are less expensive than porcelain veneers. They are made of composite resin, which is a tooth-colored filling material., Any trip to the dentist can be pricey. Even if you have dental insurance, many plans to not cover whitening, as it is considered a cosmetic procedure. Contact your insurance company to find out the details of your coverage. Then, contact your dentist to inquire about pricing for the procedure that interests you.Once you know how much money you need to spend to reduce the appearance of nicotine stains, start planning your budget. It is possible that your dentist accepts payment plans. If not, come up with some ways to pinch your pennies.

Try to quit.",How to Fix Nicotine Stained Teeth3," Nicotine can quickly cause yellowing of your teeth. This occurs whether you smoke cigarettes or use chewing tobacco. Nicotine and tar settle into the very small cracks in the enamel of your teeth, and cause discoloration.It has been shown that nicotine helps the process of plaque formation, which leads to a faster deposit of tartar and can cause bad breath.

, In addition to discoloration, nicotine use can cause other physical problems for your teeth and gums. You may be prone to increased cavities, gum disease, and certain types of oral cancer. All of these ailments can decrease the healthy appearance of your teeth., One way to prevent the yellowing of teeth is to make sure that you are taking excellent care of your mouth. Good oral hygiene includes brushing your teeth twice a day. You should use a whitening toothpaste in combination with a soft-bristled tooth brush. Brush firmly but gently at least twice a day.Flossing is also important. You should make sure to use dental floss once a day. This can remove buildup of foreign material between your teeth.

, The best way to put a stop to the yellowing of your teeth is to quit using nicotine. Quitting is a very difficult process, but there are many methods you can try. Consider using cessation aids, such as chewing gum or nicotine patches. There are also prescription medications to help with your addition. Ask your doctor for help in choosing a safe and effective method."

Find a good toothbrush.,
Brush in short strokes.,
Brush regularly.",How to Avoid Hurting Your Gums2," A soft-bristled brush is best because it's less likely to harm your gums. Harder bristles can tear and damage your gums. You can use either a manual or electric toothbrush, as long as the bristles are soft., You don't want to run the toothbrush across all your teeth in hard strokes. Rather, short, soft strokes are better. On the outer edges of your teeth, you can use small back and forth strokes, aiming to be just along the gum line but mostly on your teeth. After three or four back and forth strokes, continue brushing using vertical strokes over the teeth and the gumline. On the inside edge of your teeth, you can use small up and down strokes.Brushing too hard can leave your gums damaged and bleeding.

, Your gums are harmed by bacteria just like your teeth. Therefore, it's important to brush your teeth often to avoid hurting your gums. You should try to brush your teeth at least twice a day for two to three minutes each time.

Spend some time between the tooth.,
Hug the tooth.,
Floss once a day.",How to Avoid Hurting Your Gums3," Food and bacteria can be trapped between teeth. Start by moving the floss up and down a bit between the tooth. That helps loosen and remove the bacteria that lives there. You can even saw back and forth a bit. At this point, you're not at the gum line.Make sure you use about 18 inches (46 cm) of floss. You want a new bit of floss for each section.

, Go down to the gum line, at the bottom corner of the tooth on one side. Use the floss to cup that tooth, helping you to get the floss down into that corner. Much of the bacteria lives in that corner, so it's important to get down there. Move it back and forth a bit, then move to the other bottom corner of the tooth next to it., Like brushing, flossing needs to be done regularly. Flossing helps remove bacteria that's trapped near the gum line. In turn, that keeps your gums healthier. Aim to floss at least once a day to keep your gums healthy and happy after or before brushing, but never after rinsing with mouthwash."

, Take a short walk around the yard or on the sidewalk, but don't go too far. Breathe a little deeper than normal but nothing out of the ordinary. Fresh air can feel soothing to your lungs and body.

, Put pillows under your feet to prop them up.

, It may be because it distracts your body from fixating on the nausea, or it may be something else entirely. But touching things around you actually helps.To generate a very little bit of pain — nothing serious.


Try pinching your arm
Tap your balled-up fist on your thigh
Pull a little bit of your hair
Bite your lower lip
Dig your fingernails into your forearm

, Acupressure is the manipulation of pressure points on your body in order to relieve pain. The wrists are what many acupressurists tend to target when nausea and vomiting occur.


Face your palm up towards your face. Then, place your thumb gently in the middle of your wrist and push to begin gently massaging the area. Slowly pushing on this pressure point will help relieve nausea.
Put the inner parts of both wrists together and press them into one another. You should be activating the same pressure point as in the example above.

Remember to brush at least twice a day.",How to Brush Your Teeth," Choose a toothbrush with soft nylon bristles. This must effectively remove plaque and debris from your teeth, without irritating the gums or eroding tooth enamel like hard-bristled brushes can do when used with sideways action. The toothbrush should also fit comfortably in your hand, and have a head small enough to easily reach all of your teeth, especially the ones at the back. If you have difficulty fitting the toothbrush into your mouth, it is probably too big.








Electric toothbrushes are a great choice if you are a lazy brusher and think that the electric toothbrush might encourage you to spend more time on your teeth; however, you can do just as good of a job with a manual toothbrush — it's all in the technique.
One good method is to brush with a manual toothbrush in the morning and use an electric toothbrush at night.
You should definitely avoid toothbrushes with ""natural"" bristles made from animal hair as these can harbor bacteria and must be replaced more frequently.;
, The bristles will wear out over time, losing their flexibility and effectiveness. You should purchase a new toothbrush every three to four months, or as soon as the bristles start to splay out and lose their shape. Visual inspection of the toothbrush is more important than the actual timeline. You can also buy toothbrushes whose handles will change color when it's time to purchase a new toothbrush.









Research has found that thousands of microbes call toothbrush bristles and handles ""home,"" and can cause infections.
At about three months, bristles become sharp due to friction and can cause your gums to bleed.
Always rinse your brush after using it, and store it upright and uncovered so that it can dry before your next use. Otherwise bacteria will grow., It not only helps remove plaque, but it also helps strengthen tooth enamel.It's important to note that fluoride toothpaste is not to be swallowed, as ingesting too much can have serious health consequences. It should not be used for children under the age of three.








You can get toothpaste to target a wide variety of dental and gum problems, including cavities, tartar, sensitive teeth and gums, gingivitis and stained teeth. Opt for the one that suits your best or ask your dentist or hygienist for advice., Flossing your teeth is just as important as brushing, as it removes built up plaque, bacteria and food particles that get trapped between the teeth, which soft floppy toothbrush bristles can't reach even when used with up/down natural motion. You should always floss before brushing your teeth so that any food or bacteria that comes loose during flossing doesn't remain in your mouth.









Remember to floss gently. Don't ""snap"" the floss between the teeth as this can irritate sensitive gums. Ease it down gently, following the curve of each tooth.
If you find dental floss awkward to use, or you have braces, look for dental picks instead. These are small wooden or plastic sticks which you can insert between teeth, achieving the same results as flossing if spaces are large enough.

, Squeeze only a pea-sized amount of toothpaste onto your toothbrush. Applying too much toothpaste can cause over-sudsing, tempting you to spit and finish too early. Plus, it increases the risk of you ingesting more fluoride-filled toothpaste, which is very unhealthy. 








If brushing is painful, try brushing more gently with accurate up/down motion only or switch to a toothpaste formulated for sensitive teeth.


, Gently brush with a short, vertical or circular motion. Don't brush across your teeth.Ask your dentist or hygienist to present you the correct brushing technique.









, Brushing just a few teeth at a time, work your way around your mouth in a circle so that you get every tooth, spending about 12 to 15 seconds in each spot. If it helps, you can divide your mouth into quadrants: top left, top right, bottom left, and bottom right. If you spend 30 seconds on each quadrant, you'll get a full two minutes of brushing time in.









Try starting at the outside lower left teeth, moving to the outside lower right, then outside upper right to upper left. Change to inside uppers and brush inside upper right, inside lower right, and finally inside lower left.
If you get bored, try brushing your teeth while watching television or hum a song to yourself while you brush. Brushing your teeth for the duration of an entire song will ensure that you brush thoroughly!


, Position the toothbrush so that it's perpendicular to your lips, or so that the bristles are resting on top of your bottom molars. Work the toothbrush in an in-and-out motion, and move from the back of your mouth to the front. Then complete this motion doing s rotational movement of the brush in order to eliminate bacteria which have been dislocated from the surface. Repeat on the other side of your mouth. When the bottom teeth are clean, flip the toothbrush over and work on the top molars.









To access outside top molars always swing the lower jaw to the side you are working on. This will increase the space available to move your brush up and down by several times so that no sideways motion occurs.

, Tip the toothbrush so that the head of the toothbrush is pointing towards your gum line, and brush each tooth. Dentists report that the most commonly skipped area is the inside of the lower front teeth, so be sure not to forget those! Check that your mouth is opening wide enough by holding teeth apart with two or three fingers of your other hand. This will allow correct vertical angle to reach edge of gum.







, After you've cleaned your teeth, use the bristles of your toothbrush to gently clean your tongue. (Don't press too hard, or you'll damage the tissue.) This helps keep bad breath away and gets rid of bacteria on your tongue.








, If you choose to rinse after brushing, take a sip of water from a disposable cup, or cup your hands under the faucet. Swish it around your mouth, and spit it out.









Note that there is some debate on whether or not this is recommended. While some feel that it reduces the efficacy of the topical fluoride treatment, others wish to ensure that no fluoride is ingested. There are also those who just don't like having toothpaste in their mouths! If you're at a high risk of getting cavities, it may be beneficial not to rinse, or rinse with just a small amount of water — effectively creating a fluoride mouthwash.Other studies have shown that rinsing after brushing has no significant impact on the effectiveness of brushing with a fluoride toothpaste., Hold your toothbrush under running water for a few seconds to remove any bacteria from the brush. If you don't rinse the toothbrush properly, you can actually introduce old bacteria into your mouth the next time you use it. Rinsing also removes any leftover toothpaste. Place your toothbrush somewhere where it will readily dry out. Otherwise, bacteria can grow.








, Take a small sip of mouthwash, swish it in your mouth for about 30 seconds, and spit it out. Be careful not to swallow any.








, Saltwater kills the bad bacteria on your teeth. There is a rumor that saltwater is acidic and can erode teeth if used too often. It's better not to use it too often, as, like anything, too much of anything is bad.


For a complete antibacterial protection rinse with a chlorhexidine mouthwash before going to bed, but do not use it for longer than two weeks in a row.

, Most dentists recommend that you brush at least twice a day — once in the morning and once before bed. If you can fit in a third time somewhere in the middle, even better! Try brushing at a 45° angle as this helps remove plaque and food/drink particles on your teeth better than if you did it normally. You should also try to avoid snacking between meals as much as possible, as this results in more food debris and bacteria building up in the mouth.

You can generally replace these after an hour or so, if you need to. If you continue to bleed, change your gauze packs every 30-45 minutes and apply gentle pressure.You should not bleed for more than a few hours after surgery. If the bleeding continues for much longer than that, contact your doctor or dental surgeon.It's normal to see a little blood oozing from the site for 24-48 hours after surgery. This oozing should be mostly saliva with just a few traces of blood. If you see significantly more than that, this is excessive bleeding and you should call your doctor.;
, Do not brush your teeth, spit, or rinse with a mouthwash for the first day after surgery. This can disrupt the healing process and lead to conditions such as dry socket or infection.The first 24 hours after surgery are very important for the healing process. Brushing your teeth or other cleaning measures may disturb the stitches or interfere with blood clotting, which can prolong healing or cause infection., Avoid brushing the area where you had your wisdom teeth removed for three days after surgery. Instead, you can rinse out your mouth with ½ cup warm water and a pinch of salt beginning the day after your surgery.Do not spit the saline rinse out. Instead, gently tilt your head from side to side to allow the water to wash the area, and then tilt your head to the side to allow it to drain.

, On the day of your surgery, resume brushing your teeth very gently. Be sure to avoid the surgery site so that you don’t irritate it or disrupt the blood clots that protect the surgery site.Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and gently and slowly brush your teeth using small circular motions.Do not spit out toothpaste for the first few days after your surgery. Spitting could disturb the blood clot that needs to form over the wounded gums. Instead, use a saltwater rinse or antiseptic mouthwash to gently rinse your mouth, and then allow the rinse to drain by tilting your head to the side.

, Once you've reached the third day post-op, you can resume your regular brushing and flossing routine. Continue to be gentle with the site of your surgery so that you don’t irritate it.When brushing your teeth, remember to also brush your tongue in order to remove food particles and bacteria, which could enter the wounded gums and cause an infection.

, If you follow your doctor’s order and keep your mouth and teeth clean, this will minimize the risk of infection. It’s important to look for the signs of infection, though, and contact your doctor if you see any of them to avoid post-operative complications.


See your doctor immediately if you experience problems swallowing or breathing, have a fever, see pus near the surgery site or in your nose, or have swelling that worsens., The day following your surgery, start using a simple solution of salt water to help keep your teeth and mouth clean in between brushing. This will not only help keep your mouth clean, but also help reduce inflammation.Make a salt solution by dissolving 1/2 teaspoon of salt in an 8 oz glass of warm water.
Gently swish around a mouthful of the saline solution for 30 seconds. Don't spit it out: tilt your head to the side and allow the water to drain. This will avoid disturbing the empty tooth socket.
Rinse with the salt water after every meal to help clear out debris in your mouth.You can also use a mouthwash to rinse your mouth if it doesn't contain alcohol, which can irritate your surgery site.

, Your doctor may provide you with an irrigator, or a small plastic syringe, to rinse out your mouth. Use this after meals and at bedtime if your doctor advises this treatment.Your doctor may prescribe the irrigator only on the lower extraction sites. Make sure to follow his or her instructions.
You can use the simple saline solution to fill the irrigator.
Make sure to get the tip of the irrigator close to the surgery site flush it out. You can also use it to flush out your teeth. This may be slightly painful, but keeping your mouth and the surgery area clean will help reduce the chance of infection or dry socket., The water pressure from these tools is too great to use immediately after surgery and could disturb your tooth socket, delaying healing. Unless your dentist specifically recommends otherwise, don't use a waterpik or water flosser for one week after having your wisdom teeth removed., For the first few days after surgery, don't use a straw to sip beverages or foods like smoothies. The suction could disturb the healing process., It’s important to make sure that you drink plenty of water after your surgery. This will keep mouth moist and help avoid dry socket and infection.Avoid caffeinated and carbonated beverages during the first day.Avoid alcohol for at least a week after surgery., Hot drinks such as tea, coffee, or cocoa could dislodge the blood clots forming in the empty socket where your wisdom tooth was. These blood clots are necessary to the healing process., Don't eat anything that could get caught in the empty sockets or disrupt clotting. Use your other teeth to chew, if you have to chew your food.This will minimize the amount of food that can get stuck in between your teeth and potentially cause infection.In the first day post-op, eat foods like yogurt and applesauce, which won’t irritate your mouth or get lodged in your teeth, which could cause infection. Soft oatmeal or cream of wheat are other good options.Avoid, hard, chewy, brittle, very hot or spicy foods that might irritate the surgery site or get lodged in your teeth, making the conditions ripe for infection.Rinse with warm salt water after every meal for the first week following surgery., If you smoke or chew tobacco, avoid them for as long as possible. Doing this will help ensure a full and timely recovery and also keep infection and inflammation at bay.Consuming tobacco following oral surgery can delay healing and also increases your risk for complications such as infection.If you smoke, wait at least 72 hours to have a cigarette.If you chew tobacco, don't use it for at least a week., It’s normal to have pain for a few days following the removal of your wisdom teeth. Use either over the counter pain relievers or a prescription pain medication to help alleviate pain and some swelling.


Take NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) such as ibuprofen or naproxen. These will help alleviate some of the swelling associated with the surgery. You can also use acetaminophen, but this does not manage inflammation.
Your doctor may prescribe a pain medication if over the counter pain relief doesn’t work for you., You’ll likely have some swelling for a few days after surgery. This is normal and applying an ice pack to your cheeks will help reduce swelling and pain, including around your teeth.The swelling usually goes away after 2-3 days.Patient should relax and avoid strenuous activity or exercise until swelling resolves.

Non-bloody diarrhea.



 


Nausea.






Vomiting.






Abdominal cramps.






Mild fever around 100-degrees F.






Headache or dizziness.






Physical aching or tiredness.





;
, A simple stool sample test can determine whether or not you are experiencing a rotavirus or norovirus. Your doctor may also test for bacterial and parasitic infections., Often laying down and/or curling into a fetal position can feel more comfortable when you are experiencing gastrointestinal pain.

, Peppermint reduces spasms in the stomach that lead to vomiting and soothes the overall digestive tract.


If drinking ginger ale, make sure to choose a variety make with real ginger. Ginger has anti-inflammatory properties that soothe your stomach.
You may also chop up fresh ginger and allow it to steep in hot water for about 10 minutes before drinking.

, A common cause of gastroenteritis is dehydration. Make sure to intake 3 liters (0.8 US gal) of water per day for men and 2.2 liters (0.6 US gal) of water per day for women.Drink water enhanced with electrolytes such as Pedialyte, Gatorade, Powerade, or coconut water, especially if you are vomiting or experiencing diarrhea. This will help your body make up the vitamins and minerals it might have lost during that time.
Take oral rehydration salts if you are prone to dehydration. These are available at your pharmacy and replace glucose and other essential minerals that you lose when you are dehydrated.Do not drink fruit juice or milk if you are experiencing gastroenteritis. The sugar in fruit juices and the dairy in milk can be upsetting to sensitive or allergic stomachs.
Consult a medical professional if your dehydration does not improve or worsens, you may need to be started on a fluid IV.

, Chop up ice in a plastic bag with a meat mallet or a hammer until it is in little chips. If you have an ice maker, simply set it to the chipped ice setting. Suck on small ice chips to rehydrate yourself and bring your temperature down if you are experiencing a fever.

, While you are experiencing the worst symptoms of gastroenteritis such as vomiting, stop eating solid foods for a day or two. If you choose to stop eating solid foods, make sure you are still receiving the proper nourishment to allow your body to heal itself. Drink a product such as Ensure, which is rich in the vitamins, minerals, and electrolytes needed to nourish your body.


When you resume eating solid foods, do so gradually. If you immediately rush back into consuming a hamburger, for instance, your body will likely be shocked and you will end up with an upset stomach.
Start off with relatively bland foods such as crackers, toast, gelatin, bananas, rice and chicken., The BRAT diet outlines a diet composed of bananas, rice, apples and toast for up to two days following an experience of gastroenteritis.


These four foods are rich in fiber and are very easy to digest. While is it not a sustainable diet for continued use, it is highly desirable following a bout of gastroenteritis.
Common variations of the diet include adding yogurt and tea., Certain indigestion medications may help with the symptoms of gastroenteritis. Some common medications include Pepcid, Maalox, and Pepto Bismol. These medications will only truly help if you are experiencing indigestion, acid reflux, or excess gas, but they can help calm your stomach.


Avoid taking pain medications, as these can further upset and damage your stomach lining. Be especially wary of taking medications that contain ibuprofen, which is known to be particularly hard on the stomach.
Always be aware of any drug allergies that you have before taking medication and only mix medications if the labels denote that doing so is appropriate for your symptoms. Consult a doctor or a nurse advice line if you are unsure about a certain medication.

, Ultimately, there is no real cure for gastroenteritis, but don't be discouraged, it will pass. Gastroenteritis usually passes through your system within two to three days, but can last for up to 10 days. If symptoms do not subside, consider consulting a medical professional.

, If none of the non-prescription medications or immediate home remedies are easing your symptoms, consider contacting a doctor and obtain prescription-strength medication.


Commonly prescribed medications for reducing vomiting include (Phenergan), prochlorperazine (Compazine) and ondansetron (Zofran). They are often prescribed as suppositories or administered through an IV to avoid the possibility of the patient vomiting the pills after taking them.
To reduce diarrhea, your doctor may prescribe diphenoxylate and atropine (Lomotil) or loperamide (Imodium).

, Common symptoms of gastroenteritis can also be indicators of more serious gastrointestinal diseases.


Common treatments for gastrointestinal disorders include antibiotics, steroids, and immunosuppressant medications.
Accurate diagnosis is extremely important when treating gastrointestinal disorders. Be sure to visit a gastrointestinal doctor and undergo the appropriate testing in order to receive a proper diagnosis.

, In some countries, a vaccine against rotavirus is available for children. Children under one year old can be administered the vaccine. In most cases, the rotavirus vaccine will prevent a child from experiencing severe symptoms of gastroenteritis throughout his or her life., Use hand sanitizer often. Always wash your hands after going to the bathroom, visiting public spaces, before and after eating, and whenever deemed appropriate throughout the day. Be sure to wash any clothing items, bedding, and/or washable toys that come into contact with an infected individual to avoid spreading the virus.

, Use a chlorine bleach-based cleaner to sterilize countertops in your home and avoid bacteria from spreading.

, Over the course of a day, the average person often comes into direct contact with bacteria and viruses that have the potential to cause sickness. Be sure to avoid touching your face, especially orifices such as your mouth, nose, eyes, and ears as much as possible throughout the day. Be sure to wash your hands before touching your face if possible.

, These foods have a higher ability to spread the stomach flu virus. Meats are especially prone to carrying the virus. Consume undercooked and raw meats and other foods with extreme caution.

Do not drink untreated water or unpasteurized milk when possible. Untreated or unpasteurized waters can carry illness-inducing bacteria and viruses. Only drink from sealed bottles and use bottled water to brush your teeth when you are travelling.
Wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly before consuming to remove any outstanding bacteria from the outside of the produce.

If you're outside, try to get away from people and their belongings. Nothing makes you more ticked off when some random drunk comes and spews all over your car. Try to find a forest or an empty lot. You can throw up on the open ground in one of those areas.;
, Some people are assaulted with waves of nausea, and aren't really sure that they need to throw up. In this case, vomiting might not be all that comfortable because it's unnecessary. Other people know that they're going to vomit — perhaps they've had too much to drink — and purging is an inevitability. Look for these telltale signs that you or someone else is going to vomit:

"
Try digesting something bland, like crackers.,
Start simple and ramp your way up.,
Suck on a mint or chew gum to jump-start your intestines in the right direction.,
Avoid acidic, spicy, fatty, or fibrous foods.These foods make your stomach work overtime, meaning that the chance you feel you need to vomit increases.",How to Stop Vomiting2," Dry crackers in small amounts may decrease nausea. That's because foods high in starch, such as crackers or toast, can help absorb stomach acids.If eating crackers works, you may have been hungry, not ill.

, Remember that, when you begin to eat again, you should start with some simple carbohydrates, such as gelatin. Slowly work your way up to proteins like chicken noodle soup. Save fats for last, as fat is toughest to digest and can disrupt your already weakened stomach.

, Fresh-tasting mints are great as a palate-cleanser and may help reduce nausea. As mentioned earlier, candied ginger is also a good solution to keep the vomiting sensation away.

, Acidic, spicy, and fatty foods are all self-explanatory. Fibrous foods include many vegetables, meats, and coarse grains.


If diarrhea accompanied your vomiting, avoid dairy products as well. Like other foods mentioned above, dairy can be hard for the stomach to process.
Avoid very hot or very cold food. Your stomach has to work overtime to make very cold food warm enough to process, and very hot food cool enough to process.

Stick with water in the beginning.,
After you've had water, stick with clear liquids, and preferably something with electrolytes.,
Use syrups and tonics to help calm your stomach.,
Avoid liquids with caffeine, carbonation, and high amounts of acidity.This includes many sodas and coffee, as well as fruit juices like orange juice, grapefruit juice, or lemonade.

,
Try to drink a little ginger tea in order to quell your nausea.",How to Stop Vomiting3," If you've been vomiting a lot recently, drink only small amounts of water at a time. Too much water processed too quickly can cause you to begin to throw up.If you want, try sucking on an ice cube. The cool water feels good going down your throat and it's nearly impossible to drink too much water by melting the ice cube in your mouth.

, Clear liquids aside from water are helpful in replacing certain essential vitamins that you may have lost while previously vomiting.


If you can, try to drink liquids that are high in potassium and sodium. These are among the body's most important electrolytes.They are often lost when the body goes through the vomiting process.
Acceptable ""clear"" liquids include:

Weak tea
Bouillon
Apple juice
Sugar free sports drinks



, Coke syrup (the kind used in soda machines) may work in soothing your upset stomach, as might over the counter syrups like Emetrol. Children should have 1-2 teaspoons while adults should have 1-2 tablespoons.


While there is little science to back up the claim that coke syrup works, it has been used for generations in order to soothe upset stomachs. In fact, it was originally used as a stomach tonic.
Syrups like Emetrol can be safely used by children. Although it is often used by women who are pregnant, the manufacturer's guidelines recommend checking with your doctor before taking.

,, Ginger has been a renowned nausea-buster for quite some time now, beating out dramamine in effectiveness in one particularly noteworthy study.You can purchase bagged ginger tea or brew your own ginger tea with honey, also called Tisane.


If you don't want warm tea but still want the soothing benefits of ginger, try drinking ginger ale. Pop open a can and let the carbonation die off first; remember that carbonation can upset an already fragile stomach, causing vomiting.Another option to try if you want ginger but can't stomach any fluids is to try candied ginger. Try nibbling on a small amount of candied ginger once every 45 minutes.

Try Dramamine if your vomiting is induced by nausea.,
If pain is accompanying your illness or vomiting, take acetaminophen.,
Get a prescription for a scopolamine patch.,
If your vomiting hasn't stopped after two days for adults, or one day for children, see a doctor.You could be dangerously low on fluids and may need to be hooked up to an IV.

",How to Stop Vomiting4," Dramamine, or ""dimenhydrinate"", is used to cure nausea, an upset stomach and vomiting. It should not be taken by children under 2 years of age. If you suspect that a certain activity is going to make you nauseous or might induce vomiting, take Dramamine 30 to 60 minutes before starting the activity., Unlike NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), such as aspirin or ibuprofen, acetaminophen will relieve pain without making your nausea any worse.

, Scopolamine patches prevent nausea and vomiting and are applied as a patch to the skin directly behind the ear.Be advised, however, that scopolamine patches carry a long list of side-effects that may outweigh the troubling but tolerable existence of nausea.

Seek medical attention for vomiting that lasts more than four hours.,
Ask your doctor if you should stop taking oral medications.,
Have your doctor test for underlying conditions.,
Ask your doctor to recommend a medication.",How to Stop Retching After Vomiting2," Uncontrolled vomiting for more than more fours straight is a cause for concern. If you can’t stop vomiting and aren’t able to keep down any liquids, you might need medical attention to avoid dehydration.You should also see a doctor promptly if you vomit blood, are experiencing diarrhea, or have a fever.

, If you take any oral medications regularly, taking them during a vomiting spell could upset your stomach. Further, if you vomit them up immediately, your body didn’t absorb them.Call your doctor or pharmacist and tell them about your condition. Ask them, “Should I hold off taking my prescription until a few hours after I’ve stopped vomiting?”

, Vomiting and retching could be associated with any number of medical conditions, from food poisoning to chronic digestive issues. If you experience regular patterns of vomiting and retching, you should talk to your doctor about imaging, urine, and blood tests to diagnose any underlying conditions.X-ray and ultrasound imaging can rule out ulcers, blockages, gallstones, and other issues.
Blood and urine tests can detect infections or kidney issues.

, Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about taking an over the counter or prescription medication. Ask them if they recommend an anti-nausea or antacid, or combination of the two. If your digestive issues are related to anxiety, ask them about a prescription anti-anxiety medication.If you’re undergoing cancer treatment therapy, there are anti-nausea medications that your doctor or specialist can prescribe for your specific form of treatment."
"
Take medication as directed.,
Drink at least six to eight glasses of water between meals.,
Eat smaller meals throughout the day.,
Get plenty of rest.",How to Stop Retching After Vomiting3," If your doctor has recommended an anti-nausea, antacid, or anti-anxiety medication, take it daily or at the first sign of nausea according to their instructions. If you find that your medication is ineffective, ask your doctor or pharmacist to modify your treatment regimen.It might take some time to tailor your treatment plan to combat symptoms of chronic conditions, like cyclic vomiting syndrome or migraine-related episodes.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist to recommend an alternative medication if you experience any side effects, such as diarrhea, headache, dizziness, or drowsiness.

, To stay hydrated, you’ll need at least six to eight daily glasses of liquid. However, drinking during meals can upset your sensitive stomach. Try drinking water between meals instead of having a tall glass with a meal., Larger meals can overwhelm and upset your stomach. Try eating five smaller meals instead of three larger meals per day. Eat slowly and avoid rushing through meals.Rest after you eat in an upright position to make digestion easier.

, Whenever you feel like retching or vomiting, cease activity to avoid worsening your nausea. Take some time to rest until your symptoms pass.Vomiting and retching take a toll on your body, so make sure to get extra rest during a vomiting spell.

Determine whether you have hemorrhoids.,
Clean your anal area.,
Don't use a towel.,
Apply witch hazel.,
Let the area air dry for a few minutes.",How to Use Witch Hazel to Reduce Hemorrhoids1," Hemorrhoids are swollen veins in the anal canal that can be present either outside or inside the body. They form when too much pressure on on the veins causes them to swell.This can happen when you strain while having a bowel movement, during pregnancy, or as a result of being overweight. Hemorrhoids are a common condition that can often be resolved with home treatment, including witch hazel. Symptoms include the following:Itching, irritation or pain in the anal area.
Bleeding when you have a bowel movement (the blood will be bright red).
A swelling or lump in the anal area.
Check with your doctor before trying home treatment if you are unsure whether your symptoms are the result of hemorrhoids.;
, Bathe or shower daily to keep your anal area clean. Baths are preferable to showers because it allows the area to sit in warm water for longer. You don't need to use soap, but use warm to hot water. Be gentle when cleaning your anal area, as scrubbing harder can cause irritation., After drying off the rest of your body, use a hair dryer to dry off your anal area. Rubbing with a towel can make the problem worse., Use a clean piece of cloth. Soak it in a witch hazel-alcohol extract. Blot it gently on the affected area. You can hold it on for a few minutes.If you prefer, you can use pre-made witch hazel pads, made specifically for use with hemorrhoids.This application is best for external hemorrhoids, as it only reaches the outer part of your anus. Internal hemorrhoids are ones that remain inside your anal cavity, while external ones bulge out past your sphincter., Once you remove the cloth, let the area air dry for a few minutes before putting your clothes back on.

Prepare a bath.,
Add Epsom salts to the water.,
Use a washcloth if you cannot take a bath.,
Dry off your anus.",How to Use Tucks Pads for Hemorrhoids1," Before you use a TUCKS® pad, you will need to ensure that the anal area is clean. The best way to clean the anal area is to take a warm Sitz bath. Sitz baths only require a few inches of water to soak the anus but you can take a full bath if you prefer. If you prefer the traditional Sitz bath, just fill the tub with a few inches of water.You can also buy a Sitz bath at a pharmacy or medical supply store. These are small basins that you can attach to your toilet seat and use to wash your anal area.;
, Add about one cup of Epsom salts to a full bathtub or two to three tablespoons of Epsom salts for a few inches of water in the tub. Keep the water warm, but not too hot. Repeat the bath two times per day., If you cannot take a bath, get a clean, cotton washcloth and soak it in warm water. Apply the compress for about 10–15 minutes, directly on the hemorrhoid three times per day or before each time you use a TUCKS® pad.

, Using a clean cotton towel, dry your anus well.Make sure that you pat the area dry. Do not rub the area because this may make the hemorrhoid worse.

Soak in warm water or a sitz bath.,
Apply an ice pack to the hemorrhoids.,
Apply a topical cream.Try a topical cream with phenylephrine to constrict the vessels, which may reduce bleeding.,
Use soft toilet paper and resist the urge to scratch.,
Take supplements to reduce bleeding.,
Reduce pressure on the hemorrhoids.",How to Stop Bleeding Hemorrhoids1," To reduce irritation, ease pain, and help shrink the veins, soak the hemorrhoids for 15 to 20 minutes three times a day in warm, not hot, water.If you don't want to run a bath, try a sitz bath, which is a plastic tub that goes over your toilet seat. This lets you soak your buttocks and hips while in a seated position. It can reduce irritation, spasms of the rectal muscle, and itching.You can also place ¼ cup of sea salt in the sitz bath and sit 30 minutes at a time. Salt is an excellent antibacterial and is used to help with wound healing and drawing out infection.You may also add witch hazel, known for being a soothing and cooling remedy for hemorrhoids. This should be done a minimum of once a day and the Sitz bath should last for anywhere between 15 and 20 minutes.;
, Place the ice pack in freezer until it's completely frozen. Take care not to apply the ice directly to the hemorrhoids. Instead, wrap the compress in a clean towel or cloth before pressing it gently on the hemorrhoids. Do not leave the pack on for long periods of time or it may damage the surrounding skin. It is best to apply for few minutes, remove it until your skin is back to room temperature and then apply it again.


This will help reduce the pain and swelling by reducing inflammation.It will also constrict the vessels which will stop the bleeding.

, You can also apply a cream to sooth the pain, irritation, and itching (which may cause bleeding). However, these will not stop the bleeding. Soothing creams can include hydrocortisone, aloe, witch hazel (herbal plant extract), and vitamin E.


If you use hydrocortisone, apply it morning and night, but don't use it for more than one week.Too much absorption may lead to an imbalance in your hypothalamus and pituitary hormones or cause the skin in the area to become thin.

, Rough toilet paper can scratch and/or irritate the skin even more. To soothe the pain and reduce irritation, use moist or medicated towelettes. You can also use witch hazel, hydrocortisone, aloe, or vitamin E medicated pads. Do not wipe aggressively, which can irritate or cause further bleeding. Pat or blot the area instead.


Scratching will only increase the bleeding and irritation, causing extra stress on your already tender hemorrhoids. This could lead to further infection.

, Many of these supplements may be hard to find in drug stores, so check for them online and in herbal stores. Always talk with your doctor before taking supplements, especially if you're taking other medications. If you're pregnant or nursing, talk with your doctor before supplementing, since most of these have not been tested for use by pregnant or nursing women. These supplements or traditional medicines include:


Fargelin extra: Take these traditional Chinese medicine tablets three or four times a day to strengthen veins which can reduce bleeding.Oral Flavonoids: These have been shown to reduce bleeding, pain, itching, and recurrence. They increase vascular tone which reduces the leaking of tiny blood vessels (capillaries).Calcium dobesilate or doxium tablets: Take these for two weeks and follow the packaged instructions. These drugs have been shown to decrease leaking of tiny blood vessels (capillaries), prevent clots, and improve blood viscosity. All of these things can reduce the swelling of tissues that cause hemorrhoids., This can help prevent or put less strain on the hemorrhoids. Eat a high-fiber diet to soften your stools and reduce constipation. Try to eat fruits, vegetables, and whole grains or take supplements (aim for 25 grams a day for women or 38 grams for men of total fiber). Drink plenty of fluids and establish regular bowel habits and especially avoid straining when having a bowel movement You should also avoid sitting for long periods of time which can increase pressure on your hemorrhoid veins, causing them to bleed. Exercise and walk to reduce the pressure.Use a donut cushion to help ease your body weight off the affected area. To use it, sit on the center of the cushion with your anal area right over the gap. It may actually put more pressure on the anal area, so stop using it if your symptoms get worse or bleeding continues or starts again."

The fiber from these foods can help your body absorb water and make your stools firmer which can slow down the diarrhea.Avoid eating fatty, oily or spicy foods, acidic foods (like orange juice, tomatoes, pickles), chocolate, ice cream and eggs.


For a light meal with fiber, try cooking grains in a light chicken or miso broth. Use at least twice as much liquid as grains. For example, cook 1/2 cup barley in 1 to 2 cups of chicken broth.

, Purchase probiotic supplements and take them according to the manufacturer's or your doctor's instructions. These can improve the balance of bacteria in your gut. If you take probiotics while having diarrhea, they can compete with the disease-causing bacteria.Good sources or types of probiotics include:


Yogurt containing active cultures
Yeast (Saccharomyces boulardii),, If you don't feel like eating much, snack on salted crackers to calm any nausea or vomiting. When you do feel ready to eat something, choose food from the BRAT diet.

Get a hemorrhoidectomy for external or internal hemorrhoids.,
Have a rubber band ligation for internal hemorrhoids.,
Get injection (sclerotherapy) for internal hemorrhoids.,
Have laser or radio treatment (infrared coagulation) for internal hemorrhoids.,
Get cryotherapy for internal hemorrhoids.,
Staple the internal hemorrhoids.",How to Stop Bleeding Hemorrhoids2," This is the usual method for treating external hemorrhoids, especially if they are large or haven't responded to less invasive procedures. Your surgeon removes hemorrhoids with various tools such as scissors, scalpels, or a ligasure (device that delivers electrical current to seal bleeding hemorrhoids). You'll be sedated using a local anesthetic combined with sedation, a spinal anesthetic or a general anesthetic.Hemorrhoidectomy is the most effective and complete way to treat severe or recurring hemorrhoids. It can be painful, but medications, sitz bath, and/or ointments can be prescribed or used after the procedure for comfort.
Compared with hemorrhoidectomy, stapling has been associated with a greater risk of recurrence and rectal prolapse, where part of the rectum protrudes from the anus., Your doctor will insert a probe through an anoscope (plastic device inserted in anus to view rectum). He will then attach a rubber band-like device at the base of the hemorrhoid. The device will cut off blood circulation and lead to the hemorrhoid scarring, which shrinks and eliminates the hemorrhoid after a time.You may feel uncomfortable after the procedure. Get some relief by using a sitz bath, warm water soaks, and/or topical ointment.

, Your doctor will use a plastic device inserted into the anus to view the rectum (anoscope). The doctor will use it to inject a needle with chemical solutions such as 5% phenol in oil, vegetable oil, quinine, and urea hydrochloride or hypertonic salt solution at the base of the hemorrhoids. These chemical solutions will cause the veins to shrink.


Sclerotherapy is considered less effective than rubber band litigation., Your doctor may use infrared lasers or radio frequencies to coagulate the veins near the hemorrhoids. If the infrared method is used, a probe is applied to the base of the hemorrhoid. If a radio frequency is used, a ball electrode is connected to a radio-frequency generator. This is placed on the hemorrhoidal tissue, which causes it to coagulate and evaporate.


Infrared treatments are more likely to result in recurring hemorrhoids, compared to rubber band litigation., Your doctor will use a probe capable of applying cold temperatures to the base of the hemorrhoid. This should cause destruction of the tissue. But, this method isn't used very often, since the hemorrhoids usually return., Your surgeon will use a device to staple slipped or prolapsed internal hemorrhoids back within the anal canal. This will cut off the blood supply to the hemorrhoids so the tissue eventually dies and stops bleeding.The recovery time is usually faster and involves less pain than a hemorrhoidectomy."

Learn the causes of hemorrhoids.,
Recognize the symptoms of hemorrhoids.,
Check to see if you have hemorrhoids.,
Know when to see a doctor.,
Know what to expect from a medical examination.",How to Stop Bleeding Hemorrhoids3," Chronic constipation, straining, and long periods of sitting on the toilet are causes associated with hemorrhoids. These can all put more pressure on and block your veins, impairing circulation. Pregnancy is another condition that puts a lot of pressure on these veins, especially during delivery when straining happens and can lead to hemorrhoids.


Hemorrhoids are more common as you get older and in people who are overweight.
Hemorrhoids can either be internal (inside the rectum) or external (around the outside of the anus). Internal hemorrhoids are painless while external ones are painful. But, both types can lead to bleeding if they rupture., If you have internal hemorrhoids, it may be hard to see symptoms until they are bleeding and they'll probably be painless. But, if you have external hemorrhoids, several symptoms will appear including:Painless bleeding during bowel movements. There won't be very much blood and it will be bright red.
Itching or irritation in your anal region.
Pain or discomfort.
Swelling around your anus.
A sensitive or painful lump of tissue near your anus.
Leaking feces.

, Look in the mirror with your back turned to it and note any lumps or mass-like protrusions around your anus. The color may vary from your normal skin tone to darker red. It may be painful if you press on the lumps. If so, you probably have external hemorrhoids. Pay attention to any blood on the toilet paper after you use the bathroom and wipe. Hemorrhoid blood is usually bright red, rather than dark (which could indicate bleeding from somewhere deeper in your digestive system).


It can be hard to see internal hemorrhoids at home without the right tools. Make an appointment with your doctor. You'll be asked to give a detailed medical history to catch any other possible reasons for bleeding such as colon cancer and polyps, since both of these masses can bleed.

, If you still have symptoms or pain after a week of home remedies, you should see your doctor for an exam. Bleeding can be a cause for concern, especially if you're at risk for or have another condition, like inflammatory bowel disease or colon cancer. You should also get medical attention if the blood is dark red or your stools are dark/tarry in color. These can mean there's bleeding higher up in your intestines or from a bleeding mass.Try to estimate how much blood you've lost. If you start to feel fatigue/anxiety, look pale pale, have cold hands or feet, a high heart rate, or confusion accompanied by blood loss, you should see your doctor immediately. You should also be examined if the amount of blood has increased., Your doctor will determine if you have hemorrhoids by looking at the outside of your anus and performing a digital rectal exam. Your doctor will insert a lubricated index finger to feel the walls of your rectum for lumps, masses, and look for any blood. If it's suspected that you have internal hemorrhoids, the doctor may insert an anoscope (a plastic tube) through your anus into the rectum. This lets the doctor shine a light and look for swollen, distended, or bleeding veins.


Your doctor may do a guaiac test, which involves a smear of fecal matter on a strip of paper. This can detect microscopic blood cells within the feces, which can indicate several conditions including hemorrhoids, colon cancer, and polyps.
If you do have a guaiac test, it is important not to eat red meat, turnips, radish, horseradish, cantaloupe or uncooked broccoli three days before, since they can cause false positive results."

Take a diarrhea medication.,
Take a ginger supplement.,
Make a ginger tea.,
Make an herbal tea.,
Try aromatherapy.,
Practice controlled breathing.",How to Stop Vomiting and Diarrhea2," While it might be best to let the diarrhea resolve on its own, you may want to slow down the diarrhea using medication. You can take over-the-counter medications like bismuth subsalicylate or a fiber (psyllium) supplement. Adults can take 2.5 to 30g of psyllium a day in divided doses.Bismuth subsalicylate can be used to treat ""traveler's diarrhea"" and contains mild antibacterial properties.
Psyllium is safe to take during pregnancy or while breastfeeding., For vomiting associated with food poisoning, gastroenteritis and most other non-serious causes, take 1000–4000 mg of ginger (in four divided doses throughout the day. For example, take 250–1000 mg four times a day.Ginger has been used to treat nausea and vomiting of many different causes including chemotherapy-induced nausea, and the nausea of early pregnancy.


Studies have shown ginger to be effective at relieving post-surgical nausea. It inhibits or suppresses certain types of brain and gut receptors that are related to the sense of nausea., Wash fresh ginger and cut off a two-inch piece. Peel the tan colored ""skin"" or peel to get to the pale ginger. Cut or grate it into small pieces to get a tablespoon. Add the ginger to two cups of boiling water. Cover the pot and boil it for another minute. Turn off the heat and let the ginger tea steep for three to five minutes. Pour into a cup and add honey if you like. Drink four to six cups of ginger tea a day.


Use fresh ginger, not ginger ale. Most ginger ales do not contain real ginger and contain high levels of sweetener. You should avoid sweeteners while nauseous because sugar generally makes you feel worse., While more research is needed, some herbs are believed to reduce viral or bacterial infections that cause nausea. If anything, herbal teas may simply let you relax and minimize your sense of nausea. To make herbal teas, add 1 teaspoon of dried powder or leaf and steep it in 1 cup of boiled water. You can add honey and lemon to taste. Use the following:


Peppermint
Clove
Cinnamon

, Take peppermint or lemon essential oil and place a drop of oil on both of your wrists and temples. Both peppermint and lemon oil have been traditionally used to treat nausea. Studies suggest that these oils reduce nausea by relaxation or by influencing the part of the brain that controls nausea.Make sure you don’t have a skin sensitivity. Either put a single drop of oil on your wrist. If you have a sensitivity, you may experience a rash, redness or itching. If so, try the other oil or another method.
Only use essential oils, since candies or scents probably don't have real peppermint or lemon oil and are unlikely to have high enough levels of the oil to be helpful.

, Lie flat on your back and place pillows under your knees and neck for comfort. Put your hands palm down on your stomach below the rib cage. Place the fingers of your hands together so you can feel them separate. This will let you know you are doing the exercise correctly. Take a long, slow deep breath by expanding your belly, breathing through your diaphragm instead of your rib cage. The diaphragm creates suction that pulls more air into your lungs than can be achieved by expanding the rib cage.


Research has shown that controlled, deep breathing can help relieve nausea. Other studies have indicated that breathing can help control nausea after surgery."

Breastmilk (if nursing)

, If your child is older than one year, you can feed her clear chicken or vegetable broths (beef broths can be given, but they often upset a nauseous stomach). You can also give juice mixed with an equal amount of water.


Avoid giving something that's too sugary, like soda or pure juice since these tend to make diarrhea worse., If the diarrhea and vomiting in infants and children lasts longer than a few hours, call your physician. The doctor might recommend an ORS, such as Pedialyte, which contains fluids and electrolytes (minerals) that are needed to prevent dehydration. You can find these at most grocery and drugstores.


For infants and small children, start with about 1 teaspoon of ORS every minute or two. If they can keep the ORS down without vomiting, slowly increase the amount of ORS.You can administer it using a spoon, medicine dropper or cup. With infants, you can wet a cotton washcloth and squeeze drops into their mouths if they won’t take the breast or bottle.
For bottle fed infants, use a lactose free infant formula because the sugar, lactose, can make diarrhea worse.
You can also find Pedialyte popsicles for kids that refuse to drink.

Soak a cotton pad in witch hazel and apply it to the hemorrhoids after having a bowel movement.
When you feel the hemorrhoids itching, apply more witch hazel as needed.;
, Suppositories or creams containing hydrocortisone will reduce inflammation and help relieve the pain.The medicines in these creams and ointments can cause skin damage over time, so don't use them for longer than suggested on the packaging.

, Place small ice pack against the anal area for a few minutes. This causes the veins to constrict, thus reducing pain and swelling. Apply ice for no longer than 20 minutes at a time.

, A sitz bath is a warm water bath for the buttocks and hips. Place enough warm water in a big tub (that can fit over a toilet seat) or sit in a regular bathtub with a few inches of warm water. Experts recommend a 20-minute sitz bath after each bowel movement and two or three times a day. This can relieve itching, irritation, and spasms of the sphincter muscle.


Take care to gently pat the anal area dry afterward. Do not rub or wipe hard as this may cause bleeding and irritation."

When these veins swell or bulge with pressure, they’re called hemorrhoids. You can get hemorrhoids inside or outside the anus and, while unpleasant, they’re usually not serious. Pain and itching are the most common symptoms.In addition, you might feel pain in the area while walking or sitting.;
, Hemorrhoids are often particularly painful during a bowel movement, when pressure in bearing down is placed upon the anal and rectal area. In addition to feeling pain, many report feeling the uncomfortable sensation of needing to have another bowel movement right away, even though the bowels have been vacated., One of the most common signs of hemorrhoids is painless bleeding, usually when you go to the bathroom. You might see a bit of blood on the toilet paper or in the bowl. Your bottom may also itch, hurt, or have small bulges around the anus.Hemorrhoids aren’t the only possible reason for these symptoms, though. See your doctor to rule out other problems.

, Small bulges around the anus that look like grapes may be an indication of hemorrhoids. These can be various sizes. Usually, they’re the color of surrounding. But if the lumps are black or dark red/purplish, you need to go to the doctor immediately as it is a sign of a thrombosed hemorrhoid – which needs to be treated by a doctor.

, External hemorrhoids cause the anal area to swell and become tender. There are medications that can reduce swelling, though, including over-the-counter meds called vasoconstrictors that will shrink hemorrhoids. You can also try non-prescription creams and wipes – or even a small ice pack – to ease pain and swelling. Soak in a bathtub filled with a few inches of warm water 2-3 times a day or use a special ""sitz bath"" pan that fits onto your toilet seat. Then, pat dry gently.

, The biggest cause of hemorrhoids is straining during a bowel movement. It puts pressure on the veins in the rectum and anus, causing them to swell and become painful and irritated. If you have infrequent bowel movements or have difficult during bowel movements, you may be more likely to strain. Think about your bathroom habits and determine whether they put you at risk for getting hemorrhoids.


Straining can cause an internal hemorrhoid to pass through the anus, a condition known as a protruding or prolapsed hemorrhoid.This can be a medical emergency if the hemorrhoid doesn’t shrink or return to normal with the application of hemorrhoid ointment.

, Constipation leads to the feeling of being ""backed up,"" which causes people to strain during bowel movements. If you have trouble staying regular, you may be straining during bowel movements in an effort to move things through your system faster.

, Sitting all day long puts pressure on the anal area, which can eventually lead to hemorrhoids. People who drive for many hours, work at desks in offices or who are unable to move around for other reasons are particularly at risk. Assess your daily habits to determine if sitting too much may be the problem.

, Hemorrhoids can be a result of other conditions that irritate the anal and rectal area. An anal infection, for example, can affect the surrounding tissue such that hemorrhoids are formed.

, The extra weight, pressure against internal organs, a change in diet, and the process of childbirth itself can also cause hemorrhoids. Talk to your doctor or OB-GYN if you are having a problem., It has astringent properties that can help to ease the swelling and irritation. Dab a cotton ball in witch hazel and rub it over the affected area. Let it dry for a few moments.If you don't want to use pure witch hazel, you can instead buy a cream containing witch hazel.

, There are several over-the-counter creams that are quite effective in treating hemorrhoids - so much so that in many cases, people who use them don't end up needing to see a doctor. Look for the following types of creams in the drugstore:


Corticosteroid creams, which can reduce the itching and swelling.
Creams containing lidocaine can also help reduce the pain.
Vasoconstrictor ointments, creams, and suppositories.

, Since having bowel movements can be very painful when hemorrhoids are present, many find that using a stool softener is helpful. It allows you to have a bowel movement without putting extra pressure on the anal and rectal area. Using a stool softener may also help counteract a tendency to strain too much while on the toilet.

, Perfumes, dyes, rough toilet paper, and other irritants can make hemorrhoids feel a lot worse. Use soft, white toilet paper - or even cotton balls, if you're especially sensitive. You might also find it irritating to wear tight pants or stockings.

, Soft cotton underwear allows air to flow in and out of the area, which can keep the hemorrhoids from getting more irritated and painful. Wearing underwear made of a synthetic fabric can keep moisture trapped against the body. It should go without saying that wearing tight underwear and thongs will be uncomfortable and irritating when you have hemorrhoids.

, This bathing method can ease pain and discomfort while you have hemorrhoids. Fill the tub with warm water (not hot) and sit in it for about 15 minutes. Don't add soap or bubble bath, as they might further irritate the hemorrhoids. You can add witch hazel to make the bath even more restorative.

, If your hemorrhoid symptoms don't seem to be affected by your home treatments, and if they don't go away after a week or so, you should see a doctor to determine whether you need medical treatment to take care of the problem. In most cases hemorrhoids are curable at home, but if yours are persistent, there's no need to keep yourself uncomfortable for too long.


As well, the fact that the hemorrhoids aren't going away may be an indication of a deeper problem, such as bleeding coming from someplace other than the tip of the rectum or anus.
Heat treatments and surgery are commonly used to treat severe hemorrhoids.

, Bump up your fiber intake. Fiber softens stools and makes them move through your body more easily. You'll find fiber in things like beans, whole-grain breads and cereals, and fresh fruits and veggies. You may also want to try a supplement if you can't get enough from foods. Add fiber slowly to help avoid gas and bloating., Stay well hydrated to keep stools soft, so that they're easier to pass. Water is the best choice. Drink plenty of water and fluids throughout the day.

Prune juice is also a natural laxative and can help you go.

, Try to get in daily exercise to keep things moving, too. Even brisk walking 20-30 minutes every day can help keep you from getting stopped up."

Drink plenty of water.,
Get more fiber.,
Exercise every day.,
Go to the bathroom right away.,
Try not to strain.",How to Treat Internal Hemorrhoids1," Water is essential to prevent constipation, which is a major cause of hemorrhoids. Make sure that you are drinking around eight 8-ounce (1.9L) glasses of water every day. If you are active or if you still feel thirsty, then drink some more.You can also drink other types of beverages to get more fluids, such as juice, herbal tea, and sparkling water. Just try to avoid caffeinated beverages and alcohol. Beverages that contain caffeine or alcohol may dehydrate you and cause constipation.;
, Getting enough fiber can help to make bowel movements easier and help to treat and prevent hemorrhoids. Aim for about 25 grams of fiber per day. Try to include more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains in your diet to increase your daily fiber intake.Try taking a fiber supplement if you fall short. If you do not meet your daily goal for fiber intake, then you may want to include a fiber supplement to help you reach your goal., Exercise can help to stimulate your digestive system, which can prevent constipation. Try taking a daily walk or riding your bike to get around town. Even little things such as parking further away from the entrance at the mall or taking the stairs instead of the elevator can help you to get more exercise throughout the day., One way to prevent hemorrhoids from becoming worse is to use the bathroom as soon as you have the urge to defecate. Holding onto waste can lead to constipation and constipation is a major cause of hemorrhoids. Pay attention to your body’s signals and go to the bathroom right away if you have the urge to make a bowel movement., Straining can also make hemorrhoids worse, so make sure that you do not try to force a bowel movement. If you cannot have a bowel movement and find that you are starting to strain, then get up from the toilet and try again later.


Do not stay on the toilet and keep trying to go. Long periods of sitting on the toilet can also make hemorrhoids worse.Instead of sitting, try squatting. This may make it easier to pass a bowel movement without straining.You can purchase a stool or other device that makes it possible to hold a squatting position over the toilet.

Use essential oils.",How to Stop Hemorrhoids from Itching1," A sitz bath has become a general phrase for a shallow bath of only a few inches of water. You get in it to soak your anus; however, if you prefer, a full bath can accomplish the same thing. These baths allow for better circulation in the anal area, mostly due to the warmth, and adds extra relaxation and healing of the tissues around your anus. Repeat it two times a day.


You can also buy a sitz bath that fits over your toilet at any pharmacy or medical supply store.Add about one cup of epsom salts to a full bathtub or two to three tablespoons of epsom salts into a few inches of water in the tub or toilet sitz bath. You can also add a tablespoon of witch hazel or baking soda as well.This will help decrease the swelling and inflammation, which will relieve the itching. Keep the water warm, but not too hot. ;
, To help relieve any itching experienced from hemorrhoids, make a towel compress for the area. Soak a clean, soft towel in warm (not hot) water. Apply the compress to your anus for about 10 to 15 minutes. Make sure it is directly on the hemorrhoid. Repeat four to five times a day.


After you finish, use a clean cotton towel to dry yourself thoroughly. Make sure you pat the area. Do not rub your anal region because it will irritate it even more., To relieve itching, you can use a medicated pad. These are available commercially at most drug stores. If you are itching, gently cleanse the area. Next, use one of the wipes to gently wipe the anal area. Do not rub the area. Repeat six times a day.


Make sure you use one of these whenever you have a bowel movement. Always cleanse the area first, then use the pad. Also make sure you throw the pad away after use., Medicated gels and lotions can help reduce itching. Use a small amount of aloe vera gel or Preparation H to help with hemorrhoidal pain and discomfort. Apply it as often as needed.


Avoid any cream that has steroids in it for a long period of time or more than an occasional basis. With repeated use, these can damage the delicate tissue around a hemorrhoid.
If you don't have these, try a tiny bit of baby teething gel on the area. These teething gels contain a local anesthetic that can decrease the itching., Ice packs can help reduce swelling. Apply one to the area once it is clean for not more than 10 minutes. Make sure to wrap the cold compress with a towel so the cold doesn't harm your skin. Repeat several times a day.


You can follow it with a warm compress for 10 to 20 minutes to help ease the discomfort even more. , Herbal astringents, like witch hazel, help with itching skin. Witch hazel acts as an astringent and can help reduce any swelling and itching you experience. Soak a cotton pad with the astringent and apply it after you have cleansed yourself following a bowel movement. Repeat as often as needed, but aim for at least four or five times a day.Never use any herbal astringent on your anus before first cleansing yourself.

, Essential oils may help treat hemorrhoids and reduce itching. To make a treatment, add two to four drops of an essential oil to two fluid ounces of a base oil, such as castor or almond oil. Mix well and apply directly on your external hemorrhoid. You can use one to three oils in your mixture.


Lavender oil can help relieve pain and itching. Cypress oil is used to sooth and help heal the tissues. Tea tree oil is used as an antiseptic and anti-inflammatory oil. Avocado oil can be used as a base or added to other oils. It moisturizes, soothes, and accelerates healing. These can also be applied to internal hemorrhoids, but in general, that would require a partner to apply. If you have a partner willing to help, make sure your partner washes his or her hands before and after application and wear non-latex gloves or a finger cot for the application.

Apply cold treatments to the area.,
Try over-the-counter topical agents.,
Take oral pain relievers.,
Take a stool softener.",How to Stop Hemorrhoid Pain1," Hemorrhoids can be either internal or external. Pain is most often associated with external hemorrhoids. However, you may want to see your doctor for a positive diagnosis.


Internal hemorrhoids develop in the lower rectum, and they are usually painless because the body doesn’t have any pain receptors in the rectum. You may not even know you have an internal hemorrhoid until you notice blood in your stool or the hemorrhoid prolapsing (protruding from the anus).If you have pain associated with your hemorrhoid, then it is likely an external hemorrhoid, which develops under the skin around the anus. If a blood clot forms inside the hemorrhoid, it is called a “thrombosed hemorrhoid,” and the pain is typically described as sudden and severe. Those afflicted might see or feel a lump in the vicinity of the anus. The clot usually dissolves and may leave a skin tag, or excess skin, in the anal area.;
, These baths can provide immediate relief of pain and itching from hemorrhoids. Soak the anal area in warm water for 10 to 20 minutes two to three times per day and following bowel movements. Pharmacies sell small plastic tubs that fit over the toilet seat. Alternatively, you can fill a bathtub to approximately hip level with warm water.Gently pat the anal area dry with a towel or use a hair dryer after each treatment.

, Cold treatment can alleviate swelling and pain associated with hemorrhoids. You can apply a frozen, water-filled condom or ice cubes wrapped in a cloth to the anal area for 5-10 minutes 3-4 times per day.Gently pat the anal area dry with a towel or use a hair dryer after each treatment.

, Your local pharmacy will have a variety of OTC products designed to help with the pain and discomfort associated with hemorrhoids. Some of these products include:You can use pads such as Tucks as compresses on irritated hemorrhoids up to six times per day to relieve pain and itching. These have witch hazel, which is a soothing, natural anti-inflammatory agent.
Preparation H cream is a topical anesthetic, constrictor of blood vessels (vasoconstrictor), and skin protectant useful in the treatment of hemorrhoids. The cream blocks pain signals coming from the nerve endings of the anal area and also shrinks swollen, inflamed tissue.
OTC creams or suppositories containing the steroid hydrocortisone can also be helpful in the treatment of hemorrhoids. Hydrocortisone is a potent anti-inflammatory agent that can help ease the pain and itching of hemorrhoids. Topical steroids such as hydrocortisone should not be used for more than one week as they can lead to atrophy (or thinning) of the skin in the anal area.
Pramoxine, available OTC and by prescription, is another topical anesthetic used to treat hemorrhoids.

, OTC oral pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil), or aspirin can be used to help relieve the discomfort of hemorrhoids.Acetaminophen can be taken 650-1000 mg every 4-6 hours, not to exceed 4 grams (0.14 oz) in a 24-hour period.
Ibuprofen can be taken 800 mg up to 4 times per day.
Aspirin can be taken 325-650 mg every 4 hours as needed, not to exceed 4 grams (0.14 oz) in a 24-hour period.

, Stool softeners can be helpful if you are experiencing constipation from your hemorrhoids. OTC stool softeners such as docusate (Colace) can be used to keep stools soft and reduce constipation and straining. You can take 100-300 mg of docusate daily for up to one week."
"
Don't strain on the toilet.,
Prevent constipation.,
Try unverified natural remedies.",How to Shrink Hemorrhoids2," Try to avoid straining on the toilet. Straining to have a bowel movement is the leading cause of hemorrhoids. Don't go unless you have to, and don't sit on toilet longer than 5 minutes.


Straining is also called the Valsalva maneuver. During the strain, peripheral venous pressures become increased, causing the dilated veins to become more painful. Try placing a cushion on the toilet (available at drugstores). Sitting on a cushion rather than a hard surface helps reduce the swelling of existing hemorrhoids and prevents the formation of new ones.

, Constipation makes it more likely for straining to occur, making it tough to shrink hemorrhoids. To prevent constipation, drink plenty of water and maximize fiber intake to keep things regular.


A high fiber diet along with adequate water intake helps soften stools and makes them easier to pass thus reducing pain on hemorrhoids.
High-fiber foods include broccoli, beans, wheat and oat bran, whole-grain foods, and fresh fruit.
Fiber supplements can also help. According to Harvard health you may start slowly, and gradually increase your intake to 25–30 grams of fiber per day. Use a stool softener if other methods don't help your constipation.

, Certain herbs and supplements have been said to help shrink hemorrhoids and prevent them from returning. There's no scientific evidence that they work, but many individuals have found relief using these remedies:


Take triphala capsules, available at health food stores. They contain herbs that help with bowel health.
Use horse chestnut and butcher's broom. These substances are used in herbal hemorrhoid creams, and you can also take them in the form of tea.
Use aloe. Eat a teaspoon of aloe after meals, and rub aloe on your hemorrhoids for a cooling effect.

Discuss non-surgical treatment options with your doctor.,
Consider having a hemorrhoidectomy.",How to Shrink Hemorrhoids3," Hemorrhoids that won't go away after you've tried at-home treatments can be removed using a variety of treatment methods. Discuss the following options with your doctor and decide which one is right for your situation:


Rubber band ligation. A band is placed around the hemorrhoid to cut off the supply of blood, causing it to eventually fall off.Injection sclerotherapy. A fluid is injected into the hemorrhoidal tissue, causing it to shrink.
Infrared photocoagulation. A probe is used to irradiate the hemorrhoids that don't respond to other treatments.

, This is the surgical removal of the hemorrhoids and surrounding blood vessels that could lead to recurrence. Recovery time after surgery normally takes just a few days.

Talk to your doctor if you experience pain with an internal hemorrhoid.,
Soak in a warm Sitz bath.,
Take over-the counter pain relievers.,
Insert a suppository.,
Sit on a cushion.",How to Treat Internal Hemorrhoids2," It is rare that internal hemorrhoids cause pain, because there are very few pain receptors in the lower rectum.Pain usually only occurs if the hemorrhoid has prolapsed, meaning it comes out of your anus. This may resolve on its own, or you may be able to push it in yourself; however, if you are experiencing pain with a prolapsed hemorrhoid, it usually indicates that you will not be able to push the hemorrhoid back into your anus and will need to see a doctor.You may also experience severe itching and irritation.
If you develop a blood clot in this area, this will increase the pressure on the hemorrhoid and likely lead to constant and possibly severe pain.

, A warm Sitz bath can also help to soothe hemorrhoids. Try taking a Sitz bath after you have a bowel movement to help soothe and cleanse your hemorrhoids.To prepare a Sitz bath, fill a tub with a few inches of warm water and add about a cup of Epsom salts. Then, sit in the tub for about 15 to 20 minutes.

, Over-the-counter pain relievers may also provide some relief for painful hemorrhoids. Try taking acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or aspirin for hemorrhoid pain. Read and follow the manufacturer’s instructions before use.


Ask your doctor for a recommendation if you are not sure what type of over-the-counter pain reliever you should take.

, If you are experiencing pain, a suppository might help. Suppository treatments for hemorrhoids may reduce the size of internal hemorrhoids by delivering medicine to the base of your hemorrhoids within your rectum. Reducing the size of your hemorrhoids can also reduce pain and discomfort. You can buy over-the-counter suppositories that contain witch hazel and other ingredients meant to treat hemorrhoids.


Keep in mind that suppositories need to be inserted into your anus., Sitting on a hard surface for a long period of time can cause hemorrhoid pain to feel more intense. Instead try using a cushion or a doughnut pillow. Using a cushion or doughnut pillow can make hemorrhoids feel less painful."
"
See your doctor for treatment.,
Ask about rubber band ligation.,
Discuss the possibility of having sclerotherapy.,
Look into coagulation.,
Consider hemorrhoid removal surgery.",How to Treat Internal Hemorrhoids3," One of the main symptoms of hemorrhoids is bleeding from the rectum, but this is also a symptom of colorectal cancer. For this reason, you should visit your doctor as soon as possible if you are experiencing internal hemorrhoid symptoms. Your doctor will perform a physical exam and may also order some imaging tests to rule out cancer. Some of the tests that your doctor may order include:Colonoscopy — For this procedure, a long, flexible tube with a camera and light on the end is inserted into the anus and moved into the rectum and intestine to capture images.

Sigmoidoscopy — This procedure is uses camera and light at the end of a short tube. In a sigmoidoscopy, the camera captures images of the lower rectum and the sigmoid colon (the lowest part of the colon).

Barium enema x-ray — This procedure requires an enema with barium followed by x-rays to capture images of the colon.

, If internal hemorrhoids move outside of the rectum, then you may be eligible for rubber band ligation. In this procedure, your doctor will place one or two small rubber bands around the base of the hemorrhoid.The rubber band cuts off circulation to the hemorrhoid, which may cause some discomfort. There might also be some bleeding. But after a couple of days the hemorrhoid will fall off.

, For this procedure, your doctor will inject a solution into your hemorrhoid that will cause it to shrink. This treatment is effective, but not as effective as rubber band therapy. You might have some pain with the injection, but otherwise this procedure is pain-free., Coagulation uses infrared light, heat, or a laser to treat hemorrhoids. After exposure, the hemorrhoids will harden and shrink. This procedure can treat hemorrhoids, but they are more likely to come back than when treated with rubber band ligation., For large hemorrhoids or for hemorrhoids that have not responded to other treatments, surgery may be the best option. There are two main types of hemorrhoid surgery that are used to treat hemorrhoids:



Hemorrhoidectomy — In this procedure, the surgeon removes the hemorrhoids by making an incision around the base of the hemorrhoid.Keep in mind that you will be anesthetized during the procedure so that you will not feel anything; however, recovery can be painful and you may need prescription pain medicine to deal with pain after the surgery.Stapled hemorrhoidectomy — In this procedure, the surgeon uses staples to block blood flow to hemorrhoids. This procedure is less painful and includes a faster recovery time than a standard hemorrhoidectomy, but it also carries the a higher risk of hemorrhoid recurrence and rectal prolapse (where part of the rectum falls out of the anus)."

Learn the causes.,
Recognize the symptoms.,
Prevent hemorrhoids.,
See your doctor.",How to Stop Hemorrhoids from Itching2," Hemorrhoids are enlarged veins that are found either externally or internally around the anus, the opening of the rectum.Hemorrhoids are most commonly caused by straining or pushing too hard during a bowel movement. They can also be caused by obesity, lifting heavy objects, sitting too long, and pregnancy. Hemorrhoids are also associated with age and a history of constipation.In pregnancy, hemorrhoids occur commonly and are due to the increased pressure caused by the growing fetus, which causes pressure on the veins of the lower abdomen., The most common symptom of hemorrhoids is bleeding during a bowel movement. You may notice blood on the toilet paper or drops of blood in the toilet bowl. Other symptoms of hemorrhoids, especially external ones, are itchiness and pain or tenderness. You may actually feel an external hemorrhoid when cleaning yourself. It will be a tender, puffy swelling around the anal opening.


You won’t usually feel internal hemorrhoids, but they can bulge through the anal opening.
As long as it is only a spot of blood or a few drops of blood in the toilet, there is no need to panic. , Preventing hemorrhoids can be achieved through diet. There are many different techniques you can try, which you can play with until you find what works best for you. Some of the techniques include:


Trying to soften and hydrate the stool by drinking lots of water. Drink nine to twelve eight ounce glasses of water a day. This also helps get rid of hemorrhoids. They will often go away and the swelling will be reduced if the amount of irritation caused by passing stools is minimized. Stool contains significant amounts of water, so the more water a stool contains, the softer and easier to pass it will be.
Increasing the fiber in your diet. Fiber helps keep water in the stool and bulks it up so that it passes more easily. It also helps lessen the pain of hemorrhoids. Eat whole grains, like brown rice, barley, corn, rye, and oatmeal. Fruits, such as cherries, plums, prunes, apricots, and berries, and vegetables, like leafy greens, are great sources of fiber. Also try beans and legumes.
Avoiding laxatives. Laxatives can be habit forming and can also weaken the bowels, potentially leading to chronic constipation., Most hemorrhoids resolve using home remedies and over the counter remedies within four to seven days. If you don’t see improvement (less pain, less itching, less tenderness, and less bleeding) within two to three days, call your doctor. There are medical treatments for more serious cases.


Many, if not most, hemorrhoids can safely be treated at home. If the bleeding doesn’t stop or if there is a large amount of blood, you should call your doctor for an appointment right away. Also, if you are on blood thinning medication and experience rectal bleeding, call your physician right away.
A doctor will generally diagnose internal or external hemorrhoids by visual inspection and performing a rectal exam.If you have internal hemorrhoids, your doctor may remove them using rubber band ligation, which uses a rubber band to cut off circulation to the hemorrhoid. After about a week the hemorrhoid will die and fall off, leaving scar tissue.Other treatments may include coagulation therapy or sclerotherapy."
"
See your doctor.,
Ask about prescription-strength anesthetics.,
Discuss rubber band ligation.,
Talk to your physician about sclerotherapy.,
Investigate coagulation techniques.,
Look into removing the hemorrhoid.,
Consider hemorrhoid stapling as an option.",How to Stop Hemorrhoid Pain2," Sometimes hemorrhoids will improve with home treatment methods and medical treatment will not be necessary. However, you should consult your physician if your hemorrhoid symptoms do not improve with a week of home treatments. Your doctor may discuss a number of prescription-strength or surgical options.


See a doctor right away if your hemorrhoids are causing you pain.
Your doctor may advise you to make some diet and lifestyle changes before trying anything too drastic. These changes may include increasing your fiber intake and getting more exercise.

, If your doctor doesn’t believe a surgical option is necessary, yet he or she wants to help you with the pain associated with your hemorrhoids, he or she can provide a prescription-strength anesthetic, such as lidocaine (Xylocaine), to help deal with the discomfort and itching.

, This is the most common procedure used to treat hemorrhoids. A small elastic band is place around the base of an internal hemorrhoid, which cuts off the circulation to the hemorrhoid. With no circulation, the hemorrhoid will shrink and wither away in a week., In this procedure, a physician injects a chemical solution into the hemorrhoid, which causes scarring and shrinkage of tissue. Sclerotherapy is less effective than rubber band ligation.Sclerotherapy, however, may not be the recommended option by a number of doctors because studies have shown that while effective in the short term, most patients develop recurrent hemorrhoids., Coagulation techniques use laser, infrared light, or heat. The procedures stop bleeding in small hemorrhoids and also cause them to scar and shrivel. Coagulation has higher rates of recurrence of hemorrhoids than rubber band ligation.This technique is often used for small hemorrhoidal tissue for which rubber band ligation is not an option, or it may be used in association with rubber band ligation as the combination of the two techniques has shown as 97 percent success rate.This method also leads to some of the shorter recovery times for hemorrhoid surgery at one to two weeks., This procedure is known as a hemorrhoidectomy. The offending external or internal hemorrhoid is surgically removed. It is the most effective method of treating severe or recurring hemorrhoids. It cures 95% of patients and has a low rate of complications.This procedure is typically performed in the cases of strangulated internal hemorrhoids, mixed internal and external hemorrhoids, or preexisting anorectal conditions that necessitate surgery.This option is also known for the larger degree of pain associated with the healing time.Recovery time for removal options is approximately two to three weeks with a follow-up visit to your surgeon., With stapled hemorrhoidectomy (or stapled hemorrhoidopexy), a physician uses a stapling device to anchor the bleeding or prolapsed hemorrhoid in its normal position. The stapling procedure blocks the blood flow to the hemorrhoid, which causes it to shrink.


Compared to hemorrhoidectomy, stapling has a higher risk of hemorrhoid recurrence and rectal prolapse, which is when the rectum protrudes out of the anus.However, this surgical procedure is also known for its marked decrease in postoperative pain for the patient versus standard hemorrhoidectomy."

Increase the amount of fiber in your diet.,
Drink more water.,
Exercise regularly.,
Use the bathroom as soon as you feel the urge.,
Avoid sitting for long periods of time.",How to Stop Hemorrhoid Pain3," Increasing your fiber intake can help to prevent constipation, which is the main cause of hemorrhoids. You will find fiber in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. The increased fiber softens the stool, which makes it easier to avoid straining with bowel movements, which is a prime cause of hemorrhoids.


The recommended daily amount of fiber varies from about 20 to 35 grams per day depending on your age and sex. Women under 51 require 25 grams per day, while women over 51 require 21 grams per day. Men under 51 require 38 grams per day, while men under 51 require 30 grams per day.You can also supplement your fiber intake with over-the-counter fiber sources such as psyllium husk (Metamucil, Citrucel).
Increase fiber in your diet slowly to avoid increased gas.
If increasing you fiber intake does not help with your constipation, then you may want to consider incorporating a stool softener, such as Colace, as a short-term solution., Staying hydrated can also help to prevent constipation. Try to drink 6 to 8 eight ounce glasses of water per day. It softens the stool and helps bowel movements pass more easily. This is especially important for individuals using fiber supplementation because not drinking enough water with increased fiber can cause constipation or make pre-existing constipation worse., Regular exercise increases the motility of the bowel, which prevents constipation. It can also help an individual lose weight, which could decrease pressure in the lower rectum and anus, which is another measure for preventing hemorrhoids.Aim for 30 minutes of exercise at least five days per week. You can divide your exercise sessions into shorter ones as well. For example, you could exercise for 15 minutes twice per day or 10 minutes three times per day if that is easier for you.Look for an activity that you enjoy so that you will be more likely to stick with it. Try going for a walk after dinner, riding your bike to work, or taking an aerobics class a few times per week.

, Delaying bowel movements can worsen constipation, which then aggravates hemorrhoids. Try to stay close to a bathroom during your regular times for bowel movements in order to go as soon as you feel the urge.If you cannot go to the bathroom after sitting for about five minutes, then get off of the toilet and come back later. Sitting on the toilet for long periods of time can worsen hemorrhoids., Prolonged sitting increases the pressure in the veins of the lower rectum and anus, which can contribute to the development of hemorrhoids. Try standing up and walking around even for a few minutes whenever you take breaks at work if your job involves lots of sitting."
"
Find some fresh air.,
Sit quietly for a bit.,
Use acupressure.,
Try relaxation techniques.",How to Prevent Yourself from Vomiting1," Tight spaces, or other stuffy situations, can increase nausea. Therefore, if possible, get out of the room for a few minutes, or at least open a window, then take several deep breaths of fresh air., Let your body relax for a few minutes because moving around sometimes makes nausea worse. If you've eaten recently, it's better to sit instead of lying down., Similar to acupuncture, acupressure is based on traditional Chinese practices and uses the body's natural pressure points. Applying occasional pressure to the P-6 pressure point on your wrist, can help lessen nausea and vomiting.With the palm of one hand facing up, place the first three fingers of your other hand over the wrist while feeling for the two large tendons under the thumb. The point you seek is about three finger lengths below your wrist.
Apply pressure to the point using a circular motion while making sure you are pushing down on the point. This should not cause any pain or discomfort and you can continue to apply pressure for two or three minutes.
Repeat on your other wrist. Locate the pressure point on your other wrist, then apply pressure in a circular motion for a couple of minutes.

, Divert your attention from your discomfort by thinking about something calming. This method is most effective if you have practiced the technique before the need arises to relieve your nausea. There techniques which might help:Autogenic relaxation. This involves finding something to take your mind off the nausea (or whatever else you are feeling). Repeat a word or phrase to yourself, not related to your nausea. Try to think of something peaceful or relaxing. As you repeat this idea, make your deepen your breathing and relax your muscles.
Visualization. Picture a peaceful or calming setting in your mind. Think about how your various senses would experience this place, things you might feel, smell, or hear, as well as what you would see. It can help to close your eyes and sit while you do this.
Deep breathing. Find a quiet place to sit. Take a normal breath, then a deep breath. Breath in slowly through your nose, and let the air fill your lungs and abdomen. Exhale slowly, through your mouth is better, but it can be through your nose if that is more comfortable."

Adjust your positioning on the toilet.,
Cushion your butt while sitting.,
Keep your backside cool and dry.",How to Sit with Hemorrhoids1," For most of human history, people defecated by squatting in the woods or over a hole in the ground — and a billion or more people around the world still utilize this position today. Squatting with your knees against your abdomen creates a better internal alignment for the release of a bowel movement (and tends to speed the process), and some experts believe this positioning significantly reduces the likelihood of developing hemorrhoids.If squatting is a step beyond where you’re willing to go to deal with hemorrhoids, try raising your feet while on the toilet. Place a low bench or pile of books under your feet. This will improve your internal alignment and may help you pass stools faster and reduce hemorrhoid-causing pressure.;
, Sitting itself is the real problem when it comes to hemorrhoids, so sitting for too long in even the most comfortable, “cushiony” chairs may leave you with rectal pain and itching; however, a softer seat is preferable to a hard one, so stick a thick cushion or pillow under your rear end when sitting down on a hard chair, bench, etc.You can also find a range of products marketed as “hemorrhoid cushions” (or similar) online. There is no guarantee that any of these will help more than a pillow, but they might. “Donut” style cushions of the type used when someone has had surgery or suffered an injury in the anal region are another option to consider. Try them and see what works best for you.

, If you’ve ever had hemorrhoids, you probably know that getting hot and sweaty “between the cheeks” can make your anus unbearably itchy and uncomfortable. Standing or especially sitting in constrictive, heat- and moisture-trapping clothing can make things even worse. Along with keeping the area clean and dry, then, choosing the right clothing can help soothe your posterior pain.Choose loose-fitting clothing (including undergarments) made of breathable fabrics like cotton. Change into a fresh pair of underwear if the ones you have on get damp from sweat.

Try acupressure.,
Use motion sickness bands.,
Use aromatherapy oils.,
Avoid strong smells.",How to Overcome Nausea at Night1," Targeting the pressure point that eases motion sickness can keep nausea away. This point is the Pericardium 6 (PC6), located on your wrist. Find it by placing three fingers at the crease of your wrist with your palm up. This area on the inside of your arm/wrist can be targeted through pressure from your fingers., These bands, designed to use acupressure to keep you from experiencing motion sickness, are often available at drugstores or travel stores. They are typically a small sweatband that goes around your wrist at the PC6 with a half of a small ball attached to keep constant pressure., Lavender and peppermint are those most associated with calming the stomach and helping nausea. You can use them as essential oils and put them on your wrists, or on a soothing face mask. You could also try them as candle scents.

, Sometimes there are particular smells that can trigger nausea. These might be from food, strong perfume, or rotting or decaying smells. Keep your area well-ventilated (particularly the kitchen and eating area) to combat this."

Insert a suppository.,
Apply an ice pack.,
Take warm Sitz baths after bowel movements.,
Use gentle laxatives only if necessary.,
Try a magnesium supplement.,
Take an over-the counter pain reliever.,
Call your doctor if your hemorrhoids do not improve.",How to Shrink Internal Hemorrhoids1," External wipes and creams will not help internal hemorrhoids, but there are some suppositories available that can help. Make sure that you check with your doctor first and follow the manufacturer’s instructions for use as well. You can find hemorrhoid suppositories in most drug stores. Some available suppositories include:


Calmol. This suppository contains cocoa butter, zinc oxide, and an astringent to help soothe and shrink hemorrhoids.Preparation H. This suppository contains phenylephrine to help constrict and shrink the veins in your anus.;
, An ice pack can help to relieve pain and swelling associated with hemorrhoids. Try applying a towel-wrapped ice pack to your anal region to help relieve any pain and swelling., Taking a Sitz bath after you have a bowel movement may help to relieve the pain and discomfort of hemorrhoids and prevent them from becoming larger. To take a Sitz bath, fill a tub with a few inches of warm water and about a cup of Epsom salts. Then sit in the tub for about 20 minutes. Repeat this treatment after every bowel movement., Avoid stimulant laxatives because these are harsh on your system and may make hemorrhoids worse or lead to chronic constipation.If you do find that you need to take a laxative, then try taking a gentle stool softener such as docusate.

, Taking magnesium citrate supplements may help to soften your bowel movements and prevent hemorrhoids from becoming worse. Start with 100 mg and increase the dose up to about 300 mg per day.It is important to start with a low dose and gradually increase the dosage because magnesium can cause diarrhea.


Talk to your doctor before trying magnesium citrate supplements.

, Internal hemorrhoids are generally painless, but if you do experience discomfort, take an NSAID to decrease the inflammation associated with hemorrhoids and therefore decrease the pain (ibuprofen, naproxen).


Read and follow the manufacturer’s instructions before taking any over-the-counter medicines. Talk to your doctor if you are not sure what dosage is right for you.

, If you do not notice an improvement in your hemorrhoids within three to four days, then call your doctor. You may need to get treatment for your hemorrhoids, such as an injection to shrink the hemorrhoid or heat therapy to shrink the hemorrhoid."

Talk to your doctor before taking medications.,
Try ginger.,
Use an anti-nausea patch.",How to Get Rid of Your Motion Sickness1," You should discuss your options, even over-the-counter and home remedies, with your doctor before treatment. This is especially true if you have medical problems, allergies, are pregnant, or are treating a child.Remember that most of the available options will make you drowsy, and they should be taken about 30 minutes prior to your trip.


Gravol or Dramamine (Dimenhydrinate), from the anti-histamine family, is an excellent option.It is available over-the-counter and helps to reduce motion sickness. Other antihistamines including diphenhydramine (Benadryl) can also be helpful, especially for children.
Zofran (Ondansetron) is a prescription anti-nausea medication that your physician may offer you if Gravol or Dramamine alone is insufficient.Other anti-nausea medications may also be recommended.;
, Ginger is a natural remedy for nausea.Drinking ginger tea, taking ginger pills (available over-the-counter), and even chewing raw ginger sometimes helps cure a person's nausea.


Sipping ginger-ale, or eating foods with ginger (such as ginger cookies, as long as they contain natural ginger and not just artificial flavoring) can also be of help.

, These are available over-the-counter and are called the Scopolamine Transdermal Patch.They are small patches that are placed behind the ear and release the anti-nausea medication slowly. They can last up to 3 days.


Place the patch behind your ear approximately 4 hours before you need it to kick in. Because it is more slow-release than medications in pill form, it is important to apply it well in advance."

Drink some liquid.,
Find something to suck or chew on.,
Eat something bland.,
Take some ginger.,
Take anti-nausea medication.",How to Prevent Yourself from Vomiting2," Water is always a good choice. If available, sweet liquids like flat soda or fruit juice can also help keep your stomach down.Avoid more acidic drinks like orange or grapefruit juice.
If you can't find anything else, sucking on an ice cube can give you water and help control the nauseous feelings, Hard candies like peppermints or lemon drops, or something like peppermint gum can help settle your stomach., Find some plain tasting food, like toast or crackers. If these aren't available, try something like cereal, rice, or fruit.Avoid fatty, greasy, or spicy foods. These will only upset your stomach further.
Make sure your food is cool before eating it. This will reduce the strength of some tastes., Ginger has been found to reduce nausea from motion sickness in some people. You can get ginger from a variety of foods that contain it, including ginger snap cookies, ginger bread, ginger ale soda, and even ginger tea. In general, one gram of ginger spread out in small doses should reduce nausea, so a few cookies or a can of flat soda should be enough.Do not give ginger to children under the age of 2. Pregnant women should first discuss taking it with their doctor, and limit themselves to no more than 4 grams per day.

, These are simple, over the counter pills for motion sickness, like Dramamine, that can reduce nausea, and hopefully prevent vomiting. If you have some available, take one.Avoid medications such as ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin), as these will likely upset your stomach more.If your nausea continues, or has been caused by an outside condition like chemotherapy, talk to your doctor about stronger prescription medications. These can include corticosteroids, dopamine and serotonin antagonists, and aprepitant."
"
Spend less time on the toilet.,
Don’t sit for long stretches elsewhere, either.,
Get moving while you’re standing up.",How to Sit with Hemorrhoids2," Using the toilet often reveals the presence of hemorrhoids, by way of red blood in the water or on your bath tissue. Sitting on the toilet is also one of the major causes of hemorrhoids, especially if you spend a lot of time there or strain while defecating. The quicker you can get on the toilet, have a bowel movement, and get off, the better.Don’t linger on the toilet unnecessarily, for instance by finishing a chapter in your bathroom reading material of choice or playing on your phone.
If your toilet routine takes more than a few minutes because of regular constipation, look into methods of relief like drinking more water, eating more fiber-rich foods, and taking fiber supplements and/or stool softeners.
Also, “when you gotta go” — use the toilet right away. “Holding it in” can cause or exacerbate constipation.

, Sitting causes increased pressure on the veins in and around your anus, and these stressed veins are where hemorrhoids form. Try standing instead of sitting when watching TV, working at a desk (look for an adjustable model that allows you to both sit and stand), and at other times during your daily routine. It’s good for your health and your fight against hemorrhoids.When you do need to sit, take breaks to stand up and move around every so often. This can help prevent the pooling of blood that causes hemorrhoids, and can relieve some of the pain of existing hemorrhoids.

, Standing up instead of sitting is good for your health, and exercising instead of standing still is even better. Walking, dancing, gardening, or any other moderate-intensity activity will benefit your body in many ways — including possibly easing your constipation.Exercise can also help you lose excess weight, which will in turn decrease the pressure on the veins in your posterior when you sit down.

Take action against constipation.,
Keep your “hemorrhoid zone” clean.,
Try topical treatments or medications.,
Consult your doctor.",How to Sit with Hemorrhoids3," Anyone can get hemorrhoids, but people with regular constipation almost always get them. Sitting on the toilet for long stretches and straining to push out hard, compacted stools is a “one-two punch” for hemorrhoid formation and discomfort.One of the easiest ways to battle constipation is to drink more water. Women are recommended to consume 9 cups (2.2 liters) of fluids daily and men are recommended to consume 13 cups (3 liters).Also, add more fiber to your diet. Eat more vegetables, fruits, and high-fiber grains like oats.
Look at the side effects of any medications or supplements you are taking. Constipation may be caused by certain medications. Talk to your doctor about discontinuing or switching your medication if this is the case.
Consider also using a fiber supplement or stool softener as well. Consult your doctor before undertaking any long-term regimen, however.
Keep in mind that to most effectively avoid constipation, you will want to do a combination of these things. Increasing exercise, fluids, and fiber intake, as well as discontinuing any problematic medications, will all work together to ease constipation better than any one treatment done alone.

, Regular, gentle cleaning and drying can help cool and soothe your hemorrhoids. Try, for instance, using pre-moistened (but fragrance-free) wipes instead of standard toilet paper, which tends to be more abrasive and clean less thoroughly.Shower or — preferably — bathe daily and gently clean the area with water alone. Pat the area dry or use a hair dryer on the lowest setting.
You can also use a sitz bath, which is a basin that fits over your toilet bowl and allows you to soak and clean only the target area. Use clean, cool water and sit for 10 to 15 minutes, three times per day (or more as needed).

, The range of treatments and medications available at any pharmacy provides a clear indication of just how common hemorrhoids are. Try various options and see what provides you with relief, but don’t use any hemorrhoid treatment for more than two weeks without clearing it with your doctor first.Hemorrhoid creams or ointments (such as a well-known “preparation”) can help shrink hemorrhoidal tissues and soothe itching and discomfort. Ointments or pads containing witch hazel may also be effective in dealing with itchiness and pain.
On a more basic level, placing a wrapped ice pack or cold compress in your intergluteal cleft (or your ""butt crack"") can provide temporary relief from pain and inflammation.
Pain-relieving medications like acetaminophen or ibuprofen may also provide some measure of relief from hemorrhoidal discomfort.

, If you have rectal itching and discomfort, can feel small protrusions outside your anus, and/or see small amounts of red blood when you defecate, you more than likely have hemorrhoids; however, in rare instances, more serious conditions ranging from anal fissures to internal bleeding to cancer may be the cause. The smartest choice is to see your doctor and verify that you are dealing with hemorrhoids, then discuss treatment options.While most hemorrhoids can be treated at home, some may require intervention by your doctor. Treatments can range from “banding” hemorrhoids so they wither and fall off to surgical removal (hemorrhoidectomy). The nature of your hemorrhoids, your level of discomfort, and many other factors will come into play as you and your doctor determine your best course of treatment.

Attempt to eat the BRAT diet.,
Try bland foods.,
Eat long before bedtime.,
Choose multiple small meals a day.,
Stay away from foods that are greasy, fatty, or spicy.",How to Overcome Nausea at Night2," Bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast are the foods that have been proven to help prevent diarrhea, but can also help symptoms of nausea and vomiting. The BRAT diet is not meant to be used long-term, as it does not provide necessary nutrients to your body. Once your nausea has subsided, you should start adding in fresh fruits and vegetables and then return to your normal diet., If the BRAT diet is too restrictive, you can add bland foods into the mix. Nausea can often be made worse by spicy foods. Even if food doesn’t sound good, attempt to eat some saltine crackers or bread to try and help settle your stomach.

, Eating right before you lay down to sleep can increase nausea. Give yourself enough time to fully digest your meal before sleep. Eating close to bedtime can also increase the possibility of heartburn., Even if your nausea typically occurs at night, eating more frequent, small meals can help prevent nausea. Keeping your stomach mostly full might also help prevent nausea from becoming more severe., These tend to exacerbate nausea. Your body can also have more difficulty processing these foods. It’s best to aim for light and healthy foods (fresh fruits and vegetables) that can keep your body working smoothly.

The teas and their scents can help calm your stomach. You can also try either flavor in different forms — ginger in foods is common, and peppermint candies can also help., Many people find that the bubbles of carbonation can help an upset stomach. Choose ginger ale or citrus-flavored carbonated beverages. Use sparingly, since soda is not very healthy. A small glass can sometimes help, often coupled with some crackers or other bland food."

Try doctor-prescribed medicine.,
Consider marijuana if it's legal.,
Go to the doctor for severe recurring nausea.,
Monitor your symptoms.,
Seek immediate medical attention for some symptoms coupled with nausea.",How to Overcome Nausea at Night4," Some nausea is only going to respond to medication. Follow the treatment regimen described by your doctor. Watch for side effects — many anti-nausea medications cause drowsiness.Prochlorperazine is the most commonly used anti-nausea medication. It is moderately effective for nausea and other GI disorders, but not as effective for chemotherapy-induced nausea.
Metoclopramide and ondansetron are two other anti-nausea medications your doctor may prescribe.
Always follow your doctor's instructions on dosage and duration of medication.

, If you live in a state where medical marijuana is legal, chances are that many doctors prescribe it for the nausea that can accompany chemotherapy. Many studies have shown that it can be an effective treatment for nausea. Keep in mind that marijuana comes in many forms — a candy or other edible form might be a good choice. Talk to your medical professional about a possible prescription.Unfavorable side effects of include vertigo, dry mouth, low blood pressure, and depression.

, If you have experienced nausea for over a month and if your vomiting has lasted more than two days, you should see your doctor. Also go if you have unexplained weight loss. Your doctor will be able to help you, and might include a different diet or even medication., Extreme nausea coupled with other symptoms might mean you need to take a trip as soon as possible to your doctor or a clinic. Take prompt action if nausea is accompanied by:Chest pains
High fever
Cramping
Fecal odor in your vomit
Fainting

Exercise regularly.",How to Shrink Internal Hemorrhoids2," Stool contains a lot of water, so it is important to stay well-hydrated to ensure soft stools. Try to drink at least eight 8 ounce glasses of water per day to help you stay hydrated.You can also drink a few cups of herbal tea to reach your daily fluid intake, but avoid caffeinated beverages. Caffeine has diuretic properties, so it may dehydrate you and lead to constipation.

, Hemorrhoids are often due to straining during bowel movements. To make bowel movements easier, increase the fiber in your diet by consuming more whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and beans.Some good choices include:


Whole grains such as brown rice, barley, bulgur wheat, corn, rye, buckwheat, and oatmeal
Fruits such as prunes, peaches, plums, grapes, apples, and pears
Vegetables such as Swiss chard, spinach, collard greens, lettuces, and beet greens
Beans and legumes such as pintos, garbanzos, edamame, and cannellini beans

, If you are having trouble getting enough fiber from diet alone, then you may want to add psyllium husk or a fiber supplement.Psyllium husk is a natural bulking agent, which may help make your bowel movements easier. You can add psyllium powder to meals, drink a scoop in a glass of water, or take it in tablet form.


Make sure that you read and follow the manufacturer’s instructions for use.

, Regular exercise can help to keep your bowels moving and prevent constipation as well.Make sure that you get up and move around now and then to stimulate your digestive system. Taking a short walk may be enough to help you have a bowel movement.

If you get to the toilet and you cannot go, then sit for a few minutes, but don’t sit too long. Sitting on the toilet for a long time may make hemorrhoids worse., See if you can arrange a regular time to use the bathroom without any interruptions. Having a bowel movement around the same time each day may make your bowel movements easier.For example, you might try to go every day at 8:30am and again at 7:00pm

, Straining is one of the main causes of hemorrhoids, so stop yourself if you notice that you are pushing too hard.If you cannot seem to have a bowel movement and notice that you are straining, then get up and come back in about an hour to try again. In the meantime, drink some water and move around a bit to help loosen things up.

, Sitting on a hard surface can also irritate hemorrhoids and make them worse. Try sitting on a soft foam cushion or on a doughnut shaped pillow instead. A cushion or doughnut pillow may help to relieve some of the pressure and discomfort of sitting on a hard surface."

Eat bland foods during the trip.,
Choose where you sit wisely to minimize motion sickness.It is best to position yourself in areas where you can see out the window, and with the least motion or rocking as possible.,
Distract yourself with calming music.,
Close your eyes.,
Invest in a Sea Band or Relief Band.These and other similar products are advertised as reducing motion sickness by placing stimulation on other parts of the body, usually the wrists.",How to Get Rid of Your Motion Sickness2," Crackers, bread/toast, bananas, rice, and applesauce are all good options.It is also best to avoid alcohol and caffeine, as they can exacerbate motion sickness. Stick to water, non-caffeinated tea, or juice instead, and make sure you stay hydrated during the trip.
Don't eat heavy, greasy, or fried food.

,


In the car, sit in the front seat or drive. Mentally visualize the route before and during the trip to prepare yourself for the movement.
On a boat, try to stay towards the middle as this is where it rocks the least. Keep your eyes on the horizon. Staying outside in the fresh air will also help.
On an airplane, make sure you get a window seat. Stay away from the very back of the plane (this will be bumpier) and from the bulkhead (you'll have no visual cues when the plane is tilting). It's probably best to get a seat towards the front middle of the plane, above the wing.

, A distraction, such as calming music, can bring your focus away from the movement of the plane or vehicle. Other things that might help include sucking on a flavored lozenge (ginger in particular may be helpful) or using aromatherapy scents like mint or lavender.Do not read in an attempt to distract yourself. Reading can lead to or worsen motion sickness.

, Motion sickness occurs when your balance-sensing system (which includes your eyes, inner ear, and sensory nerves) experiences a conflict. You may sense movement with your inner ear, but you may not see any sign of movement (such as when you are on a plane or in a cabin on a boat).Reducing sensory input — closing your eyes, or lying on the ground if you have the space — can help lessen this conflict and may reduce motion sickness., It is unclear whether they are more than simply a placebo, but studies have shown that some people have success when wearing them.


It is hypothesized that, when placed on the wrist, they stimulate the median nerve with pulse-like activity that counteracts the neurological signals for nausea from the stomach.If you are someone who prefers to combat your nausea without using medication, this may be a good option to try!

This tea is a miracle for those mild nausea moments, it also calms you down/relaxes you. It tastes kinda sweet so this one is great. Not a fan of sweet things? Try peppermint. For generations, peppermint has been used for nausea. Don't drink peppermint tea if you have GERD/ acid reflux, it will only make it worse.

, Slowly sip any nonacid fruit juice (not orange juice or other acidic juices). It really helps. Or go for a popsicle and eat it slowly, but don't down the whole box.

, This drug really helps to fight nausea and vomiting on a daily basis.

,

,, Get comfortable, and don't move around much unless you are not vomiting or gagging (about to vomit).

, Staying in a single sick room may be easy, but the air will go stale and make you feel worse. Keep your windows open to allow a breeze of fresh air, and when possible, take a few minutes to step outside.

, Taking a bubble bath may sound great, but adding in overly-scented perfumes will likely upset your stomach more. In general, avoid anything (perfumes or otherwise) with a very strong scent. Smell and taste are connected, so a strong smell can make you feel equally as sick as a bad taste. Kill two birds with one stone by keeping your window open to allow fresh air in, and to keep bad smells out.

, The brightness, noise, and movement associated with your television, laptop, tablet, and phone can be overly stimulating and make an upset stomach worse. Instead, lay in bed with the lights dimmed and read a book or relax in a similar way. Taking time away from your electronics will ease your stomach and prevent an associated headache as well.

, Nothing is worse than feeling sick and being too hot or too cold as well. Stay at a comfortable temperature to make resting easy; add or remove layers of clothing and blankets, or take a short shower or bath. You can change the temperatures of the liquids you are drinking to help as well.

, If the natural remedies just aren’t cutting it for you, switch over to a medication from your local pharmacy or drugstore. Look for medicines that advertise nausea and vomit-fighting, rather than taking a generic all-around medication. Make sure to check the dosage for your medication, and take the pills accordingly.

, If your stomach ache simply won’t go away and the urge to vomit is growing stronger, don’t stop it. Your body is trying to expel the cause of your illness from your body, so let it. Vomiting is certainly not an enjoyable activity, but it does an important job of helping you to heal. You’ll probably feel better afterwards anyway.

Lemons contain vitamin C and helps your body absorb glucose.You can blend these nutritious foods together with ice to make a cold, smoothie-like drink.

, Coconut water is a very hydrating substance. It contains natural electrolytes, including high levels of potassium. If you want, you can add one to two teaspoons of chia seeds to your coconut water.Chia seeds are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which can provide you with energy. They are also rich in protein and fiber., Bananas are high in potassium, while almonds are a rich source of magnesium and potassium. Kale is rich in calcium.

Collect necessary supplies.,
Pick up the chunks gently.,
Take out the vomit.,
Clean surface with soft scrub brush and cleaning solution.,
Rinse stain.,
Use baking soda to eliminate the odor.,
Soak the item.,
Spot clean with baking soda.,
Wash the item.",How to Get Rid of Vomit Smell," In order to remove vomit from a surface you will need to have the appropriate supplies to ensure that you do so without exposing yourself to it. Get paper towels, gloves, and a plastic bag.;
, Take two paper towels and fold them up to make them thicker. Use your paper towel to lift up chunks and place them in the bag. Scoop the chunks gently or you might push the vomit into the carpet, making the stain worse.


Alternatively, you could use a large spoon or spatula to scoop the chunks into the bag., Once all of the large chunks of vomit are gone, leaving only a wet surface, tie the bag tightly and place it in a trash can outside of your living space.

, A soft scrub brush will help you remove any liquids that have solidified on the carpet. Scrub vigorously with a cleaning solution. Several popular mixtures can be used as a cleaning solution.


One method is to mix one part white vinegar with one part hot water in a spray bottle. Spray a good deal of the solution on the stain before scrubbing it.A similar solution is made by combining two cups of warm water and 1 tbsp of table salt. After the salt dissolves mix in ½ cup of white vinegar, 1 tbsp of laundry detergent, and 2 tbsp of rubbing alcohol.”Totally Toddler” is a solution created for cleaning vomit. It can be used the same way any of the other solutions would be used., Spray the area with water and then blot it with a clean cloth. If a wet vacuum or carpet cleaner is available, use it to help dry and clean the surface.If you have used detergent in your solution, be sure to perform this step twice. Dirt clings to detergent, so you will have problems in the future if you don't get it out of your carpet.If you use a towel to clean the area, place the towel on the ground and walk around on it., Cover the area with baking soda and allow it to sit overnight. The following day vacuum up the baking soda. Repeat this step if necessary.To cover the smell in the interim, consider spraying it with Febreze.Light a candle or incense to help cover the smell.
If possible you should also open doors and windows to allow fresh air to circulate.

, After removing chunks, and before washing the item, you should allow it to soak to remove most of the stain. Combine water with 1 cup of your regular detergent and, if possible, some Borax. Allow the item to soak for approximately two hours., If some of the stain is still there, combine a small bit of water with a lot of baking soda to create a thick paste, almost like tooth paste. Rub the paste in with a sponge. Let it sit for several minutes before washing it out.


Repeat if there is still a stain., Wash the item as you normally would, preferably in a load by itself. Use detergent. If the item is white, use bleach as well.


Be sure that the stain is totally removed before washing the item or it could get baked in."

Have some ginger.,
Eat some crackers.,
Try watermelon.,
Eat plain rice.,
Have a banana.,
Scoop up some yogurt.,
Try plain toast.,
Avoid upsetting foods.",How to Fight Nausea2," For years now, ginger has been giving the sick support with its nausea-fighting powers. Head for your pantry and grab some fresh or candied ginger. If you can handle the flavor of fresh ginger, eat it raw. Otherwise, try it candied or grate some into a cup of water to make tea.

, When all else fails, plain crackers tend to do the trick for nausea. They have a mild flavor and are easy to digest, making them the perfect sick food. If you can handle crackers, try upgrading to pretzels which have a bit of a higher nutritional value.

, Although it’s not everyone’s first ‘sick food’ to turn to, watermelon is actually great for helping out with a bout of nausea. The high water content and mild flavor help to settle your stomach and incorporate more fluids into your system. If you have a fever as well, try the fruit chilled for a soothing cooling effect.

, White rice sans toppings isn’t the most flavorful dish, but it is helpful for combating nausea. The easy-to-digest carbs will give you a short boost of energy, while the simple flavor won’t irritate your stomach further.

, Eating a barely ripe banana (more towards the green side, with no spots) is great for several reasons. The soft texture and mild flavor make it easy to digest, plus the fruit is full of potassium which aids your immune system in healing your body. Kill two birds with one stone, and mash your banana up with a cup of white rice.

, Now, most dairy products are frowned upon during a period of nausea. However, yogurt with active cultures helps to supply your stomach with the good bacteria necessary for kicking out the bad bacteria. Therefore, find a simple yogurt flavor that advertises probiotics, and your stomach will be back on track in no time.

, No butter, no jam, nothing. Plain (unburnt) toast has similar qualities to crackers. The bread is easy to digest and has a very mild taste, making it more likely that your stomach won’t fight against it. Try a single slice and see how you feel before taking another., Sticking to eating the aforementioned foods is best, but if you must eat other things, use your best judgment. Avoid eating any foods that are greasy, fried, spicy, or very sweet. These can all make an upset stomach much worse, and are more likely to trigger a spell of vomiting.

Mix lemon juice with honey.,
Drink cinnamon tea.,
Try a clove tea.,
Make a cup of cumin tea.,
Have some peppermint tea.,
Try ginger ale.,
Sip some cola syrup.,
Drink all liquids slowly.",How to Fight Nausea3," Water works to flush out toxins in your system and keep your body hydrated so that it can fight against the things that are ailing it. Although it is important to drink water on a regular basis, it is especially important to do so when you’re sick. Make sure you have a glass of water with you at all times, and that you are drinking it at least every hour.

, If you're nauseous and vomiting, you’ve probably lost a lot of fluids and are having a difficult time keeping fresh ones down. Sports drinks are enhanced with electrolytes, which your body needs for a speedy recovery. Grab your favorite flavor and gulp it down after throwing up to help replenish your body’s electrolyte and fluid supplies.

, While many juices can be filled with sugar and flavors that are hard on an upset stomach, cranberry juice offers some nutrients without the sugary punch. Drink cranberry juice when suffering from nausea, especially when you haven’t been able to eat any food.

, This sweet and sour combination works to settle your stomach quickly, without a ton of necessary fluids, Mix a teaspoon of lemon juice with a teaspoon of warm honey. Slowly sip the juice-like liquid over several minutes. You can take this mixture multiple times a day if your nausea doesn’t subside.

, Cinnamon has been used for decades as a natural remedy for nausea and vomiting. Mix ½ teaspoon of cinnamon with a cup of hot water and allow the mixture to steep. Drink the tea slowly several times a day until your upset stomach goes away.

, With a similarly autumn-esque flavor to cinnamon, cloves can also help to settle an upset stomach. Brew up a cup of clove tea by mixing a cup of hot water with a teaspoon of powdered cloves. Allow the mixture to steep for several minutes before straining out any large clove chunks.

, Ordinarily associated with cooking, cumin can actually work well in a nausea-fighting tea. Try a mug by mixing a cup of hot water with a teaspoon of cumin seeds. Allow the tea to steep for 10-15 minutes before removing the seeds and drinking slowly. A bit of honey can be added for sweetness if desired.

, Peppermint is on par with ginger as being one of the best natural nausea-fighting remedies around. Use a teaspoon of crushed and dried peppermint leaves or use a few fresh leaves with a cup of hot water to make the perfect tea. This can be drunk hot or cold, as many times throughout the day as you would like.

, If eating ginger isn’t enough for you, grab a can of ginger ale soda. Check your soda ingredients first though to make sure it is made with real ginger and not artificial flavor. Sipping a can of the ginger pop will settle your stomach and help to keep you from throwing up., Slightly different than a regular cola soda, cola syrup is a thick liquid used for treating nausea. With the same classic flavor of your favorite cola, it might be nice to sip on it while you’re sick. Pour a tablespoon or two over some crushed ice and sip the liquid slowly over several minutes.

, No matter what you choose to drink to stay hydrated, avoid chugging it down quickly or in big gulps. Your stomach is already irritated, so ease liquids into it with small, slow sips."

Avoid dairy products.,
Eat carrot soup.,
Eat foods that are rich in potassium.,
Avoid drinking alcohol and caffeinated beverages.",How to Prevent Dehydration from Diarrhea or Vomiting2," Milk and milk products should be avoided. Your body normally has enzymes that help to digest dairy when you consume it. Unfortunately, when you are sick, those enzymes are slowed down, which means that dairy may pass through your stomach undigested, causing you to feel even more sick.Image:Prevent Dehydration from Diarrhea or Vomiting Step 9.jpg|center]]

Wait at least a week until after your illness has cleared up before you begin to consume dairy products again.

, Carrot soup can help to rehydrate you while also supplying your body with sodium, chloride, sulphur, magnesium, and pectin. To make carrot soup:


Boil several large carrots and blend them together. Add these blended carrots to a pot and simmer them on low. Add salt for taste.
For sick infants, boil water and add eight teaspoons of sugar with a pinch of salt. Feed this amount to your child in small doses.

, When you have diarrhea or begin to vomit, it is important to keep your potassium levels up. Certain fruits have high concentrations of potassium, including:


Mangoes, pawpaw, coconuts, oranges, strawberries, grapes, and pineapples. Lentils also have high levels of potassium.

, While you most likely won’t feel like drinking alcohol anyway, it is important to avoid drinking it when you have diarrhea or have been vomiting. Alcohol contains toxins that can actually dehydrate you, which is the opposite effect that you want to have when dealing with an illness. Caffeinated sodas and coffee can make your dehydration worse by taking more water out of your body.

Keep breastfeeding your infant.,
Give children ORS.,
Take care of your child during the first four hours.,
Give your child ORS frequently during the first 24 hours that they are sick.,
Feed your child their normal diet after 48 hours have passed.,
Know when to seek medical treatment.",How to Prevent Dehydration from Diarrhea or Vomiting3," Because infants are at higher risk for development of dehydration and malnutrition the two major consequences of diarrhea and vomiting, management must be very prompt in this age group. If your infant is the one who is ill, continue to breastfeed your child. Breastfeeding promotes faster recovery and provides improved nutrition when compared with formula feeding. However, if you give your child formula, you can also continue to feed her this, even if she vomits or has diarrhea., If your child is the one who is sick, do not give her any solid food. Instead, give your child an oral rehydration solution. Give them small amounts to begin with, and increase the amount you give them as they become more able to keep food down., The amount of ORS that you give your child depends on her age. If your child refuses to drink the ORS from a bottle or cup, you can also feed the solution to her using a teaspoon, dropper, or in the form of a frozen popsicle.For babies who are six months or younger, give them 30 to 90 mL (1 to 3 ounces) every hour.Children six months to two years of age should receive 90 to 125 mL (3 to 4 ounces) an hour.Children two years and older can receive 125 to 250 mL (4 to 8 ounces) an hour.The child should be given 5ml to 15 ml every 5 minutes or so. Such small volumes can usually be tolerated, even in children who are vomiting. Use common household measures 5ml equals 1 teaspoon; 15ml equals 1 tablespoon.
If your child continues to vomit, only give her the ORS solution. You can give her one tablespoon every 10 to 15 minutes until the vomiting ceases.
Voiding of dilute urine every 3 to 4 hours in both children and adults is an index of appropriate hydration status.
Frequency and amount of stools may increase over the initial 3 to 4 hours of oral rehydration therapy, but they will start to normalize over the next few hours.
If the vomiting does not stop or slow down, take your child to the hospital.

, During the first 24 hours of illness, give your child the ORS at regular intervals until the frequency of diarrhea slows down.


If the vomiting stops after 24 hours, you can slowly reintroduce your child to other foods. However, only give your child small amounts of the food, be it breastmilk, formula, or regular food.
Because infants are at higher risk for development of dehydration and inadequate nutrition management must be very aggressive in this age group. Infants younger than 1 year of age should be referred to a physician unless diarrhea and vomiting are mild.

, Most children are able to resume their normal diet after 48 hours. Your child’s stool may take approximately 7 to 10 days to go back to its normal consistency. This is because the digestive system takes time to begin functioning normally again., If your child is vomiting or has diarrhea constantly, and this condition does not change, bring your child to the hospital. If your child will not take any fluids, she will be rehydrated intravenously.


Your child will also be given anti-diarrhea medication, as well as medication to prevent her from feeling nauseous.

Drink enough fluids to stay hydrated.,
Try a cup of ginger tea.,
Drink a cup of peppermint tea.,
Prepare a fennel seed tea.,
Sip chamomile tea.,
Brew a cinnamon stick tea.",How to Get Rid of Nausea (Without Medicines)1," Dehydration can cause nausea, so it is important to get plenty of fluids. Drink room temperature water or warm herbal teas to help ease your nausea. Avoid very cold or very hot drinks. Take sips throughout the day rather than trying to drink a cup or glass of liquid all at once. If you are too nauseous to eat, then include broths such as vegetable, chicken or beef broths for some nutrition as well.


For children, call a physician for advice regarding fluids. They may recommend liquids such as Pedialyte, Rehydrate, Resol, and Rice-Lyte because children are more prone to dehydration, especially if they are also vomiting.Adults may want to try Gatorade for an added boost of essential electrolytes.;
, Ginger has long been used to treat the nausea associated with chemotherapy and surgery. Ginger tea is also considered safe for pregnant women. If you are drinking ginger tea for nausea associated with pregnancy, just make sure that you tell your obstetrician and only have one to two cups a day. Most adults can have up to four to six cups of ginger tea a day.


To make ginger tea from fresh ginger, peel and chop ½ to 1 teaspoon of fresh ginger. Pour boiling water over the chopped ginger and add lemon and/or honey to taste.
If you do not like the taste of ginger tea, then you can try a ginger supplement instead. The recommended dose is 250–1000 mg taken four times a day., Peppermint tea can be made by adding boiling water to ½ to 1 teaspoon of dried peppermint leaves, but most stores carry peppermint tea. You can add lemon and/or honey to taste. Peppermint tea is considered “likely safe” for pregnant women and children. Again, make sure you tell your obstetrician and limit the tea to one to two cups a day.


Try adding ¼ teaspoon of caraway seeds to the tea to help settle your stomach.
Peppermint is also used to help treat Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) and Functional Dyspepsia.

, Fennel seed tea is made a bit differently. To make fennel seed tea, add ½ to 1 teaspoon of fennel seeds to 6–8 ounces of cold water in a sauce pan. Slowly heat to boiling while stirring. Allow the water to boil for five minutes. Pour the tea through a strainer and then let it cool down. Add lemon and/or honey to taste.


It is unclear if fennel seeds are safe for pregnant women because fennel has mild estrogenic effects. If you are pregnant, talk to your physician before using fennel tea.

, Chamomile tea has long been used for nausea and upset stomachs. You can find chamomile tea in most stores. It is safe for children, although you may want to use weaker tea. Pregnant women should avoid chamomile tea because it contains phytoestrogens.Do not drink chamomile tea if you are taking anticoagulants, as it has been found to interact with those medications., Cinnamon tea can be made similar to how you make fennel seed tea, using ½ stick of cinnamon or ½ teaspoon of powdered cinnamon. Add the cinnamon to 6–8 ounces of cold water in a sauce pan. Then, slowly heat to boiling while stirring. Allow the water to boil for five minutes. Pour the tea through a strainer and then let it cool down.


Pregnant women should not use cinnamon tea.

Water
Tea
Broth, such as chicken or vegetable broth
Things like cranberry juice, Jell-O, and even popsicles.;
, According to doctors, drinks with ginger in them can be calming to the stomach.At the same time, avoid drinks with excessive acidity, such as grapefruit juice or orange juice.

, Place a cool, damp cloth on your forehead.This may cool down your suddenly-warm body and send signals to your brain that vomiting is unnecessary. Other parts of your body that may benefit from a cold compress include:


The back of your neck
The inside joint of your elbows (where your forearm meets your bicep)
Behind your knees
The inside of your wrists

, In several trials, receiving a ginger supplement has proven to be more effective at reducing nausea and the need for vomiting.Doctors are even beginning to prescribe ginger syrup to women who experience nausea in the first trimester of their pregnancy.All told, ginger is a great anti-emetic that's cheap and readily available. Here are some ways to enjoy ginger at home, even when you're feeling less than well:


Ginger chews and ginger cough drops. Ginger chews are more like ginger candy, while ginger cough drops are more often sucked on (and may double as an effective throat coating if you happen to have a cold).
Ginger tea. Grind up 12 slices of ginger with a mortar and pestle until grains begin to show. Place ginger and 3 cups of water into a pot and bring to boil. Turn burner down to a simmer and cook for 20-25 minutes. After steeped, strain away ginger and add 1 tablespoon or honey, stirring to dissolve. Serve warm.Ginger syrup. Place 2 cups of roughly chopped ginger in a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. Place in large pot. Add 2 cups of sugar and 6 cups of water to pot and bring to boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook for approximately 1 hour, until syrup has reduced by two-thirds. Strain syrup through cheesecloth.Add syrup to water or take straight.

, If you begin to feel nauseous, try to lie down immediately. Prop your head up on pillows so that it's at a higher elevation than your feet. This helps your body maintain its sense of balance better, leading to less nausea.

, Teas contain herbal remedies that can calm the stomach, line the intestines, and otherwise help reduce the need to vomit. When drinking, remember always to sip in small quantities. However, not just any tea will do. Try these teas as a precautionary stopgap when you feel the nausea coming on:


Chamomile. Laced with a little bit of organic honey, this trusted sleepytime tea soothes the stomach. Calming, light, and comforting.
Licorice root. A very mild laxative, licorice root can help you relieve any constipation that may be causing nausea or vomiting.It also contains an enzyme (called glycyrrhizin) treats a host of ailments, but also makes for a very sweet tea.
Red raspberry leaf. Many women use red raspberry leaf tea to help treat morning sickness and to ease muscles going into labor.Although it can relax muscles, red raspberry leaf has been shown to cause uterine contractions. Be sure to talk to your doctor about recommended doses if you are currently pregnant, as it can bring on early labor in some women.
Slippery elm. Slippery elm tea helps produce mucous secretions which line the stomach. This stomach lining can be beneficial in treating upset stomach and helping to allay the need to vomit., In small amounts, eating dry crackers may decrease nausea. If this solution works, you may have been hungry, not ill. This may or may not work, depending on what is causing you to want to throw up.

, If you suspect food is the culprit in vomiting, that's good, because there's a good chance that you can reduce the urge to vomit simply by modifying the way that you eat:


Eat cold foods or meals if the smell of hot foods makes you nauseous.
Avoid hard-to-digest foods. Fried foods, spicy foods, beans, high-fat and dairy foods, chocolate, and nutrient- and fiber-rich veggies are all especially difficult for your body to digest.Eat smaller meals more often instead of bigger meals less often. Try shooting for 6 small meals per day instead of 3 larger ones. You'll make it easier for your body to digest its food.
Drink plenty of fluids during the day, just not very much with meals.Drink 6 to 8 glasses of water a day, but don't drink very much during meals.
If you experience morning sickness, keep a box of crackers by your bed and eat a few first thing the morning before you get out of bed. This may help quash morning sickness.

, Available, in tablet, liquid, and suppository form, dramamine is a good way to prevent nausea and vomiting for something like motion sickness. If you know you're going to be driving in a fast car up windy hills, or go out whale-watching on choppy seas, pop some dramamine. Dramamine can be purchased over-the-counter.

, Scopolamine is a powerful motion sickness drug that's derived from a family of plants. Although often used as a potent street drug on its own, scopolamine in very small doses can be used to counteract motion sickness and upset stomach.


See your doctor if nausea and vomiting is a persistent trouble in your life and ask about motion sickness patches that contain scopolamine. If placed 4 to 12 hours before expected motion sickness, the patch can be very effective. It does produce some side-effects, including drowsiness, blurred vision, and dry mouth., If you're still getting used to the persistent morning sickness caused by early stages of pregnancy, doctors recommend taking the over-the-counter drug doxylamine. Doxylamine is a sedative that is often used as a cold and allergy relief medicine.


At high doses, withdrawal symptoms may appear if you stop taking this drug suddenly. It can cause insomnia, sometimes lasting for up to a week. For this reason, avoid relying solely on this drug to prevent morning sickness.

Avoid solid foods for a few hours to let your stomach settle.,
Take small sips of water or chew ice chips.,
Ease back into eating.,
Go for foods and drinks that replace lost electrolytes.,
Get bed rest.,
Be cautious with medications.",How to Ease a Stomach Virus1," When you first notice symptoms of the stomach virus, you should allow your stomach to settle. Eating food early on could irritate the stomach lining more, worsening your symptoms. For a few hours, avoid solid foods., During the first few hours, you will probably feel thirsty and uncomfortable. Try chewing on ice chips and taking small sips of water to rehydrate.Aim to consume 2 to 4 ounces of water every 30 to 60 minutes. Make sure to take small sips. Chugging water can cause vomiting.
In addition to water, you could also try clear sodas, broths, and non-caffeinated sports drinks. Mild and/or weak tea, such as ginger and chamomile, is also a good option.

, Once the first few hours have passed, do not go straight into eating meals. You should ease back into eating solid foods. Start with small snacks that are easy to digest. Soda crackers, gelatins, toast, rice, bananas, and lean meats like chickens are okay to eat. Eat in small portions at first., When you have the stomach virus, your body loses electrolytes through vomiting and diarrhea. You need to replenish the electrolytes by eating foods and drinking liquids that contain electrolytes.Complex carbohydrates, such as potatoes and whole wheats, contain electrolytes. When it comes to protein, go for lean meat like fish.
Chamomile tea can reduce nausea, too.Any clear broth, such as miso, will replace electrolytes and fluids.Electrolyte replacement solutions are usually sold at drug stores, and you can add these to waters and other fluids. Sports beverages, such as Gatorade, may also replenish lost electrolytes., If you want to feel better faster, bed rest is key. Your body will need lots of rest to fight off the virus. Try to stay on the couch or in your bed as symptoms persist. It's normal to feel weak and tired due to the illness.Try to stay comfortable. Get enough pillows and blankets so you feel cozy.
It may help to do something to distract yourself from the pain. You could watch a movie or read a book. Ask a household member to do something with you, like play a card game, so you do not focus on the stomach virus.

, Antibiotics do not treat viruses, so taking them will not help with your stomach virus. Over-the-counter painkillers, like ibuprofen and acetaminophen, can upset the stomach more. However, medications used to treat nausea can be helpful when you have a stomach virus.For the first 24 hours, let nature take its course. Your body is trying to clear an infection. If you don't have any warning signs, try not to take antidiarrheal meds.
While over-the-counter painkillers should generally be avoided, for your comfort anti-vomiting and antidiarrheal medications can help.
If you choose to take such medications, check with your doctor or pharmacists to make sure these medications are safe for you given your medical history and any current medications.

Symptoms may also include abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, dizziness and sensitivity to light. Chronic vomiting can lead to dehydration and can be life threatening. Watch for symptoms of thirst, decreased urinary output, paleness and exhaustion.
, Many people are diagnosed as children, as early as age 5.Try to remember the first time you had an episode of severe vomiting. If this began when you were young, it may be more likely to be CVS. If you’re unsure when you had your first episode, try to call a parent, caretaker, or older sibling who may remember. If you were ever treated for vomiting as a kid, contact your pediatric doctor’s office to request your medical records., Usually, all of an individual's episodes of CVS will be similar - the same symptoms will last around the same length of time.Keep track of details about your episodes in a journal or diary. This can help your doctor look for patterns and make a diagnosis. Record the following:

When your symptoms started – including what time of day, because this tends to be the same throughout episodesWhen your symptoms stopped, so you know how long they lasted

People who have migraines are more likely to have CVS, and CVS sometimes transforms into migraines as you get older. Make a special note if you have headaches or migraines during your episode, or even at other times., Not all headaches are migraines. Make note of your headache symptoms. A migraine headache has the following features:Throbbing or pulsing pain usually on one side of your head, though it can be both sides
Sensitivity to light and sounds, and sometimes smell and touch
Blurry vision
Lightheadedness
Some migraines have “auras” during or before the headache – visual changes like flashes of light or zigzagging vision, weakness, pins and needles, muscle jerks, or hearing sounds
Some people with migraines have symptoms before the headache that may warn them it’s coming, like changes in mood (usually feeling more depressed), yawning a lot, food cravings, stiff neck, or increased thirst

, It’s common to have other abdominal problems during episodes of vomiting. You may experience abdominal pain and/or have diarrhea. Keep track of these symptoms in your symptoms diary. Note what the pain feels like – “cramping,” “sharp,” “constant,” “comes in waves,” etc. – and notice if it’s the same kind of pain with each episode., People often feel physically exhausted during episodes of CVS. Pay attention to your energy level, and make a note if you feel extremely tired. Notice if you start feeling exhausted before or after you start vomiting.It’s also common to have pale, clammy skin during this time, or have a fever (a temperature of 100.4°F/38°C or higher). This can make it difficult to distinguish CVS from viral illnesses that have the same symptoms. The important thing is to notice if you have the same symptoms with each episode.

, Unfortunately, viral illnesses and contaminated food can also cause severe nausea and vomiting. It can be difficult to know whether your vomiting was caused by one of these problems, or was an episode of CVS. When considering an early or recent episode of vomiting, ask yourself the following:

Did anyone else in your household get sick at the same time? If family members or classmates also experienced vomiting, especially with a fever, it may have been due to a stomach virus.
Did anyone else get sick after eating what you ate? If contaminated food caused the problem, others who ate the same thing may also have felt sick.

, As soon as you notice a trend in your vomiting episodes, see your doctor. Take your symptoms diary with you so you can provide details about the timing and symptoms of your episodes. Your doctor will talk to you about your past medical history and your family history, and they will do a physical exam. They will review the history of your symptoms and then help you decide the best next steps in treatment.

Be sure to tell your doctor if you take any medications or have any other medical conditions.
Tell your doctor if you use marijuana (weed, pot). Frequently using marijuana has been linked to CVS., If your family doctor is uncertain about your diagnosis, ask for a referral to a gastroenterologist – a doctor who specializes in stomach and digestion problems. They may be more familiar with CVS than your regular doctor, since CVS is pretty uncommon. A gastroenterologist can prescribe some tests to help diagnose the problem., A number of tests can be done to show whether you have a different problem causing your vomiting. If these tests show no other problems, then your doctor can more accurately diagnose CVS. Some tests you may need to do include:Imaging with a CT scan or endoscopy (a small camera that looks into your throat) to look for structural problems in your throat and stomach
Motility tests to see how food moves through your digestive system
Blood tests to check your thyroid and other hormones
MRI to check for problems in your brain and nervous system

See a chiropractor.",How to Deal With Chronic Unexplained Nausea," The definition of chronic nausea is different to many people, with some thinking it must last for more than a week to qualify, whereas others say more than a month. Pregnancy is a very common cause of nausea (called morning sickness) that can last for a few weeks or sometimes even longer. If you're a sexually active female and feeling nauseous in the morning for a week or more, buy a pregnancy test from the pharmacy and check.


Morning sickness is much more common during the first trimester (3-month period) of pregnancy, although in rare cases it can last the entire 9 months.
The main treatment for morning sickness is to avoid triggers, which may include stuffy rooms, odors, heat, humidity, noise, and visual and physical motion.
If you are pregnant and your nausea persists for more than a few weeks, make an appointment with obstetrician for advice.;
, Another very common cause of unexplained chronic nausea, especially among the elderly, is medication. Virtually every prescription and over-the-counter medication can trigger nausea as a side effect, but the most common offenders are chemotherapy drugs, painkillers (especially opiates), antidepressants (SSRIs) and antibiotics.Read the list of side effects for your medications and see if your nausea is associated with taking any of them.
Research your medication(s) on the internet to see if other people are having trouble with unexplained nausea.
Ask your doctor about reducing your dosage or changing to a different type of medication with similar actions.

, Although drinking alcohol is firmly ingrained in our culture as an appropriate social activity, the reality is that ethanol is toxic to people and can cause numerous negative symptoms, including nausea. Sometimes it's from drinking too much and getting dizzy (""bed spins"") or ""hung over"" the next morning, but if your nausea is chronic then you may be allergic to alcohol. See if you can connect having a drink with feeling nauseous.


If it does seem to be caused by alcohol, you need to cut back or stop drinking alcohol altogether.
Some races of people are more susceptible to feeling sick / nauseous after drinking alcohol because they lack the enzymes to break down and process ethanol. Asians and Native Americans are most notable.Switch to non-alcoholic beer, virgin cocktails or grape juice instead of wine if you still want to be social and go to bars/lounges with your friends.

, Regardless of the cause of your nausea, eating fatty, fried and/or spicy food will generally make it worse. As such, eat bland whole foods that are low in fat and higher in fiber, such as whole wheat bread, bran cereal, and fresh fruits and veggies.Furthermore, chew slower and eat smaller, more frequent meals.


If you really have trouble keeping food down, nibble on plain crackers and toast throughout the day.
If you can eat small meals, focus on lean fish, chicken breast, rice, boiled potatoes and bread. Veggies are fine too, but avoid ones that can cause gas and make nausea worse — such as cauliflower, cabbage and onions.
It's recommended that you wait about six hours to eat solid foods after you throw up. Sip on some diluted chicken or beef broth while you wait.

, Food allergies often go undiagnosed and can be a cause of chronic nausea and stomach upset. The most common foods that trigger allergic reaction in people are: eggs, fish, cow's milk (and related dairy products), peanuts, walnuts, soy products, shellfish (shrimp, crab, mussels) and wheat.Be more aware of how you feel within a few minutes of eating certain foods.


Try an elimination diet (removing foods one by one) and see if that cures your nausea.
Other allergy symptoms to look out for include: swelling in your face, lips and/or throat, congested nose and sinuses, itchy skin, hives, headache, brain fog and difficulty breathing.
If you think you might have a food allergy, get tested by a nutritionist or allied health professional who is trained in allergy testing.

, In addition to avoid eating fatty, spicy and fried foods, you should also avoid smelling them as strong odors often cause nausea to get worse. Other strong odors to avoid include perfume/cologne, cigarette smoke, body odors, onions, garlic and curry.Avoid restaurants until you feel better and prepare more meals at home. Avoid the food courts and perfume counters when shopping in malls.


Wearing a surgical mask or applying some menthol rub to your nostrils may reduce the impact of strong odors while you're outside your home.
Other triggers of nausea to be aware of in your home and other places include: high heat, humidity and flickering lights.

, Chronic, low levels of dehydration are much more common than you might think, especially in warm and humid climates. The vast majority of people drink plenty of beverages, but they are often loaded with caffeine and processed sugar, which can promote loss of water from the body. Furthermore, your risk of more severe dehydration is high if your nausea is associated with chronic vomiting.Aim for approximately eight 8-ounce glasses of purified water each day — more if you're active and sweating a lot.
If you're having trouble keeping water down, take small sips or try sucking on ice chips.
Avoid beverages with caffeine, such as coffee, black tea, hot chocolate, colas and energy drinks.
Avoid milk if you're lactose intolerant. Symptoms of bloating, abdominal cramps and diarrhea will make your nausea worse.
If you're losing fluid from vomiting and/or diarrhea, then you also need to replace your electrolytes (mineral salts). As such, drink some diluted fruit or vegetable juice in addition to water.

, Adding some herbal tea to your routine is not only a great source of uncaffeinated hydration, but some herbs may combat nausea by settling your stomach down or calming your nerves. For example, peppermint, spearmint and chamomile are herbs well known for their stomach soothing abilities.Herbs that may reduce anxiety/stress and make an impact on nausea include: chamomile, Valerian root, passionflower and kava.
You can buy these herbal teas at most grocery stores or buy the dried herbs directly and use them to make a herbal infusion.
Don't add boiling hot water to herbs as it can destroy some of the helpful compounds. Instead, add very warm water and let the herbs steep for about 15 minutes.

, Another traditional plant remedy popular for combating nausea is ginger. Ginger has some anti-inflammatory ability and is considered a carminative that reduces gas, bloating and abdominal pain — all of which can cause nausea.Ginger can be consumed as an herbal tea, taken as capsules, or as a lozenge or chew.


Most commercial ginger ale doesn't contain real ginger, but some natural brands in health food stores do. Make sure to get rid of the fizz (carbonation) before drinking it.
Pickled ginger (the type that often comes with sushi) is another form that's tasty and fairly easy to find.
Take some form of ginger about 15–30 minutes before eating solid food in order to reduce the likelihood of nausea.

, The is some research that indicates supplementing with vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) can help reduce chronic nausea and vomiting, especially among women who are pregnant. The recommended dosages are 30mg of pyridoxine hydrochloride daily for up to five days consecutively.


Be aware that vitamin B6 supplements may not impact all causes of chronic, unexplained nausea, but it's affordable and worth a try in most cases.
Taking too much vitamin B6 (more than 100mg daily) can lead to nerve irritation and numbness/tingling in your limbs. Always keep daily doses under 50mg to be on the safe side.

, If natural and home remedies don't impact your nausea, and your doctor is unable to figure out the underlying cause, then taking anti-nausea medication may be a good option.Over-the-counter types such as Dramamine might work, but stronger ones need a prescription from your doctor.


Commonly prescribed anti-nausea drugs include: prochlorperazine (Compazine), granisetron (Kytril), ondansetron (Zofran), perphenazine (Trilafon), metoclopramide (Reglan), and thiethylperazine (Torecan).Cannabinoids (derived from the chemical THC in marijuana), such as dronabinol (Marinol), may also be useful for combating nausea.
Be aware that these drugs all come with their own potential side effects, which may include high blood pressure and difficulty with muscle control. Speak with your doctor at length about the side effects of any anti-nausea medication
If severe nausea prevents you from either taking pills or holding them down, then ask your doctor about suppositories.

, If your doctor (and other specialists) are unable to diagnose your chronic nausea, then it may be worth experimenting with a short course (a week or two) of antibiotics. Chronic low-grade bacterial infections are often difficult to diagnose and frequently trigger bouts of nausea, especially if they're gastrointestinal infections. Ask your doctor about the pros and cons of taking antibiotics.


Antibiotics are notorious for causing nausea, so there should be some evidence of infection before taking them.
Bacterial infections typically cause abnormal blood tests, such as a high white blood cells count, which indicates your immune system is fighting an infection.
Viral stomach infections can cause nausea also, but antibiotics are only effective against bacteria.
Erythromycin is an example of an antibiotic your doctor may prescribe. It is used to promote the passage of food from the gut to the intestines. The window for this antibiotic to be useful in treating nausea is very narrow, and if you take it for too long it may increase abdominal pain.

, Acupressure involves putting sustained pressure on specific spots on your body to trigger certain physiological reactions. It's the same principle as acupuncture, but without the needles. Research indicates that there's a point located on the wrist (called the P6 point) that, if pressed, can reduce nausea.Most research has been done on pregnant women, but the P6 point may work for other causes also, such as motion sickness and anxiety.


You can locate a trained acupuncturist in your area, although watching some videos on how to locate and stimulate P6 may work also.
Pressing the P6 point on either wrist for between 30-60 seconds may be enough to significantly reduce your nausea. If not, try massaging the point for about five minutes.
Look for special bracelets online designed to stimulate the P6 point for long periods of time, which is may help when combating sea sickness or nausea related to pregnancy.

, Another type of alternative treatment that can significantly impact unexplained nausea is a chiropractic spinal adjustment. If the joints, nerves or muscles of your upper neck are irritated, it can throw off your balance just enough to cause mild dizziness and nausea. A chiropractic neck adjustment can realign spinal joints and reduce upper neck tension, which causes the related nausea to quickly fade away.


Most chiropractors will want to take an x-ray of your neck before adjusting it to make sure the treatment is safe.
You will often hear a relatively painless popping or cracking sound with chiropractic adjustments, so don't think anything is breaking.
Although one treatment is sometimes enough, you'll likely need between 3-5 treatments to fix an upper neck issue.

Put a handkerchief or tissue over your nose and breathe through it.,
Wind or roll down the window a little if possible.,
Try mouth-breathing.,
Always keep an ""odor defender"" in your handbag to counteract strong odors.,
Eat something.,
Ask for a rest stop.,
Speak up.",How to Cope With Strong Perfume in an Enclosed Car," It will help to lessen the strength of the odor molecules passing through to your sense of smell.;
, This is a hard one because sometimes other passengers in the car complain about the cold, heat, dust, whatever, coming in. But do it if you can, as the odor will have somewhere to escape other than all over you. Be politely assertive about needing some ""fresh air"".

, This will give your odor sense a bit of a rest. Although, doing this won't last for long because you still have to breathe normally and odor and taste are closely linked.

, A little dab of peppermint, lavender, eucalyptus, or ginger essential oil on a tissue can make your area of the car a little more bearable. Or take some peppermints and suck on these; they are good for tricking your senses with a more powerful immediate taste.

, A little bread, a bun, a ginger cookie, or some other starchy carbohydrate might help overcome the rising nausea that the smell is inducing in you. If you feel really queasy, however, food might make things worse. Judge it by knowing how your own constitution reacts.

, Having a break now and then from the odor can improve things for your markedly. Get right out of the car and walk about, visit a restroom, do some stretches. Even if it's freezing, take the chance to leave the car temporarily.

, Tell your fellow passengers that you are finding the scent in the car so overwhelming that you are afraid you might be sick. Ask for frequent breaks or even find an alternative travel arrangement if feasible. Great Aunt Agatha might even offer to wash off some of the perfume if you're tactful enough but don't bet on it!

Follow the BRAT diet.,
Eat certain foods.,
Avoid other foods.,
Have smaller meals.,
Use ginger.,
Sip drinks.",How to Cope With Nausea1," The BRAT diet was developed to help people who can't have normal foods because of nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. This diet contains just bland foods that won't irritate your stomach. BRAT stands for bananas, rice, applesauce and toast.


Only follow the BRAT diet for a short time, 24–36 hours. It is only intended to help you fight off stomach issues for a short while. You don't get the nutrients necessary while on this diet.;
, In addition to the BRAT diet, or after you have been on the BRAT diet for a day or so, there are other foods that you can eat that should keep your nausea at bay. There are certain foods that have been shown to help against nausea and are easier on the stomach, especially if you're experiencing morning sickness or pregnancy induced nausea. Try bland foods that are more substantial, such as crackers, English muffins, baked chicken, baked fish, potatoes, and noodles.


You can also try mints, clear soup, flavored gelatin, angel food cake, sherbet, popsicles, and ice cubes made of apple or grape juice., There are certain foods that will only make your nausea worse. These items can irritate your stomach and can lead to acid reflux, nausea, and vomiting. When you are feeling nauseous, limit or do not eat:


Fatty foods such as fried foods
Spicy foods or seasonings
Processed foods such as chips, donuts, fast food, and canned foods
Beverages with alcohol and caffeine, especially coffee
Foods with strong aromas

, When you are feeling unwell, avoid eating three large meals. Instead, eat several small meals throughout the day. This gives your stomach less work because there is less to digest.Meals should consist of the mild foods already discussed.

, Ginger is often used to help reduce nausea. Ginger may help calm the stomach as well as indigestion. You can use ginger in a variety of ways, such as adding fresh ginger or ginger powder to recipes, sucking on ginger hard candy or fresh ginger root, and drinking ginger tea.You can also buy ginger capsules through many herbal stores. Common dosage is 1000 mg by mouth with water.Ginger has been a long-standing home remedy for many different conditions that cause nausea. These include motion sickness, seasickness, hyperemesis gravidarum or vomiting during pregnancy, chemotherapy induced nausea, and post-surgery nausea., Since nausea deals with an upset stomach, you need to be careful about what you put in it. When you feel nauseous, sip non-alcoholic drinks such as water, sports drinks, flat soda, and tea. Too much fluid can lead to vomiting, so take sips. Try taking one to two sips every five to 10 minutes. This can help settle your stomach and if you have been vomiting, it can help replace the fluids or electrolytes you've lost in the process.Drinks such as ginger ale and lemon lime soda are very helpful for nausea. These don't have to be flat when you drink them.

Eat bland foods and include the BRAT diet.,
Eat small amounts of food throughout the day.,
Stick to a low-sodium diet.,
Choose low-fat foods.,
Stay away from foods known to increase nausea.",How to Get Rid of Nausea (Without Medicines)2," The BRAT diet consists of bananas, rice, applesauce and dry toast. These foods are very easy on your stomach, but the diet is thought to be too restrictive and does not provide enough nutrition.The BRAT diet is a good place to start, but incorporate other bland foods, such as saltine crackers, rice or sesame crackers, brown rice, toasted whole-grain bread, or chicken without the skin. Don’t add any spices or other seasonings to the foods that you eat.Steer clear of spicy foods if you are nauseous.

, Eating smaller amounts of food can also help to reduce nausea. For example, you can start the day with ½ banana and ½ a piece of whole-grain toast. Then, have some clear broth and crackers. Snack on some applesauce, then have some boiled chicken and rice for dinner.

, Sodium may increase feelings of nausea as well, so it is best to stick to a low-sodium diet if you are nauseous. Do not add salt to your foods and avoid foods that are high in sodium. Read labels and try not to exceed 1500 milligrams of sodium total per day., Fatty foods may increase feelings of nausea as well, so opt for low-fat foods instead, such as lean meats, low fat dairy products, fruits and vegetables, and whole grains prepared without any added oil or butter. Fatty foods include anything that has been fried, meats with skin and marbling, lamb, oils, butter, pastries, and most fast foods., Many people experience worsening nausea as a result of eating certain foods, so it is best to steer clear of these if you are already nauseous. Keep track of any foods that make you nauseous and avoid these foods as much as possible. Some examples of foods that make some people feel nauseous include:Tomatoes
Acidic foods (like orange juice and pickles)
Chocolate
Ice cream
Eggs

Use aromatherapy.,
Make an appointment for acupuncture or acupressure.,
Perform a breathing exercise.,
Make sure that your environment is free from irritants.,
Rest and relax as much as you can.,
Stay still.",How to Get Rid of Nausea (Without Medicines)3," Aromatherapy uses the essential oils of various herbs to produce soothing scents. Apply a drop of peppermint oil, lavender oil, or lemon oil to both your wrists and your temples, then breathe deeply.


Make sure you don’t have a skin sensitivity to the oil by first putting a single drop of oil on your wrist. If you have a sensitivity, then you may experience a rash, redness or itching. If so, try a different oil or use a different method to deal with your nausea., In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the body is seen as having a system of energy meridians throughout. Applying needles (as in acupuncture) or pressure (as in acupressure) to specific points along these meridians can help to re-balance the energy and reduce feelings of nausea.


Try the “P6,” “Neiguan” or “inner gate” point. This point is about two finger-widths below the crease of your wrists (at the base of the palms). Start with your palms facing you. Feel for two tendons around the midpoint of that area above your wrist. Using the index and middle finger of the opposite hand, apply firm, but gentle pressure for about 10–20 seconds and release. Make sure you repeat this process on the other arm as well., The University of Connecticut conducted a study which indicated that controlled, deep breathing can help to relieve nausea.Other studies have indicated that breathing can help control nausea after surgery.Try this exercise adapted from the University of Missouri at Kansas City:


Lie flat on your back and place pillows under your knees and neck to make sure that you are comfortable.
Put your hands (palm down) on your stomach, right below the rib cage. Place your hands over your belly with your fingers together. This way, you will be able to feel your fingers separate as you breathe in and this will let you know that you are doing the exercise correctly.
Take a long, slow deep breath by expanding your belly, breathing like a baby breathes. This ensures that you are using your diaphragm to breathe rather than your rib cage. The diaphragm creates suction that pulls more air into your lungs than by expanding the rib cage.

, Some environmental irritants may cause you to feel nauseous. These include strong odors, smoke, heat, and humidity. Do your best to avoid these irritants as they can be “triggers” for either nausea or vomiting.

, Sometimes being stressed, overworked, or physically uncomfortable may cause you to feel nauseous. Some common causes of nausea are stress, anxiety, and muscle strain. Try to rest and relax to help reduce these unpleasant symptoms and prevent them from escalating feelings of nausea.

, When you are feeling nauseous, moving around too much may make matters worse. Try to keep as still as possible to help reduce your feelings of nausea and prevent them from becoming worse. Sit in a comfortable chair or recline on a sofa or bed."

Call your doctor if nothing helps or if you have other symptoms.,
Consider the cause of your nausea.,
Determine if you may need to seek medical attention.",How to Get Rid of Nausea (Without Medicines)4," If home remedies do not help to relieve your nausea within a day or so, or if you are vomiting, then call your physician right away to ensure that you don’t have a more serious problem.

, Nausea — often along with vomiting — is a common problem for many people. The feeling of being “sick to your stomach” can be caused by a number of different things, including:Food sensitivities or food allergies
Bacterial or viral infections
GastroEsophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) and heartburn
Medications, especially chemotherapy and radiation treatments
Pregnancy (morning sickness)
Migraines and other headaches
Motion sickness
Pain

Stay away from plain water at first.,
Give your child rehydration solutions.,
Provide solid foods when your child is hungry.,
Avoid certain foods.,
Encourage bed rest.,
Do not use over-the-counter antidiarrheal medications.",How to Ease a Stomach Virus2," Children with stomach virus should not be given plain water in the early stages of the virus. Water will not help children rehydrate as it is not absorbed well by a child's body when suffering from the stomach virus., You do not want to give a child sports drinks like Gatorade if he or she is sick with the stomach flu. To replace lost electrolytes, you can find rehydration solutions at a drugstore or supermarket.You can feed a very small child or an infant using a syringe or teaspoon.
Rehydration solutions are often put in popsicles. This may be a good route for a younger child, as he or she will be more likely to eat a treat than medicine.
If you have a baby, only give the baby small amounts 15 to 20 minutes after the child experiences vomiting or diarrhea.

, Bland foods are unlikely to make symptoms worse. It's important to provide your child with the nutrients her or she needs to fight off the virus.Foods like soups, rices, pastas, and breads are a good option when your child is fighting a stomach virus.
Yogurts, bananas, and fresh apples can also be helpful to a child with a stomach virus.
Soups and soup broths may also help rehydrate your child.

, You may be tempted to give your child a treat if he or she is feeling ill. However, many favorite childhood snacks can worsen symptoms of the stomach virus. Stick to healthy foods and find other ways to treat your child, such as watching his or her favorite show or reading your child a book.Fizzy drinks and fruit juices are high in sugar, and can make symptoms worse. Other high sugar foods, like ice cream and candy, should also be avoided.
Dairy products can also make diarrhea worse, so cut back on milk and cheese until your child is feeling better. However, infants can continue to drink breast milk and formula when they have stomach virus. You do not need to switch to soy formula or milk.

, Bed rest is vital to a healthy immune system. You want to make sure your child gets adequate rest as symptoms persist. Try to entertain your child while he or she is resting. This can encourage your child to stay in bed, as well as distract him or her from the symptoms.Watch movies or TV shows with your child that he or she likes. Read your child a book. Play simple games, like card games, with your child.

, Antidiarrheal medications are not safe for young children. In some cases, a doctor may advise you use such medications, but you should not use them unless you receive specific instructions from your doctor to do so. Antidiarrheal medications can prevent your child from fighting the virus."

Talk to your doctor if you notice any unusual symptoms.,
Wait 48 hours after your symptoms clear to return to work or school.,
Take steps to prevent a reoccurrence.,
See a doctor if you develop diarrhea after taking antibiotics.",How to Ease a Stomach Virus3," For the most part, the stomach virus will pass on its own without complications. However, if you had certain symptoms during your virus, consult a doctor. The following symptoms should be evaluated by a medical professional:Diarrhea, vomiting, or severe abdominal pain that lasts longer than 48 hours
Blood in your stool
Confusion or dizziness
No urination for an 8 hour period
Sunken appearance in the eyes
With infants, watch for a lack of tears when crying, less drool than usual for a teething infant, a lack of urination for 4 hours, or a sunken soft spot on the infant's head. This can be a sign of severe dehydration.

, The stomach virus can spread easily. You should not return to work or school for at least 48 hours after your symptoms have cleared up. If you have a young child, make sure not to send him or her to school for at least 48 hours as the stomach virus often spreads quickly in a classroom setting., As the stomach virus can take time away from work and school obligations, take steps to prevent a reoccurrence of the virus. If you know someone at work or school is currently infected with the virus, take extra steps to protect yourself.Wash your hands frequently throughout the day. You should make sure to do so after going to the bathroom or handling food.
Make sure to clean kitchen surfaces. The stomach virus can be caused by food contaminants, so clean surfaces that have been exposed to raw meat and eggs. You should also store raw meat and eggs away from foods that are eaten raw in your fridge.

, There is a bacterial infection of the stomach that can occur right after you finish taking antibiotics. If you develop diarrhea after finish a strong round of antibiotics, call your doctor and don't take any other medicine yet."

Sit still.,
Avoid lying down after eating.,
Get fresh air.,
Try peppermint aromatherapy.,
Use breathing techniques.,
Undergo music therapy.",How to Cope With Nausea2," When feeling nauseous, sit still in a chair or sofa to prevent yourself from moving in any direction. Motions are detected by various parts of your body, including the inner ear, eyes, muscles, and joints. When these differing parts are not transmitting the same motions to the brain, or when they are not synced, you can start feeling nauseous.Some people find that hanging their head between their knees helps as well.

, Right after you eat, the food you just ate has not been digested yet. If you lie down before digestion happens, food from the stomach can enter your esophagus and give you a nauseous feeling. It can eventually lead to acid reflux and vomiting.


After eating a meal, it is good habit to walk for 30 minutes to help digestion.

, Nausea can be caused by air quality factors, such as stuffiness or air irritants. Stuffiness can be caused by a poorly ventilated room where dust builds up, leading to blockage of the respiratory system through your nose, lungs, and throat. In addition, cooking smells may irritate you, causing nausea if the area is not properly ventilated.


Cold, fresh air can be beneficial relief from these situations. Get outside quickly for fresh air. If you can't, a fan or air conditioning may have a similar effect.Also try opening a window or using a kitchen air vent when cooking to let the smells out., Deep breathing exercises along with peppermint aromatherapy helps reduce nausea and vomiting. Studies have shown that inhaling peppermint oil not only reduced the incidence and severity of nausea and vomiting, but also decreased anti-nausea medication use.You can purchase oils in many grocery, drug, and health stores. You can use the oils to:


Sniff from the peppermint oil bottle or use a few drops on a cotton ball, place it in a cup, and inhale.
Massage the oil around your abdominal area or chest so you can breathe it in.
Mix the oil with water and add it to a spray bottle for home and car use.
Add five to 10 drops into a bath before taking it., For those recovering from surgery-induced nausea, studies have shown that deep controlled breathing reduces the occurrence of nausea.To perform these techniques, find a quiet, comfortable place to sit. Take a normal breath followed by a deep breath. Breathe in slowly through your nose, allowing your chest and lower belly to rise as you fill your lungs. Let your abdomen expand fully. Now breathe out slowly through your mouth. You can also breathe out through your nose, if that feels more natural.


Try using guided imagery with deep breathing. As you sit comfortably with your eyes closed, blend deep breathing with helpful imagery and perhaps a focus word or phrase that helps you relax. The image can be a vacation spot, a room at home, or some other safe or pleasant place. This can help some people block out nausea and the urge to vomit., For those patients who suffer from chemotherapy-induced nausea, studies have shown improvement from music therapy sessions.Music therapy involves specially trained health professionals, called music therapists, using music to help relieve symptoms. These professionals use different methods with each person, depending on that person’s needs and abilities.


This method can also lower heart rate and blood pressure, relieve stress, and give a sense of well-being."

See your doctor.,
Treat common nausea conditions.,
Help with pregnancy, post-surgery nausea, and stomach flu.",How to Cope With Nausea3," Many anti-nausea medications require a prescription, so a visit to your doctor will be warranted. Describe your symptoms and medical history. He or she may provide you a prescription strength drug or advise you to take an over the counter, non-prescription, drug instead, depending on your particular situation.


Take the medications as described on the label or by your healthcare professional. , Some people suffer from migraine-induced nausea. If you suffer from this, ask your doctor about metoclopramide (Reglan) or prochlorperazine (Compazine) to help with the symptoms.

When you are constipated, you have difficulty passing bowel movements, which in turn increases pressure on the blood vessels in the pelvic area and causes hemorrhoids.Constipation can result due to hormonal imbalances during pregnancy.Reduce or prevent constipation by increasing your dietary fiber intake. Foods high in fiber include fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
Prune juice or dried prunes are also high in fiber and may support healthy bowel function.Start your mornings with an oatmeal sprinkled with flaxseeds. Oatmeal is high in fiber and the added fiber and fatty acids in flaxseeds can help trigger a bowel movement.
Drink dandelion or mallow tea. Steep the tea bags in boiling water for about 5 to 10 minutes to prepare the tea. Drink dandelion or mallow daily to ease constipation.

If you are drinking enough water, then your urine will be clear. If you are not drinking enough, then it will be a dark yellow color.
Consuming the correct amount of water during pregnancy helps prevent constipation and promotes softer stools, thus decreasing the risk of hemorrhoids.

, Both put pressure on your lower body and slow blood flow to the rectal veins, which increases your risk of hemorrhoids.Take frequent breaks and walk around, especially if your work involves sitting at a desk.
Stretch and take time to sit from time to time if you are on your feet most of the time.

, Pushing too hard during a bowel movement puts more pressure on the rectal veins, which can cause or worsen hemorrhoids.Put your feet up on a stool during bowel movements. This can help relieve the pressure on the rectal area and allow you to pass the stool more easily.
Use the bathroom immediately if you feel the urge to go, this can reduce the risk of hemorrhoids. Passing stool can become more difficult if you wait., This helps keep your bowel movements regular and relieves the pressure on the veins in your rectum. Getting up and moving is essential if you tend to sit for extended periods of time.Try exercises, such as walking, swimming, low-impact aerobics, dancing, yoga, and stretching. These help improve your cardiovascular and muscular health besides promoting healthy bowel movements.Always ask your doctor before starting a new exercise program. It is essential you only do exercises that are safe for you and your baby.

For persistent, painful hemorrhoids, talk to a doctor about heat treatments and other types of procedures.,
Seek help for hemorrhoids that have formed nearby clots.,
Seek help for excessive bloody discharge from bowel movements.",How to Heal Hemorrhoids3," For hemorrhoids that consistently get in the way of daily activities and present a painful medical condition, talk to your doctor:


Heat treatment. Called ""infrared coagulation,"" this heat treatment blocks blood flow to a single hemorrhoid at a time, causing it to eventually fall off.Only one hemorrhoid can be treated at a time.
Rubber band ligation. This procedure also blocks blood flow to hemorrhoids, causing them to die.A rubber band is tied around the hemorrhoid to do this.
Surgical hemorrhoidectomy. Surgical hemorrhoidectomy removes individual hemorrhoids using a stapler or sutures., Hemorrhoids can cause surrounding blood in the anus to clot and nearby tissue to scar. If you think you may have clotting, see a doctor to help remove them and treat the hemorrhoids.

, Blood from the stool may be caused by hemorrhoids, but it may also be caused by a more serious condition, such as cancer.

"
"
Expect the first procedure to be a simple rubber band ligation.,
Talk to your doctor about alternative shrinking procedures if rubber band ligation fails.,
Consider a hemorrhoidectomy with your doctor to permanently remove hemorrhoids.,
Talk to your doctor about stapling to remove internal or prolapsed hemorrhoids.,
Do not expect pain relievers, but be ready for prescription stool softeners.",How to Heal Hemorrhoids4," Your doctor will place a small elastic band around the hemorrhoid, which cuts off blood flow and slowly shrinks it. This procedure must usually be repeated 2-4 times, with 6-8 weeks between each application.


Side effects are mild, usually some light pain and discomfort.
There may be some light bleeding, though it is rare.

, There are several possible therapies your doctor may try. All of them have similarly mild side effects and are low-risk.



Sclerotherapy: A chemical is injected directly into the hemorrhoid to shrink it.

Laser/Infrared Coagulation: The hemorrhoid is burned, causing scar tissue that cuts off blood supply and shrinks the hemorrhoid.

Cryosurgery: Just like freezing a wart, this also scars the hemorrhoid so it cannot get blood., This surgically removes the tissue from your body. If you doctor is worried about prolapsing, constant hemorrhoids, or if the simpler procedures do not work, this is the best. It is also usually the most permanent. The doctor will remove the vein connecting blood to the hemorrhoid.


Hemorrhoidectomies boast a 95% effectiveness rate and few risks.
You may require stitches.
While you will likely be under anesthesia, most patients return home the same day.
This surgery is painful. Expect to miss a week or more of work., A prolapsed hemorrhoid is one that has left your anal cavity. To fix it, a staple-like device is used to reposition the hemorrhoids and simultaneously pin shut the veins giving them blood. Because it places them higher up the anus, there are fewer nerve endings and less pain.


Your doctor may refer to this as the Procedure for Prolapse and Hemorrhoids, or PPH.
Bleeding, pain, and itching is generally lower with PPH than full surgery
You should recover more quickly from PPH than a haemorrhoidectomy.

, Your doctor will likely recommend that you take over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofin, but pain should not be serious enough to require stronger meds. You will receive stool softeners, however, to prevent constipation. Other advice to expect includes:


Taking small, frequent bowel movements.
Taking warm baths, known as ""sitz baths""
Avoiding sitting, especially on hard surfaces.
Eating a high-fiber diet."

Chronic constipation and chronic diarrhea are common causes of hemorrhoids. Women in late stages of pregnancy are also susceptible, as are people who are overweight. Anal intercourse can sometimes cause hemorrhoids, and the sores can be internal or external.


Internal hemorrhoid: Internal hemorrhoids occur inside the rectum. If they are large enough, or close enough to the anus, they may bulge out during a bowel movement.
External hemorrhoid: External hemorrhoids occur in the area around the rectal opening. If they get severely irritated and clot under the skin, they can become a hard lump. This is called a thrombosed hemorrhoid.;
, If you suspect you have a hemorrhoid, it's important to know the symptoms of this condition. Here are the signs of internal and external hemorrhoids.Internal hemorrhoids: The most obvious symptom of internal hemorrhoids is bright red rectal bleeding with your bowel movements. You will see bright red blood when cleaning yourself. In most cases, they do not cause pain.
External hemorrhoids: External hemorrhoids can cause itching and burning in the anal area. They often cause pain, and sometimes bleed, especially when wiping after a bowel movement. Sometimes, external hemorrhoids make sitting very uncomfortable.

, While hemorrhoids are usually not serious, rectal bleeding can be caused by other serious health conditions, including anal, rectal or colon cancer; diverticulitis; or a bacterial infection. If you experience any kind of new rectal bleeding, it's important to call your doctor so you can be properly diagnosed and treated.

, In most cases, hemorrhoids can be treated at home, using methods that soothe or reduce pain, inflammation, swelling, itching and pressure.This section describes some of the steps you can take at home to feel better.

, Although it can be painful to wipe the anal area when there's a hemorrhoid present, one of the most important steps you can take to begin healing is keeping it as clean as possible. Gently wash it with a soft washcloth, warm water and mild soap. Rinse well, and pat dry using a clean washcloth or very soft toilet tissue.


You might also want to try using moist towelettes, which are much more gentle than dry toilet tissue. Many brands include aloe or other soothing ingredients.

, Several topical treatments can relieve hemorrhoid swelling and pain. Some can be purchased at the drugstore, and some are probably in your kitchen. Here's what to try:


Creams and ointments: Preparation H, hydrocortisone creams, diaper rash cream, or products containing topical analgesics such as lidocaine or benzocaine.
Witch hazel: Tucks Medicated Pads contain witch hazel, which is an astringent. You can also purchase witch hazel water and apply it to the anal area using a cotton ball or soft pad.
Aloe vera: Aloe vera is lubricating and soothing. You can purchase aloe vera gel at the drugstore. If you have an aloe plant, break off a small piece, squeeze out the gel inside, and apply it to the area.
Vinegar: White vinegar or apple cider vinegar can help relieve itching, burning and inflammation. Soak a cotton ball with vinegar and apply.

, Drinking water will soften your stools, making them easier to pass and reducing the urge to strain, which can potentially worsen your hemorrhoids. When you suspect a hemorrhoid, increase your water intake to eight to 10 glasses of water a day.

, Fiber is another excellent stool softener. You can add it to your diet by eating high-fiber foods, by using a fiber supplement, or both.


Eat more legumes, whole grains, seeds, vegetables and fruits.
Or, you can try over-the-counter psyllium fiber supplements like Citrucel or Metamucil.

, A sitz bath is a warm water bath for the perineal area. Warm water is soothing for hemorrhoids, provides relief and promotes healing. You can purchase a small tub (often called a sitz bath) that sits on top of the toilet seat, or simply use your bathtub. Here's how to find relief using a sitz bath:


Fill the tub with a few inches warm water. If you are using a toilet sitz bath, fill it to the point indicated in the instructions. Make sure the water is warm, not hot.
Add soothing and healing ingredients, if desired. Warm water alone will be soothing, but you may also find additional relief by adding known hemorrhoid healers such as table salt, epsom salts, chamomile, yarrow, and calendula.
Soak for about 20 minutes. Take a 20 minute sitz bath after every bowel movement. If you can, also include another two to three soaks a day until the hemorrhoids have healed.
Gently dry the perineal area with a soft towel.

, Cold will reduce swelling, inflammation and pain. Put the ice pack or compress on the anal area for 15 minutes. Repeat two to three times a day.

, Once the hemorrhoids are healed, you can take measures to stop them from returning. Some treatment suggestions also apply to prevention, like maintaining a high-fiber diet and drinking lots of water. Here are some other ideas.

, Sometimes it just isn't the best time to make a bowel movement. However, waiting until later can cause problems. When you wait, your stools dry out and back up in your rectum, which can cause additional pressure. Then, when you do use the toilet, you may find yourself straining. So, when you feel the urge to move your bowels, don't wait. Find a bathroom and go!

, Spending long periods of time sitting on the toilet puts pressure on the anal area. Don't spend more than 10 minutes on the toilet at a stretch. If you are constipated, clean up, take a break, drink some water, take a walk, and try going again later.

, If being overweight is the cause of your hemorrhoids, losing weight may help. Talk to your doctor for recommendations about how much weight you might need to lose, and healthy ways to do it.

, Exercise stimulates bowel function, which makes it easier to pass your stools. Try 20 minutes a day of moderate aerobic exercise; walking is a great place to start. If you have a sedentary job, make a point to get up and walk around some every hour. Getting more exercise can also help you with weight loss.

, Softer stools mean less straining, less pressure on the anal area and less time spent sitting on the toilet. Dietary changes mean both adding and omitting or reducing your intake of certain foods. You may need to experiment with your diet before finding the balance that works for you. Here are some examples:


Foods to add: lots of water, prunes or prune juice, ground flaxseed, foods with omega fatty acids, leafy greens, raw vegetables and fruits
Foods to omit or reduce: fried foods, refined carbohydrates, dairy products, sodium

, Many foods and herbs contain compounds that support venous health by strengthening blood vessel walls. Some of these foods and herbs also reduce inflammation, an added bonus. Examples include:


Flavonoids (found in citrus fruits, blackberries, cherries and many other fruits and vegetables)
Butcher's broom
Horse chestnut
Gingko biloba
Calendula.

, Home treatments will heal most hemorrhoids. However, there may be times when helping yourself is not sufficient, and you need medical attention. Pay close attention to symptoms to determine whether you should seek medical help. Look for the following:


Duration of symptoms: Bleeding and pain typically resolve after two to three days. Call your doctor if these symptoms last longer than one week.
Timing of symptoms: Bleeding from hemorrhoids usually only occurs with bowel movements. If you are experiencing rectal bleeding at any other time, call your doctor.
Changes in symptoms: Changes in your symptoms can mean your condition is worsening. It can also mean that something else is wrong. If the color of your hemorrhoidal bleeding changes from bright to dark red, call your doctor as soon as possible.
Severity of symptoms: If you've been applying home treatments, your hemorrhoids should improve. If your symptoms worsen, or become severe, call your doctor.

Pregnancy also increases the risk of constipation, which is another risk factor of hemorrhoids.
Most women find that their hemorrhoids resolve after they give birth, but they require care and can recur weeks later.;
, The increased that causes hemorrhoids are typically caused from the pressure. Risk factors that contribute to the increased pressure on those areas are pregnancy, obesity, straining to have a bowel movement, constipation, anal intercourse, lifting heavy objects, weight lifting, and sitting on the toilet too long. Those who participate in these activities will likely experience a hemorrhoid. To reduce the likelihood of developing hemorrhoids or to alleviate the symptoms, reducing how much and often you do these activities.


Pay special attention to preventing constipation or standing for long periods in one place while pregnant. Do not gain more than the recommended amount of weight during your pregnancy as recommended by your obstetrician for your individual circumstances.
Do not lift heavy items at work or at home without help. Find someone to help or use mechanical assistance at work if possible.
Refrain from anal intercourse. It stretches the rectum past normal capacity and places additional stress on the veins in the anus and rectum.

, Hemorrhoids commonly form during pregnancy, but they are the same type that form during any other time. The only difference is the type of pressure that triggers the formation of the hemorrhoids. A hemorrhoid will be a lump around the anus, which is often sensitive or painful when touched. Symptoms of hemorrhoids include:Itching, irritation, and discomfort around the anus from the inflammation of the swollen vein.
Swelling as small as a pea
Pain with your bowel movements without bleeding and around the anus when you aren’t
Light bleeding from the pressure of the stool against the vein
Discomfort
Some leakage of stool into your underwear from the anus, which is not fully closed when the hemorrhoid is located near the entrance to the rectum

, Taking any medications for hemorrhoids can affect your baby if you haven’t given birth yet. The medicine will also be passed through your milk if you are nursing, which can also affect the baby. Before using any over-the-counter treatment medication or natural herbal supplement, talk about the risks with your doctor and pharmacist.

They are more common amongst women who are pregnant, those with increased abdominal pressure due to liver disease, or those who are constipated because of medications, lack of dietary fiber, or lack of water. All of these conditions and situations cause increased straining during defecation, which contributes to the dilatation, engorgement, and prolapse of the hemorrhoidal tissue inside the anus.Symptoms of hemorrhoids include:


Mucoid discharge from your anus
Bleeding in the anal region
Swelling of the anal region
Discomfort or pain
Poor hygiene due to fecal leakage
Anal itchingBurning during bowel movements
Severe pain from a hemorrhoid that has a blot clot trapped inside;

If you don't have wet wipes, try using wet toilet paper until you can get some. This may be kind of irritating because wet toilet paper is not nearly as strong.
In addition to using wet wipes to keep cleaner and avoid irritation, you should also shower or bath daily to keep your anal region clean. This will help cut down on discomfort and irritation as well as help relieve swelling., The pain of your hemorrhoids can be relieved by over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol).

Drink a lot of water.",How to Prevent Hemorrhoids," One of the main causes of hemorrhoids is obesity, which also affects numerous Americans. This happens because of the extra weight exerting pressure on the anal and rectal areas, causing the veins to swell, forming hemorrhoids. In order to avoid obesity, take a 15-30 minute jog or walk every day, and try to do more physically strenuous exercises if you're already facing this kind of problem.

When you delay potty sessions, your stools will get harder, thus making it more difficult for you to push them out, causing you to strain. Difficulty in emptying the bowels is called constipation and in turn, it causes hemorrhoids.

, This is responsible in aiding digestion and softening the stools, avoiding constipation and making waste disposal a lot easier. Rich fiber sources include:


Vegetables like broccoli, artichokes, kale and brussels sprouts.
Fruits like raspberries, apples, pineapples and oranges.
Beans and legumes are the richest sources. These include baked beans, chickpeas, pistachios, black beans, split peas and haricot beans.
High fiber foods like raisin bran or shredded wheat cereals are good, too.

, Simply put, fiber is useless if you don't supplement it with water. Eight to ten glasses of water will aid in digestion and improve bodily functions: you can last for weeks without food, but die within three days without water. In the context of hemorrhoid prevention, water aids fiber in softening stools, thus making waste disposal easy.

Eat high fiber foods.,
Take probiotics.",How to Care for Hemorrhoids Postpartum3," Constipation is extremely bad for hemorrhoids. It is one of the leading causes of hemorrhoids, which means that being constipated just makes your hemorrhoids worse. The straining increases the pressure against the veins, which causes them to grow, become irritated, and potentially bleed., Keeping your body moving will also help keep your digestion moving. To prevent constipation, exercise daily. Exercise will move the food through your intestines in a timely and natural way.

If you are experiencing complications associated with hemorrhoids, or if your condition does not improve after about a week with over-the-counter treatments, see a doctor immediately.Blood in your stool may indicate hemorrhoids, but it may also be a symptom of a more serious medical problem. If you find blood in your stool, contact your doctor and set up an appointment as soon as possible.
Chronic and prolonged blood loss caused by hemorrhoids can lead to anemia in some people. Anemia results from a loss of red blood cells, which restricts your body's ability to carry oxygen to your cells. Symptoms of anemia include weakness and chronic fatigue.If your body's blood flow to a hemorrhoid is suddenly cut off, it can lead to a condition known as strangulated hemorrhoids. Strangulated hemorrhoids are extremely painful and may result in necrosis (tissue death) and gangrene., There are a number of options your doctor can counsel you on that do not require surgery. These options are generally safe and effective, are minimally invasive, and can usually be done in an outpatient setting.Rubber band ligation — this minimally-invasive procedure uses tiny rubber bands to constrict blood flow to the hemorrhoid. Your doctor will place these bands around the base of the hemorrhoid, and within one week the hemorrhoid will shrivel and fall off.Sclerotherapy injection — this procedure involves a chemical injection into the inflamed tissue. It results in a shrunken hemorrhoid with reduced pain and inflammation. The injection causes relatively little pain, but may be less effective than rubber band ligation.Coagulation — this technique uses either laser, infrared light, or heat (bipolar) treatments to shrivel and harden the inflamed hemorrhoids. Coagulation has few side effects, but often has a high rate of recurrence compared to rubber band ligation., In some cases, hemorrhoids may not respond to nonsurgical treatments. If you have not had success with other treatments, or if you have abnormally large hemorrhoids, your doctor may suggest surgery to remove your hemorrhoids.There are a few different surgical options, and they may be performed in an outpatient setting or may require hospitalization, depending on the surgical technique and severity of your hemorrhoids. Surgical procedures do run the risk of prolonged bleeding, infection, and leaking stool, though long-term adverse effects are very rare.Hemorrhoidectomy — this procedure is the surgical removal hemorrhoids and the tissue around hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoidectomies are the most effective way to get rid of hemorrhoids that do not respond to other treatments.Stapled hemorrhoidectomy/hemorrhoidopexy — this procedure involves surgically stapling the hemorrhoid to cut off blood flow to the affected area. This option is considered to be less painful than a hemorrhoidectomy, but it often results in hemorrhoid recurrence and rectal prolapse."

Ask about a hemorrhoidectomy.",How to Deal With Hemorrhoids3," For advanced hemorrhoids, which are considered have permanently protruded outside of the rectum without possible retraction, you need to see your doctor.He or she may suggest you have rubber band ligation, which is an outpatient procedure. In rubber band ligation, one or two small rubber bands are placed around the base of the hemorrhoid to cut off the circulation. Because of this, the hemorrhoid loses its blood supply, which causes it to shrink and fall off within a week of the procedure.This procedure can be uncomfortable and can cause bleeding. This generally starts two to four days after the ligation, but it is rarely severe bleeding., There is a method that can be used to remove your hemorrhoids called sclerotherapy, which is a procedure where a chemical solution is injected into the hemorrhoid tissue in order to shrink it. There is generally very little pain.


This procedure is often less effective than rubber band ligation., Hemorrhoids which are thrombosed, or filled with a blood clot, can be treated with incision. The doctor will incise the hemorrhoid with a scalpel and the clotted blood is removed. Due to the blood loss, the hemorrhoids then heal within three to five days by drying up and falling off.


This method is also useful for other, more serious hemorrhoids. Large external hemorrhoid protrusion can be surgically removed if done within 72 hours., A hemorrhoidectomy is the treatment that is considered a last resort of treatment. It is a procedure performed surgically through an incision that removes the entire hemorrhoid in one piece. The doctor has to proceed with extreme caution to avoid cutting the anal sphincter, as bowel incontinence could result. The area is then sewn closed with dissolving sutures.


These wounds rarely get infected due to the rich vascular bed in these muscles, which prevents infection despite the location."

In any case, your doctor can suggest a treatment plan that will help reduce constipation or diarrhea that can cause external hemorrhoidal tags.If a bacterial infection is causing discomfort, you may need to take antibiotics., Straining and holding your breath when you try to pass a bowel movement creates pressure on the veins in your rectum, which can cause hemorrhoids.If you are experiencing constipation, it can be tempting to stay on the toilet until you get relief. It’s understandable; however, this increases the risk of hemorrhoid tags because of straining. This is only true if you can’t have a bowel movement. If you’re having diarrhea, it’s okay to stay put., Waiting can make it harder to go. So if you feel like going, that’s when you should go. Otherwise you’ll be prone to straining, discomfort, and possibly hemorrhoid skin tags., While your primary care doctor may be able to help you, if your bowels are really giving you trouble, you may need to get a referral for a gastroenterologist. They will likely want to do an endoscopy (either a sigmoidoscopy or a more complete colonoscopy) to look for evidence of hemorrhoids.

, Exercise is important in maintaining healthy bowel movements, which will help prevent hemorrhoid tags. Even 20 to 30 minutes of moderate exercise a day can improve bowel function. Walking, biking, or some other moderate exercise is good for reducing the likelihood of hemorrhoids.Avoid exercises that put pressure on the abdomen. Exercises like squats can potentially increase the risk of hemorrhoids or exacerbate the symptoms.Lose weight only if you need to (if you’re overweight and it seems to be exacerbating the hemorrhoid problem)., Try to get the daily recommended intake of fiber through food sources.

For men over 50, 30 grams of fiber a day is recommended, and 38 grams of fiber is suggested for women. Eating vegetables like broccoli, beans, or fresh fruit will provide the necessary intake. You can also take a fiber supplement. Other foods that are high in fiber include:


Fruits like raspberries, pears, apples, bananas, oranges, strawberries, figs, and raisins.
Vegetables like artichokes, green peas, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, potatoes, and carrots.
Legumes and nuts including split peas, lentils, black beans, almonds, pistachios, and pecans.
Grains, cereal, and pasta including whole wheat spaghetti, bran cereal, oatmeal, popcorn, barley, and rye bread., Drinking water helps prevent flare-ups and speeds up the healing process because a hydrated body can digest food better. Your stool will be softer, causing less strain during bowel movements, reducing the risk of hemorrhoid irritation.The Institute of Medicine recommends that men drink 13 cups (3 liters) of fluids every day and women drink nine cups (2.2. liters) a day., Diuretics like alcohol and caffeine increase urination and can cause dehydration. Dehydration can eventually lead to constipation, which can cause hemorrhoids to flare up or linger. As such, avoid alcohol and caffeine while upping your intake of other, more hydrating fluids like water. Processed foods like instant meals and packaged candy have high amounts of salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats that can impede digestion. Because these foods can also lead to constipation, you should avoid them at all costs to prevent and cure hemorrhoids."

See a doctor.,
Use suppositories to treat piles.,
Talk to your doctor about using anesthetics.,
Talk to your doctor about rubber band ligation.,
Get stapled hemorrhoidopexy.,
Discuss a hemorrhoidectomy with your doctor.",How to Cure Piles3," Hemorrhoids are common, but there are times when they will merit a visit to a doctor. If you notice any type of bleeding from your rectum, see a doctor immediately. He’ll be able to evaluate and rule out any other causes of rectal bleeding. If you experience pain or discomfort, talk to your doctor about pain management and other medications you might consider to fix the issue. Do not take pain or bleeding lightly.


If you are passing stools with irregular colors — most likely a tarry/maroon color — this could be a sign of bleeding somewhere in your digestive system., Hydrocortisone suppositories will help you get rid of the swelling and inflammation in your rectum and anus, both of which are associated with piles. It is very important to strictly follow your doctor’s administration advice.In most cases, hydrocortisone suppositories are administered for a 7 to 10 day period, 2 or 3 times per day.

, Local anesthetics, like Pramoxine, will help relieve itching and pain. After each bowel movement, apply the medical product directly on the affected area. You should repeat the procedure up to four times per day. The treatment should last for about one week., Rubber band ligation is the most common treatment method for Piles, especially in the United States. The procedure consists of the attachment of an elastic band to the base of the inflamed hemorrhoid. The blood flow is restricted, and the pathological tissue will eventually decrease in size and will fall off.After the procedure, it is advised that you keep yourself hydrated and also administer stool softeners. You may administer docusate before you go to bed each night, accompanied by a large glass of water.

, Stapled hemorrhoidopexy is an alternative to the common hemorrhoid removal procedure. For this procedure, a surgeon will use a stapling device, anchoring the piles in their original position after the enlarged piles are removed. The procedure is always performed under general anesthesia and has a very short recovery period compared to other methods., When all the other methods fail in getting rid of your piles, a hemorrhoidectomy is the last resort. When inflamed hemorrhoids occur, or when they become too large, surgical treatment is the only weapon of choice. The procedure starts with a small incision around the internal and external tissues which are affected by the condition. The second step involves the removal of the pathological tissue. Hemorrhoidectomy is the most effective procedure, and also has a very low complication risk. The rehabilitation period may be painful, but despite this disadvantage, a lot of people choose this method."

Look for blood.,
Notice itching.,
Feel for external hemorrhoids.,
See a doctor.",How to Reduce Hemorrhoid Pain1," The most common symptom is bleeding during a bowel movement. You may notice blood on the toilet paper or in the toilet bowl.This can be a symptom of several different problems. If you notice blood in your stool, it is a good idea to make an appointment with your doctor.
Hemorrhoids do not always bleed. Many do not, so this is a possible indication you have this condition, but does not definitely say you do.;
, Hemorrhoids are typically itchy and painful. If you have persistent itching or pain around your anus, this may be a sign you have hemorrhoids., You may actually feel an external hemorrhoid (one on the outside of the anus) when cleaning yourself. It will likely be a tender swelling around the anal opening.These may be sore spots in the region.
These also may be lumps, bumps, and odd bits that were not there previously. Often they feel a bit like raisins, but attached to your body.
In general, internal hemorrhoids are too far inside the anus, so you will not feel them under usual conditions. They can bulge through the anal opening though., If you are experiencing symptoms consistent with hemorrhoids, be sure to have it confirmed by a doctor, and anything else ruled out. A physician can diagnose internal or external hemorrhoids by performing a rectal exam. If your symptoms are persistent and not relieved by the measures below, it is a good idea to seek treatment. It it is possible your condition is more serious.If rectal bleeding is not caused by a hemorrhoid, your doctor will likely recommend a more extensive test called a sigmoidoscopy or a colonoscopy. These tests check for colon cancer."

Look for blood.,
Check for anemia.,
Watch out for a strangulated hemorrhoid.,
Look for a clot.",How to Care for Hemorrhoids Postpartum5," After giving birth, your hemorrhoids often resolve using home care treatments; however, if you experience severe pain or notice more than just a few drops of blood from the area, see your physician immediately. You may believe that your hemorrhoid is bleeding, but the blood may originate from bleeding inside the colon, which is a symptom of another, more serious condition such as colon cancer.


It is also necessary to figure out if the blood might be coming from the uterus after delivering your baby. If you are having difficulty distinguishing this, place a maternity pad against your vagina and a towelette at the anus. If there is more than just a few drops of blood from the hemorrhoid, talk to your physician. , A complication that arises from having hemorrhoids that chronically bleeds is anemia. Although rare, chronic blood loss will cause not enough blood to transport oxygen to the cells. You will then develop fatigue and a strain on the heart muscle. If you experience chronic fatigue not related to lack of sleep, talk to your doctor about blood testing to check the oxygen carrying capacity of your blood.


You may also experience some mild anemia following the birth of your baby. This is due to the discharges of the blood and tissue from the uterus., A strangulated hemorrhoid is formed when the blood supply to the hemorrhoid has been cut off. It can cause extreme pain, ulceration, tissue death, or gangrene. This is a medical emergency and requires immediate medical care. You doctor will have to re-establish the blood supply to the area to prevent infection in the dead tissue. , A hemorrhoid can also develop a clot inside the vein. This causes extreme pain and is typically excruciating. When this happens, you have a thrombosed hemorrhoid. See you doctor immediately for treatment of the clot. It may need to be surgically removed or withdrawn from the vein in an out-patient procedure.


Your physician can also help you control the pain and prevent of further complications."

Wear non-restrictive, breathable undergarments.Undergarments made from silk or other fabrics that don't allow the free passage of air can trap moisture around the anal area.,
Protect the anal region from chemicals.The chemicals found in perfumed and dyed products can cause irritation that worsens hemorrhoids.",How to Cure Hemorrhoids or Piles," Replace showers with a daily warm-water bath while you have hemorrhoids.Soaking in a warm tub for at least 10 minutes a day will increase your blood flow, soothing pain and speeding up the healing process. You don't have to use soap; in fact, soap could make the problem worse by irritating the affected area. Because soap remove naturally produced oils it can dry out and irritate the skin.Lingering moisture can also cause irritation, so pat the anal area dry with a cotton ball. You can also dry the area gently using the lowest setting on a hair dryer.;
, A sitz bath is an over-the-toilet bath for the hips and buttocks that can ease the pain of hemorrhoids, relieve irritation and pruritus as well as relax the anal sphincter. Rather than simply soaking in warm water, a sitz bath sprays the irritated area with a stream of warm water. These products are available at pharmacies and medical supply stores.


You can add Epsom salts to your sitz bath to further soothe the skin. Add 1 cup Epsom salts for every 2 quarts of water.Soak the affected area for 10-15 minutes in warm water, up to 2-3 times a day., Whatever you use for your cold compress, cover it with a towel so you don't make direct contact with the irritated skin. Applying cold to the irritated area reduces swelling and soothes itching.


Apply the compress gently for up to 20 minutes (less is okay)
Remove it if you feel discomfort/pain from the coldness.
Repeat 2-3 more times, allowing a few minutes between each application.

, Pure witch hazel is available at most drug stores, though it can come in different concentrations and application methods. For example, you can buy pads pre-soaked with witch hazel at some drugstores. Application methods and times will vary depending on the product you bought. Follow the instructions that came with your particular product and/or follow your doctor's instructions.


It's best to use pure witch hazel, but you might try a product that mixes witch hazel other substances like soothing oils and aloe. Avoid products with synthetic chemicals, which may make the hemorrhoids worse.
Draw a warm bath and pour in a few capfuls of witch hazel. Soak in the tub until the irritation has eased.
You can apply a diluted witch hazel and water mixture directly to irritated skin up to 6 times a day, or after bowel movements.

, Hydrocortisone is a steroid cream, and is the most effective way to combat for ""pruritus"" (localized itching) after bowel movements. Steroid cream should be applied twice a day for not more than seven days. In theory, it may help reduce inflammation and speed up healing because it's a steroid — but studies have not yet confirmed this.Even if it doesn't cure hemorrhoids, though, it at least controls the itching that comes with them.


Follow the instructions for application on the bottle, and do not apply hydrocortisone more often than recommended.

, Medical attention is important if your hemorrhoids are interfering with your daily life. Furthermore, their symptom can be similar to those of more serious conditions like colon or rectal cancer. Either way, it's important to have a doctor evaluate you if the following occurs:Symptoms linger after a week of home-treatment
Pain or swelling grows severe
Bleeding increases or changes in color (from bright to dark red, for example)
Stool changes in size, shape, or color (from brown to tarry black, for example)
Tissue from inside the body bulges out from the anus. If it doesn't retract within 3 to 7 days of home treatment, see a doctor.

, Tell your doctor about your symptoms and allow her to assess the area. After evaluation, she might prescribe medication based on:Pain: hydrocortisone ointment, analgesic sprays - benzocaine, dibucaine
Pruritus (itching): hydrocortisone ointment
Bleeding: astringent suppositories (Preparation H), hydrocortisone ointment

, It is usually effective at ridding you of your hemorrhoid. The doctor will use rubber bands to cut off blood flow to the internal bundles of hemorrhoids. This causes necrosis (cell death), and the hemorrhoid will eventually slough off.


There are two types of hemorrhoids: internal and external. This is determined by the hemorrhoid's anatomic location to the dentate line. Hemorrhoids are graded 1-5 with 1 being mild and 5 being severe. Symptoms of a hemorrhoid include bleeding with a bowel movement, fecal incontinence, wetness, irritation and pruritus of the perianal area. Diagnosis is made based upon history, a physical assessment and visualization of the hemorrhoids.

, In severe cases, hemorrhoids may not shrink with at-home treatment or prescribed medication. At that point, the doctor may recommend removing the hemorrhoid ""hemorrhoidal artery ligation operation"" (HALO). This procedure is effective and usually painless, so it's gaining popularity in the medical community.The more common response to persistent hemorrhoids is a hemorrhoidectomy, or surgical removal.


If you have further complications like prolapse, hernia strangulation, or large anal tags, the doctor will likely recommend surgery.
Although hemorrhoidectomy is a surgical process, it's not a major undertaking. It's usually performed in a relatively casual setting, either in a clinic or in an outpatient setting.
Most hemorrhoids heal within 48 hours with at-home care or prescription medications. Surgical removal should only be considered after those options have proven ineffective., This is an area where a large number of blood vessels connect together, raising the likelihood that pressure will cause dilation and hemorrhoid. Common causes increased pressure that causes hemorrhoids include:


Constipation and straining during bowel movements
Chronic diarrhea
Pregnancy
Liver Disease, Cirrhosis
Extended periods of prolonged sitting
Obesity

, Straining increases pressure during bowel movements, making hemorrhoids worse. Dietary changes can help decrease straining: stick to a normal eating schedule of multiple, small meals. Don't try to pass stool unless you actually feel like you have to, and when you do, decrease strain by using proper technique:Sit with good posture on the toilet, leaning slightly forward with a straight back.
Rest each forearm on your knees
Put your feet in a comfortable position, and raise your heels off the ground so you're on your toes
Keep your legs apart so they are not touching
Relax your pelvic muscles and anal sphincter as you feel your stool approaching your rectum.
Remember not to hold your breath. Breathe naturally with your mouth slightly open.

, Your stool will be softer, causing less strain during bowel movements, reducing the risk of the hemorrhoid enlarging.


The Institute of Medicine recommends that men drink 13 cups (3 liters) of fluids every day, and women drink 9 cups (2.2 liters)., Fruits and vegetables with lots of fiber help prevent and cure constipation. When you can pass your stool easily with less strain, you place less pressure on anal and rectal blood vessels. This prevents hemorrhoids, or speeds up the recovery process if you already have them. If changing your diet isn't an option, you might try a stool softener or fiber supplement like Metamucil or Critical. In general, women should take in 25 grams of fiber every day, and men 38 grams.Foods to work into your diet include:Dark, leafy greens like kale and spinachCooked asparagus, beets, mushrooms, turnips, and pumpkin
Broccoli, artichokes, squashes, sweet potatoes, string beans, and raw carrots
Fruits: apples, bananas, peaches, pears, tangerines, prunes, berries, figs, and other dried fruits.
Grains: brown rice, whole-grain breads, high-fiber cereals, whole-wheat pastas

, Dehydration can eventually lead to constipation, which can cause hemorrhoids to flare up or linger. As such, avoid alcohol and caffeine while upping your intake of other, more hydrating fluids like water. Processed foods like instant meals and packaged candy have high amounts of salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats that can impede digestion. Because these foods can also lead to constipation, you should avoid them at all costs to prevent and cure hemorrhoids.

, This can contribute to hemorrhoid flare-ups. Instead, wear loose undergarments in a breathable material like cotton to speed up the healing process., Avoid using perfumed soaps when bathing, perfumed detergent when washing your clothes, and do not use perfumed toilet paper. Look for unscented, dye-free products to replace them. Hemorrhoids are already irritating to the surrounding skin, so do what you can avoid extra, unnecessary irritation.

Avoid driving.,
Take non-drowsy motion sickness medication before driving.,
Stock your car with chewing gum and sick bags.,
Eat ginger before you drive.,
Drive defensively and learn the warning signs.",How to Vomit While Driving1," Motion sickness is likely caused when involuntary movement (as in a car or boat) confuses the brain, which normally senses movement by signals coming from the inner ear, eyes, and surface receptors.It is a common problem. If you are prone to motion sickness and vomiting, one way to avoid a dangerous situation is to avoid driving.


According to the Mayo Clinic, nausea and vomiting are more common in chemotherapy patients with a prior history of motion sickness.You may want to avoid driving for the duration of your therapy, if you suspect a problem will arise.;
, If you experience severe motion sickness, you might try an over-the-counter medication like Dramamine or Meclizine. These will usually work within 30 to 60 minutes. However, make sure to choose a non-drowsy variety. Regular Dramamine has a sedative effect, for example, which makes driving under its influence dangerous!Another option is to take an antiemetic or anti-nausea drug. Immodium, for example, for Pepto-Bismol may be appropriate.Always consult a doctor about what medicine is best for you. She will know about possible side-effects and adverse drug interactions.

, Be prepared if you are prone to vomiting. Stock vomit bags near the driver’s seat, for example, either paper or plastic bags, and consider lining the passenger seat and/or floor with plastic sheeting.


Chewing also helps to reduce nauseafor example, so keep a mild-flavored gum handy, like Juicy Fruit. However, you may find that chewing in general helps your symptoms. Snacking on sweets of just chewing in general may relieve your body’s conflict between vision and balance.
Fresh, cool air also seems to help motion sickness slightly. Keep your driver’s side window open slightly or the vents pointed at your face., Ginger is an old herbal remedy for nausea and some studies indicate that it may help motion sickness. Try taking a supplement of 250 mg three times per day, when driving heavily. Alternately, you might buy some ginger gum to chew, doubling the effects of chewing with the soothing qualities of the herb.Keep in mind that ginger supplements may increase the risk of bleeding, especially if you are on a blood-thinner or aspirin. Talk to your doctor to see if ginger supplements are OK for you.

, If you must drive, drive defensively in case you need to pull over quickly. Stay in the outer lane, for example, and avoid expressways or roads where it is hard to make a quick exit or safe pull off.


Learn to read your body’s reactions. If your motion sickness usually starts with a light headache, worsens, and then turns to nausea and vomiting, note whenever you get a headache. Take that as a sign that you should pull over.

Relax and position your arms.,
Locate the pressure point on your arm.,
Use your fingers to press on the pressure point.,
Gently tap your wrists together at the acupressure points.,
Locate the pressure point below your knee.,
Apply pressure to the point below your knee.",How to Stop Nausea With Acupressure1," Place your arms directly in front of you with the fingers pointing up and palms facing you. Relax your shoulders and take several deep breaths.


While you can perform acupressure anywhere, try to make yourself as comfortable as possible.;
, With your opposite hand, place 3 fingers below the crease of your wrist. Place your thumb right below them and center it in between the two large tendons. This is the pressure point.Specifically, you're looking for the P6, or inner gate, pressure point which relieves nausea. The same point on the opposite side of your arm is known as the SJ5, or outer gate.

, Take your thumb and index or middle finger and press firmly on the point on both sides of the wrist when you feel nauseous. Then gently, but firmly rub the point using a circular motion for several minutes. You may immediately feel relief, but it can sometimes take up to five minutes.Repeat the process with your other wrist.

, Simply do several quick taps while taking deep breaths. It doesn't matter which arm happens to be on top. If you like, you can alternate arms. Do this for several minutes, until you begin feeling relief.


For some, tapping or rubbing the wrists may seem easier than locating and massaging the P6 pressure point. Try tapping if you're still struggling to locate the exact pressure point.

, Find the bottom of your kneecap and measure four fingers below it. With your opposite hand, place a finger right below the lowest measuring finger (your pinky), on the outside of your shinbone. If you've correctly found the pressure point, a muscle will flex if you move your foot up and down.Specifically, you're looking for the ST36, or three miles, pressure point, which is one of the most widely used pressure points, providing nourishment and energy., Use your finger, fingernail, or heel of the opposite foot to apply firm pressure. You can keep pressure on it without any massage or you can rub up and down on the point. Either way, keep pressure on the point for several minutes."

Try a stool softener.,
Use the ""breath push"" method.,
Treat the area.,
Try a medication.,
Consider surgery.,
Sit on ""The Donut"".,
Ice.",How to Reduce Hemorrhoid Pain2," Internal hemorrhoids often end up requiring professional medical treatment. There are, however, a number ways you can ease the discomfort of hemorrhoids while waiting for them to heal. One of these is to take herbs that soften your stools, thus making them easier to pass.


Use stool softeners like senna tablets or senna teas (flavored with honey and lemon if you prefer). You can also try psyllium fiber as found in Metamucil.TM, When you visit the restroom, allow gravity to do most of the work. You can avoid straining by using a ""breath push"" method to move things along.


Sit up straight on a toilet before starting the bowel movement. Take the deepest breath you can and let your abdomen expand. This allows the diaphragm to drop and allows you to fill yours lungs as much as possible.
Hold the full breath. Then, when you are ready, imagine that as you exhale that the breath is pushing out the stool. This does take some practice, but it does work.
Continue using the ""breathe push"" method as long as the hemorrhoids persist, or as long as you need to, to reduce the pain.This method reduces strain and can help you relax. Used regularly, it can also help avoid recurring problems with hemorrhoids.

, After a bowel movement, try a Sitz bath, warm compresses, aloe vera gel or Preparation HTM to help soothe and heal the hemorrhoid.


For a Sitz bath, use about a cup of Epsom salts for a full tub of water. If you use only a few inches of water, 2–3 tablespoons (29.6–44.4 ml) of Epsom salts is enough. Keep the water warm (but not hot) and sit in the tub for 10-15 minutes. After the soak, pat dry yourself gently or use a hair dryer on a low setting. Try to repeat this two to thee times every day.Your local pharmacy may also have a basin that fits over the toilet which may be easier for you.
To treat with a warm compress, get a clean, cotton wash towel and soak it in warm (not hot) water. Apply the compress for about 10-15 minutes, three times a day. Some find it helpful to apply ice for a few minutes first.Once you have soaked and are dry, use a small amount of aloe vera gel or Preparation HTM to help with hemorrhoidal pain and/or discomfort. Preparation HTM ointment contains petroleum jelly, mineral oil, shark liver oil and phenylephrine. Phenylephrine acts as a decongestant and helps shrink the hemorrhoid. Aloe vera gel contains components that inhibit infection and help in healing minor wounds.Try witch hazel. Witch hazel is found at most pharmacies, which is a clear liquid derived from the witch hazel plant. A cotton pad soaked in witch hazel after a bowel movement. Witch hazel acts as an astringent, helps clean the area, reduces itching, and can help reduce the swelling. Witch hazel is usually quite inexpensive.
It is also good for a facial toner.
Pre- Packaged hemorrhoid wipes (which usually contain witch hazel) are sometimes available, which is convenient for slipping into a wallet or purse.



, If the suggestions above don't end the discomfort, you may want to try an over-the-counter medication. There are several options that may be helpful.


You can try placing glycerin suppositories into the rectum. These can help lubricate the area and reduce discomfort. Use these after a bowel movement, because they can also stimulate the urge to pass stool. Only use these for a week to 10 days. Longer use can damage the anal area and lead to other problems.You can also lubricate the anal area with petroleum jelly or ointments containing zinc oxide (e.g. Desitin).
Another option is to try ointments containing 1% hydrocortisone. Hydrocortisone is a steroid that can help reduce inflammation and itching. Again, stop use after a week to 10 days, as longer use can damage the skin in the anal area and lead to other, more serious problems.Ask your pharmacist for help finding an over-the-counter local anesthetic.The pharmacist may recommend a cream or ointment such as Aveno Anti-itch, Nupercainal, Solarcaine, or Lidoderm. These products can numb the pain, but check with your doctor first. They can sometimes interact with other medications you may be taking.You can also try using over-the-counter pain relievers. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve) can all provide temporary relief., If none of these approaches are helping, or if your hemorrhoids are internal, you may need to seek surgery for the condition. Talk to your doctor about your options.


Medical treatment may involve an injection to reduce the size of the hemorrhoid. It can also include banding to shut off the blood supply, or cauterization to sealing off the hemorrhoid. In some cases, you may need surgery to remove large hemorrhoids.Some hemorrhoid surgery methods do not require any cutting. Sometimes an offending hemorrhoid can be dealt with in a simple procedure.

, Hemorrhoids are painful to sit on, and it is not always an option to stay upright. Many cushions are available to take pressure off of the area, and make sitting more comfortable and less likely to aggravate sensitive tissues. A good pharmacist can help you out. (These cushions are also often used by people who have injured their coccyx (tail bone), so you can say you did that if you are embarrassed.)

, Using an ice pack can help take some of the discomfort from the area, and help decrease swelling. It is also a non-invasive, simple, drug free way to handle this problem.

Eat more fiber.,
Avoid problem foods.,
Drink more water.",How to Reduce Hemorrhoid Pain3," Eating foods that are high in fiber is a simple way of decreasing the likelihood of hemorrhoids.In particular, the following foods are good high-fiber options:Berries and other fruits, especially those with an edible skin, such as apples and grapes.
Dark, leafy green vegetables like collard, mustard, and beet greens, as well as Swiss chard.
Other vegetables such as broccoli, spinach, carrots, cauliflower, brussel sprouts, artichokes and green beans.
Beans and other legumes such as kidney, navy, garbanzo, pinto, lima, and white beans, as well as lentils, and black eyed peas.
Whole, unprocessed grains. An easy rule of thumb is that if it is a light color or white, it is probably processed. Cereals like granola tend to have the highest fiber. If you are buying boxed cereals, read the label to make sure your choice is high in fiber.
Seeds and nuts such as pumpkin, sesame, sunflower, or flax seeds, as well as almonds, walnuts and pecans.

, While foods that are high in fiber can help prevent hemorrhoids, other foods may make them more likely to occur.


Try to avoid “junk food” such as chips and other unhealthy snacks as much as possible. This is a good choice in general, but when you eat processed or salty junk food, you also increase the risk of hemorrhoids.
Avoid spicy foods. Many spices may feel just as “spicy” on the way out as they do on the way in.

, Increasing the amount of water you consume helps to keep stools soft. This reduces the amount of strain needed to pass stools.Experts do not have a hard and fast rule about how much water you should drink each day. The most common recommendation is to drink about eight 8-ounce glasses. Use that as a starting point and find what works best for you.Get some exercise. Increasing your exercise can help hemorrhoids. It also does not have to be a great amount of exercise. Just choose a parking space further away from your destination, or walk to the corner store more often.
Even simply decreasing the amount of time you spend sitting can be helpful. If your work allows it, get up every half hour or so and walk around a bit."

Alert your passengers.,
Try to pull over carefully.,
At higher speeds, use extreme caution.,
Vomit outside only under safe conditions.,
Vomit straight ahead.",How to Vomit While Driving2," Let your passengers know if you are suddenly overcome with nausea. Passengers can help either by giving you something to vomit into or, in dire need, by grabbing control of the wheel. Someone can also cup their hands as an impromptu vomit bag. Gross, yes, but perhaps better than a lingering stench in the car of vomiting on your clothes. The important thing is that they know what is happening and do not panic.

, The most important thing is controlling the car and the ensuring the safety of you, your passengers, and other motorists and pedestrians. Your clothes are the least of your worries. If you are driving at a slower speed, between 10 to 30 mph, try to pull over. If that proves to be impossible and there are no or only a few cars behind you, slow to a stop, turn on your hazard lights, and vomit.


Don’t worry about the reaction of other motorists in this situation. At slow speeds, there is little danger in stopping in the road. Open the door and vomit if possible.
If you can, pull over onto the side of the road. At the first sign of nausea, brace your body for another couple seconds and attempt a safe, slow maneuver onto the road shoulder.

, Do not stop in the middle of the road. Drive defensively, use your indicator, and do not assume other cars will slow down for you.


Do not pull into the center divide on a freeway or highway. Center divides are closer to the fastest moving cars and offer less space than the shoulder.

, As said, as slower speeds you should be able to stop, open your door, and vomit onto the pavement. However, this maneuver is very dangerous on faster roads and expressways. Even pulled onto the shoulder, you should avoid getting out of your car. Exercise caution. It is better to hurl on your floor mats than to be seriously injured by another car.


At high speeds, and if stopping is impossible take your foot off the accelerator while preparing to vomit and hover your foot over the brake in case you need to slow the car down quickly.

, If unable to pull over, your primary aim should be to maintain control over the vehicle. Do not pivot your head to the side and take your eyes off the road. Such a movement naturally causes one to swerve. Instead, look straight ahead and aim for a container or, barring that, the steering wheel/column or front window. You can wipe it off later with your hand.


If a bag or container is unavailable, you might also pull out your shirt collar and vomit onto your chest. While gross, this minimizes head movement and keeps you safest.
Alternatively, aim for the floor. It is better to vomit on the seat or floor than on a console with sound system and air conditioning/heating controls etc.

Purchase a wristband.,
Make your own wristband.,
Locate the pressure point on your arm.,
Correctly position the wristband.",How to Stop Nausea With Acupressure2," Anti-nausea wristbands are designed to apply pressure to the correct pressure point on your wrist. They usually have a knob or flat button positioned over the acupressure point. Several styles are available and are made from knitted fabric, plastic, or woven nylon.


Choose a band based on your own preferences, budget, and sense of style.

, If you don't want to spend money on a band, you can put together one using a wristwatch or sweatband and a small stone or button. Simply place the stone or button underneath the band and secure., With your opposite hand, place 3 fingers below the crease of your wrist. Place your thumb right below them and center it in between the two large tendons. This is the pressure point.Specifically, you're looking for the P6, or inner gate, pressure point which relieves nausea. The same point on the opposite side of your arm is known as the P5, or outer gate.

, Make sure the knob, button, bead, or stone is directly covering the pressure point. Then, secure the band so you feel medium to firm pressure on that spot. The wristband should not slide or wiggle around your wrist, but be set firmly in place.


Make sure the wristband is not too tight. You should not feel pain; if you do, loosen the band.
You might feel relief as soon as you put it on, but after your body grows accustomed to the pressure, you'll need to press down on the acupressure point for extra relief."

Safeguard yourself from germs.,
Scrape up the worst of the mess.,
Sprinkle the affected area with an absorbent substance.,
Vacuum up the remaining vomit.,
Buy or make a cleaning solution.,
Apply the cleaner to the soiled surface.,
Blot at the stain vigorously.,
Repeat until the vomit is completely gone.,
Dust the surface with baking soda.,
Let the baking soda sit overnight.,
Air out the room.,
Vacuum up the dried mess.",How to Clean Up Vomit," Before you get anywhere near the mess, you’re going to want to make sure you’re properly protected. Pull on a pair of thick rubber dish gloves and, if possible, wear something to cover your face. Try not to let any part of your body come into contact with the vomit.If you have a weak stomach, it might be a good idea to smear some menthol rub, peppermint oil or another strong fragrance under your nose.Keep small children and pets away from the mess until you’ve had time to treat it.;
, Use a paper plate, sheet of cardboard or folded piece of newsprint to scoop up any thick chunks. Try to get up as much solid and semisolid material as you can. This will make the later stages of cleaning much easier. Make sure you have a trash bag nearby to dispose of the mess, along with the items you used to remove it.It’s not recommended that you use a spatula, plastic scraper or other utensil unless you’re prepared to throw it away afterwards.Take the trash out as soon as you’re finished to minimize the danger of germs spreading.

, Shake some baking soda, kitty litter or cornstarch onto the wet spot. Cover the entire area, being careful not to leave any of the mess exposed. Leave the powder in place for 15-20 minutes to soak up as much as vomit as possible.These materials are especially useful when treating vomit stains on carpet and upholstery, where messes have more spaces to hide.
If you’re unable to take care of the mess right away, you can skip the manual cleanup and go straight for the absorbent layer., Once the powder has had a chance to dry, go over the spot several times using a high power setting. This should take care of most of the vomit itself. However, on textile surfaces there may still be staining and lingering odors to deal with.A brush or dusting attachment make it easier for the suction to reach deep down into carpet fibers.
Give hard surfaces a once-over with a disinfecting wipe or a washcloth soaked in soapy water after vacuuming to finish the job.
Don't forget to empty the vacuum of the dried mess when you're done (ideally in a separate trash bag).

, Enzyme-based cleaners break down proteins, acids and bacteria, disinfecting and deodorizing in one. These can be found at most pharmacies, pet stores or janitorial supply outlets. You also have the option of mixing up your own cleaner using basic household items.A few of the most trusted brands of enzymatic cleaners include Simple Solution, Capture and Nature’s Miracle.To make a basic cleaning solution at home, combine two cups of warm water, half a cup of distilled white vinegar, one tablespoon of clear liquid dish soap and two tablespoons of rubbing alcohol in a small bucket or spray bottle., Spray the vomit stain liberally, including around the outer edges where germs may have begun spreading. Let the cleaner sit for about 5 minutes. It will begin to kill germs immediately. Assuming you’re not using a spray bottle, dip a washcloth or sponge into the cleaning solution, wring out the excess and blot the area around the stain.Be careful not to oversaturate carpet or delicate upholstery. Too much moisture may damage certain materials or make it more likely for mold and mildew to develop.

, Press the cloth or sponge into the spot to work in the disinfecting solution. Avoid scrubbing or wiping at first, as this can spread the stain to a larger area. As you work, rotate whatever tool you’re using. Colorful stains are particularly tricky, and should be handled carefully to prevent them from getting out of hand.
A single pass may be all that’s needed to clear vomit from harder surfaces like tile, laminate, hardwood or metal.

, Wring out the cloth or sponge and apply fresh cleaner. Continue dabbing at the stain until it disappears. You’ll likely have to scrub more forcefully at this point to make sure every last trace of the mess comes out of the surface.It may take considerable time and effort to completely erase the stain, but be persistent. The longer you work at it, the better it will look.
For vomit stains on clothing, follow the same steps, then throw the garment into the washing machine and wash it on a high temperature cycle as soon as possible.Launder all towels and washcloths that you used to spot-clean the mess. Used sponges should go straight into the trash.

, Cover the affected area while it’s still damp so that the baking soda has an easier time sticking. If possible, place another object (like a bucket, bowl or plastic washtub) over the stain so that it’s completely enclosed. That way, more of the odor will be trapped rather than escaping into the air.You should follow up with this step even if you used baking soda to soak up the vomit originally. A second application will most likely be needed to rid the area of more persistent odors.

, It will take several hours for the sodium bicarbonate to absorb the remainder of the odor-causing residue. In the meantime, there’s not much else you can do but be patient.Wait until the baking soda has solidified into dry clumps before suctioning it up.

, Spray the room with a powerful air freshener or a homemade version mixed from water, fresh citrus juice and essential oils. If possible, leave a door or window open to the room to promote ventilation. Most of the smell should dissipate within a couple of hours.Turning on the overhead fan or air conditioning can help cut down on overpowering odors. Avoid running the heater, which can thicken odors and make them more pronounced.
Burning scented candles may also help improve the air quality in the room.

, Sweep the area from multiple angles, using a variety of head attachments as needed. Run your hand over the spot to make sure you didn’t miss any baking soda. After you’ve vacuumed a second time, it will be hard to tell there was ever a stain there in the first place.Use a handheld vacuum or Shop-Vac to remove baking soda from your car interior or other hard-to-reach spots.
Be sure to empty out the contents of the vacuum into the trash to get rid of the clumps before using it again.

Look up from reading every few seconds.,
Minimize the physical sensations of motion while you read.,
Open a window.,
Relax and don’t stress about it if you start feeling ill. Getting anxious will make you more prone to nausea.,
Eat lightly before and during travel.,
Settle your stomach while you read.,
Wear acupressure bands while you read.,
Don’t smoke or ride in a car that smells of smoke.",How to Avoid Nausea when Reading in the Car1," When you do, look out at the horizon. Fixating on a stable object on the horizon and looking out the window will help your body to match the visual cues of motion with the physical cues like the vibrations.Don’t try to focus on vegetation that is whipping by on the side of the road. It will make you more dizzy.
Holding the book up right instead of putting it down in your lap will make it easier to flick your eyes back and forth between the horizon to the book.
If you start to feel ill, you may need to look out the window for a few minutes before you can return to reading.
You can minimize nausea significantly by closing the eye closest to the nearest window. This serves double purpose: To relieve your brain from processing two visual inputs of your reading material at once, and also to eliminate most of the cues of movement from your field of vision. If you have difficulty keeping it closed, cover it with your hand. Using this technique you might be able to read with no major nuisance.;
, This will help reduce the mismatch between what your body and your eyes are telling your brain. You can do this by:Sitting in a more stable part of the car. The back seat is generally more rocky than the front, so you may do best if you sit in the passenger side in the front seat.
Leaning your head against a pillow or the headrest to keep it as still as you can.
Not reading when you leave the highway and start traveling on windy back roads. Your body gets much stronger physical sensations of movement as the car turns and this will make you more prone to nausea.

, The fresh air blowing over your face as you read will help reduce nausea and prevent you from getting too hot.The fresh air may reinvigorate you.


Fully opening the window may make the pages blow around too much, but chances are that even cracking the window a bit will help a lot.

, Instead take a break from reading and focus on relaxing. You can use relaxation techniques such as: Deep breathing
Meditation

Progressively tensing and relaxing each muscle group in your body

Visualizing a calming landscape
Listening to music
Closing your eyes and taking a brief nap

, While it is enjoyable to snack on rich, junk foods while reading, getting very full can make you more prone to nausea and vomiting. Foods to avoid are:Greasy, fatty foods
Spicy foods
Alcohol

, These foods are light, easy to digest, and will reduce nausea:Dry crackers will help absorb some of your stomach acids.
Hard candies, particularly mints. But be sure to suck on them instead of chewing them.
Carbonated beverages. This will settle your stomach and provide electrolytes.

, These are cloth bands which are elastic and have a little knob on them. Position them on your wrist so that the knob presses on the inside of your wrist between the two tendons running down the middle of your forearm. Stimulating this acupressure point is thought to prevent nausea.They should not be so tight that they cause pain or cut off the circulation to your hand.
They have not been scientifically demonstrated to be effective, but some people may find that they help.

, If you start to feel nauseous you will be more sensitive to irritants like smoke. Being exposed to the smoke may make you more likely to vomit.Strong air fresheners may also have this effect.

Eat healthy and get active.,
Avoid high fiber foods.,
Limit fatty or sugary foods.",How to Take Garcinia Cambogia1," Taking this supplement alone will not cause you to lose weight unless you also change your diet and increase your level of physical activity. You don’t necessarily need a special diet. Eating nutritious meals and snacks throughout the day is a great place to start. You should also remove sweets, processed food, and sweetened soft drinks in order to lose weight.


You don’t need to start running marathons to get active. Start with smaller steps that will increase your activity level, help you move around more, and keep you healthy. Begin with walking, gardening, hiking, swimming, playing golf, or playing tennis. Then, work your way up to higher level activities.;
, There have been no scientific studies to date that prove garcinia cambogia can help you lose weight. But, a number of studies have suggested that if you use garcinia while avoiding certain foods, you may increase your weight loss, especially around your waist. You should limit your intake of high fiber foods, particularly around the time you take the garcinia.


This means you don’t want to eat the high fiber foods with every meal because you take garcinia 30-60 minutes before meals. To get your daily fiber intake, eat high fiber snacks outside of this window.
These snacks include nuts, granola bars, kale chips, fruit, especially those with edible rinds like apples, cherries, and plums, and raw vegetables such as broccoli, carrots, and celery.

, You should also avoid foods that have too much fat or too much sugar. This includes fast food, chips and dips, cakes, pies, bacon, mayonnaise, candy, and chocolate. These all have a high fat or sugar content, and some of them have both.


You should also limit you intake of breads, potatoes, pasta, and sauces thickened with wheat flour.
Focus more on fish , lean meats such as turkey, chicken, and lean beef, and leafy green vegetables such as spinach and arugula.

If your stomach turns queasy when you see or envision a food, do not eat it.,
Eat foods that are easy to digest.,
Eat small meals and chew your food thoroughly.,
Take small sips of liquid.,
Be aware of what medications that can upset your stomach.,
Get sufficient rest.,
Try motion sickness medications and antihistamines.,
See your doctor.",How to Keep Things Down when You're Sick," Some doctors suggest the BRAT diet, which stands for Bananas, Rice, Applesauce, and Toast. These foods can help you recover from nausea and vomiting because the foods are low in fiber and easy to digest and help replace nutrients lost.The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAFP) no longer recommends the BRAT diet for children. Instead, the AAFP recommends that children resume eating a normal, well-balanced, age appropriate diet within 24 hours of getting sick.Some other foods that are easy to digest:
Crackers: saltines, oyster crackers, rice crackers or other ""white flour"" crackers.
Boiled potatoes
Noodles/Pasta: plain egg noodles, pasta, or ramen noodles. Avoid whole wheat.
Gelatin: often referred by brand names such as ""Jello"" although any will do. The choice of flavoring is yours. ;
, Once you are able to keep down very simple foods such as broth, rice, bananas, and toast, add more complex foods as you feel better. This can help minimize nausea and vomiting and will not strain your stomach.Examples of more complex foods you can try as you feel better are cereal, fruit, cooked vegetables, chicken, creamy peanut butter, and white pasta without sauce., It’s important to be gentle on your stomach at this time. Avoiding foods such as dairy or spicy dishes can help prevent further vomiting.Avoid fatty foods, including fried dishes. For example, if you have been vomiting, a greasy cheeseburger is likely to exacerbate your nausea and may make you throw up more.Stay away from spicy foods such as curries, chili, Buffalo wings or barbeque.Dairy products including milk, yogurt, and cheese may make you more nauseous or vomit.Sugary foods such as cookies and cakes may trigger nausea or cause more vomiting.Stay away from whole grain breads, cereals, or pastas until your nausea has passed. Nuts and seeds may also upset your stomach., Stay hydrated when you have been vomiting or sick. Drinking plenty of clear liquids may help you stay hydrated and also soothe your stomach and relive nausea.Liquids are more important than solids. Your body will suffer from dehydration long before issues from fasting become problematic. Many foods contain a lot of liquid, such as gelatin, bananas, or rice.
You can drink any beverage that is clear or turns into a clear liquid when at room temperature, such as an ice cube, soup, ginger ale, or ice pop.Water, fruit juices without pulp, soup broths, clear sodas such as ginger ale or Sprite, teas, and popsicles may help you stay hydrated and keep you from vomiting.Electrolyte or sports drinks can help replace some nutrients and also settle your stomach. However, do not use full strength. Either dilute by at least half, or for every sip of energy drink, take a drink of water. Sports drinks are typically far too concentrated, and diluting them is easier on the stomach. , There is some medical evidence that ginger and peppermint teas may help nausea and vomiting.Brew yourself either ginger or peppermint teas to help soothe and settle your stomach and stay hydrated.You can make these by either using commercial ginger or peppermint tea bags or using a few mint leaves or a piece of ginger steeped in boiling water., Avoid drinking anything that is hard on the stomach. Consuming liquids such as alcohol, coffee, or milk can make nausea worse and may make you vomit.Do not put cream in any tea you drink., It seems common sense, but unfortunately sometimes people will rush to eat foods before the stomach is ready. If you are actively vomiting, wait to eat solid foods until you can consume them without throwing up. Instead, drink clear liquids or electrolyte beverages to help keep you from becoming dehydrated.Eat solid foods only after you haven’t vomited for about six hours., The body is sometimes wiser than the head. Also, if you feel nauseated just thinking about a certain food, chances are good you will not keep it down. There is a mental element to how your body processes nausea, and it is very difficult to overcome. If your stomach churns at the thought of eating a banana, but seems fine with a small bowl of rice, eat the rice.

, Certain foods, including dairy, can exacerbate nausea and vomiting. Eating foods that are easy to digest may help you keep them down and alleviate vomiting.Once you’re able, try solid foods on the BRAT diet and other simple options such as boiled potatoes and clear soups. You can add more complex foods as you feel better.

, While you are eating a simple, bland diet, eat small meals throughout the day and make sure that you chew your food slowly and thoroughly. This may help minimize nausea and help you keep food down.Start out with a piece of toast or a banana. Add other simple foods as you are able. For example, if you are able to keep a piece a toast down and are still hungry, have a banana a half an hour or an hour later.
Chewing your food thoroughly will help keep your stomach from having to do extra work digesting.
Taking small bites will help you chew more thoroughly. This method will also help you see if you are able to tolerate food more easily than if you overwhelm your stomach by overloading it.

, Just as it’s important to take small bites, it’s also helpful to take small sips of liquid. This may help not overwhelm your stomach and cause further nausea.Sip 4-8oz. of clear liquid every hour and only 1-2 ounces at a time. This will help keep you hydrated without increasing your risk for further vomiting or hyponatremia, which is having too little sodium in your body.If you can’t tolerate sips of liquid, try sucking on ice chips until you can safely consume 1-2oz. of liquid at a time., Certain medications, such as oxycodone, can upset your stomach and cause nausea. If you are taking any medications that unsettle the stomach, speak to your doctor about discontinuing their use until you feel better.Pain medications such as codeine, hydrocodone, morphine, or oxycodone can cause nausea.Some over the counter medications such as iron or potassium supplements, and even aspirin, can cause nausea., In many cases, simply resting can help relieve nausea and vomiting. Lie down as often as you can, especially after eating, to help you keep food down.Getting too much activity can make nausea and vomiting worse by unsettling your stomach., If you are unable to keep anything down because of motion sickness, consider taking a medication or antihistamine. These may help alleviate the nausea and vomiting and allow you to eat something.You can try over the counter antihistamines such as dimenhydrinate to help keep food down. Follow either your doctor’s instructions or the directions on the packaging.If you’re experiencing severe nausea and vomiting, your doctor can prescribe scopolamine, which comes as an adhesive patch.Scopolamine can only be used by adults.Alleviate nausea with pressure points. This really works, and requires no medication or any great expertise in Eastern style medicine.

, If you experience nausea, vomiting, or the inability to keep food or liquids down for a protracted period of time, see your doctor. She will help rule out more serious conditions and can develop a course of treatment to help you keep down foods.


If you have been vomiting for longer than 24 hours, see your doctor as soon as possible.If you haven’t kept any fluids down for 12 or more hours, seek medical treatment.If you have blood or dark material in your vomit, go to the emergency room.If you have severe vomiting—you vomit more than three times per day—see a medical professional."

Know the origins.,
Learn the benefits.,
Know the issues related to supplements.",How to Take Garcinia Cambogia3," Garcinia cambogia is a tropical fruit native to Indonesia. It is also known as brindleberry, Malabar tamarind, and kudam puli. It looks like a small, light green pumpkin and is used in Indonesia for cooking. It has a sour taste., Garcinia contains a type of citric acid, hydroxycitric acid (HCA), which appears to encourage weight loss by regulating the release of serotonin and the uptake of blood sugar. It also increases the oxidation of existing fats and decreasing the synthesis of new fat. While it is not very clear yet, this may mean that Garcinia may increase the biochemical use of fats for energy and decrease the amounts of new fat that is made.Serotonin is a type of neurotransmitter, which is a chemical messenger between nerves and other types of cells. It is related to feelings of happiness, moods, and a sense of well-being.Studies have been conducted to determine whether garcinia supplements encourage weight loss in people who are overweight, and the results have not been clear cut. The upshot is that concentrated Garcinia may help people lose weight, especially when combined with a healthy diet and exercise. But there is no scientific evidence showing it actually has an effect., Since garcinia is dietary supplement, it is not subject to review by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This means that the FDA cannot approve garcinia according to its health and safety standards.


Always use caution when taking dietary supplements, and be sure to check with your doctor before use.
Whenever buying a supplement, make as certain as possible that the company follows Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and has been in business for some time.
Check out the company website. They should state that they follow GMP and should have some information about the company, their philosophy, and their company mission.

Learn the correct dose.,
Take garcinia as a pill.,
Consider liquid garcinia.",How to Take Garcinia Cambogia4," From some early studies, a safe dose of Garcinia appears to be up to 2800 mg per day. But, it's not known what may happen if you take these amounts, so you should stay well below that dose.Once you have found a good place to buy the supplement, you need to understand how much of the HCA you need to take. The dose of HCA should be about 1500 mg per day, though this varies from supplement to supplement.


Make sure you follow the manufacturer’s instructions and you consult a knowledgeable healthcare professional before starting.

, Garcinia comes in two different forms. The first is a pill form, either in a tablet or capsule. If you buy the supplement as a pill, take the recommended dosage of garcinia as a tablet or capsule with water. Take the pill about 30-60 minutes before each meal.


In general, garcinia is taken three times a day. This means that each pill should be 500 mg. That way, you stay within your daily dosage suggestions.

, The second form that you can take of garcinia is liquid. The liquid form of garcinia usually recommends taking 1-2 drops before every meal, but the amount can vary based on the dropper or concentration. Take the drop or drops under your tongue and let them stay for a minute or so. Then, have your regular meal 30-60 minutes later.


Before you take the liquid form, ask your pharmacist or a knowledgeable healthcare professional how much garcinia is in every drop for the particular kind you have. You should also ask how many drops would equal a total of about 1500 mg of garcinia every day. Once you have the total number of drops, divide that by three and take that amount before each meal.

This is not a long-term diet.
You should be able to slowly switch to a more regular diet in 24-48 hours.
You can add other easy to digest, bland foods (clear soup, crackers, etc.) to this diet.
It is important to note that if you are actively vomiting, stick to drinking clear liquids only. The BRAT diet is recommended only after about six hours without vomiting.

, Studies show that about 1 gram (0.04 oz) of ginger can effectively reduce nausea.Take up to one gram of ginger at a time, up to 4 grams per day. If you are pregnant, ask your doctor before taking ginger — the dosage for pregnancy ranges from 650mg to 1 gram, but should never exceed 1 gram. There are many ways to work ginger into your snacks, though none of them provide a high dose.

Nibble crystallized ginger.
Make ginger tea by steeping grated fresh ginger in boiling water.
Buy and drink ginger ale.
Not everyone will respond to ginger. A portion of the population will not get relief from use of ginger, for unknown reasons.

, Although there isn’t a scientific consensus on peppermint, there are some studies that show that it can effectively soothe nausea. Peppermint has been used for digestive problems such as heartburn and indigestion, and it may help stops spasms in the stomach that lead to vomiting. Peppermint-flavored candies such as Mentos or Tic-Tacs should be eaten in moderation, as sugary sweets can make nausea worse. Sugar-free peppermint gum is an option, but be careful — chewing brings a lot of air into the stomach and can cause bloating, worsening the nauseous sensations. If you’re still on a liquid diet, peppermint tea is a great option.

Sports drinks can be helpful, when modified. Vomiting can drain your body of both liquids and electrolytes such as potassium and sodium. Sports drinks contain both of these, and therefore seem an excellent choice for replenishing these. However, sports drinks are actually far more concentrated than necessary for dehydration, containing far more sugar than necessary and unhelpful chemicals such as artificial colors-all to market the drink rather than necessarily what is actually best for you. However, it is easy to dilute the average sports drink:
Cut the sports drink by half or quarter with water.
Or, for every portion of sports drink, have a portion of water. This may be helpful if a person is being a bit stubborn about drinking water, but the sugary water is appealing. , Although it is high in sugar, flat soda can be useful to a queasy stomach. To make a soda flat, put it in a Tupperware-like container, shake, let out the air, seal, and shake, until no more carbonation is left.

Cola has been used as an anti-nausea cure for a long time, even before the use of it in soft drinks.
Ginger ale containing real ginger, likewise, is a anti-nausea elixir.

, Although drinking liquids is important, there are some drinks that will make your nausea worse. Alcohol, caffeine, and carbonated beverages, for example, are not useful for nausea treatment, as they can further irritate the stomach.If your nausea is accompanied by diarrhea, avoid milk and other dairy products until you’ve recovered. The lactose in dairy is hard to digest, and will worsen or prolong the diarrhea./images/thumb/e/e6/Cure-Nausea-Step-12-Version-9.jpg/v4-550px-Cure-Nausea-Step-12-Version-9.jpg

Seek relief with non-prescription drugs.,
See a doctor for prescription medication if necessary.,
Take all medications as directed.",How to Cure Nausea3," If you're sure that the nausea has a temporary cause and isn't a symptom underlying medical issue, you can take a variety of over-the-counter medications. Try to pinpoint the cause of your nausea — whether upset stomach or motion sickness — before purchasing an over-the-counter drug. They're often targeted toward specific types of nausea.
/images/thumb/4/49/Cure-Nausea-Step-13-Version-6.jpg/v4-550px-Cure-Nausea-Step-13-Version-6.jpg
/images/thumb/4/49/Cure-Nausea-Step-13-Version-6.jpg/v4-300px-Cure-Nausea-Step-13-Version-6.jpg









For example, nausea from an upset stomach or gastroenteritis can be treated with Pepto-Bismol, Maalox, or Mylanta. Nausea from motion sickness, though, would be better treated with Dramamine.

, Some medical procedures, like surgery or cancer treatment, can cause severe nausea that requires prescription-strength drugs. Nausea can also be a symptom of various medical conditions, such as chronic kidney disease or peptic ulcers.There are many different classes of drugs that can be used to treat nausea, and a doctor will be able to match your cause to an appropriate medication./images/thumb/7/7e/Cure-Nausea-Step-14-Version-6.jpg/v4-550px-Cure-Nausea-Step-14-Version-6.jpg
/images/thumb/7/7e/Cure-Nausea-Step-14-Version-6.jpg/v4-300px-Cure-Nausea-Step-14-Version-6.jpg









For example, Zofran (ondansetron) is commonly used to offset the nausea from chemotherapy and radiation treatment.Phenergan (promethazine) is prescribed for use after surgeries and to treat motion sickness, and scopolamine is used to treat motion sickness alone.Domperidone (sold as Motilium in the UK) is used to treat seriously upset stomachs, and is sometimes used as part of treatment for Parkinson’s disease., Read the labels on over-the-counter medications closely for dosage instructions, and follow them carefully. Prescription medication also carries instructions on the packaging, but defer to your doctor’s instructions. She may slightly alter your dosage based on her knowledge of your medical history.

Take ginger capsules.,
Make ginger tea.,
Stay away from ginger ale.,
Try other herbal teas.",How to Cure Nausea Naturally Without Medication2," Ginger has been used to treat nausea of many different causes including chemotherapy-induced nausea , , , and the nausea of early pregnancy., Ginger works by inhibiting or suppressing certain types of brain and gut receptors that are related to the sense of nausea.For nausea after chemotherapy, the recommended dose is 1,000-2,000mg in capsule form every day for the first 3 days.,For morning sickness in early pregnancy, take 250mg of ginger 4 times a day.Ginger has also been studied for the treatment of post-surgical nausea and has been shown to be very effective. , Be sure to tell your doctor that you want to take ginger, since it may increase the amount of bleeding during surgery.Take 500-1,000 mg one hour before surgery.
For nausea associated with food poisoning, gastroenteritis and most other non-serious causes, take 250-1,000 mg of ginger 4 times a day.Do not give ginger to children under 12 months old., If you prefer ginger tea to a capsule, you can also make your own ginger tea at home. Drink 4-6 cups of this tea daily.


Buy fresh ginger and cut off a 2-inch piece.
Wash the ginger and peel or cut off the tan-colored “skin” to get to the paler, almost lemon-yellow ginger.
Cut the ginger into small pieces. You can use a grater, but watch your fingers when grating. You need about a tablespoon of ginger.
Add the ginger pieces to 2 cups of boiling water.
Cover the pan and boil for another minute.
Turn off the heat and let the ginger tea steep for 3-5 minutes.
Pour off a cup and add honey or stevia to taste
Cool to a comfortable temperature and sip the tea.

, Relieving nausea is more effective with fresh ginger rather than ginger ale. First of all, most ginger ales do not contain real ginger. Second, they either have high levels of sugar, or high levels of High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS). When you are nauseous, you should avoid all sugars. The sugar generally makes you feel worse, since both high and low blood sugar can cause nausea!, Peppermint, clove and cinnamon may help relieve nausea, although it is not clinically known how this works. It’s possible that the herbs directly affect nausea centers in the brain. This helps to reduce any viral or bacterial infection that may be causing nausea. These herbal teas may also simply allow you to relax and minimize the sense of nausea.Feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium) is another remedy for nausea that has been used in tea form for centuries. It may be particularly helpful when used to treat nausea associated with migraines.Do not take feverfew if you are allergic to ragweed, chrysanthemums, marigolds, camomile, yarrow, or daisies. These may be cross-allergies.


To make these teas, steep a teaspoon of the dried powder or leaf in 1 cup of boiled water. Add honey or stevia (and lemon) to taste.
These herbs all have been traditionally used to treat nausea and are all recognized as safe to use."
"
Try aromatherapy.,
Get acupressure.",How to Cure Nausea Naturally Without Medication3," Aromatherapy uses essential oils derived from plants for healing purposes. Put a drop of peppermint oil or lemon oil on the insides of your wrists and on your temples.


Check to make sure you don’t have a skin sensitivity to essential oils by putting a single drop of the oil on your wrist. If you are sensitive to it, you may experience a rash, redness or itching. If you do have a sensitivity, try another oil.
Both peppermint and lemon oil have been traditionally used to treat nausea.Several studies indicate that relief from peppermint or lemon oil may be due to direct action on the brain’s center, which influences nausea. It’s also possible that the oils are relaxing, thereby reducing feelings of nausea.In order for this to be effective, use concentrated essential oils. Peppermint or lemon candy or scents are not likely to have real peppermint or lemon oil. In addition, they are not likely to have these substances at high enough levels to be useful.
Use caution when trying aromatherapy if you have asthma. Strong scents such as those in aromatherapy oils can cause wheezing in people with asthma.

, In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the body is viewed as having a system of energy meridians networked throughout. Applying needles (as in acupuncture) or pressure (as in acupressure) to specific points along these meridians can re-balance the energy and reduce the symptoms. Try the “p6”, “Nei guan” or “inner gate” point to relieve nausea. This is located about 2 finger-widths below the crease of your wrists (at the base of the palms).


Start with your palms facing you. Feel for two tendons around the midpoint of that area above your wrist.
Using the index and middle finger of the opposite hand, apply firm, but gentle pressure for about 10-20 seconds and release.
Repeat on the other arm.
You can also press on the p6 point while also pressing on the outer side of your wrist at the same time. To do so, use your thumb on p6 and your index finger on the other side of the same arm. Hold for 10-20 seconds and release.
Repeat as often as necessary. You can also hold it for longer periods of time, even up to a minute or two.
Do this before every meal or beverage."

Wash and dry the containers you're intending to use.,
Assemble and weigh the ingredients.

,
Put the cocoa butter and beeswax into a heatproof pouring vessel such as a metallic jug or pitcher.,
Melt the ingredients.,
Leaving the water simmering, take the heatproof vessel out of the saucepan using oven mitts.,
Return the vessel to the saucepan.,
Leave the salve to cool fully.,
Once the mixture has solidified into a salve, it's ready for use.",How to Make Lavender Healing Salve," Allow them to air dry, as this is the most hygienic method for drying. To do so, simply set them on a tea towel and leave for a time.


Suitable containers range from well cleaned used makeup jars, spice jars, to any other small glass containers you have. Glass is the best material, but be sure the containers are able to handle heat up to up to 95 C (200°F). Plastics can leach chemicals into the salve as well as break down over time, so avoid using them.;
,, Put the heatproof vessel into a saucepan of boiling water.

, Do this by keeping the water simmering and allowing the ingredients to gently come together.

, simmering Add the olive oil and lavender oil ingredients to the vessel. At this point, you'll notice that the mixture will solidify a little, which is fine.

, This will liquefy the mixture once again. Stir the mixture using a skewer to evenly distribute the contents. Once mixed thoroughly, quickly and carefully pour the resulting liquid into the prepared containers.

, If you want to place it in the fridge, that's fine.

, Use on dried skin as required.


It's a good idea to label and date the salve so that you remember what it's for and when it was made.

Purchase quality alcohol.,
Use a suitable container.,
Prepare the tincture.,
Using a butter knife, stir around the edge of the glass container to ensure that air bubbles are broken.

,
Seal the container.,
Strain the tincture.,
Decant the liquid into a prepared tincture bottle.,
Store and use.",How to Make an Herbal Tincture," The preferred type of alcohol for producing a tincture is vodka.This is owing to its being colorless, odorless, and fairly flavorless. If you cannot obtain vodka, brandy, rum, or whiskey can be substituted. Whatever alcohol is chosen, it must be 80 proof (namely, 40% alcohol) to prevent mildewing of the plant material in the bottle.


It is also possible to make a tincture from quality apple cider vinegar or glycerin.The alternatives may work better where the patient refuses alcohol.;
, The container for the tincture should be glass or ceramic. Avoid using metallic or plastic containers because these can react with the tincture or leach dangerous chemicals over time. Items such as a Mason jar, a glass bottle with an attached stopper, etc., are ideal for steeping a tincture. In addition, you will need to get some small dark glass tincture bottles for storing the tincture in once it has been made; these bottles should have a tight screw-on or tight clip-on lid to prevent air intrusion during storage but to allow for ease of use. Ensure that all containers are both washed clean and sterilized prior to use.

, You can prepare a tincture by measurement or by sight; it really depends on your level of comfort with simply adding herbs and judging by eye, or whether you feel more comfortable adding them by measured weight. Also, you should know whether you want to add fresh, powdered, or dried herbs to the tincture. Some suggestions for adding the herbs in the order of fresh, powdered, or dried are as follows:


Add enough fresh chopped herbs to fill the glass container. Cover with alcohol.Add 4 ounces (113g) of powdered herb with 1 pint (473ml) of alcohol (or vinegar/glycerin).Add 7 ounces (198g) of dried herb material to 35 fluid ounces (1 liter) of alcohol (or vinegar/glycerin).

,, Place it into a cool, dark area; a cupboard shelf works best. The container should be stored there for 8 days to a month.Shake the container regularly. Humbart Santillo recommends shaking it twice a day for 14 days,while James Wong recommends shaking it occasionally.Be sure to label the steeping tincture so that you know what it is and the date on which it was made. Keep it out of the reach of children and pets.

, Once the steeping time is finished (either the tincture instructions you're following will inform you of this or you'll know already from experience but if not, about two weeks is a good steeping time), strain the tincture as follows:


Place a muslin cloth across a sieve. Place a large bowl underneath to catch the strained liquid.
Gently pour the steeped liquid through the muslin-lined sieve. The muslin will capture the plant material and the liquid will pass through into the bowl underneath.
Press the herb material with a wooden or bamboo spoon to squeeze out some more liquid, and lastly, twist the muslin to extract any leftover liquid from the herbs.

, Use a small funnel for this step if you don't have a steady hand. Tighten the lid and date and label the tincture.


If you're storing this for long-term without using until later, consider sealing the caps with wax., A tincture can have a shelf life of up to 5 years owing to the fact that alcohol is a preservative.However, know the properties of the particular herbs you've used, and follow the guidance of the recipe from which you're making the tincture in terms of how long to keep the tincture for.


Follow the instructions relevant to your tincture for usage; consult a qualified, reputable herbalist or a health professional if you need more information and bear in mind that herbal treatments can be dangerous if you don't know the properties of the herb and its consequences.

This may be a good time to check for a fever. While not every illness causes elevated fever, it can help narrow down why the nausea is happening.
Was it something you ate that turned bad? Food poisoning is surprisingly common. Check with other members of your household--if all of your roommates have stomachaches after eating dinner last night, it may be due to food poisoning.
If you keep having issues more than a couple of days, it is possible that you may have a gastro-intestinal issue that goes beyond a ""stomach bug"". There are a lot of medical reasons nausea happens, from simple to severe. A trip to your general practitioner may be in order. Severe and prolonged nausea may even be a reason to go to the ER (as discussed more in-depth below.)

, If you have frequent bouts of nausea, keep a journal for a couple weeks to see if you can find a pattern that points to the culprit. If you suspect food intolerance or other reactions, avoid or limit the food and talk to your doctor.

Lactose intolerance is a common cause of nausea. The ability to digest milk comfortably as an adult is mostly limited to people of European descent, and even then many are lactose-intolerant. Use over-the-counter medications like Lactaid or Dairy Ease to help you digest dairy items, or stick with milk products in which are processed by enzymes, such as yogurt and cheese.
Food sensitivities or even allergies can be another issue. If you notice that you feel queasy shortly after eating strawberries or foods with strawberry, this may be an indicator of this problem.
Food sensitivity and intolerance can only be definitively diagnosed by a qualified medical specialist.
It has become trendy in some regions for people to self-identify as ""gluten intolerant"" and the like without any sort of medical testing. Be careful of such fads. There are some people who react horribly to gluten. But sometimes the ""cure"" is due to a placebo effect or simply a person feeling better after a period of time, and ascribing the ""cure"" to the diet change when in fact it is unclear that it was the diet change, or the fact the body simply healed.

, Before introducing more drugs into your system to treat the nausea, you should first make sure that the source itself isn’t one of the medications you’re already on. Many drugs, like codeine or hydrocodone, can cause nausea and vomiting.If you suffer from ongoing nausea, talk to your doctor about whether any of your medications list it as a side effect. He or she may be able to suggest an alternate medication or a lower dosage.

Try fresh air, whether by rolling down a window, or taking a walk outside for a few minutes.
Avoid smoking.
Void spicy or greasy foods.
Try to keep your head as still as possible to manage motion sickness.
Antihistamines such as Dramamine or Antivert are great over-the-counter medications that can effectively treat motion sickness, as well. These should be taken about 30 minutes to one hour before travel, but can cause drowsiness.
Scopolamine is a medication available by prescription for severe cases.
Some people get relief from ginger and ginger products. Ginger ale (with natural flavoring), ginger root, or ginger candy can all be helpful.
Avoid traveling on a very full or empty stomach.

, Though commonly called “morning sickness,” the nausea that comes with the early (and sometimes later) stages of pregnancy and can come at any time in the day.

Stay tuned.",How to Cultivate and Facilitate Reiki Circles," For those new to Reiki, a circle, or share, is a group of Reiki practitioners simultaneously practicing Reiki on a recipient for a set amount of time, usually fifteen to twenty minutes. The recipient then exchanges places with a practitioner until all in the group have received their treatment.


Strangers bond and healing is facilitated. It literally is magic in action. I also feel it’s one of the best ways to help facilitate world peace by breaking down boundaries in a safe manner and allowing individuals to help each other.;
, Everyone has a unique style. A favorite is where some sort of refreshment is offered, like tea and/or light snacks. The music sets the tone. Depending on the space, you might have candles or ambient lighting.


Above all, you create a safe space for the group healing exploration. Living rooms, furnished basements, community centers, and practitioners’ treatment spaces have all become circles. Years back we even had a rotating Reiki circle in each other’s living rooms. It’s a wonderful way of bringing extra light and healing into a space.
Experiment with live music (which is simply wonderful!), healing lights, healing pets (for those attending who don’t have allergies), incorporating other healing traditions like Shamanism, crystals, and aromatherapy.

, Clearing the space in between sessions is an important part of keeping the energy flowing and the space a sanctuary. Have both rose water and sage to smudge. Rose water is usually not as offensive an aroma as sage and can quickly be sprayed in and around the group.


Chimes, bells and ting-shaws (Tibetan cymbals used to mark the beginning/ending of a ritual) are sound instruments that also can be used at the end of each session, to mark the closing as well as to gently cleanse the space.

, Setting healthy boundaries for the circle creates optimum healing space.


The original author used to facilitate a sound healing Reiki circle, called Reiki Soundscape, with live musicians and instruments available for participants to use. At one circle, a practitioner came in and started banging mercilessly on the drum, shaking all of us up. Another practitioner began to do shamanic psychic surgery with loud cries that also disrupted the flow. Both instances encouraged the author to create a flyer with guidelines for practitioners in coming to an open circle. Loud, excessive noise was not a part of the circle, so it was stated in the guidelines and briefly gone over in the introduction each time.

,


Make little flyers and put them at the corner metaphysical bookstore.
Send a press release to the local paper and explain your healing intentions.
Multitudes of Reiki networking Web sites abound, and even craigslist allows you to post events for free.
The old paper flyer still has a place in letting others know about your circle, giving people something they can hold on to. Use both methods. Experiment, explore. Ask how your attendees found out about your circle. See what works for you.

, A simple mailing list is adequate for newcomers, but you will need to build a way to organize the information you receive. It is recommended that you use both an email and “snail mail” list so that, as your practice grows, you can send out messages of upcoming classes, circles, and other events you are offering. Some people prefer email, others a postcard. For those tech savvy, you might think about Facebook or Twitter contacts as well.


You never know what will come from inviting the general public to your circles, who you will meet, what networks you will create. From the two veterans who attended my circle years ago, our Reiki for Veterans program got its jump-start.
Encourage participants to bring their friends and family as well, an impromptu Reiki education for those who are curious. They might not participate in the circle, but they can certainly receive a session and sit off to the side and watch. During breaks, they will often ask questions or simply bask in the energy that is generated.

, Facilitating a Reiki circle is an excellent way for you, as a budding practitioner, to build your public relations skills as well. You must organize the event, market it, and then facilitate with grace and ease. Welcome to the world of self-promotion as a Reiki professional.


Each circle gets easier and easier, but in the beginning, you might feel overwhelmed. Shadow another facilitator for a while. Ask to co-facilitate and get a feel for the flow and for what details they have to keep track of. Take notes!
Reiki circles are grass-roots community organizing. But it’s important to keep a regular and posted schedule for your circles. People appreciate consistency and will more easily remember the dates of your sessions. Your reliability provides a foundation for you to present yourself as a professional business as well as to assist in the building of community. When you pull people together from such different spheres, you are building a healing community that can have a voice to share with the world.
For some circles, having practitioners pre-register and limiting the number might be a solution to holding a circle in a small space. For others, having them drop in is more appropriate and lends itself to a more casual and formal affair.
In holding a Reiki circle, you are building a tribe, so to speak. Become creative with ways in which you can reach out to this group and keep them informed of your offerings.
In the summer, you can have circles outdoors as well, and holding such a circle is a very magical and powerful experience. Not only are you channeling the healing vibration of Reiki, but you are also tapping into the soothing and grounding energy of the land upon which you are standing.

, Hold monthly circles for global healing. Instead of having clients lie on tables, take world events and places and peoples that were in crisis and put them in the center of your circle where you are seated and send healing energy from a distance. The impressions of each “send” were often quite profound. For every hour of news that you watch or read you should balance with sending healing.


A group out of Seattle, Global Earthsend, apparently has over fifty thousand Reiki practitioners connected worldwide via the Internet who send healing energy to a particular part of the world each Friday night. Again, powerful community involvement is working for world healing.
Before beginning your larger circle within the greater community, allow room for dialogue. Get to meet the other participants. What brings them to your space? Get to know the amazing people who share the same passion for healing that you do. We started the Reiki Fellowship that way, building upon many shared experiences in Reiki circles.

, Circles cost considerably less to the individual than private sessions. But the depth and breadth of where a client can go in an individual treatment certainly exceeds that of a fifteen-minute Reiki circle treatment. Yet, if you consider that most circles are donation based, and if one was to attend an event each week, the monthly cost would be ten times less than paying for private health insurance. Circles are not a substitute for traditional health care, but they certainly serve as a supplement for many.


The perception of “stranger” dies in such an environment. People come together to send healing energy to each other, to the world. Their individual differences are blurred into the healing collective. No one ego stands out. No one is greater than the other. Each person may have certain skills that differ, but together they form a healing unit that amplifies all those individual abilities and makes the unit function as a whole.
Circles are places of deep healing and self-discovery. They provide a safe environment of support and embrace and love reminiscent of being held by a universal mother. The circle becomes the receptacle for a recipient’s self-discovery and healing: “How do I feel about being held by those I had perceived as strangers? These people are now coming together to help me on my path. They have never met me, and yet they hold me.” Each one in turn receives from the group in an equal balance of giving and receiving. There are no expectations.
There are circles being held all over the world, in many different environments. As time goes on, we will see more of them in traditional arenas like hospitals, corporate spaces, and educational institutions because circles do offer an immediate experience of stress-reduction and relaxation.

, Keep doing your work. Hold a circle. Build your practice. Reiki circles as social healing phenomena are beginning to reach their potential. Continue to watch the world transform through the building of healing community and the sharing of Universal Energy.

difficulty breathing or chest pain
purple or blue discoloration of the lips
vomiting and inability to keep liquids down
signs of dehydration, such as feeling dizzy when standing or being unable to urinate

,
Decide whether to get the child vaccinated.",How to Take Care of a Child With Swine Flu," It's ultimately up to you to make the judgment call as to whether your child has the common cold or the flu. Some people think that the difference between a cold and the flu is a fever, but many people who contracted the 2009 H1N1 flu (hereafter referred to by its more popular name, the swine flu) never had a fever. Ideally, you should keep your child home if there is any sneezing, coughing, sore throat, or any of the other symptoms of a common cold. Weigh out whether or not to take your child to a doctor, because most physicians aren't testing for swine flu.However, be sure to watch for signs of infection and distress. If your child has a history of bronchial or asthmatic conditions, be sure to have your child on controller medication.


The only way you can be reasonably sure your child doesn't have the swine flu is if he or she got the complete swine flu vaccine, and their immune system has had a chance to protect itself. Children are protected from swine flu starting 10 days after their last required dose. Children over 10 only need one dose, but children under 10 need two, 21 days apart.So if it hasn't been 10 days after your child's last required dose, he or she might still have contracted the swine flu.;
, The most important thing is to make sure your child doesn't spread the virus. Practice good hygiene, and teach the child to do the same, if they are old enough. Whether the child has the common cold, the seasonal flu, or the swine flu, it's best to keep the virus contained. Even if the child doesn't have the swine flu, his or her immune system will be kept busy by the cold or seasonal flu virus, making them more susceptible to the swine flu. That's why it's important to limit your child's contact with people (including you and others in the household)--both for their protection, and that of everyone else.


If you're especially vulnerable to swine flu, like if you're pregnant or have a compromised immune system, you should see if you can get someone else to take care of the child. Likewise, it's especially important to keep the sick child as isolated as possible from young adults and other children (who seem to be particularly vulnerable to swine flu) in the household, or anyone else who is considered especially vulnerable. Even if you get vaccinated immediately, there are still about 10 days before the vaccine kicks in.

, The following tips will help your child recover faster:


Give fluids to make sure your child is properly hydrated. These can include tea, broth, diluted fruit juice, or water. Make sure there is nutritional value in some of the liquids

Chicken soup is traditionally considered helpful. For the full benefit, use chicken stock, not ""chicken flavored soup"".
Allow your child to rest. Make him or her comfortable, and keep the room quiet enough to allow naps. If your child is awake, offer some calm activities he or she can do in bed, such as coloring or reading.
Monitor your child's temperature with a home thermometer. Young children have difficulties regulating body temperature, and may require intervention if the fever runs too high. If this happens, give mild fever reducers designed for children. This will help reduce fever and inflammation, and make your child more comfortable. Remember; do not give a child under the age of 19 aspirin or salicylate containing products as this may trigger Reye's Syndrome.

,,, If the child hasn't gotten vaccinated against either kind of flu yet, you'll have to decide whether to do so once he or she has recovered. If you're confident the child had the swine flu, it'll be unnecessary to get them vaccinated because their immune system will already have developed its defenses against the virus. If you're unsure what kind of virus your child had, however, check with a doctor about how to proceed. See also How to Get a Flu Shot


You should get vaccinated, too, if you didn't get sick. If you missed work to take care of the child, and you lucked out and didn't catch a virus, then the last thing you want to do is catch one from someone else and end up having to stay home again.

If you are a Reiki master, always offer to train your listener in a beginning class, such as Reiki 1.,
Finally, be prepared to be surprised.",How to Be a Spokesperson for Reiki," You just never know when you might need them- whether it be conferences on holistic health, career training classes for alternative medicine, or wellness networking events, someone is going to ask you what you do.;
, Nothing says “I’m not sure”, like when you stumble on your own description of what you do or how you say it. It’s Reiki pronounced “Raki” but NOT spelled Reike.

, The client is the one who is doing the healing, you don’t possess magical powers. If you think you do, go back to Reiki 101. Reiki healing is not about you, it’s greater than you.

, If you are a counselor, then it is appropriate to announce that you are a mental health professional and offer counseling in your energy healing. So don’t feel you need to do more if you are not a counselor. Don’t claim to be one. You will violate ethics and possibly do a disservice to your clients.

, Some are interested in the practical applications of Reiki, or on Reiki instruction. Others are more curious about Reiki symbols and meditation associated with practice. Tailor your presentation to what the client (or audience) is asking for. You will keep them engaged and interested to ask more questions about your work!

, I often use the line, ‘Reiki is like acupuncture without needles’. It’s a quick, visual statement that clarifies for the listener what your topic is about.

, There is no substitute for learning Reiki (out of book or online) than an in-person class.

, Your client or audience will often ask questions you weren’t expecting. One person asked if he should address me as ‘Sensei’ (the Japanese word for Master).

Even if you do not smoke in the presence of your children, the smoke that lingers in your clothes, hair, furniture, and car can still have a negative impact on their health; this is known as thirdhand smoke. Smoking can leave behind a residue which can also negatively impact the health of your children.Find resources to help you quit. Smoking is a challenging addiction to give up. Fortunately, there are many resources available, which can help guide you through the process.
Try following the START acronym: Set a quit date; Tell friends and family that you plan on quitting; Anticipate challenges; Remove tobacco from your car, work, and home; and Talk to you doctor about support.
Consider the benefits you will experience. In addition to protecting your children, you will also be improving your own health. Consider that, 20 minutes after your last cigarette, your heart rate and blood pressure decrease. One year after quitting, your risk of contracting coronary heart disease is cut in half. Ten years after quitting, the risk of dying from lung cancer is 50% lower than that of a continuing smoker.;
, Other adults who spend a lot of time around your children, and who also smoke pose a risk to them. Research suggests that having social support can play an important role in helping an individual to quit smoking, especially during the first few months after giving up cigarettes.Although quitting is a personal choice, you may also be able to persuade them to quit, if you feel they simply need a small push.


Calmly explain to them that you want them to quit because of the dangerous carcinogens they are exposing your children to.
Explain to them the personal benefits they may experience from quitting.
If they agree to give quitting a shot, offer as much emotional support as possible.

, It is your home, and you have the right to make the rules. If an adult visiting your home wishes to smoke, make it clear that smoking will only be allowed outdoors, away from the children. Even if children are not present, the residue left behind from smoking is still present and harmful., Some people believe that simply rolling down the windows is enough to protect others from secondhand smoke. This is wrong, and rolling down the windows may actually help to blow the smoke directly into the faces of those sitting in the back seat.Even if your kids are not in the car while someone smokes, the risk of thirdhand smoke exposure still exists.

, If you live in an apartment building with other tenants who smoke, you may be affected by secondhand smoke. Check your contract to see if there are any restrictions about smoking indoors.


If there is not, and a smoking neighbor is affecting you, try to resolve the issue by kindly discussing the matter with them.
If you are unable to resolve the issue with the smoker, try broaching the subject with your landlord. They might be willing to make your building a smoke-free building., It may not always be possible to do this, but it is important to limit their exposure as much as possible.


If you do not live in an area with laws banning smoking in restaurants, look for those that voluntarily ban smoking.
Avoid theaters, entertainment venues, and anywhere that smokers are likely to feel comfortable lighting up.
Be aware that even in places where smoking is banned indoors, many places still permit smoking on outdoor patios. Keep your children away from the tables of smokers or take them indoors.

, If you must be near the person smoking, kindly ask them if they could refrain while your children are present.


Explain to the smoker that you only wish to protect your children’s health. However, be aware that they may refuse.
Be understanding of their choice, if they refuse to stop smoking. This might be hard, but do your best.
Be prepared to remove your children from the smoking environment, if necessary.

, You may have friends and family who are not ready or are unwilling to quit. You should take the time to explain to them that you value their presence in your life and your children’s lives, but that you cannot allow them to smoke around your children, and that your children will not be allowed to be around them while they are smoking.


Help them understand how they are putting everyone around them at risk when they smoke, particularly children, who are still developing. Do your best to be firm, but also respectful.

, If your child wants to have a sleepover at a friend’s house, but you know that the parents are smokers (especially if they smoke indoors), do not allow them to go.


Suggest instead that your child’s friend comes to your home for a sleepover.

, There is a lot of information available about the effects of secondhand smoke, and how children might come in to contact with it. Before being able to truly protect your children from its negative effects, you need to understand the different ways they might be exposed to it.

, There is a lot of information available, a few examples of what you might find include:


No amount of secondhand smoke exposure constitutes a safe amount.Infants who are exposed to secondhand smoke are at greater risk of dying from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).Short-term effects of exposure to secondhand smoke on children include more frequent ear infections, more frequent coughs and colds (and longer recovery times), as well as tooth decay.Long-term effects include greater risk of lung cancer and heart disease, as well as poor lung development., While you are likely to find everything you need to know on the internet, if you want to read the scientific studies that discover how secondhand smoke effects children, try searching in scholarly databases.


Google Scholar offers a good way to search for scholarly literature. The advantage of reading these peer reviewed articles is that you are getting the information from the source, rather than an interpretation.

, Many states offer free hotlines where you can request information about tobacco use and support for those wishing to quit.

, It will not always be possible to protect your children from the habits of other people; therefore, it is important that they also understand why they should not smoke, and why they should try to avoid secondhand smoke.


If you are not sure how to best talk to your children about this topic, consider using alternative methods. Search for videos, which might help your children understand the dangers of smoking and secondhand smoke.

, Your behavior has a strong impact on your children. Telling your children that smoking is unhealthy, and that they should stay away from people who are smoking when you are a smoker yourself sends a confusing message to your child.

, Most schools offer an anti-tobacco program, but some may have a less well-developed program than others. Ask your child’s teacher what the school’s program involves, and whether or not they include education about secondhand smoke in their program.


If you are not satisfied with the current program, consider asking how you might be able to get involved in improving the program.

, Simply telling your child that smoking and secondhand smoke are bad does not help them understand exactly why they should not do it.


Explain to them the different ways that smoking and secondhand smoke can harm the body.
Use examples to back up your points. If you tell them that smoking is bad for their lungs, you might consider showing them a picture of a smoker’s lungs.
Be clear that while choosing not to smoke is the most important thing they can do, avoiding secondhand smoke is also important for avoiding negative health effects.
Point out, for example, that even secondhand smoke exposure can lead to lung cancer.,


Some evidence suggests that children feel pressure to do something simply because they think their peers are doing it too., Though it may be true that much of the pressure a child feels comes from their own minds, they may also, at some point, be pressured by someone else to try a cigarette or other tobacco product. Preparing them for this possibility will help them say “no.”

, Practice different scenarios with them.It can sometimes be hard to know how to get out of a situation in which you feel uncomfortable. Practicing different scenarios in advance may be helpful.


Possible ways to say “no” include:

Making a joke, and changing the subject.
Firmly saying, “No, I’m not interested.”
Suggesting other things they might do instead of smoking.
Leaving the situation without saying anything, if nothing else works.


Explain to your children that a true friend will respect their decision. If that “friend” continues to put pressure on them, ask them to consider if they have other friends with more similar interests.

, It can be difficult to know how to politely leave a situation you don't want to be in, especially as a young person. Discuss this with your children, and give them examples about how you might handle the situation yourself.

, Normally when you try to move any energy you use the energy that is already inside your body. If you do that for the first time in a long time you probably will not feel a lot of effects.

Check to see if you, a friend, or loved one, meet(s) the criteria for having selective mutism:


Consistent inability to speak in specific social situations (e.g.,
Recognize the extent to which selective mutism is affecting your daily functioning.,
If you can get others to help, try to overcome selective mutism gradually with the ""Stimulus Fading technique"": under a controlled environment (where help is readily available), interact with someone whom you can communicate with comfortably.,
If the technique above fails to work entirely, or cannot be carried out readily, try to overcome selective mutism using the ""Systematic Desensitization Technique"":
First imagine yourself in the situation wherein you cannot speak, then imagine speaking, then try to interact with persons in that scenario indirectly, e.g.,
Practice as necessary with all kinds of communications; become comfortable getting attention, raising your hand, nodding/shaking your head, pointing, writing, making some eye contact, etc.Introduce speaking a little at a time, and progressively speak a little more.,
Use ""Contingency Management,"" whereby you get a simple reward for speaking under anxiety-provoking situations.

,
Focus on positive thinking to help overcome the anxiety.,
Realize that butterflies (nervousness or even shaking) are common in certain situations; hence, you should start with smaller groups.,
For severe selective mutism, the above techniques may not work adequately to overcome the disability.",How to Overcome Selective Mutism," at school) where speaking is expected.
Ability to talk and normally interact in other circumstances.
The inability to speak under certain situation is having a negative impact on social and academic functions.
The symptoms last for longer than one month, excluding the first month of school (it takes time to adjust to a new environment).
The symptoms cannot be accounted for by unfamiliarity with the spoken language under the given social situation (i.e. a girl fluent in another language who knows very little English and remains quiet in situations where English is spoken does not have selective mutism!)
The symptoms cannot be accounted for by another disability, such as autism/Asperger syndrome, schizophrenia, or general psychotic disorders.
The inability to speak is not by choice, but rather by extreme anxiety preventing the individual from speaking.;
, To overcome selective mutism, you must first recognise how it is affecting you. Find out the specific circumstances in which you are unable to speak. For example, a child may speak normally with peers, but unable to talk to adults. Another child may talk and behave totally normal at home, but remains completely silent at school. By identifying the particular situation where selective mutism manifests, you can help direct your efforts to overcome selective mutism under these circumstances.

, Then gradually introduce another person to interact with to join the conversation. Start with the most comfortable person you can talk with and progress gradually to the most uncomfortable person for you to talk to. The idea of this technique is that the anxiety caused by the persons you feel uncomfortable interacting with will ""fade"" away when this stimulus is associated with another person you feel very comfortable interacting with.

, via letter, e-mail, instant message, online chat, etc.
Then progress to more interactions, such as by phone, then interact at a distance, and eventually to more direct interactions. This method is also highly effective for numerous other anxiety disorders, such as specific phobias. The idea of this method is to overcome the anxiety causing inability to speak by gradual exposure to increasing levels of the anxiety-provoking stimulus, eventually becoming desensitized enough to overcome the actual situation.

, Gradually increase the comfort level. Due to the extreme anxiety, it is crucial to get as much help and encouragement from others as possible.Try audio recordings of one's own voice, then replaying the speech to develop comfort with speaking -- this technique is known as Shaping. Practice whispering at a public place as in an office or classroom with a friend/parent or teacher, and practice gradually increasing the volume to a talking level.

,, Instead of thinking ""I can't talk..."" think ""I can try to talk and make it possible if I work at it! ""

, One may benefit from public speaking classes for learning to do presentations, and even for small venues such as job interviews. Entertainers and other public speakers get used to having that stress when speaking or singing for a large audience. Sometimes, however, even well-experienced entertainers turn to drugs to attempt to control these stressful feelings, to relax on stage. Later in one's career while being naturally relaxed, one may desire to feel the old excitement, when it is rarely felt at all. Often, at the head table or on stage one may look at each other to offer support and to get a smile or a nod of appreciation.
There is considerable stress related to new social situations as well as in the larger venues with crowds.

, In that case, you should seek professional help and may require the use of medications to cope with selective mutism. Common medications prescribed to help reduce anxiety to allow speaking and interaction include fluoxetine (Prozac) and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Use of medications should be combined with repeated practice of the above techniques and anxiety-reduction techniques for the greatest likelihood of overcoming selective mutism.

, Asking for personal recommendations will allow you to get an honest and trustworthy opinion of other teachers and healers. Ask any friends you have that see a healer or are enrolled in classes about their experience and for any advice they might have.


If you are currently seeking a Reiki healer for treatment, ask them if they offer classes or if they can recommend a teacher.
Try asking questions like “What has your experience been like with this teacher?” “Do you feel like you are increasing your understanding?” “Are you enjoying learning from this person?”

, Reiki is not often listed in the Yellow Pages, but the Yellow Pages does list many other healers who may also practice Reiki. Contacting other healers and asking if they teach Reiki, offer classes, or can provide other resources and information will put you on your way to finding a teacher.Look for other healing categories in the Yellow Pages, like massage, herbology, chiropractic care, traditional chinese medicine, or hypnotherapy., Ask your potential teacher how often they practice, if they continue to heal others, and how they see those they are healing (remote or in-person).

, A Reiki teacher will be your partner throughout your journey learning how to practice and heal others. Teachers who assist your lifestyle, by leaving your decisions and lifestyle choices up to you, will give you the space and time to become your own Reiki teacher.Assistance means giving encouragement and advice while providing informative and helpful resources.
Ask about the teacher's take on spirituality. Some Reiki Masters are interested in Reiki as a spiritual path while others are not.
Avoid teachers who demonstrate controlling or interfering behaviors, like demanding lifestyle changes, isolation, or ideological worldviews. Learning Reiki should be about self-exploration, not self-exploitation.

, Many teachers become teachers through the desire to heal themselves. Self-healing can also be a sign of experienced teachers. Remember that your teacher will be your partner throughout your time learning to be a healer. A teacher that has healed themselves can often provide insight the inter- and intra-personal exploration that takes place when learning to heal.Some teachers, particularly those who are inexperienced, who have healed themselves can be emotionally triggered while teaching. Be sure to look for teachers with years of experience.

, Some teachers have taught hundreds of students and yet those they've taught would never see fit to recommend them. Others have taught but a few, yet they are excellent teachers. Looking at your potential teacher’s experience will help you select a teacher with your desired qualifications.]


Ask you teacher questions, like “How long have you been teaching?” “Do you take students regularly?” or “How many students have you taught in your career?”
Get in touch with previous students that your potential teacher has taught. Ask them about their time with this particular teacher, if there are things to be wary of, what their experience was like, and if they would recommend them to others.

, Some teachers tend to rush their students to the next level even if they are not really ready, while others seemingly wait forever. Ask your potential teacher what their policy on advancements are, how long they might take, and how these policies might align with your goals as a future teacher.


Ask about the degrees your teacher offers. Do they only offer first-degree classes or is there an opportunity for advancement?
Ask your potential teacher to put you in touch with some of their old students for recommendations.

, Taking a healing session from your teacher will help you evaluate your own personal connection to their style, lineage, and practice. Continually check-in with yourself during and after healing to see how the experience feels.


Ask yourself questions, like “Does this healer and healing session invoke gratitude and love, or frustration and repulsion?”

Affirm their feelings.,
Ask them what they are worried about.,
Help them find the facts of their fears.,
Have them draw the monster and make it silly.,
Reassure them of their safety if they leave their bedroom.,
Help your child address and move past actual trauma.,
Get professional help in severe cases.",How to Help a Child Overcome a Fear of Monsters1," One of the most helpful points in helping your child move past their fear is acknowledging that the fear exists. Rather than saying things like “Don’t be scared” or “You shouldn’t worry,” you should acknowledge your child’s anxiety so that they feel heard.Say something like “I know that you are scared, honey. I’m going to help you, I promise.”;
, Don’t guess or make any assumptions about why your child is scared. Instead, seek to understand through actively listening to them. You might say something like “Tell me what’s bothering you the most.” It is only once you understand their fear that you can help them overcome it.Active listening involves more than simply asking your child what's bothering them. Sit down or kneel to get on their level, and make eye contact as they describe their fears. This lets them know you take their concerns seriously.

, Though you know that your child’s fears are unreasonable, to them they are very real. Help them break down the realities of the situation. After finding out their fears, ask them questions. For instance, if they are worried that a monster is hiding in their closet, ask them if they have ever seen one in there.If they are afraid of their dolls at night, ask them if they have ever seen one of their dolls move on their own. This will help jumpstart the process of delegitimizing their worries.
Very young children may not be as receptive to being told monsters are not real. You may need to help a young child feel ready to take on the threat of a monster. By age six or seven, though, you should be able to speak clearly with your child about fact versus fiction.

, Another way to help debunk their fears is to assign them a mini art project. Have them draw what they think their monster might look like. After they have done that, have them make the monster look silly by adding polka dots or ice skates or anything else that is funny to them. This will help assuage their fears by adding humor to the idea of the monster.Perhaps they could draw them slipping on a banana peel.
You may also have them write a silly story about their monster, or tell them a story that makes their monster seem like less of a threat.

, Sometimes, your child might feel so afraid at night that they will leave their beds to get in yours. Though it can be tempting to allow them to sleep with you, it is important that you reinforce that their room is a safe place and that they should be sleeping there. Walk them back to their bed and stay for a bit until they fall asleep.You might say something like “Honey, I know you are scared. But your room is a safe place and it is okay for you to sleep there. I won’t let anything get you. I’m going to stay with you for a little bit until you fall asleep, okay?”

, Perhaps your child’s fear of monsters stems from some very real traumatic life situation that has occurred. Maybe your home was broken into or they witnessed a violent act. Whatever the cause, help your child move past their issue through conversation and making changes to your home environment.You might begin the conversation by saying “Honey, I know you are still scared from seeing that fight yesterday. We can talk about it any time you want to. Do you want to talk about it now?”
You may also ask your child, ""What would help you feel less afraid?"" They may be able to direct you to a practical answer if asked outright.
If they are afraid because of a burglar, consider purchasing a home alarm system and explaining to them how it works and keeps bad people out. Lock your windows and doors. Get a guard dog.

, Sometimes, your child’s fear of monsters might be beyond the scope of just having a conversation or tweaking their nighttime routine. If your child is not sleeping at night, eating less, or if you observe any signs of depression, consider getting them professional help. Look up child therapists in your area."

Read a book that helps them overcome childhood fears.,
Schedule time hours before bed to discuss worries.,
Help them shift their nighttime thoughts.,
Give them a security object.,
Don’t allow them to watch any scary shows or movies.,
Occasionally stay in their bed until they fall asleep.,
Do periodic check-ins.",How to Help a Child Overcome a Fear of Monsters2," Read to your child nightly to help soothe them to sleep. Allow them to select a book of their choosing or consider purchasing books addressing fears of monsters. The movie Monsters, Inc. has also been helpful for some children to humanize monsters. A list of potentially helpful books include:The Monster at the End of this Book
Can’t You Sleep, Little Bear?
The Owl Who Was Afraid of the Dark
What a Bad Dream

, Do some fact checking about their monsters with them earlier in the day rather than later. Rather than always waiting until right before bed to address your child’s concerns, begin talking about them after school or dinner. This will ensure that their worries are being addressed early on, which will help make their transition to sleep easier and faster., Make a list with your child of different things they are looking forward to, or a list of their general interests. Have them cycle through this list every night so that they have things to think of rather than the monsters.This is a great way to shift their focus at night to something more positive and constructive.

, Many children find great comfort in having an item to hold while sleeping. Give your child a special blanket or stuffed animal that they can sleep with to alleviate their fears.Consider even giving them one of these items from your childhood. Otherwise, you could also go shopping to allow them to pick out one that is special to them.
You may even appoint a favorite stuffed animal or toy as a guardian or watcher to place somewhere special in the room where they will be able to watch over and protect your child.
You can also create a ""magic"" object that will help protect your child. A spray bottle filled with water could be their monster spray that they use every night before bed.

, Sometimes the monsters that children fear are the monsters they have seen on TV. Though you can’t change what they’ve already seen, you can control what they see hereafter. Don’t allow your child to watch anything scary or anything that is not G or PG rated.Consider placing parental controls on their televisions so that they cannot access this frightening material on their own.

, Though you should not make a habit of this, you can occasionally sleep with your child on nights that they are particularly scared. Don’t do this for two consecutive nights, however, or even on a weekly basis. You don’t want you child to be overly accustomed to your presence., If your child is very fearful at night, tell them that you will check on them every few minutes until they fall asleep. Consider checking in 5 minutes after they have been put to bed, then 10, then 25. This will help assure them that you are there and that nothing can get to them."

Change the lighting in the room.,
Eliminate any shadows.,
Move their bed to face the door.,
Consider a pet for companionship.",How to Help a Child Overcome a Fear of Monsters3," Though your child may want to keep the lights in their room blazing out of fear of the monsters, this will likely affect their quality of sleep and will not help them face their worries. Purchase some lower wattage lights so that they can keep lights on that will not be overly bright. You can also consider purchasing a night light or keeping a small lamp on by their bed.You may also want to work with your child to get comfortable in the dark. Walk through the lit room with them, then turn out the lights and go through the room again, having them touch things to identify them. This can help create some comfort.

, Your child’s fear may arise from the presence of shadows in their room. Eliminate as many shadows as you can. If their coat hanging on a hook makes a creepy shadow, hang it in the closet instead. If their toys are casting a shadow near their bed, place them in a bin instead.Take a look at the room from your child's level. Squat down and look at look at everything from about their height to get an idea of what may frighten them.

, One way to help assuage your child’s fears is to have their bed facing the door. If their bed is facing away from the door currently, they may worry that a monster could enter without them knowing. Having them face the door can alleviate that concern., Some children benefit immensely from having a pet with them in their room as they sleep, as it can serve as a constant companion for them in a way that you cannot. Choose one that does not sleep in the bed like a hamster or fish.Make sure the pet is not very noisy as well so that it doesn’t affect their sleep.
If you have a dog, cat, or other large pet, you can talk to your child about how the pet helps keep the monsters away at night. Let your child think your dog is a guard dog.

"
"
Comfort your child with encouraging words.,
Obtain a general description of the monster.,
Believe what your child tells you.,
Take your child out of the room with you; into the kitchen is probably best.,
Prepare a small snack for your child (such as an orange or banana).,
Take down the ""Monster Spray"" and explain that your mother/father always kept a bottle or can of ""Monster Spray"" in the house when you were little and had monsters in your room, too.,
Go into the ""scary place"" and squirt ""Monster Spray"" under the bed, in the floor area of the closet, and around the windows.,
Bring your child back into the room where you can perform a final inspection together.,
Encourage your child back into bed and remain with him/her for a few minutes.,
If you are a busy Mom/Dad with other children or are unable to do the story, song, etc.,
If all else fails then you can simply invest in a bed which doesn't have any space underneath, or cut the legs off the current bed.",How to Eliminate Monsters Under the Bed1,";
, Ask your child why he/she thinks there is a monster in the room. What is the monster doing? What does this monster look like? Is it a boy monster or a girl monster? This will help ease the fear as your child is describing it as a story.

, Of course, there's no monster in the room, but its presence is very real to your child.

, The kitchen is the most comforting room in your home.(Taking your child into bed with you is not a good solution. This can get to be a habit hard to break.)

, Instruct your child to enjoy the snack while you go into the bedroom and eliminate the ""monster"". (See ""Warnings"".)

, Let your child know that ""Monster Spray"" always works. (See ""Things you will need"").

, The room will have a fresh, comforting fragrance. (And monsters hate it!)

, Check all areas where monsters had been hiding.

, Maybe tell a quick story or sing the child's favorite song. If necessary, briefly lie down with your child until he/she is secure that all monsters, alligators and other scary things have vanished. (Or until he/she nods off to sleep.)

, Try putting on your child's favorite cartoon movie (as long as it's not a scary one, and it's age appropriate.) A happy cartoon will give them happy thoughts,(thus erasing the scary ones) helping them to relax and fall asleep. let them watch till they fall asleep.

, This essentially nips the problem in the bud.

Role play social situations with her.,
Become an active listeneractive listening.,
Help her practice social skill words.,
Model healthy social behavior when you are around her and others.",How to Help a Shy Child1," Make a game out of learning social skills by sitting down with your child for a few minutes every day and role-playing social situations. Take the role of someone new and instruct your child on how to greet someone. This means making eye contact, smiling, and shaking someone’s hand. You can encourage your spouse and any siblings to participate in the game as well. The more individuals your child practices with, the more comfortable she will get with social skills.You can also encourage your child to make small talk with you as part of the game. This means practicing saying “Hello” and “How are you?” as well as responses like “I’m great, thanks” or “I’m doing well, thank you”.;
, Be attentive to what your child is saying. One of the reasons shy children tend to withhold from conversing is fear of being embarrassed or laughed at. When your child is talking about something, give him/her your full attention. Refrain from judging them or laughing at them. They need to feel understood and accepted and to know that others care about them.Encourage your child to start the conversation by asking your child an open-ended question, such as, “What did you do at school today?” She may then tell you about her math test, her chemistry lab, and the special lunch for Heritage Day. Listen as she speaks to you, nodding and maintaining eye contact with her.
When she is done speaking, respond to her by saying, “What I hear you saying is...” and then summarize what she told you in your own words. Once you’re done speaking, ask her if you listened to her correctly. If she says yes, you can comment on her day and offer any advice.
Then, switch roles and tell your child about your day. Let her sum up what you said in her own words and agree that she listened correctly. This will allow her to model her behavior after yours and get a sense of how active listening works.

, Social skill words are terms that your child can use to enter social situations in a clear and straightforward way. Phrases like, “Can I play, too?” or “Mind if I join you?” allow your child to enter a conversation or a play date in a friendly way. Teach her to lean on these phrases so she can pull them out easily in real life situations.Other social skill terms like “Hello”, “Bye”, “Please”, and “Thank you”, are also useful terms for any social situations she may face.

, Be an example for your child. This means being friendly and open around new people, greeting them, and making eye contact with them.Doing this will limit the possibility of her developing “stranger danger”, where she has a fear of strangers. While you should teach her to be cautious around new people, you should also show her that you can have a conversation and engage with strangers just like you would anyone else.

"
"
Allow your child to observe the situation before she enters it.,
Practice a big speech or performance with her beforehand.,
Talk about big social gatherings and prepare for it together.,
Give your child a task or role when she is around a big group of people so that she doesn't feel clueless and left out.,
Encourage one-on-one play with other children.,
Let your child play with children who are younger.",How to Help a Shy Child2," Rather than shame your child for her shyness, you should take a supportive role. This means being aware of her social needs and responding to them in kind. Doing this will be much more efficient than trying to force her to socialize or be more outgoing.Keep an eye on your child when she is in a social situation, such as with other kids on the playground or around other adults at the dinner table, and note her body language. Is she avoiding eye contact and turning her body inward? Does she seem unengaged or distracted?
Respond to this by letting her take a minute to assess the situation. Be supportive by making eye contact with her or smiling at her encouragingly. Don’t rush her into socializing or participating in the conversation.
You can also pull her aside and talk to her one on one to ensure she feels comfortable. Or, you can take a more hands-off approach and allow her to listen to what is being said, rather than force her to respond.

, Many shy children become anxious and stressed when they have to present a big speech or do a performance in front of others. Help her cope with this by practicing her speech with her one-on-one beforehand. After she is comfortable with this, enlist the help of other family members, gather a small audience, and encourage her to perform in front of them. This is an excellent way to help your child overcome stage fear. Ask the family members beforehand not to laugh at her mistakes and to give encouraging nods through her speech. You may also try to integrate the speech or performance in your daily routine. For example, you can play the song she may be dancing to, on the drive to school or take some time before bed to practice critical sections of her speech. Doing this will help her become more comfortable with her upcoming presentation and reduce her feelings of shyness.

, Support your shy child by discussing any big social gatherings with family or friends a few days before they happen. This way, you can talk about who will be there and who she can talk to at the event. You can also put her at ease by preparing her for what to expect regarding the itinerary for the event or any special activities planned as part of the event.For example, if you are throwing a surprise party for her grandparents, you should sit her down and let her know there will fifty people in the house and mention few familiar names she may be comfortable around. You can also let her know there will be balloons, cake, and presents so she knows what to expect on the day of the party.

, Giving your child a task to focus on when she is around a big group can help her to steady her nerves and feel less pressure to socialize on her own.This could be collecting everyone’s coats at the door or showing everyone into the dining room. You could also encourage her to help set the table before dinner or organize the presents at a party. These types of tasks will help her stay focused and feel more comfortable around a big group.

, Most shy children do better one-on-one, especially when they are playing with other children. You could set up playdates with another child in her class that she gets along with and make them a weekly or bi-monthly occurrence so she can socialize on a consistent basis. You could also suggest that she join a club or a class with one close friend to expand her social group in a safe and comfortable way., Some shy children are less intimidated around children who are younger than them. Encourage your shy child to play with younger children in the neighbourhood or younger siblings at home."
"
Praise your child when you notice her social skills.,
Give her positive reinforcement in front of others.,
Encourage her to pursue hobbies or passions she is confident in and enjoys.",How to Help a Shy Child3," Building your child’s self-esteem will help your child to feel accepted and valued, which may help her become more comfortable around others. Make sure you praise your child when you notice she is practicing healthy social skills and interacting with others in a proactive way.For example, you may compliment her on her conversation with a family member at a big family dinner. You may say, “Aunt Jane was telling me how much she enjoyed talking with you.”

, Doing this will show her that she is capable and build up her self-esteem. This could be a simple comment like, “How nice of you to ask how Grandma is doing”, or an encouraging statement like, “Tell your Dad what you told me today.” Positive reinforcement will also let her know that you support her and are an ally for her., Get your child to focus on personal self-development and encourage her to take up swimming if she seems to enjoy the water or to take up painting if she seems to enjoy sketching and drawing. Finding something she is good at will make she feel less self-conscious and help to boost her confidence.If your child is struggling to identify a passion or hobby she might enjoy, you can help her by suggesting that she think about a skill she is good at or enjoys. This could be watching basketball games on television or baking at home. You may then suggest that she try to play basketball or take a baking class. Throw out suggestions and see if she responds to any of them.
You can also have a conversation with your child where you ask her what she likes doing the most or what skill she would like to learn. You may then be able to work together to find a hobby or passion she can pursue.

Initiate an on-going discussion about shots.,
Have a practice run.,
Choose the right time to let your child know about the shots.,
Watch a television show or read a book about doctor visits to the child.,
Monitor your mood.,
Choose a doctor who has a calming presence.,
Pick a time of day in which the child is relaxed or happy.,
Play soothing music on the way to the doctor’s office.,
Distract the child.,
Offer a reward for cooperation.,
Provide physical comfort before, during or after the shots.,
Avoid coddling the child.,
Provide positive feedback after the shots.",How to Help Children Cope With Shots," One good way to help children cope with shots is to talk to them, over a long period of time, about shots and the reason for them. While many people believe that children are irrational, this is not always the case. By demystifying shots, you’ll allow your child to cope with them in a very healthy way.


Explain the reason for shots. Say something like ""Shots will help keep you safe."" You can also say something like ""Shots will help keep you from getting really sick.""
Tell your child everyone has to get shots.
Allow your child to watch you get shots.
Detail the experience of getting shots.Let your child know that will hurt a little, but then it will be over.;
, Children can benefit immensely from having practice shots. Using practice shots will allow the child to go through much of the experience associated with shots without experiencing any pain.


Show the child an empty, needleless, syringe. Allow them to touch it.
Use an alcohol swab on their arm.
Show them what the doctor would do if this were the real deal.
Give the child some sort of reward or positive verbal affirmation., Make sure you pick the right time to let your child know about the shots. Picking the right moment will make sure that getting shots is a lot less of a traumatic process than if you picked the wrong moment.


Let the child know you’re visiting the doctor in advance.
Tell the child that they’ll be getting shots either in the car or in the waiting room.
Talk about the shots in a very nonchalant way, as if they are not a big deal.
Letting your child know about the shots too far in advance will only multiply their anxiety. This is because you’ll give them more time to think about and dwell on the shots they’ll be getting.
Don’t try to trick the child or hide the fact that they’re going to get some shots. Simply withhold the information until appropriate., One great way to prepare a child to deal with shots is to watch certain TV shows or videos or read certain books with them. Some TV shows and books designed for young children tackle the topic of shots in a way that helps prepare them for this life milestone. Consider:


Watching Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood or Sesame Street. These programs deal with a wide variety of milestones in the life of young children, including shots.
Reading Berenstain Bears. This book series deals with a number of children-related issues, including shots.
Other books specifically designed for helping children cope with medical treatment. Ask your local librarian for suggestions or check online for options and reviews., Children can pick up on their parents’ moods, so it is important to get into a calm state of mind before you take your child to the doctor for a shot. Being in a calm state may help your child to feel calm as well.


If you are feeling stressed, then try doing some deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or meditation before you take your child to the doctor for a shot.

, Your choice of a doctor or pediatrician is extremely important when it comes to dealing with a child and shots. Choosing a doctor who is calm, caring, and warm can help reduce the child's anxiety.


Ask friends and other parents about the doctor they use.
Read reviews online about the doctor’s bedside manner.
Let the doctor know if your child has a severe fear of needles. This will give the doctor an extra chance to put the child at ease., Choosing the right time to take your child to get their shots is also extremely important. If you pick a time full of tumult, you’ll undoubtedly increase your child’s anxiety. Instead, pick a time during which your child is happy or relaxed.


While it may be convenient, taking your child to the doctor immediately after school might heighten your child’s anxiety. This is especially true if your child knows about it early in the day.
Think about taking your child to get shots before something fun, like a birthday party or a visit to the movies. This way, your child may focus on the fun times to come.

, Another great way to help a child cope with shots is to play soothing music when you’re on the way to the doctor’s office. Soothing music will help relax the child.


Put on some of your child’s favorite music. Singalong music might work especially well, since it will engage your child and keep their mind off of the shots.
Avoid turning the volume up too high. Unless your child is actively engaged in the music, it should be relatively low., A great way to help a child cope with shots is to distract them during the process. Distraction is important, as you’ll be able to draw your child’s attention to something more pleasant.


Be humorous and distract your child. Tell funny jokes before you go in for the shots.
Read a book during the shots to keep your child distracted and looking away. Recall happy occasions with your child.
Show your child a favorite video on your phone or tablet.
Find something the child can do during shots, such as blowing bubbles, a pinwheel, or holding a favorite soft toy.
Some hospitals and doctors will pretend to give shots to a stuffed animal and then let children bandage their toy up afterward. This is not only fun for the child but also gives them a sense of control over the situation. It also distracts them as they comfort their toy rather than focusing on their own pain., While you don’t want to bribe or pay off the child, a promise of a reward for good behavior might help convince the child to cooperate. It might also change their spirits as they might see the shot as something to get through before receiving a reward.


Promise a visit to a favorite café, park or toy shop after the shots.
Give the child a small toy or stuffed animal after they get shots.
Some doctors will give children a sticker or small toy immediately after the shot., If your child is still beside themselves after other inducements, you should definitely provide physical comfort throughout the process. Physical comfort will make the child feel as if shots aren’t a punishment and that they’re getting shots because you want the best for them.


Let them sit in your lap, if they want.
Hold their hand.
Pat them on the back.
Hug them afterward., While providing physical comfort is important, you should also avoid coddling your child. Ultimately, having shots are an important part of growing up, and your child will have to go through many things in life they don’t like or they don’t enjoy.


Don’t ever cancel an appointment because your child doesn’t want their shots.
Don’t give into any demands associated with the shots. If you want to offer something, that’s okay.
Don’t console your child too much. Your child will pick up on your sympathy and react to it., After your child has been given their shots, you should offer positive feedback. By offering positive feedback, you’ll make your child feel better about getting shots in the future.


Tell your child how brave they are after the shots.
Let your child know that you were happy with how they acted.
Appeal to their sense of pride at having dealt so well with the situation and coped with the pain.

Try to look at it from your child's point of view.,
Let Them Know What Will Happen.,
Interact with the Caregiver a While Before Separation.,
Be Supportive and Calm.,
Don't Feed Into the Drama.,
If you are away for a longer period of time, keep in contact with them - call them while you are away and reassure them that you will be back soon.,
Leave them lots of activities to do during the day.,
When you get back, greet them with all the love and hugs and kisses you can muster!",How to Deal With Your Child's Separation Anxiety," At their age, around 3 to 4 years, they are still very self-aware - and you, the parent, are seen as their source of everything - food, warmth, love, affection, authority, reassurance, safety; they see you going as you going for good! Therefore it is imperative that you realise that this is genuinely stressful for them, even though to you, there should be no issue.

, Explain in direct language what will happen. Do this several times, if possible, and be sure to do it just before heading out or the arrival of the sitter.

Emphasize the fun things he or she will do.
Use positive language. Don't say, ""I will never leave you forever."" Say, ""I will be back soon.""

, It's important that your child sees you're OK with the person he or she is with. A few calm minutes getting your child interested in a toy, game, or activity can really help separation. Don't, however, drag this out.
, You must be supportive through this time and reiterate to them that you are always there for them. Be loving and calm and you shouldn't go far wrong.
, You may do everything right, but it's still hard for your angel to say good-bye. Be calm, firm, and loving. Do not prolong separation, even though your child may very well seem inconsolable, throw a temper tantrum, and beg plaintively to come with you. You may have to have the caregiver restrain your child (gently and lovingly of course).

It's natural to be concerned that your child is miserable. Call in 10-20 minutes to check in if you need to. Chances are, your child has come about and doing fine.

, Vary the topics - how their day was, what they did, funny anecdotes - this all helps to keep their mind away from the separation anxiety.
, Set up some paints, colouring books, a kids' DVD/TV programme, something fun to keep them occupied. Again, this will help distract them from the fact that you're not there.
, Praise them for being so good while you were away, and then spend some quality time with them. All these, with repetition, will help them understand that you are always there for them and will always return to them.

Provide comfort to your child that they are safe.,
Avoid increasing fears.,
Teach your child to face their fears.,
Use nightlights.,
Provide an object for companionship.,
Provide positive reinforcement.,
Teach your child to self-soothe.,

Make bedtime a relaxing experience.",How to Calm Your Child's Fears of the Dark," Ask your child what he or she thinks and feels when it's dark. Reassure your child that their worries are normal, and will be less as they grow. Be respectful. Avoid saying that their fears are silly. This may make them feel guilty or ashamed, and it’s important that you show support.
Communicating about fears will help your child learn to be open with you. This builds trust over time.
Consider saying, ""I know it feels scary right now, and that's normal, but it will get better"" or ""Tell me what makes you feel afraid. How can I help?"";
, Feeling afraid of the dark is a primal, evolutionary fear. Sleeping alone in separate bedrooms is a modern way of life. This practice will take time for your child to understand. Be loving, comforting, and supportive. Reassure them they are safe with you.Be a role model and show confidence that they are safe. Be calm and sensitive to your child's needs.
Avoid the desire to overprotect them. If you show anxiety about their safety, then they may respond by being more anxious.
Consider saying, ""No need to worry. You are safe here at home.""

, If your child is fearful of monsters under the bed or elsewhere in the home, don't reinforce these fears by playing along. Children have imaginative fears that they may believe is real to them. Young children under the age of 5 have difficulty in distinguishing fantasy from reality. Don't inadvertently reinforce fears by scaring your child with scary stories of ""things that go bump in the night.""
Use reason and logic to help your child learn about their fears.

, It is important to teach your child how to face their fears and addressing a fear of the dark is a good opportunity. You can do this by modeling how to face your fears and comforting your child during the process of confronting a fear.


For example, if your child fears that there is something under the bed, then go check it out together. Turn on the lights and have your child hold their favorite stuffed animal or your hand for comfort. Then, look under the bed for your child. Name what you see under the bed, such as some dust, a box of clothes, an old toy, and no monsters.
Keep in mind that you may have to repeat this process over and over as your child learns how to face their fears and becomes more self-assured.

, Get a nightlight for your child's bedroom. Nightlights give just enough light, helping your child feel more relaxed.Nightlights can also be placed in the hallways and bathrooms to help ease fears if walking outside of the room in the dark.
If a nightlight isn't available or disrupts your child's sleep, leave the hall light on and the child's bedroom door open. This allows a little light to still enter. It may make your child feel less isolated with the door ajar.

, Your child may feel more secure with something to ease his or her fears. Consider finding a special object for your child's security as they learn to sleep on their own. Consider these:


A large stuffed animal. This can provide comfort to soothe fears or anxiety.
A special blanket or other object to provide security. This may make your child feel more protected.
A pet, such as a dog or cat, that your child enjoys sleeping with.

, Use tools to help them learn that bedtime can be a rewarding experience. For small children, it could be a sticker program that leads to small prizes. It helps to teach you child that they will be rewarded for good behavior. Teach them about how to be brave like you with encouragement.After the lights are out, consider saying something like, “You’re doing such a good job of staying in bed.”
Listen to your child if their fears continue to persist despite these techniques. Talk with them in the morning about their experiences.

, You cannot be there all night to provide positive reinforcement and reassurance to your child. Therefore, it is a good idea to teach your child how to do this for themselves.


Try teaching your child to speak reassuring phrases to themselves, such as, “I am safe, I am brave, and I'm going to be ok.""
You can also teach your child to do something like rubbing their feet or hands together as a tactile soothing method or humming a comfort tune to feel safer as they fall asleep.
Your child can also repeat out loud what they found under the bed, such as by saying, ""I looked under the bed and I know there is only some dust and an old toy under there.""

, Exposing small children to frightening things that may seem tame to you should be avoided in the evenings. This can include passive exposure, while you or an older child watch scary movies or TV.Think about how your child may not be able to verbalize fears about the evening news, movies with violence, or TV shows with monsters.
Make sure that your young children are away from the TV at least 1-2 hours before bedtime. Frightening TV, stories, or imagery can disrupt sleep patterns.

, After turning out the lights, stay with them until their eyes adjust to the dark. Sit and talk with them casually in the dark. Show them that being in the dark can be fun and relaxing.


Have fun playing in the dark. Make it seem like doing things in the dark is natural.
Make up a game of flashlight tag. Use flashlights to help identify things in the room that you see. Identify things in the room that comfort your children and make them feel happy.
Create a starry sky on the bedroom ceiling. Put glow-in-the-dark stars on the walls and ceiling. Your children will feel like they're explorers in the outdoors, sleeping under the stars.

, Make your child's bedroom feel homey and reassuring. Place cheerful pictures up of people and places. Make this a time to wind down with a bedtime story or a warm bath before bed. Sit quietly with your child to help them transition to sleeping.Help your child get ready for bed with a bath.
Sing a quiet song or lullaby.
Read books that help both to teach and act as sleeping aids.
Hug and kiss your child. Make them feel loved.

Try mindfulness.,
Examine your past.,
Play fill-in-the-blank.",How to Deal with Fear of the Unknown1," One way to become aware of the cause of your fear is to be more aware of yourself in general. Being present in the moment and aware of your emotions and thoughts can help you identify what exactly you’re afraid of. It can also help you recognize what strategies help you overcome your fear. Meditation and yoga classes can train your mindfulness for everyday life.


Be fully present in the moment by focusing your senses and your mind on what you are doing. For example, if you’re eating, pay attention to how the food smells, looks, tastes, and feels in your mouth.
Pay attention to how certain situations and the thought of certain situations make you feel. For instance, you might think, “When I thought about speaking at the meeting, I got nauseous.” Keep a journal to track these thoughts and discoveries.;
, Fear of the unknown often has an underlying cause you may not be aware of. Figuring out what exactly you’re afraid of about unknown situations and why you’re afraid can help you overcome the fear.It is often easier to get insight into other people than about ourselves, so consider talking to a trusted friend or a therapist who can help you identify patterns or connections. In the meantime, you can start with some self-reflection:


Think about the last time you feared the unknown or about something you’re afraid of know. For example, you may fear living on your own after a divorce.
Write down what this situation meant or will mean for you. For example, living alone will mean being independent, spending more time alone, and being responsible for everything.
Highlight those things that make you anxious about the situation. For instance, you may be okay with being independent and responsible for everything, but being alone may scare you.
Ask yourself why those specific things scare you. Did something happen in your past to make you uneasy about similar situations? How did you (or the affected person) handle the situation?

, This game is one way to figure out what you’re afraid of. It can be useful when you’re having trouble articulating what you fear. By completing the sentence “I am afraid of ___ because ____” you can force yourself to figure out what exactly you’re afraid of and why.


For example, you may fear traveling because of the uncertainty you feel it has. You could say, “I’m afraid of traveling because someone might break in while I’m gone.”
Or, for instance, you may be afraid of dating. You might say to yourself, “I’m afraid of asking someone out because they might reject me.”

"
"
Organize and prepare.,
Educate yourself.,
Use your support system.",How to Deal with Fear of the Unknown2," Being organized will make it easier for you to be prepared, and being prepared will make it easier for you to handle your fear of the unknown.Knowing where you’re supposed to be, when you’re supposed to be there, what materials you’ll need, and where those materials are will help a lot. It will eliminate a lot of your fear because you’ll have control over some of the factors that may worry you.


For example, you may be a great basketball player and want to join a team, but may be anxious because you don’t know how it will go. Get organized and find out when tryouts are and what you skills you’ll have to demonstrate. Then prepare by practicing.
Or, for instance, if you’re afraid of asking your crush out, you might prepare by finding out more about them and giving yourself a pep talk.

, It’s said that “knowledge is power” and when dealing with fear of the unknown this can be true. The more you know about a situation, the better you can prepare yourself for it and address any fears about it.Find out everything you can about the situation so that you can get organized and prepared to address it.


Ask questions. For example, ask your mom for more information about her new partner. The more you know about the person, the more prepared you’ll be to include them in your life (or not).
Get online or go to the library and find out what you can. For example, you might do an online search about traveling abroad to help you deal with your fear of what might happen overseas.

, Your friends and family can help you address your fear of the unknown in a lot of ways. They can help you get organized and prepared, answer questions or help you find information, and encourage you. Let the people close to you know about your fear so that they can help you deal with it.


For instance, you might tell your best friend, “I’m afraid of going to the dance. I don’t know what might happen. Can you help me deal with this because I do want to go.”
Or, for example, you might ask your dad, “Would you help me with driving. I want to get my license but I’m afraid of all the different things that could happen. Can you answer some questions for me?”

Prepare to face your fear.,
Start small.,
Use humor.,
Consult a professional.",How to Deal with Fear of the Unknown3," Facing your fear can help you realize that the situation isn’t as bad as you imagined, and it builds your confidence when you show yourself that you can handle it.Before you jump into the deep end of the pool, however, you need to learn to swim:


Practice relaxation techniques to help you through frightening situations. Don't force yourself too far out of your comfort zone until you have practiced these techniques many times.
Ask a friend to accompany you to scary situations and prompt you to use your relaxation techniques when you start to get nervous.

, You don’t have to try to tackle all of your fears and even fears that distress you the most.Instead, try challenging your fear a little at a time. Starting small can help build confidence in yourself as you overcome each new challenge. It can also help you learn what strategies work to help you deal with your fear. This way you can use those strategies and confidence when you face larger fears. A therapist who specializes in ""systematic desensitization"" can structure this process for you.For instance, if you fear moving to a new town, it may also make you afraid of even searching for homes. Instead of tackling your big fear of moving, challenge your smaller fear of home searching.
Or, for example, you may fear handling the next grade because you don’t know how you’ll make friends and do the work. Focus on challenging your smaller fear of doing the work.

, One way to deal with your fear of the unknown is to lighten up in general. Taking a more relaxed perspective on life and what it may bring can help reduce stress related to specific situations. Try doing things that put a smile on your face and a laugh in your throat.


Spend time with people that make you happy. For instance, take your younger siblings to park.
Take a couple of minutes to browse a funny website you enjoy or check out the latest memes on social media.
Subscribe to a joke of the day app or site or download a humorous e-book.
When you start worrying about the unknown, imagine the funniest, most-outlandish outcome possible. For example, if you’re afraid of switching schools, imagine that on your first day everyone has on clown shoes.

, In some cases, fear of the unknown can cause panic attacks or even develop into a phobia or anxiety disorder. If your fear is causing you significant impairment in your life, you may want to consider speaking with a mental health professional. They can provide you with strategies to help you cope, treatment options, and address any deeper issues you may be having.


For example, if you’re fear of what might happen is keeping you from leaving your home, you may want to contact a therapist or counselor.
Talk to someone you trust like a parent, your physician, school counselor, or human resources representative for information about therapists in your area.

They're much more severe than a headache you'd get from dehydration or even a migraine. A persistent, severe headache is commonly felt by people with meningitis.


A meningitis headache won't ease up after taking over the counter pain pills.
If a severe headache is felt without the presence of other common meningitis symptoms, the cause of the headache may be another illness. If the headache persists for more than a day or so, see a doctor.;
, Migraines often lead to vomiting and nausea, so these symptoms don't automatically point to meningitis. However, it's important to pay close attention to other symptoms if you or the person you're concerned about is feeling sick enough to vomit., A high fever, along with these other symptoms, could indicate that the problem is meningitis, rather than the flu or strep throat. Take the temperature of the person who is sick to determine whether a high fever is on the list of symptoms.


The fever related to meningitis is generally around 101 degrees, and any fever over 103 Fahrenheit is cause for concern., This is a very common symptom among those who have meningitis. The stiffness and soreness is caused by pressure from the inflamed meninges. If you or someone you know has a sore neck that doesn't seem to be related to other common causes of soreness and stiffness, like pulling a muscle or getting whiplash, meningitis might be the culprit.


If this symptom arises, have the person lie flat on his back and ask him to bend or flex his hips. When they do this, it should cause pain in the neck. This is a sign of meningitis., Since the membranes around the brain become inflamed with meningitis, cognitive difficulties commonly occur among meningitis patients. The inability to finish reading an article, focus on a conversation, or complete a task, paired with a severe headache, could be a warning sign.He may not act himself and be overall more drowsy and lethargic than usual.
In rare cases, this can make the person anywhere from barely rousable to comatose., Photophobia is an intense pain caused by light. Eye pain and eye sensitivity are associated with meningitis in adults. If you or someone you know has trouble going outside or being in a room with bright lights, see your doctor.


This may manifest by a general sensitivity or fear of bright lights at first. Watch for this behavior if other symptoms occur as well., Seizures are uncontrollable muscle movements, often violent in nature, which usually cause loss of bladder control and general disorientation. The person who underwent a seizure likely may not know what year it is, where they are, or how old they are right after the seizure is over.


If the person has epilepsy or a history of seizures, they may not be a symptom of meningitis.
If you encounter someone having a seizure, call 911. Roll them on their side and move any objects that he may hit themselves on away from the area. Most seizures stop on their own within one to two minutes., Certain types of meningitis, such as meningococcal meningitis, cause a rash to occur. The rash is reddish or purple and blotchy, and may be a sign of blood poisoning. If you see a rash, you can determine whether it was caused by meningitis by conducting the glass test:Press a glass against the rash. Use a clear glass so you can see the skin through it.
If the skin under the glass does not turn white, this indicates that blood poisoning may have occurred. Go to the hospital immediately.
Not all types of meningitis have a rash. The absence of a rash should not be taken as a sign that a person does not have meningitis.

, The diagnosis of meningitis in children, especially infants, is a diagnostic challenge, even to experienced pediatricians. Since so many benign and self-limited viral syndromes present similarly, with fever and a crying child, it can be hard to distinguish meningitis symptoms in small children and infants. This leads many hospital protocols and individual clinicians to have a very high suspicion for meningitis, especially for those children 3 months and younger who have only received one set in their series of vaccines.With good vaccination compliance, the number of cases of bacterial meningitis have decreased. Viral meningitis still presents but presentation is mild and self-limited, with minimal care needed.

, Infants, like adults and children, develop a high fever with meningitis. Check your baby's temperature to determine if a fever is present. Whether or not meningitis is the cause, you should take your baby to the doctor if he or she has a fever., This can be caused by many illnesses and other issues, but if your baby seems especially upset and won't be calmed by changing, feeding, and other measures you usually take, you should call the doctor. In combination with other symptoms, constant crying may be a sign of meningitis.Crying caused by meningitis usually can't be comforted. Look for differences in the baby's normal crying patterns.
Some parents report that babies become even more upset when they are picked up if meningitis is the issue.
Meningitis may cause babies to produce a cry that is higher-pitched than normal., A sluggish, sleepy, irritable baby who is usually active may have meningitis. Look for noticeable behavioral differences that point to lower consciousness and an inability to fully wake up., Babies with meningitis have a reduced ability to make the sucking motion during feeding. If your baby is having trouble sucking, call the doctor immediately., If the baby seems to have trouble moving his or her head, and his or her body looks unusually rigid and stiff, this could be a sign of meningitis.


The child may also feel pain around their neck and back. It may be simple stiffness at first, but if the child seems in pain when moved, it may be more severe. Watch to see if she automatically brings her feet up to her chest when you bend their neck forward or is she has pain when her legs are bent.
She may also be unable to straighten her lower legs if her hips are at a 90 degree angle. This presents in infants most often when their diapers are changed and you cannot pull their legs out., Viral meningitis is usually self limited and goes away on its own. There are a few specific viruses such as the herpes simplex virus (HSV) and HIV that require specific goal directed therapy with antiviral drugs. Viral meningitis is spread person to person contact. A groups of viruses called enterovirus is the primary source and occur most typically in the late summer to early fall.


Despite it being possible to be spread by person to person contact, outbreaks of viral meningitis are rare., There are three kinds of bacteria that cause bacterial meningitis, which is the most worrisome and lethal. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common form to strike infants, young children, and adults in the US. There is a vaccine for this bacteria, however, so it is curable. It is spread most commonly from a sinus or ear infection and should be suspected when a person with a prior sinus or ear infection develops symptoms of meningitis.


Certain people are at higher risk, such as those who do not have spleens and those who are older. Vaccination for these individuals is protocol. , Another bacteria that causes bacterial meningitis is Neisseria meningitidis. This is a highly contagious form that afflicts otherwise healthy adolescents and young adults. It is spread person to person and outbreaks occur in schools or dorms. It is particularly lethal, leading to multi-organ failure, brain damage, and death if not rapidly identified and started on intravenous antibiotics.


It also has the distinction of causing a “petechial” rash, meaning a rash that looks like lots of tiny bruises, and this is an important distinction to note.
Vaccination is recommended for all adolescents 11 to 12 years of age, with a booster at age 16. If no prior vaccine was given and the patient is 16, only one vaccination is required., The third bacteria that causes bacterial meningitis is Haemophilus influenza. This used to be a very common cause of bacterial meningitis in infants and children. However, since a Hib vaccination protocol has been introduced, rates have dropped dramatically. With the combination of immigrants from other countries that don’t follow routine vaccination or even parents who do not believe in vaccination, not all are protected against this form.


Obtaining an accurate vaccination history, preferably from the actual medical record or yellow vaccine card, is critical when this, or any, form of meningitis is considered., Fungal meningitis is rare and seen almost exclusively in those with AIDS or others with weakened immune systems. It is one of the AIDS defining diagnoses, occurring when the person has very little immunity, is exceedingly fragile, and is at risk for most any infection. The typical culprit is Cryptococcus.


The optimal prevention in an HIV infected individual is compliance with antiretroviral therapy to keep viral loads low and T cells high to protect from this type of infection., It is recommended that the following groups with high risk of contracting meningitis have routine vaccinations:

All children ages 11-18
U.S. military recruits
Anyone who has a damaged spleen or whose spleen has been removed
College freshmen living in dormitories
Microbiologists exposed to meningococcal bacteria
Anyone who has terminal complement component deficiency (an immune system disorder)
Anyone traveling to countries which have an outbreak of meningococcal disease
Those who might have been exposed to meningitis during an outbreak"

Talk with your child about why they’re afraid.,
Take your child’s fears seriously.,
Set small goals and adjust them as your child progresses.,
Use personal flotation devices.,
Show your child that water can be fun.",How to Ease a Child's Fear of the Water1," Understanding your child’s fear is essential for helping them work through it. Ask your child what in particular scares them about the water. Are they afraid of sinking? Does it make them uneasy to watch bathwater go down the drain?Many children develop a fear of the water after having a bad experience, such as accidentally getting water up their nose.
Once you know where your child’s fear is coming from, you can find ways to help them cope with the particular situation that scares them. You might say, ""Sweetie, I noticed that you get really jumpy during bath-time. What bothers you about taking a bath?""
Your child's first response may be: ""I don't know."" A young child especially might not yet be able to make the connection as to why they are suddenly afraid. Allow them some time to think about it or, if you think you know the reason, it's okay ask them if you're right. You might say, ""Is it because you saw your friend fall in the pool this weekend?"";
, Kids need empathy and support when they’re scared of something. Listen to your child and make them feel understood. Avoid brushing off their fears or telling them that they shouldn’t be afraid.For instance, if your daughter is afraid of getting her face wet, reassure her by saying something like, “It seems like this is scary for you. Putting your face in the water feels funny, doesn’t it?”
When you validate your child’s feelings, it reassures them that they can trust you.

, Build your child’s confidence by setting a small goal that they can achieve easily. As they get more used to the water, set new goals that stretch their comfort zone a little bit further.Make sure you are cheering them on each step of the way.


If your child is afraid to take a bath, you may be able to begin with showers and then progress to taking a bath.
Or if your child is scared to get into the pool, have them practice sitting on the edge with their legs in the water. After they’re comfortable doing that, have them climb down steps or a ladder to practice submerging themselves more.
Let your child decide how quickly (or slowly) to make progress. Avoid making your child do anything they aren’t ready to do — this could make their fear worse.
Remind your child that you are right there if they need you, and that you have confidence in their abilities.

, Water wings and other swimming aids can be a good way to help a fearful child get used to the water. Use them to give your child a confidence boost until they’re ready to get into the pool on their own.Avoid relying on flotation devices for too long. For safety reasons, it’s important for young children to learn to swim without them. Get in the water with your child and practice without the flotation device, then give it back. Alternating in this way can help build their confidence.

, Your kids pick up on your attitudes and behaviors. If you show them that you enjoy being in the water, they’ll want to imitate you. Go swimming with your child or let them see you get into the bathtub, and emphasize how much you like the water.If you dislike the water yourself, find another role model, such as a family member or swimming teacher, to help your kids feel positive about the water.
Consider inviting one or two of their friends to join, which can help them view swimming as a fun activity.

Note how long the symptoms have been present.,
Observe the level of fatigue.,
Be aware of the physical symptoms.,
Look for additional symptoms.",How to Recognize Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Symptoms1," Be aware of severe, debilitating fatigue that is not improved by rest. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that CFS can be defined as persistent fatigue that lasts longer than 6 months., Fatigue is a normal response to physical and emotional activity.Feeling tired after exercising or after spending a long day at work is to be expected. Those with CFS often report extreme exhaustion 24 hours after mental or physical exertion.CFS can also cause fatigue even when you have not exerted yourself. If fatigue interferes with your work or social life, alters your motivation, interferes with your responsibilities, and is not helped by rest, you may have severe fatigue., CFS can cause a variety of physical symptoms, and it is important to take note of how long they have been present, particularly if they have been persistent for more than 6 months. Let your doctor know if you experience these common CFS symptoms.


Sore throat
Enlarged lymph nodes in your neck or armpits
Muscle pain
Headaches
Joint pain that moves from one joint to another without redness or inflammation, While reported less frequently, individuals with CFS have noted symptoms other than the more common physical symptoms.If you experience any additional pain, discomfort, or mental health issues, let your doctor know.


Some patients with CFS feel dizzy, faint, have balance problems, and have difficulty sitting upright.
Others report developing new allergies or sensitivities to foods, odors, and medications.
Notice any gastrointestinal or digestive changes, such as irritable bowel syndrome or diarrhea.
Patients with CFS have reported trouble with concentration and memory.
Report any visual changes such as eye pain, blurred vision, or light sensitivity.
If you experience any mood swings, symptoms of depression, or have panic attacks, talk to you doctor right away."

Make bath-time a special occasion.,
Talk about swimming in a positive light.,
Find some fun water toys.,
Reward your child for facing their fears.,
Give your child lots of praise for their efforts.",How to Ease a Child's Fear of the Water2," If your child gets freaked out by taking a bath, it can help to create a ceremony or ritual around the task to help ease your child's concern and make bath-time more enjoyable.


For instance, add bubbles, colored salts, or bath glitter to make the water fun and less intimidating. Use special soap or shampoo in your child's favorite color or scent.
Doctor also advise giving smaller children massage-like baths involving gentle kneading as you wash to promote relaxation and increase the bond between you and your child.
In addition, create a ritualistic event surrounding bath-time. Beforehand, you might enjoy a nighttime snack. Then, afterwards, you might read a bedtime story. Sandwich the undesirable activity in between two enjoyable ones so that your child comes to expect it as part of the daily ritual., Tell your child about how much fun they’ll have after they learn to swim. Point out that their older siblings or other children they look up to enjoy swimming, too.For instance, say something like, “If you learn how to swim now, you’ll be able to play with your cousins at the lake this summer. Won’t that be fun?”

, Toys can lure even the most reluctant kids into the pool or the bathtub. Consider getting a variety of toys that your child can play with as their swimming skills progress.Floating toys like boats and balls are good choices for beginners, while colorful rings that sink to the bottom of the pool can help kids learn to swim underwater.

, Sometimes a little outside incentive can motivate a reluctant child to do something they don’t like. Make bath time or a swimming lesson more appealing by promising your child a treat after they’re done.A sticker, a favorite snack, or some time doing a fun activity are a few good rewards you could offer.

, Nervous kids need a lot of reassurance, and praise is one of the best ways to help them feel more confident. Provide plenty of encouragement when your child tries something new or faces one of their water-related fears.Praise your child’s efforts instead of their ability. Say something like, “I’m really proud of you for putting your face in the water so bravely today!”
Remind them that it's normal and okay to have fears. This is a great opportunity to teach your child to face fears with courage and intention.

Look for a class that takes a relaxed approach.,
Make sure your child is comfortable.,
Use tricks to help your child adjust.,
Give your child time to practice.",How to Ease a Child's Fear of the Water3," If your child is afraid of the water, it’s especially important to find a class in which they can build a sense of trust with the teacher. Avoid intense or fast-paced lessons and look for an instructor who’s willing to work with your child at their own pace.Consider hiring a private swimming instructor to work with your child as they overcome their fear of the water.

, Take factors like class size and pool temperature into account. Large classes may not be a good fit for a child who already feels uncomfortable around the water. Similarly, if the pool is always cold, your child may feel even less inclined to climb in.Consider how your presence may affect your child. Is it reassuring for you to be where they can see you during their swim lesson? Or do they seem distracted by your presence? You may even ask your child, ""Would you like me to stay for your swim lesson?""

, Usually, with time, as children start to become more familiar with the pool environment, there anxiety will lessen. While you wait for them to naturally get used to the water, you can try a few strategies to ""trick"" them into relaxing.


For kids who don't much like getting water on their face, you can try playing a game of pretend shampoo. First, pat water on your cheeks and laugh excitedly. Then, rub some in their hair and pretend to lather it. Tell them to copy you like a game.
If your child is fearful of deep water, you can reduce the stress involved by letting them wear a life jacket. You might even don one yourself so that they don't feel alone. Take baby steps, letting them spend some time in the deep end before returning to the shallow end to play. Spend more time in the deep as your child becomes more comfortable.Practice breathing with your child. Taking shallow breaths or holding their breath may increase anxiety. Take some deep breaths with your child to help them stay calm and relaxed.

, The more often your child spends time in the water, the less afraid they’ll feel. Take your child to open swim sessions and get into the pool with them. Have them practice the skills they’ve learned in their swimming lessons."

List your symptoms.,
Tell your doctor of any recent life changes.,
Have a blood test.,
Take a friend or relative.",How to Recognize Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Symptoms2," Having documentation of your symptoms and their frequency is extremely helpful for your physician. Sharing this information can help your doctor understand your situation and work toward a diagnosis and treatment plan.Even if you think something may not be important, write it down. Any and all information can be useful for making a diagnosis of any kind.


If you have been experiencing blurry vision, for example, track how frequently it happens, how long the symptoms last, if you felt any pain, and what you were doing right before the blurriness occurred.
If you experience muscle aches, note how often the pain occurs, if the pain prevents you from doing your usual activities, or if any particular physical exertion causes the pain to worsen.

, If you have undergone major life changes or have experienced high levels of stress, share this information with your doctor.Life events and stress can influence your overall health.


Being stressed about your job security, going through a divorce, and losing a loved one are all examples of difficult, life-changing situations. Be sure to tell your physician if you have experienced these or any major stressful situations.

, There is no single test that can determine if you have CFS, but your doctor will most likely recommend a blood test to help rule out any other illnesses.A blood test can check for a number of things, including hormone levels, thyroid and liver function, glucose levels, cortisol, and your overall blood count.A trained professional will draw blood from your arm, which should only take a few minutes. Your doctor will receive the results of the tests within a few weeks and will review them with you., It is easy to feel overwhelmed when visiting your physician, particularly if you are receiving a lot of new and potentially stressful information. Take a relative or friend to your appointment. He or she can help you remember the information your doctor shares, and he or she can help you ask necessary questions during the appointment."

Discuss medication options.,
Talk to a therapist.,
Visit a physical therapist.,
Discuss alternative therapies.",How to Recognize Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Symptoms3," Your doctor will adapt your treatment based upon your symptoms, so treatment can vary from patient to patient. You may be prescribed an antidepressant, such as Elavil or Wellbutrin, or sleeping pill, like Ambien, to help alleviate your symptoms. These can help you cope with feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression and help you get more restful sleep., Cognitive behavior therapy and self-management methods have been shown to help patients with CFS. Cognitive behavior therapy is a common type of psychotherapy that is used to treat a wide variety of issues. Your doctor may recommend these options for you to cope with your symptoms.Over several, structured sessions, a therapist can help you cope with your symptoms and help you learn how to properly respond to the emotions and stress CFS can cause.Self-management programs are typically run by healthcare professionals. These programs highlight the importance of patient education and understanding to treat an illness. These tools can be useful when dealing with a chronic illness like CFS., Your doctor may recommend physical therapy as a treatment option for you. A physical therapist may have you do graded aerobic exercise, such as walking, stair-climbing, and cycling, which may help alleviate CFS symptoms. Daily, incremental activity under the supervision of a physical therapist may help improve your endurance and strength over time., Although alternative therapies have not been verified by medical professionals, it has been noted that yoga, tai chi, or acupuncture can help reduce CFS symptoms. Always talk to your doctor about these alternate methods."

Refrain from substance abuse.,
Prevent strokes and heart disease.,
Wear a helmet.,
Drive safely.,
Improve home safety.,
Remember that sometimes there is nothing you can do.",How to Prevent Epilepsy1," Expectant mothers can help prevent their children from developing epilepsy by receiving professional prenatal care. Talk to a doctor about supplements and an appropriate diet. Quit smoking, and refrain from drinking alcohol during gestation or while breast feeding., Brain infections are one of the more common causes for the development of epilepsy among children.Proper vaccination can often prevent the contraction of diseases that cause epilepsy., Globally, cysticercosis is the most common cause of epilepsy.This infection is passed along in the eggs of intestinal tapeworms. To prevent the contraction of tapeworms, pork should be cooked thoroughly. To prevent consumption of the eggs, a person who might have intestinal tapeworms should thoroughly wash hands before touching food.This is a much less common cause of epilepsy in developed nations.

, Lead poisoning can often produce seizures and can negatively affect a child's psychological development. Everyone should take precautions to prevent contact with lead-based products.Be particularly careful to protect young children from lead-based paint.


Most houses built before 1978 will contain some lead-based paint. If your house was constructed before then, contact your local health department about testing the paint. Keep your children away from peeling paint. Wash children’s toys and hands frequently. Mop floors and wipe windows regularly to prevent exposure to lead dust., Substance abuse, particularly alcoholism, is a major cause of epilepsy. More than 5,000 people per year suffer from alcohol induced seizures. These incidents are associated with severe abuse and addiction., The elderly are particularly susceptible to strokes that can cause the onset of epilepsy.Your risk of strokes, however, can be managed with healthier living habits, especially dietary changes.


To keep your cholesterol low, eat more fruits and vegetables. Limit how much salt you consume. Restrict your consumption of saturated fats and trans fats. Major sources of saturated fats include cheese, pizza, dairy desserts, milk, meat, butter, and chips.Adults should get at least two and half hours of moderately intense exercise, like biking or jogging, per week.Stop smoking and limit how much alcohol you drink. Men should have no more than two alcoholic drinks per day, women one.Have a doctor check your cholesterol regularly and take any medication she prescribes for high blood pressure., Head injuries are a major cause of epilepsy. Always wear a helmet during high risk activities like riding a bike, motorcycle, snowmobile, or ATV, playing contact sports, skating, and horseback riding., To prevent head injuries you should also avoid accidents by following road safety rules, driving sober, and staying off your phone while driving. Wear a seatbelt and put your child in a safety seat., You should also remove factors from the house likely to cause head injuries. Use nonslip mats in the bathtub and bathroom floors. Install grab bars in the shower or tub. Make sure you have handrails on stairways. Provide adequate lighting throughout the home. Install window guards to prevent children from falling out of open windows. Use safety gates at the top and bottom of stairs when small children are in the home., Many children are born with a brain structure that causes seizures. About one third of autistic people naturally have seizures. Some medical triggers for epilepsy, like brain tumors, cannot be prevented. In the majority of cases, there is not even an observable cause for the condition. Simply put, there is often nothing you can do to prevent epilepsy.Those with close relatives who are epileptic, including parents and siblings, are more likely to suffer from the condition."

Visit a doctor for medication.,
Take your medications as directed.,
Visit a doctor for vagus nerve stimulation.,
Begin the ketogenic diet.,
Brace yourself for oncoming seizures.,
Maintain a healthy lifestyle.",How to Prevent Epilepsy2," About 47% of epileptics will eliminate seizures after being prescribed an anti-epileptic drug. After some experimentation to determine which drug works best for the person, that number rises to 70%. In short, medical intervention is generally effective, over time, at eliminating seizures., Antiepileptic drug (AED) is usually prescribed once the type of seizure disorder has been established. Patients who have had just a single seizure are usually monitored but are not treated with AEDs. In children, use of AED is not always automatic either. The decision to start AED drug is complex and is influenced by the frequency and type of seizures. Treatment decision should always be make by a pediatric neurologist. Children are rarely treated for a first-time seizure.

, If medicine does not work, vagus nerve stimulation can reduce the frequency of seizures by as much as 50% after two years of treatment.In this procedure a pulse generator is surgically implanted in the chest so as to send signals to the brain. You will be given a device to temporarily turn off signals when exercising or doing a public performance., Doctors may prescribe the ketogenic diet to children who are not responding to medication. In this diet, you will severely limit the number of carbohydrates you consume. Instead you will derive your energy from consuming large amounts of fat. While the procedure has been shown to be effective, the diet would be hard for an adult to maintain., It is common to feel annoyed or elated for hours prior to a major seizure. With experience you might be able to recognize an “aura” before the onset of a seizure. When you feel the symptoms, sit down so that you do not hurt yourself by falling. In some cases, you can stop the seizure by responding to your symptoms.


If you inexplicably detect a strong odor or taste, this may be a sign of an oncoming seizure. These seizures can sometimes be fought off by sniffing a strong odor, like garlic.
The sudden onset of depression, irritability, or headache can also be the sign of an impending seizure. In this case, contact your doctor immediately and ask if you can take an extra dose of medication to stave off the seizure.
Uncontrollable twitching is a strong indication of an impending seizure. When this happens, squeeze the muscles around the twitching to try to contain it. This will sometimes prevent the seizure., Certain lifestyle changes are important to either eliminating seizures or minimizing their effects. You should refrain from alcohol and other recreational substances. Maintain a regular sleep schedule. Consume Vitamin D and exercise to minimize the risk of bone fracture during seizures. Decrease and manage stress.


In some cases you might also want to wear a protective helmet to prevent head injuries.You can try to limit stress, often a precipitating factor for seizures, by employing yoga or meditation. Minimize factors in your life that cause stress.
Flashing lights can cause seizures. Limit exposure to video games, big screen action flicks, and holiday lights."

Take your medication as directed.,
Arrange for help with your medication.,
Visit your doctor during flare-ups.,
Use medication to help symptoms.",How to Manage Multiple Sclerosis As You Age1," As you age, it is important to follow your treatment plan for your MS. As soon as you are diagnosed, you will likely be put on drugs to help manage your MS. Taking your medication as directed can help keep symptoms, flare ups, and the progression of the disease at a minimum.If you need reminders, place notes around your house. Some medications need to be taken every day, some every other day, and others every few weeks. Set an alarm clock that will go off to remind you to take your medicine, or if you have a smart phone, set a reminder in your calendar.
You can also use a pill box or a smartphone app to help you remember to take your pills. Reminders like these can help you get in the habit of taking them at the same time every day.
If you need help with how to take your medication, ask your doctor or pharmacist for instructions. Keep these instructions around your house in spots that are easily located. The instructions can tell you how to administer the medication, how much to give yourself, and how often to take it.;
, Some MS medications are given via self-injection. This may cause problems as you get older if you have vision problems, arthritis, or increased MS motor symptoms. If you get to the point where you can’t give yourself the injection, discuss with your doctor alternate ways to receive the medication.Talk to your doctor about whether or not there are different medications you can take. There are some MS drugs that are taken orally or that a caregiver can help you with.
Ask a trusted family member or friend to help give you your injections.
Depending upon your insurance, a home health nurse may also be able to come to your home and help you with the injections.

, Despite your best efforts, you may end up with a flare at some point. If this occurs, you should go see your doctor. Even if the flare is minor, you should consider going to the doctor.

Recognize the three main symptoms of Parkinson’s.,
Identify additional symptoms.,
Go to the doctor to get checked.,
Discuss medication with your doctor.,
Ask your doctor about deep brain stimulation.,
Avoid ineffective alternative medicines.",How to Manage Parkinson's Disease1," Symptoms usually develop gradually over years — it is a progressive disease, so signs and symptoms will worsen over time and new symptoms may arise. The symptoms frequently start on one side of the body.


The three main symptoms of Parkinson's are:Tremors. People often have uncontrollable shaking that starts in their fingers or hands. It usually appears when the hand is relaxed.
Moving slowly. People with Parkinson's may move slowly without realizing it. This is also called bradykinesia. They may also shuffle.
Muscle stiffness. Stiff muscles may make it hard to move and be painful.;
, Additional symptoms may actually be due to other problems or conditions, but can be made worse by Parkinson's. People with Parkinson's may develop symptoms out of order, experience differing levels of severity, and are unlikely to experience all or even most of these symptoms. Other symptoms include:Postural problems. Many people adopt a stooped posture.
Not making normal unconscious movements. This can include blinking, making facial expressions, or swinging your arms when you walk.
Speech problems. Parkinson’s patients often have a quiet, whispery voice, speak in monotones, or slur their words.
Difficulty writing
Nerve pain. Some people have sensations of burning, coldness, or numbness.
Anosmia. People may have a reduced ability to smell.
Frequent urination or difficulty controlling the need to urinate
Inability to have or keep an erection in men or difficulty becoming aroused, or having an orgasm for women
Constipation
Sweating
Drooling
Difficulty swallowing
Dizziness
Psychological changes including depression, anxiety, insomnia, dementia, personality changes, visual hallucinations, or delusions.

, Your doctor will examine you, watch you move, and ask about your medical history and family’s medical history. There are several things the doctor may do:Observe whether you have a normal range of facial expressions
Look for tremors
Ask you to get out of a chair
Blood tests or imaging tests such as an MRI, SPECT, or PET scan to rule out other conditions such as a stroke or hydrocephalus
Prescribe levodopa medication and observe whether your symptoms improve
Refer you to a movement specialist

, Depending on your symptoms, medical history, and how much the disease has progressed, your physician may prescribe you a variety of medications. Commonly prescribed medications include:Levodopa. This medication is generally very effective, particularly in the early stages. It is converted to dopamine in the brain. Side effects may include nausea and dizziness. As the disease progresses, this medication may become less effective. This is taken as a pill or a liquid. It may be combined with carbidopa or benserazide. The dosage may need to be increased over time.

Dopamine agonists. These medications act like dopamine in the brain. They are less effective than medications which are converted to dopamine, but they may be effective longer. These can be taken in different forms including as a patch (Neupro) or an injectable medication (Apokyn). Side effects can include hallucinations, tiredness, compulsive eating, gambling, and hypersexuality.

MAO-B inhibitors. These medications prevent your body from breaking down dopamine. Common ones include selegiline (Eldepryl, Zelapar) and rasagiline (Azilect). They can cause interactions when taken with antidepressants, carbidopa-levodopa, or other MAO-B inhibitors. Side effects include nausea, abdominal discomfort, and headaches.

Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors. The medication that is most often prescribed is entacapone (Comtan). It prevents the body from breaking down dopamine and is used to make levodopa more effective. Side effects can include involuntary movements or diarrhea.

Anticholinergics. These medications can control tremors, but they can cause intolerable side effects such as memory problems, confusion, hallucinations, constipation, and difficulty urinating. A common one is benztropine (Cogentin).

Amantadine. This medication can help with early Parkinson’s or to reduce involuntary movements that may occur due to carbidopa-levodopa. Side effects can include purple blotches on the skin, swelling in the ankles, and hallucinations.

, During this procedure, electrodes are put into your brain. These electrodes receive electrical signals from a device put into your chest. This can provide long-term benefits, but it won’t prevent the disease from continuing. You would still likely need medications.The electrodes are inserted using an MRI and neurophysiological mapping. You then receive a controller that allows you to turn the device on and off. The battery in the device needs to be changed after three to five years, but this can be done with local anesthesia.
Deep brain stimulation can improve an erratic response to levodopa medications, reduce involuntary movements, lessen rigidity, and help a tremor.
Infections, strokes, and brain hemorrhages are potential side effects.

, Several alternative medicines and natural supplements have been studied, but they have not been found to be effective. If you are considering these, or any other herbal remedy, over-the-counter medication, or supplement, discuss it with your doctor before taking it. Some may interact with other medications. In addition, the dosages in supplements are not regulated like in medications. The following substances have not been found to be effective treatments:Coenzyme Q10. This medication was not more effective than a placebo.

Vitamin E. Vitamin E has not been shown to slow the progression of Parkinson’s.

Creatine. This substance is currently being studied.

Get vaccinated.",How to Manage Parkinson's Disease3," People with Parkinson's may be able to reduce problems eating, lessen constipation, and manage their weight through dietary changes.Consult a nutritionist and occupational therapist if you have difficulty swallowing. They may suggest taking smaller mouthfuls; thickening drinks; avoiding hard, dry or crumbly foods; doing exercises to strengthen your lips and tongue; and adjusting your posture.Alleviate constipation through eating high-fiber foods like whole-grain breads, brown rice, whole wheat pasta, seeds, nuts, fruits, and vegetables. Pair this with drinking plenty of water. Try to get at least eight to 10 glasses per day. If you still have constipation, ask your doctor or nutritionist about adding a fiber supplement to your diet. Avoid bran because it can make it harder to absorb vitamins and minerals.
If you find that you are losing weight, talk to your nutritionist about using weight gain supplements to maintain calories, even if you eat less or eat fewer meals.
Avoid weight gain due to inactivity. Sometimes people struggle with weight gain when they have more difficulty exercising. If this is the case, maintain your calories while you explore new and different types of safe exercise such as Tai Chi or music therapy, which can both improve flexibility and strengthen muscles in patients with Parkinson's.

, Maintaining a strong social network will help you deal with the emotional struggles of living with Parkinson’s. Many people experience shock, fear, denial, sadness, and anger. Social support can make you feel less alone, reduce stress, improve your mood, and help you learn techniques for managing the condition.Attend a support group. Support groups are excellent places to talk to people who will understand what you are going through and to learn about the resources available to you. You may be able to either attend an in-person group or an online group. Search online at the Parkinson’s Disease Foundation website, www.pdf.org, call the information services 1-800-457-6676, or email info@pdf.org.

Learn some of the primary vascular disorders.,
Learn a few of the most common infections.,
Study the primary structural disorders.,
Learn the functional disorders of the nervous system.,
Study the degenerative disorders.",How to Learn the Main Disorders of the Nervous System," Vascular disorders are one of the most common types of nervous system disorders, characterized by issues with the blood vessels throughout the body. Vascular disorders are often genetic, but can also be caused by being overweight, having high cholesterol, going for long periods sitting, and chronic smoking.A stroke is caused when the brain does not get enough blood as a result of a blood vessel being cut off or losing its connection to the brain as the result of a blocked artery. It is treated most often with blood-thinning medications by a doctor.Subarachnoid hemorrhages are when there is blood or fluid that leaks into the space between the brain and the membrane that covers it (the subarachnoid space). This could happen from a blow to the head or a strong fall. Treatments may include a drainage tube to the brain, surgery, or special medications.Subdural hematomas are when the veins that cover the brain are stretched too thin and torn, causing bleeding on the brain. These are most common in the elderly, but can be caused by repeated head injuries, alcoholism, and frequent use of blood thinners. Treatment involves surgery and medication.;
, Infections are yet another category of nervous system disorders, and are caused by dangerous bacteria and viruses entering the body, and in the case of the nervous system, surrounding the brain. Bacterial infections are treatable, while viral infections currently have no known treatments.


Meningitis occurs when the membrane around the brain and spine becomes infected and inflamed, and can be recognized by searing headaches and a locked neck. Bacterial meningitis is treated with antibiotics and cortisone, while viral meningitis can only be treated with bed rest and pain medications.Encephalitis is a viral infection of the brain, which causes it to swell up. It has symptoms similar to meningitis, including intense head pain, locked neck, seizures, and vomiting. Treatment includes corticosteroids and pain relieving medication.Epidural abscess is an infection of the area between the bones of the spine and skull and the membrane covering the brain. It is most often caused by a variant of the staph infection, but can be caused by other bacteria that spread through the blood. This infection is treated with surgery and medication., Structural disorders are a variant of nervous system disorders characterized by changes or damages to the structure of the body (bones, nerves, muscles, etc.). These disorders can be either genetic or the result of damage later in life. Therefore, treatment varies significantly between each disorder.


Bell’s palsy is a structural disorder known by a sudden paralysis or loss of muscle control on only one side of the face. Doctors aren’t quite sure what causes its onset, but it can be recognized by loss of muscle control/feeling, inability to taste things, drooling, eye problems, and sound sensitivity. There is no treatment for Bell’s palsy; it will go away on its own after 1-2 months.Carpal tunnel disorder occurs when the nerve that runs down the arm is pinched in the wrist, and when not genetic, is typically from long-term repetitive movements. Carpal tunnel is treated with many different options from physical therapy, medication, and surgery depending on the severity of the disorder.Peripheral neuropathy is a disorder characterized by loss of feeling and numbness in the hands and feet of the body as the result of nerve damage. It is most often caused by diabetes, but can also be the result of alcoholism, certain infections, and tumors that affect the nerves. The disorder often goes away on its own, but is treated with pain-relieving medications and nerve stimulation therapies.Cervical spondylosis is a type of bone spur/growth that develops on the cervical spine, which presses down on the nerve roots. Severe arthritis, obesity, and lack of exercise can all cause this disorder. Physical therapy and certain prescription drugs are used to treat this disorder., Functional disorders are those relating to the nervous system, but for which no physiological cause can be found. These disorders typically arise in the brain, and treatment is very different for each.


Epilepsy is a disorder characterized by chronic seizures as the result of disturbed nerve cell activity inside the brain. In order to be diagnosed with epilepsy, you must experience at least two unprovoked seizures. Epilepsy is treated primarily with anti-seizure medication.
Neuralgia is nerve damage along the entire length of the nerve, causing regular touch along the nerve path to be felt as severe pain. The cause of this disorder is not yet known by doctors, but it is treated with medication, physical therapy, and nerve blocks.Dizziness is one of the most common functional disorders, and is known by a feeling of lightheadedness and vertigo. The causes of dizziness vary significantly from case to case, and therefore each has its own specific treatment., Degenerative disorders are nervous system disorders that start slowly and get increasingly worse over time. Degenerative disorders often have no cure, and can be the cause of death over an extended period of time.


Parkinson’s disease is marked by loss of muscle control causing shaking, stiffness, and slowness of movement. Parkinson’s is primarily genetic, but certain rare environmental factors may be at fault as well. There is no cure, but there are multiple medications which can help slow its progression.Multiple sclerosis is a joint immune/nervous system disorder, in which your body’s own immune system attacks and eats the covering of your nerves. The symptoms vary depending on the severity, and can include numbness, tremors, loss of vision, halting movements, and slurred speech. There is no cure for the illness, and is treated with medication to control pain and to slow its progression.Alzheimers is a disorder which causes permanent damage to the brain, and loss of memory and basic functioning skills. The cause for Alzheimer's isn’t clear, but it seems to be at least partially genetic. There is no cure for the illness, but there are currently four medications being used to help stop the profession of the illness."

Recognize a slipped or herniated spinal disc.,
Know about spinal stenosis.,
Understand other causes of sciatica.",How to Identify Sciatica1," A herniated or slipped disc is the most common cause of sciatica.


The spinal column is made of multiple vertebrae, enfolding or containing nerves as a sort of protection.
Between each vertebrae there is a disc made of a fibrous jelly material that ensures the support of the vertebrae and fixes them in place.
If the outer part of the jelly ruptures, gel leaks out and escapes between the upper and lower vertebrae, and the disc slips.
This puts pressure on the nerves contained within the spinal column, and if it happens at the lumbar area of the lower back, it can press on the sciatic nerve's roots and cause sciatica.
This usually happens as a result of trauma, wrong movement, heavy lifting, or aging.;
, Spinal stenosis describes the narrowing of the spinal lumen, the are through which the spinal cord runs.


Especially if spinal stenosis occurs at the lumbar region, it can lead to irritation of the nerve.
This is often seen when there are changes or damage to ligaments of the spine, brought about by diseases such as Paget’s disease or old age, which can damage spinal structure.

, There are several other causes of sciatica that can be equally as painful. These include:


Infection, injury, or tumor formation at the lumbar part of the spine, which exerts pressure on the nerves.
Piriformis syndrome can cause sciatica, by pressing and irritating the nerve running through the piriformis muscle, a muscle located near the buttocks.
Pregnancy can cause sciatica, because of increased pressure on the sciatic nerve due to the additional weight of the fetus.

"
"
Keep an eye out for lower back pain.,
Notice any new muscle weakness.,
Seek immediate medical attention if you experience the following symptoms.",How to Identify Sciatica2," If you feel pain in your lower back that radiates along the path of sciatic nerve (through the buttocks, thigh, and lower leg), you may be suffering from sciatica.


Sciatica pain is often described as sharp, burning, needlelike, or tingling.
In some cases, sciatica can be more localized around the buttocks, with radiation in the thigh, but no pain at the lower back.
The specific pain pattern will differ from person to person, and is mainly tied to the underlying cause of the sciatica.
Pain is usually present in one leg, but can affect both in some cases.

, Muscle weakness can occur during sciatica, due to the irritation and inflammation of the nerve.


Pain and muscle weakness can be so severe that it can affect your lifestyle and daily activities.
The pain could be triggered by walking, bending forward or backward, and prolonged sitting or standing.
In some cases, pain can get worse even with coughing, sneezing or hard laughing, although it usually recedes after.

, If your symptoms become especially acute, it is necessary to seek medical attention to prevent complications from developing. These signs include:


Progressive weakness or numbness in your lower leg or thigh
Inability to control your bladder or bowel movement

"
"
Visit your doctor to receive a comprehensive medical assessment.,
Receive a physical examination from your doctor.,
Get a straight leg raise test done to identify sciatica.,
Undergo additional diagnostic testings.",How to Identify Sciatica3," Your doctor will have you describe all your symptoms.


He or she will then analyze them, and use your medical profile, lifestyle, and family history to form a diagnosis.
They will ask specific questions about what kind of jobs/sport you participate in, or any other activities that may irritate your sciatica.
Your doctor might also ask if you have any problems controlling your bladder or bowel movements, if you have experienced excessive numbness or weakness in your leg or thigh, or if you suffer from frequent urinary tract infections.

, In addition to the background diagnostics, your doctor will use a physical examination to identify pain locations and to determine the main causes of your sciatica.


This will primarily focus on whether the sciatica originates from the spine or not.

, This test can determine if you are suffering from a case of sciatica.


You will lay down on a bed, on your back with both legs straight.
You will be asked to raise the affected leg at a 45 degree angle, while keeping it straight.
Then, the doctor will test the reflexes of your foot.
If your feel any pain at your lower back or thigh, you are probably suffering from sciatica.

, Your doctor may use other tests to determine your condition. These tests include:


Blood tests to determine whether or not you are suffering from infection
X-ray or CT scans that can pick up any spinal deformities or herniated discs
MRIs to gain a more detailed picture of the condition of your nerves and bones

Get regular exercise.,
Practice deep breathing.,
Relieve stress.,
Stop smoking.",How to Manage MS Breathing Complications1," Regular exercise can have multiple benefits for your breathing. This is especially true if you have mild to moderate MS. Exercise can build strength and tone muscles.Regular exercise also helps maintain a healthy weight, which can also relieve respiratory issues.Talk with your health care provider before starting any exercise program. Your doctor can inform if you are healthy enough to exercise. Medical professionals can also suggest the best types of exerciseyou’re your health.Aim for approximately 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week if you are able.
Try exercises that are especially good for individuals with MS. These include: walking, stretching, swimming, low-impact aerobics, stationary bicycling, yoga and tai chi.Build upper body strength. Another exercise you may want to consider is strength training. Building the muscles in your chest and back can help you breathe more easily. It may also prevent complications.Meet and work with a certified physical trainer or physical therapist. This person can help you develop a strength training program with weights and/ or resistance bands to give your respiratory system maximum benefits.;
, Fully inflating your lungs can build muscle strength and tone. Spend time every day practicing deep breathing exercises, which can relieve and manage any respiratory complications you may have.Sit up as straight as you are able in a comfortable chair. Inhale for a long and slow breath that completely inflates your lungs. This may cause your belly to expand. Count as you inhale so that you can evenly exhale and track your breathing progress. Exhale completely before taking another breath. Gradually build up your breathing exercises. For example, you may breathe in and then out for 2 counts each for the first few weeks. Once you’re comfortable, move up to 3 counts.
Perform 30 repetitions of each inhale and exhale cycle twice daily.This can help you gain the most benefits from your deep breathing exercises.
Speak with your doctor or a specialist if you are unsure of how to fully inflate your lungs.

, Exposure to stress can trigger or worsen breathing complications from MS. Limiting the stress in your life can relieve and manage your complications. You can do this by avoiding stressful situations, practicing deep breathing exercises, and meditating.Taking a few minutes to meditate by sitting in a comfortable place, closing your eyes, and breathing naturally. Let your thoughts come and go as they will.Yoga and tai chi can also be a form of meditation and exercise that relax you.
Get a massage, which can dissolve any tension making breathing symptoms worse.
Recognize that deep breathing exercises that can improve respiratory function also promote relaxation and dissolve stress.

, Smoking places a burden on your lungs. Continuing to smoke with MS may make breathing complications worse. Quit smoking to better manage any MS-related respiratory issues you have.Speak to your doctor if you are having a hard time kicking the habit. The doctor may have suggestions or treatments to help you stop smoking as quickly possible.

Grab a pen and paper.,
Consider why you listen to music.,
Find out how many hours you listen to music each day.,
Set a target.,
Get rid of your earphones.,
Turn off the radio.,
Leave your MP3 player at home.,
Get out more.,
Remember the health benefits.,
Look at your bank statements over the past six months.,
Write down all of the music you have purchased using cash in the past six months.,
Write down all of the music you have pirated in the last six months.,
Total all of your purchases up.,
Avoid impulse purchases.,
Remove your credit/debit card from your music account.,
Reward yourself.",How to Overcome a Music Addiction," If you're serious about controlling your behavior, you will need to spend time thinking about and writing down the reasons you engage in this behavior.This way, if you find it hard to quit, you can read the paper and remember why you started trying in the first place. Sometimes, writing stuff down can also get the words you want to say out of your system without anybody criticizing you.;
, What is it about music that draws you in so much that you find it hard to live without it? Maybe you find it hard to make friends or communicate, or maybe your music speaks the words you want to hear but can't bring yourself to say. Whatever the reason is, you need to become aware of the reasons you choose to engage in this behavior.Write the reason down on your paper. It could also be more than one reason––scribble them all down too.

, Becoming aware of your habit is extremely important in getting over it.Spend one day tracking your listening habits. Do this by making a note of when you start listening to music and when you stopped (e.g. started at 7:45 am and stopped at 10:30 am). Before you go to bed at night, add up the total number of hours.


In order to change, you will need to set goals about changing your behavior. It will be easier to set concrete goals if you know exactly how much time you spend listening to music.
During the day you track your listening time, listen to music as you normally would.
You can be even more accurate by tracking your listening habits over a few days. This may provide you with a more accurate picture.

, There is ample evidence that controlling your behavior is an exercise, which means that you will get better through practice.Therefore, set an objective goal, and try to reduce the time you listened to music by a few minutes each day until you reach your target. Make this goal realistic. If you listen to music for twelve hours each day, a good target would be to listen to music for ten hours each day.


Once you finally reach your target, set a new one.
If your target is too hard, feel free to set an easier one. Don't make this too hard on yourself either. In the end, you should be listening to music for three hours maximum.

, Waking up everyday and seeing your iPod and earphones is only going to tempt you. If you feel bad about throwing your earphones away or if they cost a lot of money, sell them or ask a friend to hold onto them for you. That way, you won't be able to get them without having to dig them out.


Remember to try and reduce your music time by half an hour each day (or each week if that is too hard).

, If you or your parents drive, the car radio will probably be on, but do your best not to turn it on. If you're not driving, kindly ask your parents to keep the radio off and explain that you're trying to spend less time absorbed in music.


If all else fails, noise-cancelling earplugs are a nice alternative.

, Normally, you would probably bring your iPod or other music device when you go out. Don't tempt yourself! Instead, leave it at home. If you're using a phone that plays music, and you want it with you, leave your earphones at home.


Resist the urge to buy new ones. You can do this by bringing less money and reminding yourself that you can't get what you really want to get if you waste your money on earphones.

, Try to avoid situations where you are most likely to listen to music (e.g. when you are at home). It is good if you can replace your old problem with something new and productive.Buy a bike, make some friends or just go for a nice walk.


Whatever you do, make it fun. If you're on a bike, you will need to focus on the road so you can't use earphones. If you're with friends, you will be chatting and laughing so you can't use earphones. If you're taking a walk, the nature will keep your mind off of music.

, If you really feel like giving up, remember all the good that no or minimal music will do for you. Read your list of reasons you want to listen to less music to help re-motivate yourself.For example, paying closer attention to the road while driving or riding a bike instead of focusing on music could save your life.

, If you typically download your music from online stores such as iTunes, the Google Play Store, or Amazon, you will have a credit or debit card statement documenting exactly how much money you have spent. Go through your recent credit or bank statements to see how much money you have spent on purchases.

, You may not always purchase your music with a debit or credit card. For example, if you purchase CDs or vinyl records in a shop, you may be paying in cash. If this is the case, write down the albums you have purchased with cash over the past months.


If you have the receipt or remember the price, write down how much you paid. If you didn’t, search online for the going rate for that album to get a general idea of how much you spent.

, Hopefully you have not engaged in this, but if you have, you will need to include this in your final count. Write down each song or album you have purchased or type it into an excel sheet.


Search for the album or song in the iTunes store or in the Google Play store to find out how much you would have spent had you purchased the music legally. Write this down too.
Be aware that if you are downloading music illegally, you are committing a crime. If you get caught doing so, you could face heavy fines of up to $250,000 and even jail time., Add up the number of songs you have purchased over the last six months, and how much this has cost you. Are you spending more on music than you are on basic life necessities, such as food? Are you going into debt because of your music purchases? By completing these steps, you will be able to get a good, objective way of examining your habits.

, If most of your music is purchased without really thinking about it and the consequences of doing so, there are a few things you can do to become more aware the next time you go to buy a new song or album.


Take a few seconds or minutes to regroup before you head to the cash register. Take a few deep breaths, walk around a bit. You want to get your mind off of the song you want and back to thinking about your goals.Think about whether the purchase will be in alignment with your goals. Try to be as honest with yourself as possible. Does that new song help get you closer to your goal of spending less money on music or does it take you farther away from that goal?Evaluate your stress level. Become aware of any stress you are experiencing, whether it is related to the purchase or something else. You may be more likely to make an impulse purchase if you are stressed, so take a second to think about this, too., Don’t store your information, and if you already have it stored, remove it. Companies usually make it possible to purchase the music with a single click, which makes it too easy to do. If you want to restrict your spending, change your settings so that you have to type in your credit card information each time you make a purchase.


This will also give you a bit of time to evaluate whether this is a “want” purchase or a “need” purchase., If you are able to walk away from that impulse purchase, reward yourself with something else you want. Buy yourself a fancy coffee, an ice cream, or a new sweater with the money you saved.

Follow your doctor’s instructions.,
Use certain medications with care.,
See a respiratory therapist.,
Use oxygen therapy as directed.,
Discuss oral cannabis with your doctor.,
Consider acupuncture.",How to Manage MS Breathing Complications2," If you are diagnosed with MS and have any breathing complications, it’s important to closely follow the treatment program your doctor prescribed. This includes getting regular checkups, taking medication, and making lifestyle changes. Doing these can not only help you manage your breathing complications, but may also slow the progression of MS.Follow your doctor’s instructions on how to take your medication. Ask your doctor or pharmacists any questions you may have about the medication or its dosing., Certain medications for MS, such as muscle relaxants, can depress respiratory function. Talk to your doctor about any breathing complications you are having. Ask if any of your medications may contribute to them. Your doctor may prescribe a different medication or monitor you more carefully. Some medications that can cause breathing problems include:Tranquilizers
Muscle relaxants
Opioid analgesics

, Therapy programs can strengthen respiratory muscles and enhance your breathing. If your doctor diagnoses you with breathing complications as a result of MS, schedule an appointment with a respiratory therapist. The therapist can help relieve and manage your symptoms.Ask your regular doctor to recommend a respiratory therapist. You can also locate a respiratory therapist near you at https://www.healthgrades.com/respiratory-therapy-directory.
Take relevant medical records to your appointment. You should also tell the therapist about your specific symptoms. This information can help the therapist develop an effective plan to manage your breathing issues.

, In rare cases, your doctor may prescribe oxygen therapy to help manage your MS breathing complications. This is often done if you have other conditions such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Follow your doctor's recommendations as outlined to prevent further complications or issues from oxygen therapy., Oral cannabis, or medical marijuana, is increasingly used to relieve the symptoms of many diseases. Multiple sclerosis is one of these illnesses. There are more effective treatments for MS available, but you may still experience symptoms that make it hard for you to breathe. If this is the case, discuss using medical marijuana to ease your symptoms with your doctor. Keep in mind that smoking oral cannabis may have side effects, including making it more difficult to breathe because of its impact on your lungs., Acupuncture is a practice used in Western as well as traditional Chinese medicine. Acupuncture involves inserting small, thin, disposable needles into the skin. Consider trying acupuncture, which may help relieve some of your MS-related breathing complications.Recognize that it may take 6-10 acupuncture sessions to figure out if the treatment will help your breathing complications.
Find a local acupuncturist worldwide at https://www.acufinder.com. Make sure that the acupuncturist is credentialed by checking for a National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine certification.
Make sure you let your practitioner know that you have MS. This can help the person tailor the acupuncture sessions to your specific needs.
While generally considered safe, keep in mind that the efficacy of acupuncture for people with MS has not yet been evaluated in depth or confirmed. When in doubt, consult with your doctor first before trying alternative medicine therapies such as acupuncture.

Reach out to family and friends.",How to Live with Autonomic Dysfunction," An autonomic dysfunction can be the result of several other disease or disorders. Your doctor will administer tests that correspond with the symptoms you are experiencing and provide you with treatment options based on their diagnosis.Some autonomic dysfunctions can improve over time with the right treatment, but other autonomic dysfunctions have no cure and the goal of treatment will be to maintain your standard of living and manage your symptoms.If you have a condition that increases your risk of developing an autonomic dysfunction, like diabetes, your doctor may perform a physical exam and ask you questions about your symptoms. Other treatments, like cancer treatment with a drug known to cause nerve damage, can lead to an autonomic dysfunction. Your doctor may check for signs of an autonomic dysfunction if you are on drugs for cancer treatment.
If you have symptoms of an autonomic dysfunction, but no obvious risk factors, your doctor may run other tests to confirm your diagnosis. They will review your medical history, ask you about your symptoms, and conduct a physical exam to check for several other disorders or diseases.
If you have type 2 diabetes, you should be screened annually for an autonomic dysfunction as soon as you receive your diagnosis. If you have type 1 diabetes, you should be screened annually for an autonomic dysfunction five years after your diagnosis.;
, There are several common medical issues that can occur as a result of an autonomic dysfunction:Urinary issues: You may have difficulty urinating, incontinence or involuntary leaking of urine, or chronic urinary tract infections.
Digestive issues: You may feel full after only a few bites of food, have a complete loss of appetite, constipation, diarrhea, bloating in the abdominal area, nausea, vomiting, a hard time swallowing, or heartburn.
Sexual difficulties: Men may have difficulty achieving or maintaining an erection, also known as erectile dysfunction, or ejaculation issues. Women may experience vaginal dryness, low sex drive, or difficulty achieving an orgasm.
Heart rate issues: You may experience dizziness or fainting when you stand up due to a sudden drop in your blood pressure. This is called orthostatic hypotension and is common with autonomic dysfunction. You may also have sweating abnormalities, sweating too much or too little. This will make it difficult for you to regulate your body temperature. Your heart rate may stay the same even during exercise, leading to an inability or intolerance of physical activity.

, Once you receive a diagnosis of any underlying causes, your doctor will likely recommend a combination of home treatments and medication. They may also recommend coping methods to help you live a full life with the autonomic dysfunction.There are also several alternative medicines you can try to help you manage your symptoms, including acupuncture and electrical nerve stimulation. Always talk to your doctor before using any alternative medicines to ensure it will not have a negative effect., To help improve your digestion, you should increase the amount of fiber and fluids in your diet slowly. Doing this over a period of time will prevent you from feeling gassy or bloated. You should also eat smaller meals throughout the day to avoid overloading your digestive system. Drinking more water throughout the day will also encourage your digestive system to function properly.Your doctor may suggest taking a fiber supplement like Metamucil or Citrucel to increase the amount of fiber in your body.Avoid foods that contain lactose and gluten to prevent aggravating your digestive system.
Patients with autonomic dysfunction of the stomach or diabetic gastroparesis should consume small meals four to five times a day. Meals should be low in fat and contain only soluble fiber.
Your doctor may prescribe medication called metoclopramide (Reglan) to help your stomach empty faster by encouraging your digestive tract to contract; however, this medication can cause drowsiness and may be less effective over time. Your doctor may also recommend medication to help with constipation, such as over-the-counter laxatives. Talk to your doctor about how often you should take these medications.Other medications, like antibiotics, can help relieve diarrhea or other bowel issues. Antibiotics can prevent excessive bacterial growth in your intestines, leading to a better functioning digestive system. Erythromycin causes increased functioning of the stomach, and is a prokinetic agent that improves gastric emptying.
Your doctor may also prescribe antidepressants to treat nerve-related abdominal pain. You may experience side effects like dry mouth and urine retention when on these medications., Set up a schedule so you drink fluids and urinate at the same time every day — try to use the bathroom every hour and work up to every three to four hours. This can help to increase your bladder’s capacity and retrain your bladder so it empties at the appropriate times.Your doctor may prescribe medication to help empty your bladder, such as bethanechol. You may experience side effects like headache, abdominal cramping, bloating, nausea, and flushing or redness in the face while on this medication.
Ask your doctor about medication to prevent an overactive bladder, such as tolterodine (Detrol) or oxybutynin (Ditropan XL). You may experience side effects like dry mouth, headache, fatigue, constipation, and abdominal pain while on these drugs.
Conditioning your pelvic floor muscles may also help. Talk to your doctor about how to isolate and exercise these muscles.
Your doctor may recommend a more invasive solution like urinary assistance via a catheter. For this procedure, a tube will be guided through your urethra to empty your bladder.

, If you are struggling with erectile dysfunction, your doctor may recommend medications like sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra), or tadalafil (Cialis) to help you achieve and maintain an erection. You may experience side effects like mild headache, flushing or redness of your face, upset stomach, and changes in your ability to see color.Use these medications with caution if you have a history of heart disease, arrhythmia, stroke, or high blood pressure. Get immediate medical care if you have an erection that lasts longer than four hours.
Your doctor may also recommend an external vacuum pump, which helps to pull blood into your penis using a hand pump. This will allow you to maintain an erection for up to 30 minutes.
For women with sexual issues, your doctor may recommend vaginal lubricants to decrease any dryness and to make intercourse more enjoyable.

, Your doctor will recommend a high-salt, high-fluid diet if you have a severe case of blood pressure problems. This treatment can cause your blood pressure to spike or your feet, ankles, or legs to swell. Speak to your doctor about the limits of this diet.You can also take medication to raise your blood pressure, such as a drug called fludrocortisone. This medication will allow your body to retain salt, thereby regulating your blood pressure. Your doctor may also prescribe other drugs like midodrine or pyridostigmine (Mestinon).
If you have heart regulation issues, your doctor may prescribe a class of medications called beta blockers. This will help to regulate your heart rate if it goes too high during physical activity.
If you suffer from excessive sweating, you can take medication called glycopyrrolate (Robinul) to decrease sweating. You may experience side effects like diarrhea, dry mouth, urinary retention, blurred visions, headaches, loss of taste, changes in heart rate, and drowsiness.

, Your heart issues may be coupled with orthostatic hypotension, or difficulty standing upright. It’s important to do gentle seated exercises to build up your muscle tone without the risk of falling down or losing consciousness.Water aerobics and water jogging are ideal for individuals with orthostatic intolerance. You can also use an exercise bike to do light cycling and other gentle seated aerobic exercises.
The use of antihypertensive medication (thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, etc.) can worsen orthostatic hypotension, especially in the elderly.

, Make small adjustments like elevating your bed so the head of your bed is four inches higher. Use blocks or risers under the head of your bed to keep your head raised and help with low blood pressure.You should also practice sitting with your legs dangling over the side of your bed for a few minutes before getting out of bed. Try to flex your feet and grip your hands together for a minute before standing to increase blood flow. You should also do basic standing exercises to improve blood flow like tensing your leg muscles and crossing one leg over the other.

, You should maintain strict control of your blood glucose by taking your insulin before or after a meal and monitoring your blood sugar levels.Doing this will help to lessen your symptoms and delay or prevent more serious issues as a result of your diabetes.
In addition to symptoms like urinary and digestive issues and erectile dysfunction, you may also experience peripheral neuropathy (numbness) if you have diabetes. Talk to your doctor if you experience any of these issues.

, Many people who have an autonomic dysfunction also suffer from depression and anxiety. If you are experiencing impotence or difficulty with sexual arousal, you may have relationship issues with your partner. Talking to a counselor or therapist can help you work through this issues and get professional support., Talk to your doctor about support groups for autonomic dysfunctions in your area. If there is not a specific group near you, you can look for a support group for your underlying condition, such as a diabetes support group or a sexual difficulties support group.It can be helpful to talk to others who understand what you are going through and are dealing with many of the same struggles as you. You may also learn some coping mechanisms from the support group to make life with an autonomic dysfunction easier.

, Lean on those closest to you to create a support system for yourself. Be willing to ask for and accept help when it is needed. Try not to shut yourself off from your family and friends and focus on maintaining a positive attitude to tackle any challenges or struggles you are facing due to your disorder."

Realize that you're not alone in suffering from Twitter addiction.,
Quit Twitter.",How to Defeat a Twitter Addiction," If you've got one or more of the following common warning signs of being addicted to Twitter, you're in need of a Twitter reality check:


Tweeting is more than fun. It's akin to breathing. Without tweeting, you don't feel you are... anything.
The tweets must go on, no matter what. Even when you don't feel like tweeting, your hands and fingers haven't received the message and have gone ahead and tweeted for you. Inconceivable you say? Addictions involve actions that you don't want to do, or even actions you don't realize you're doing. It has reached its zenith when you don't want to realize you've realized that you didn't realize you were tweeting.
Insignificance takes on monumental proportions. The mundane matters. The crowd on your tweet-stream deserves to know that you... got up this morning.
People without Twitter accounts are Luddites. Period. They've been removed from your address book. You'd remove them from following your Twitter account if only they had one.
Giving Twitter updates as you leap from the crashing plane, give CPR to a nearly-drowned pal, or witness a horror smash is considered perfectly normal. So is reaching for the Twitter account before the epi-pen.
Twitter is your day. The rest of what could have been your day is arranged around it; the job is slotted in, the kids are given glazed nods, and dinner's out of the store freezer for the fifteenth month in a row.
It's essential to find someone else to post updates for you when you're incapacitated because of that nuisance work trip or annoyance of a life-improving operation. Providing your substitute with a total schedule, you've told them what to say, and forcefully rammed it home that they'd better maintain your usual tweeting tone... or else.
The Fail Whale looms large. After realizing you can't post a tweet informing everyone that Twitter is down, you curse, air-punch, and grind your teeth. You refresh the screen again and again and again until the Twitter conversations return. Only to tell everyone how down you were when Twitter was down.
Your work is piling up. You have a lot of unfinished projects and you still feel compelled to tweet.
You just cannot seem to be able to go a day without tweeting. It makes you uneasy and you feel better once you log back onto Twitter.
You have been told by your parents, coworkers, or supervisors to stop tweeting, and you find yourself unable to stop.
Your real life relationships are deteriorating because of all the time you are spending on Twitter.;
, Yes, it's a cliche that half the battle is admitting the problem but not acknowledging it means you won't change the addictive behavior. And before you rush to tweet that you have a Twitter addiction, by all means admit it to yourself but remember that there's no need to tell the world.


If you do tweet about your Twitter addiction concerns, it's likely you'll receive a lot of ha, ha, LOL tweets back with comments like ""me too, and ""oh I know, isn't it just too bad"". All of which minimizes the importance of your realization, which can easily cause you to downplay the importance of admitting your problem.
Be aware that some people will want to sabotage any attempts you make to withdraw from or minimize Twitter usage. This usually happens when the potential saboteurs know their own usage is out of control but they cannot change it. They don't want any evidence from someone else that it's possible to manage Twitter as anything less than a lifeline.
If you must say something about toning down your Twitter use, couch it in much more general terms, such as:

""Got a novel to finish. You won't see much of me here for a bit.""
""Giving birth tomorrow. Since I'm no supermom, you won't see me around till I know how to parent.""
""Huge, v. big secret work assignment just came up. Will be unreachable for a few months.""
""Tweeting less 'coz I've discovered marathon running. Off to train!""



, If you're inwardly groaning about how any person could ever ""plan"" the use of what is essentially a spontaneous medium, you're right. Twitter works because of its spontaneity. And that's also its weakness because you don't feel like there are any limitations of time, day or night, to when a good (or not) tweet can be unleashed. The plan that you'll need to adopt involves when, not what, you'll tweet, so relax (although, do try your best to minimize the inane and ramp up the qualify). Try the following:


Allow yourself a set amount of time every day, reserved for Twitter. Some suggestions are: 15 minutes every 3 hours, or one single block of an hour a day when everything else is taken care of.
Set precise tweeting times. This is different from the previous suggestion in that you can set a time every day, say 12:30PM to send one tweet message. Stick the to exact allotted times.
Check when your tweets have the most impact. Using only high-impact times can lessen your daily usage. Choose your time to coincide only with the time of most impact; this will vary depending on where you live and your interests. Assessing the time of most impact is especially important if you're promoting your blog, your novels, or your inner beauty.

, This means avoiding use of Twitter as something you can do while multitasking, such as watching TV, reading your exam notes, or writing articles about quitting Twitter. Used this way, Twitter serves as a distraction, an excuse to not fully concentrate on whatever else you are doing. The problem with viewing anything as a multitask activity is that you tend to downplay how much time it wastes and how much it distracts you from getting anything done fully and with satisfaction; instead, it feels piecemeal and never quite ""done"". Setting aside time just for Twitter can be helpful in overcoming using it as part of multitasking messiness.

, All those apps and planning sites that make Twitter such a breeze for you – get rid of them. Whether it be Tweetie, TwitterBerry, TweetDeck, TwitterFon, PocketTweets, or ceTwit, these mobile Twitter platforms enable you to tweet practically anywhere and everywhere. Removing these applications from your phone will greatly cut down on the amount of time you're logged into Twitter each day. Try it before rolling on the floor in disbelief; you can, and will, thrive as a result.

, For example, make going on Twitter something you indulge in on weekends only. You'll look forward to on the weekends, when you'll be more alert and able to craft more interesting tweets and perhaps connect more deeply with a few rather than trying to keep up with the too many.


Doing this might help to increase your work productivity if you're in the sort of job where they allow Twitter usage (if work's so boring you'd rather tweet, time for a new job maybe?). On the other hand, if Twitter is a part of your work, create a plan to use it the most efficiently, especially if you're working remotely.

, The constant bombardment of messages can induce a sense of constant hyper-awareness that keeps you on edge, in need of reacting and worrying over things you can't, on the whole, change. Is that a nice way to feel all the time? Give yourself information free time, chilling under some trees, or down the gym, or wherever your favorite quiet spot is. Without your phone.

, Ever noticed those accounts that just vanish? Not those ""suspicious activity"" ones but the raw food guy who was a fanatic about sending you raw food tips every day, or the poet whose Twitter haiku astounded you in its eccentricity? They seemed so nice, always around like Twitter furniture! Many of the accounts that disappear or wind down are people who have that moment of realization that too much time spent on Twitter is time not spent on other pursuits. The raw food guy wants to make his recipes instead of tweeting them; the haiku poet wants to spend more time in a quiet, wooded wi-fi free zone to reflect and restore her creativity. Be kind to yourself in realizing that others have been here already; the evolutionary nature of social networking means that many people continue to keep revising how to balance Twitter in their already busy lives. Keep your perspective about Twitter's place in your life as fresh as the updates.


What have you given up for Twitter? Was it an inane pursuit like watching too much TV, or something that mattered, like writing, exercise, reflecting, or spending time with people in the flesh? The answer to this question may help you to find the necessary motivation to make the time and energy input adjustments.

, While radical, if you've tried everything else and Twitter is still coming before the mowed lawn, the descaling of the shower, and the ironing of work clothes, then you might have to switch it off permanently. After all, will Twitter actually land people on Mars? No. But you can bet it'll be tweeted endlessly by people whose claim to space flight expertise is drawn from a bunch of links. If you don't know how to leave, here's how:


Log in to Twitter
Click ""Settings""
Click ""Deactivate my Account"" at the bottom of the page
Enter your password when prompted. (Without the correct account password, you will not be able to deactivate an account.)
Verify that you really want to do it. If you've come this far, then you do. Have your life back. And those Luddites are having a great wine and cheese do on the corner of fifth and third...

You have prepared yourself to make a change and now you have the opportunity to follow through with your intent and gain confidence. Slowing down and limiting the number of tasks you try to simultaneously perform will help you improve your awareness.

, Realize that playing with your hair is a common affliction, but it may have developed into an addiction. Most behaviors are measured on a continuum, which ranges from slight to moderate to severe addiction. If playing with your hair has become an uncontrollable habit that causes problems in your personal life, then perhaps it’s time to do something about it.


Although you should rely upon a professional to render an official diagnosis, you can evaluate your behaviors and decide the level of care and action you would like to take. There may be instances when others may disagree with you and want you to take stronger action.
On one end of the scale, you find mild cases that resolve on their own or require simple strategies to stop the habit.
On the other end of the scale are conditions such as trichotillomania, a disorder that involves repeatedly pulling your hair out from your head, eyebrows or eyelashes. This extreme condition can leave a person with bald spots and skin irritations that interfere with daily life. This would affirm that you have an addiction and definitely need help to control or eliminate the behavior.Extreme hair playing is often times associated with other disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), depression and anxiety.It may be necessary to seek treatment for these other conditions, which may result in solving your hair playing addiction.

, There are multiple resources available to you through groups such as, the American Psychological Associationand the American Psychiatric Association.Help is available and could be the best thing you’ve ever done for yourself.

Even the smallest change is important to recognize.

Find healthy distractions.,
Keep both hands busy to prevent you from playing with your hair.,
Assess your anxiety or boredom levels.",How to Overcome a Hair Playing Addiction2," When you feel the urge to play with your hair, redirect yourself. Select activities that require you to be focused, but not to the point that you lose awareness of your hair playing behavior. Activities such as reading, playing a video game, watching a movie, and writing may be activities that increase the likelihood of your hair playing. Playing a game outdoors or taking your dog for a walk can be great distractions.


Some activities, thoughts and feelings may increase your urge to play with your hair. If you catch yourself immediately say, “Stop,"" then find a substitute activity. For example, if you are talking to someone and you start to play with your hair, grab a pen to hold, or even sit on your hands.Observe the number of times you need to distract yourself from playing with your hair. This will help you understand the severity of your habit.You will likely notice a high frequency in the beginning stages; but that leaves a lot of room for celebrating your improvements.

, There are a lot of possibilities such as baking a cake, playing a sport, making something from metal or wood, frosting some cookies, shopping for clothing, building a rock garden, painting with both hands (give it a try), doing handstands, grooming your pet, or playing a musical instrument, etc.


Not only will you stop playing with your hair, but you could have a lot of fun too.
Find new and exciting things to do that you’ve never done before. Be adventurous. You may discover a new and rewarding interest.

They have also been successfully used to help smokers deal with fidgeting as they quit smoking.You can find them online or in some health or new age stores.

, Playing with your hair can be a sign that you feel anxious or bored, which means it's important to deal with the cause rather than take it out on your hair. If you're feeling anxious, there are many calming techniques you could try. Talking to someone who will lend an ear, will help you process your feelings. If you are bored, then find a way to entertain yourself.


Try meditation or yoga, which will help you focus on your breath and will teach you to be calm.Find other soothing behaviors that will help you manage your anxiety.

Wear fun and stylish hats.,
Use hair bows and barrettes to style and control your hair.,
Cover your hair with a scarf or bandana.",How to Overcome a Hair Playing Addiction3," Making changes like this, even if temporary, could immediately help break the habit of hair playing and help in the long term as well. Essentially, this will block your hands from reaching the area on your head where you repeatedly play with your hair. There are many alternatives when it comes to hats. You may find that some styles fit you better than others. A knit cap may fit you better than a cowboy or baseball cap. Choose the ones that make you feel comfortable.

, If you pin your hair down, then you won’t be able to play with it. Place these accessories strategically to gather your hair, and pull or push it away from the area of concern. Get creative and you might just start the next new fashion trend in hair accessories.

, Completely covering your head will eliminate any chance of playing with your hair. Each time you touch the scarf or bandana, you will be reminded that you are trying to make a positive change. If you can withstand the urge to pull off the scarf or bandana, you will experience a significant amount of “play-free” time.

Braid your hair to pull it away from your face.,
Cut your hair.,
Color your hair.",How to Overcome a Hair Playing Addiction4," Simple changes, although temporary, help to break habits and assist in making long term changes in your behavior. If you can relocate strands of hair that can be played with, your hands won't find anything to do. This can trigger a mental reminder to stop trying to play with your hair. When you commit to braiding your hair, you can’t play with it because it will loosen and ruin the braid.


A ponytail or bun will work well. Keeping it off your shoulders and away from swinging in your face will remove the temptation to play.
Hair stylists can help you find a style that will keep temptation to a minimum.In particular, keeping the hair off your face, out of reach, or styled using a lot of hair product will prevent unwanted hair playing. The desire to keep your hairstyle looking its best can be enough to stop you.

, If a shorter or more layered look is what you want, then make the change. Shaving your hair would be extreme; but if you like the look of it, you might love it.


There are charitable organizations that use donated hair to make wigs for cancer patients who have lost hair due to chemotherapy. You can donate your hair to this type of program, which will help others and help you as well., A simple change in color might be exciting. It can make you feel better about yourself, or see yourself in a more positive way. A change in scenery might be just want you need to get motivated.


If the “new you” wants to stop playing with her hair, pick a new hair color and create a new picture for the world to see. It could be quite a cathartic experience."

Look for a twelve step program.,
Attend a variety of meetings in different locations.,
Get a sponsor.,
Work the 12 steps with your sponsor.,
Do the steps in order.,
Identify with a ""home group."",
Stick with the group.,
Don’t stress religion.,
Stay anonymous.,
Keep realistic.,
Attend no matter where you are.,

Carry on.,
Take it slowly.,
Be confident.,
Don’t give up.,
Get additional help.,
Examine your hobbies and social activities.,
Examine your friendships.,
Get your family into a support group.,
Clean out your home.",How to Get Sober with a 12 Step Program," You can find lists of programs on the web, in doctors’ or public health offices, and even and in libraries. These resources will point you to lists of meetings in your area.There are also online meetings through many of these organizations’ websites.;
, Some meetings will meet your needs better than others and each group will have its own identity, cohesion, approach, and unique feeling reflecting the members participating., A sponsor is someone who is also journeying through recovery and is a bit further along than you in this process. Your sponsor is also someone with whom you feel comfortable and can talk freely.You and your sponsor meet informally as equals and are there to help each other out and call each other in times of need.
Alcoholics Anonymous, for one, suggests choosing someone of your gender identity and sexual orientation to decrease involvement in unrelated matters other than sobriety.

, The steps are nearly the same in all programs and are a recipe for recovery. In addition to attending meetings, your sponsor may ask you to read program literature, pray, or meditate.It's okay to change sponsors if you need a different approach.
If you can’t reach your sponsor when you need help, call someone else from the program, attend a meeting, go to the nearest program office, or read some program literature until you get over your tough spot.

, Though they are just suggestions, you’re more likely to successfully recover if you follow through the whole program, in the purposeful order intended, and not skip any steps. Each step presents a challenge that pushes you to think and move forward.Avoid “two-stepping,” or admitting you have a problem then jumping right to taking on membership responsibilities, such as becoming a sponsor to someone else. Take the time to truly journey through the steps at the pace you need before you can be a support to someone else.
Emotional growth, maturity, personal awareness, and recovery take time.
The structure and function of the steps often gives meaning to a life that is struggling to find meaning.

, In a home group, you attend regularly enough to vote on issues that affect that group, feel especially comfortable enough to build and sustain friendships, and partake in group responsibilities, such as introducing new members or chairing a meeting.Having a home group increases your sense of belonging, often missing in the lives of people living with addictions, and allows you to have a secure and strong support system.
Having a home group does not mean that you cannot attend other meetings.

, You may feel a number of reasons to leave or have doubts about the program’s effectiveness, but there are good reasons to keep going. Researchers have found that the longer you attend a group, the more likely you are to call on a sponsor when you need help and then you’re less likely to relapse.The longer you attend group and the more meetings you attend, the more likely you are to be abstinent.

, Although there is talk of God in many twelve step programs, you do not have to be religious to recover. You and your sponsor can talk about ways to relate to the program that are non-religious. There are twelve step mantras rewritten for agnostics, Buddhists, humanists, Native American traditions, and many other belief systems.Many of the basic principles are the same, dealing with perseverance, justice, power, and so on. The main goal for any twelve step program is recovery and self-awareness.

, Though you may want to develop a feeling of camaraderie, understanding, and fellowship, you don’t have to divulge too many personally identifying details. The success of the group often depends on being able to talk freely without worrying that people know who you are in your work or family life.Only give as many details in group as you feel comfortable giving.

, Many of these programs are designed to work in concert with any other treatment you are currently undergoing with a professional in the relevant area. These are peer groups to support you, not cure your addiction.Many of these programs can offer information but do not offer other services such as nursing care, legal advice, housing, or other social services.

, Even when you are travelling, there are 12 step meetings available around the world., While this may be the most ultimately diverse group you’ve ever attended and people have nothing in common but their addictions, there are certain personality types that tend to emerge. Some people get derailed in meetings by other members with ulterior motives and agendas so knowing what to watch out for will help you stay on track.Sometimes, romantic relationships happen quite innocently but there is also a term for someone who purposefully tries to date the ‘weaker’ new members – ‘the 13th stepper.’ This person takes advantage of members at their most vulnerable.
Inevitably, there will be tears. Don’t let yourself get too emotionally drained by the ‘crier’ in the group.
The old-timer is the ‘know-it-all’ in the group that has been in recovery for years. Some may find him intimidating but don’t be afraid to call on him for help. He’s seen it all and can likely be a very valuable support person.
The ‘dry drunk’ in AA is the one who cannot see how the program applies to him, still thinks of alcohol in a romanticized way, is over-confident in his abilities to stay sober, and tends to blame others for his problems., This first step is admitting that your addiction has power over you and that you need assistance in breaking the cycle. This, some say, is the most important step.People with addictions spend years believing that the substance they are addicted to is helping, not hindering them. That is why this first step is so important – it represents a monumental shift in thinking. This step is about being honest with yourself that you have a problem.
Step 1 is humbling but also empowering, because now you have opened up to the possibility of healing.

, Although many 12 step programs talk about believing in a higher power in order to help restore your sanity, what this step is really all about is having an open mind to all the possibilities now being presented to you as you explore your journey towards recovery.If it helps, think of the 12 step program itself as the “higher power.”
This step is about having hope that there is something out there to help guide you in recovering.

, This step traditionally talks about giving yourself over to God for help, but what can apply from this situation to all 12 step programs is having faith that others, such as your sponsor, can help you.This step is about relying on the goodness and experiences of others.

, Step 4 is usually about putting yourself under a microscope, looking closely at the situations in which you find yourself drinking. You need to make a list of the situations that cause you to relapse or use alcohol.This step can be a really scary and intimate look at yourself, but can be very enlightening and empowering once you truly understand yourself.

, Steps 5, 6, and 7 are generally about asking your friends, family, sponsors, and others for help, but you also have to be really open to accepting their help, even when that means you get tough love.These steps may involve sharing secrets you’ve not shared with someone else before, and you may feel ashamed of some of the things you’ve done, but this is a natural progression.
Ask your friends to help you avoid places that trigger your addiction.
Be open, honest, and willing to change.

, Perhaps the second most difficult set of steps after accepting that you have a problem is accepting that you have wronged people with whom you now need to make amends. Steps 8, 9, and 10 are often about making lists of people you have hurt, intentionally or unintentionally, directly, or indirectly, and asking their forgiveness.These lists will likely be fluid documents, changing as new realizations come to you.
For example, if your alcoholism led you to drive drunk and you injured another driver, you need to acknowledge your wrongdoing and ask for that person's forgiveness.

, Steps 11 and 12 are often about dedicating yourself to the healing journey, continuing down the healthy path you’re on, and sharing that knowledge and experience with others.Here, you not only strive to increase your own potential, but often take on a service role of sponsoring or helping others to do the same.

, Take it one second, one minute, one hour, and one day at a time. Easy does it. Addiction recovery is a marathon, not a sprint. Alcoholism is a chronic disorder with a danger of relapse.In case you feel the urge to buy something that feeds your drinking problem, put a ""no relapse"" reminder note in your wallet so you will see it whenever you dig in there to get money.

, Remember that you are in control. The more confident you are in your ability to abstain and recover, the more likely you are to succeed.Understanding your role in your own behavior can help you stop making excuses and increase your self-confidence. Internal locus of control is the extent to which you assume responsibility for your actions and believe you can control your life. Having an internal locus of control better focuses you for future success., If you are not immediately successful, keep trying. You can find a way to make this work for you. It can take a long time to successfully recover from alcohol abuse.It may encourage you to know that about a third of people who are treated for alcohol abuse problems show no further symptoms one year later.Try visualization. A very successful technique in facing fears and overcoming challenges, visualization involves sitting quietly and focusing mentally on what you hope to achieve, watching the scene of you succeeding playing out in your mind.Recite positive affirmations to yourself. These little mantras, such as “I am taking back control of my life and my health” and “I will succeed in my effort to get sober,” help you focus on what is positive about what you’re doing and reaffirm that you’re making the right choice., Alcohol abuse often occurs alongside another issue. You may have concurrent depression, anxiety, or other mental health concerns requiring additional professional treatment such as counselling or psychotherapy.These additional resources will help you deal with the underlying psychological and emotional problems that may have lead to the very real physiological problem you now have. Treating the underlying issue will help prevent relapse.
You may require a period of inpatient treatment if your alcoholism or withdrawal is putting your immediate health and safety at risk. Twelve step programs are also available in residential treatment facility and hospital settings.
Stick to whatever medical routine your doctor orders. You may be put on Antabuse to making drinking alcohol seem repulsive to you, for example.
Spiritual help often plays a role in recovery as many people find that getting in touch with their spiritual side strengthens their resolve.
Teens with higher religious service attendance are more likely to abstain from substance abuse., You will likely find that many of your social activities and hobbies involve your addiction, such as drinking at a pool hall. You will need to find other social outings and places to go to that don’t involve your addiction in order to reduce temptation and the association between your addiction and having fun.Go to different places that don’t serve alcohol, such as coffee shops, or invite your friends to play paintball instead of shooting pool at the pub.Ask friends to help you by not drinking around you.
Go to a park to socialize instead of a bar.
Say ""No"" clearly and directly if someone offers you a drink. You can say, ""No, thank you"" or you can go into more detail, such as ""I'm not drinking because my doctor said to. I'd appreciate it if you could help me out by not asking me to have a drink."", You may need to distance yourself from friends and social activities that hinder your recovery.Addiction is a very socially debilitating ailment. You will most likely find yourself feeling very uncomfortable in social situations during early sobriety. This is quite normal. An enormous part of the healing process is regaining the ability to create, maintain, and enhance healthy relationships

This may be daunting at first, but will become less so with each healthy relationship you form and foster.
Continuing with healthy support networks is one of the key factors found in making your journey through the twelve step program a success.Teens with strong social support networks are more likely to abstain from substance abuse., Support for family members is available through various programs such as Al-Anon and Alateen. Having your family members in a support group will help them to help you, by educating them on your illness and offering them ways of coping while you are in recovery.If you have a family member who abuses alcohol, get them into a support and treatment program as well to increase the chances of both of you recovering.

, Reduce any temptation that lingers in the house or at work. Don't keep alcohol at home, even if you don't drink any more. Don't even keep cooking wine around. Remove barware, corkscrews, pub glasses -- anything that would remind you of drinking."

Make a list of things about work that gives you pleasure.,
Determine which skills your MS has affected.,
Adjust your occupation based on what you’re capable of doing.,
Think about changing careers.,
Consider working part-time.,
Look into working from home.,
Follow your management plan.",How to Make a Living When You Have Multiple Sclerosis1," As you figure out alternate ways to work and make a living with MS, you should start by making a list of the different aspects of your jobs that gave you pleasure. This can range from a part-time job you had years ago to your current career. Any work you have done may lead to a new job.For example, you may enjoy the group of people you help through your job, the importance of the work you do, or the product your job creates.
You may also enjoy the financial independence or insurance benefits of your job.;
, After you make your list of aspects of your job that you enjoy, decide which skills or parts of your job are affected by your MS. Beside each skill, write “not affected” or give a one to two sentence description of how your job is affected.For example, you may not be able to stand for eight hours, or interacting with customers causes fatigue.
Having this list gives you an idea of what duties you are able to perform and which ones causes your MS symptoms to flare up. Being aware of these details can help you figure out ways you can still work.

, After you have gone through the steps of listing the things you like about work and then figuring out what your MS affects, you can make decisions about your career. You can start by talking to your company about making accommodations to your current job based on your condition or changing jobs internally to something you are able to do. If these two things are not options, you can look for a new job based on your skills.For example, if you teach, you may switch to an older group of students who will take less energy from you to teach. You may also transition into administrative work, such as an administrative assistant in the main school office or county office or a guidance counselor.
If you are a manager with a physical job, you might consider switching to human resources or finding a job at a different company where you are in a less physical and strenuous position.

, If you have a job that you are unable to do because of your MS, you may consider changing careers or jobs. Just because you can’t do one job full-time doesn’t mean you can’t do a different job with different physical and emotional requirements. Think about ways you can change your duties at your current job or try something completely different.For example, you may consider getting a job as a phone operator or telemarketer. You may also be able to get a job as an office administrator where you do light office work and are able to sit and take breaks.
You may also try getting a job as a sales associate or customer service representative.

, If you are unable to work full-time, this does not mean you have to stop working completely. Consider talking to your job about going down to part-time hours. If your job won’t let you cut your hours, look for a part-time job in your area.A part-time job can help supplement your household income and help keep you working, even if it is for less hours each week.
Examples of part-time jobs can be retail jobs, such as a cashier or retail associate. You can also try being a substitute teacher, which you can do when you feel up to it.

, If you have a career where you can work from home, consider discussing this option with your boss. Your MS may make it difficult to go to an office, but you may be able to work from home.You may look into work you can do from home, like freelance writing, editing, tutoring, or running an online store.
Working from home may give you the freedom to arrange your hours so that you work around your symptoms. You may also be able to complete your work during your best hours of the day.

, One way to ensure that you can work for as long as possible is to follow your MS management plan and your doctor’s instructions. This helps reduce flare-ups and any unpleasant symptoms from avoidable triggers, like stress or unhealthy diets.A healthy diet may be one way to manage your MS. Eating unhealthy foods that offer no nutrition can worsen MS fatigue and weakness. Focus on eating healthy foods full of nutrients to keep yourself stronger and energized so you can focus on working.Regular exercise helps manage MS symptoms. Try swimming, walking, toga, or tai chi.Manage your stress while you work. Work adds stress not related to your MS, so focusing on relaxation and managing stress is particularly important when you have MS. "

Consult this list of symptoms, and use it to gauge the severity of your shopping addiction. This is an important way to decide exactly how much you need to cut down—whether you can be trusted to simply moderate your shopping or if it may be a better idea to simply stop shopping altogether.Shopping or spending money when you feel upset, angry, lonely, or anxious
Having arguments with others about your shopping that rationalizes your behavior
Feeling lost or lonely without your credit cards
Consistently purchasing with credit rather than cash
Feeling a euphoric rush or deep sense of ecstasy when making purchases
Feeling guilt, shame, or embarrassment upon excessive spending
Lying about your spending habits or the cost of specific items
Having obsessive thoughts about money
Spending lots of your time trying to manage money and bills to accommodate your spending habits;
, Keep a record of what you buy for two weeks to a month, also making note of how you pay for your purchases. Ask yourself the following questions to get a better handle on when and how you buy. Also, tracking the exact amount of money you spend for this length of time will help open your eyes to how severe your shopping habit really is.

, According to Shopaholics Anonymous, compulsive shopping can take many forms. Knowing these forms will help you understand your addiction better so that you can better understand how to help yourself. You may be able to recognize yourself on this list, or use your record of buying habits to see where you fit.Shoppers who are triggered to shop upon emotional distress
Trophy shopaholics who are constantly on the hunt for the perfect item
Shoppers who enjoy flashy items and love feeling like a big spender
Bargain seekers who buy things only because they are on sale
""Bulimic"" shoppers who get are caught up in a continuous cycle of buying items, only to return them later and start buying anew
Collectors who seek a feeling of completion from buying each piece of a set or the same item in every variation (color, style, etc.)

, While the short-term effects of shopping addiction may be positive, like feeling happy after completing a shopping trip, many of the long-term effects are overwhelmingly negative.Understanding these effects is a good way to face the realities of an excessive shopping habit.


Spending over budget and deep financial trouble
Compulsive buying over and above necessities (e.g. going to buy one sweater and leaving the store with ten)
Secrecy and hiding the problem to avoid criticism
Feelings of helplessness due to ongoing cycles of purchasing where guilt causes returns which then cause more purchases
Impaired relationships from secrecy, lying about debt, and physical isolation as the preoccupation with shopping increases

, For many, shopping is a way to curb and escape from negative emotions. Like most addictions that provide a ""quick fix"" to problems with deep psychological roots, shopping can help you feel complete and capable of maintaining a false image of happiness and security.Push yourself to consider whether or not shopping is an attempt to fill a void in your life that could be otherwise solved by healthier and more sustainable lifestyles.

, A trigger is anything that makes you want to shop. Keep a journal with you for at least a week, and whenever you feel the urge to shop, write down whatever you feel brought the idea into your mind. It may be a particular environment, friend, advertisement, or feeling (like anger, shame, or boredom). Knowing your triggers is extremely helpful because you can avoid the things that make you want to shop as you are learning to decrease your habit.


For example, you might go into a buying frenzy whenever you have a formal event to go to. You might get tempted to buy all sorts of wardrobe changes, designer makeup, or other products that will increase your confidence and make you feel ready for the event.
Knowing this, you could make a special plan for handling invitations to big events. You might cut out event-related shopping altogether and spend a mandatory hour looking through your closet for something suitable to wear that you already own.

, The best way to limit your shopping without stopping entirely is to be more conscious of how much your budget realistically allows you to spend over and above basic essentials. Keep a close eye to your finances, and take yourself shopping only when your budget for the month (or even for the week) permits it. This way you can keep shopping occasionally, but stand to avoid some of the larger financial issues that can come with the habit.


When shopping, carry as much money with you as you know you can get away with spending. Leave your credit cards at home to avoid temptation to go over your limit.
You can also try making an inventory of the things you own and a wishlist of the extras that you really want. Looking at your list will help keep you grounded and able to recognize when you're about to purchase something you already have a lot of or something you don't want as badly as other items that you'll surely be tempted to purchase.
Wait at least 20 minutes before making a purchase. Don't be sure that you must buy something; instead, spend time thinking about why you should or shouldn't go through with it.If you know there are particular stores where you tend to spend too much, only go to these stores on special occasions or with friends who can help monitor your purchasing. If this is a website, make sure it isn't on your list of bookmarked pages.

, Alternately, if your shopping addiction is serious, limit yourself only to the bare essentials. Be very vigilant when you must shop, and make a shopping list that you stick to. Avoid the temptation of sales and inexpensive items at discount warehouses, and allocate only a certain amount of cash to spend if you do visit one. The more specific your rules, the better. For example, instead of deciding to only shop for groceries and self-care necessities, make a complete list of self-care necessities (like toothpaste, deodorant, etc.) and do not buy anything other than what you’ve written down.


Change your payment methods, and destroy and cancel all credit cards. If you feel you should have one for emergencies only, ask a loved one guard it for you. This is important since people tend to spend twice as much as they would when making purchases with a card rather than cash.Do your market research before leaving the house. Because getting carried away while browsing often brings about unneeded purchases, know exactly which brands and types of each item on your list you need to buy. This will take the fun out of shopping by cutting off the need to browse.
Give up all loyalty cards that you do not use for the bare necessities that frequently appear on your shopping list.

, Most compulsive shoppers do their purchasing alone, and if you are with others you are much more likely not to spend excessively.This is the advantage of peer pressure; let yourself learn from the moderate buying habits of people whose judgment you trust.


It may even be necessary to put someone you trust in charge of your finances completely.

, Find more meaningful ways to spend your time. When trying to change compulsive behavior, it is crucial that you replace the behavior with another way of spending your time that is fulfilling and satisfying (but this time in a way that is sustainable).People find happiness in activities that make them feel so immersed that they lose track of time completely. Learn a new skill, finish a project you've put aside for a long time, or improve yourself in some other way. Whether you're reading, jogging, cooking or playing a musical instrument doesn't matter as long as you're fully engaged.While exercising and taking walks can provide a continuous source of happiness, these activities are especially useful alternatives to pursue while in the throes of a shopping urge.

, Remember to give yourself lots of acknowledgment and encouragement while you are in the midst of changing your shopping habits. It is important to give yourself credit for your progress, as kicking an addiction is exceedingly difficult. An objective look at how far you’ve come will stop you from beating yourself up over moments of struggle and self-doubt, which are inevitable.


Try monitoring the amount of money you spend in a spreadsheet. Look at the amount of trips you make to the store (or your favorite shopping sites) by making tick marks on your calendar.

, Create ""no-fly zones"" --places that you know will trigger you to shop. In all likelihood, these are places like malls, certain stores, or large open shopping areas. Your rules should be clear and precise to avoid being able to convince yourself that you can go and just browse a little bit. List these places and steer clear from them entirely for as long as you can manage, until the urge to buy excessively dissipates significantly. Check your trigger list to make sure that you're avoiding the right places and situations while you're in the sensitive moments of ""detox"" from your shopping addiction.You may not have to avoid all of these environments in the long-run, and indeed this may be a very difficult task due to the omnipresence of advertisements and buying opportunities.Especially if you are only trying to cut down and not quit shopping altogether, you may simply want to limit your presence in these environments. Create a schedule of when you will allow yourself to visit your favorite stores and stick to it.



, At least when you are beginning to cut back, take a break from traveling. This can help you avoid the temptation to buy that can be brought on by new or unfamiliar places. People tend to purchase more when they shop outside of their communities.Consider that ""remote buying"" from shopping channels and online sources can bring the same feel of a new environment--presenting another temptation to resist.

, Make sure your snail mail is covered, as well as your email. Unsubscribe from the promotional emails and catalogues that your favorite stores tend to send you.


Prevent the possibility of receiving unwanted offers for new credit cards by signing up for Opt-Out Prescreen. Upon providing your information here, you will not be targeted for advertising of this nature., Because the Internet is one of the most popular ways to shop now, remember that your computer environment needs to be just as ""sober"" as your world offline. Avoid e-commerce sites by setting blocks on your favorite online shopping sites.Download a good ad blocker program that will prevent personalized ads from appearing in your browser.
One-click shopping is especially dangerous. Make it even more difficult for you to buy online by deleting your credit card number from sites that have it linked to your account. Do this even if you are also blocking those sites too.This will create an added security; if you have found a way to rationalize being on the site, you will still have enough time to rethink your decision to make individual purchases.



, Secrecy is one of the major components of shopping addiction (and most addictions, for that matter).So, don’t be afraid to get public about your problems with shopping. Tell your friends and family what’s going on, and that you may ask them for help going shopping or buying necessities—at least in the early stages of cutting down when temptation is still very high.


Make sure that you only open up to trusted loved ones who are capable of supporting you through your push to cut down on shopping.

, A therapist can help you understand some of the possible problems that lay at the root of shopping addiction, such as depression. Although there is no standardized treatment for shopping addiction, you might expect to be prescribed antidepressants, like SSRIs.


One commonly used method for treating addictions is a method called cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). This type of therapy will help you recognize and challenge some of your thoughts related to shopping.Therapy will also help you place less value on extrinsic motivating factors, like a desire to look successful and wealthy, and more value on intrinsic motivators, like feeling comfortable in your skin and maintaining nourishing relationships with loved ones., Group therapy for shopping addiction is an abundant and invaluable resource. Being able to share coping tips and feelings with others who have similar problems can sometimes be the difference between sobriety and relapse back into your old, unhealthy spending habits.Look into local chapters of Debtors Anonymous or Spenders Anonymous. These are 12-step programs that can help you manage your shopping addiction on an ongoing basis.
Use this link to locate a Debtors Anonymous meeting near you.

, If your shopping addiction has gotten you into serious financial trouble that you are unable to manage on your own, you may want to consider seeing a credit counselor. A credit counselor can help you deal with the massive debt that accrues as a result of shopping addiction.


Dealing with the financial fallout of shopping addiction can be stressful alongside the emotional issues that arise with overcoming your habit. Because stress is a common trigger for relapse, a credit counselor might be an important resource.

Learn the definition of chronic kidney failure.,
Study the biochemical manifestations of this disorder.,
Study the role of vitamin D in relation to kidney failure.",How to Study the Causes of Chronic Kidney Failure," Chronic kidney failure is a progressive potentially end stage renal disease that can lead eventually to the death of the affected person. It occurs over a long period of time in which the normal function of the kidney nephrons is destroyed mostly due to the continuous use of toxic chemical compounds such as medications that have toxic effects on the kidney. Due to its important and versatile functions disorders of the kidney can have many biochemical manifestations.;
, An example is the accumulation of acids in the blood due to the weak mechanism of acid clearance in the nephrons. Acidosis occurs as a result of the accumulation of the acids. This acidosis can be corrected by the administration of a suitable base such as bicarbonate ions. Another biochemical disorder of this disease is the retention of potassium ions in the blood causing hyperkalemia. This accumulation of potassium ions in the blood can affect the function of the heart muscle.


Potassium ions are active participants in the formation and termination of action potentials in neurons of the nervous system. Thus one manifestation of hyperkalemia is arrhythmia of the heart muscle function. Hypertension is another clinical manifestation of this disorder. The failure to filter the blood efficiently leads to the retention of water in the body causing its accumulation and subsequently high blood pressure. Patients who have high blood pressure should be investigated for kidney function as one possible cause of the disorder.
In chronic renal failure, the failure to synthesize the hormone erythropoietin leads to symptoms of anemia. This is so due to the important function of this hormone in the regulation of red blood cells formation. Patients who suffer from anemia are investigated for kidney failure as one possible cause of the anemia. Chronic renal failure also has one associated biochemical disorder that is the deficient synthesis of vitamin D in the kidney cells. This lack of vitamin D can lead to deficiency of calcium ions in the blood potentially causing bones weakness due to the low level of calcium salts in the bone.

, Vitamin D is important physiologically for the absorption of calcium ions in the intestine and also for the deposition of calcium salts in the bone. This vitamin is only synthesized in the cells of the kidney in addition to its synthesis in the skin by the effect of UV light. Also in chronic kidney failure the synthesis of glucose by the metabolic process of gluconeogenesis is impaired. This causes sometimes a state of low glucose in the blood or hypoglycemia. This is especially prominent if there is also a liver failure that is associated with the kidney failure. This is so because the liver also synthesizes glucose molecules through the process of gluconeogenesis as well. Thus we see through all these biochemical disorders the importance of this disorder in humans. Also in chronic kidney failure there is retention in the blood of the molecules of urea and creatinine. Creatinine in particular is used as a marker for kidney function. Its elevated level in the blood is usually indicative of kidney failure. Also electrolytes disturbances are usually manifestations of kidney disease. Especially disturbances of potassium ions can be indicative of kidney failure. Chronic kidney failure leads usually to end stage renal disease due to its progressive course. If dialysis does not occur this will eventually leads inevitably to the death of the person.

Breaking habits is a difficult task, so if you aren't fully committed to it you are likely to fail.;
, Most habitual behaviors are patterns that have evolved because they have been rewarded in some way. They make it easier to perform a common task, or to deal with various emotional states.A “habit loop” forms from a cue, or trigger, that tells your brain to start the habitual behavior. The brain processes a “reward” from this behavior, in the form of neurochemicals, that reinforces the habit loop.Interrupting the behavior part of this loop is how to break a habit., To determine the most effective way to break a habit, it will be helpful to determine the situational and emotional context that triggers the habit.This can help you understand what “rewards” your brain is looking for.Having this understanding will allow you to develop other, healthier means of achieving the same rewards that the bad habit provided.Many bad habits come about as a means of dealing with situations that cause stress or boredom.For example, for many people smoking provides a relief from stress. Procrastination temporarily provides free time to engage in more fun activities.When you feel the urge to perform your habitual behavior, make a note of it. Often, habits have become so ingrained that we don’t even notice why we do them. Developing that awareness will help you pinpoint what is going on to prompt your habit.When you make your note, jot down what was going on at the time. For example, if you’re a nail-biter, note whenever you feel the impulse to bite your nails. Take a few notes about how you’re feeling, what has been going on during the day, where you are, and what you were thinking.

, Once you understand the situation that triggers your habit and the reward you receive for engaging in the undesirable behavior, you can make a plan that involves goals for behavior change and strategies for minimizing habit triggers.Studies show that having a clear, specific plan greatly increases your chances of success in breaking habit. It helps break down unwanted behaviors and also helps create new patterns of action.Plan to make mistakes. Do not make a plan that will be deemed a failure as a result of a single slip-up. Most people give in to the temptation of old habits at some point while trying to break them. If you accept this in advance, you will be less likely to let negative thinking defeat the whole enterprise of breaking the habit.You should include in your plan mechanisms for keeping yourself accountable, in the form of rewards for successes and feedback from others who support your goal of breaking the habit. You are more likely to succeed in your goal if you share it with others. More details on this are provided later in this article.

, In your mind, repeatedly practice breaking the habit by imagining scenarios in which you engage in desired behaviors rather than the bad habit.Imagine situations in which you would be tempted to engage in the undesired behavior and choose a better option. This helps reinforce positive behavior patterns.


For example, if your goal is to eat less junk food, imagining yourself in your kitchen preparing a healthy meal, and sitting down to eat it.Some people find it helpful to write down ""scripts"" of their desired behavior and read them every day., Increasing your mindfulness in daily life can help you become aware of your actions, rather than functioning on “autopilot.” Mindfulness focuses on being aware of what you are experiencing in the moment, and experiencing it without avoidance or judgment. With practice, mindfulness can become a healthy habit that can counteract the bad habits you want to avoid.Mindfulness trains your brain to respond to situations differently. It can actually “reprogram” the way you respond to situations and stressors.It can help give you time before you react to something, and decrease your tendency toward “automatic thoughts,” which arises in response to a situation.Be conscious of when you are tempted to give in to bad habits. What are the situations that lead to the undesired behavior? What are the sensations in your body or thoughts in your mind that promote the undesired behavior? Understanding them without judging yourself will help you resist the behavior.Don't suppress thoughts about the habit. If you try not think about something, ironically, you will start to see it everywhere and become overwhelmed.Trying not to think about smoking, for example, could result in you becoming hypersensitive to anything that reminds you of smoking. You are much better off to recognize your craving and the situations that promote it, and deal with these issues head-on.
Try mindfulness meditation. Taking a few minutes every day to become quiet and focus on your breathing will help you develop awareness of your body and your thoughts.

Yoga and Tai Chi also encourage meditation, and they’re good for your health.
Note when you feel the urge to perform your habit, but don’t judge those thoughts. You could try saying something like, “I’m feeling the urge to smoke right now” or “I really want to bite my fingernails at the moment.” Acknowledging your feelings will help you move past them without getting stuck on the thoughts.

, Research suggests that sometimes our environments can cue us to perform certain behaviors, even if we're actively trying to stop.Breaking a habit, then, is partially a matter of reducing situational triggers until you can develop new ways of dealing with them.Novel situations promote more use of the parts of your brain that are geared toward consciously making decisions, rather than slipping into automatic behavior patterns.A good way to avoid bad habits is to find a way to change your scenery and see if your bad habit becomes less tempting. For instance, if you like to smoke out on your patio, remove the chair you sit in and replace it with a plant. If you tend to overeat at the same location at the dining room table, move to a different seat or rearrange your furniture such that you're facing a different direction than usual when you eat. Subtle changes to the environment can make a habit less rote and force your mind to reassess what's happening.Forge relationships with people who support your desired behavior. You don't need to ditch your old friends entirely, but finding some new ones who live the way you want to can help minimize triggers.Go on vacation, if you can. One of the most effective ways to break old habits is put yourself in a completely new situation for a while, and develop new, healthier habits that you can then transplant into your normal life when you return., If you can create obstacles that make the habit more difficult or unpleasant to engage in than some other course of action, this can help you break the routines that have reinforced this habit in the past.Here are a few suggestions:


Tell supportive people about your plan to break your habit, and invite them to call you out on your slip-ups. This will create consequences for succumbing to temptation.Or, even better, find someone else who wants to break the same habit as you, and quit together, keeping each other accountable.Anything you can do to break up the sequence of events that normally leads to the undesirable behavior is also a good idea. For example, if you are trying to stop smoking, keep your cigarettes in another room. If you are trying to stop logging on to Facebook during working hours, disconnect the internet or use one of the available apps that blocks access to sites like this.Even though these obstacles can be easily overcome, they are sometimes enough to break up the behavior pattern that leads to the unwanted behavior.Create small ""punishments"" for lapses. For example, you can use the same rationale behind a swear jar: every time you slip back into the habit, put a dollar (or more) in a can or jar. Set an amount that you'll hate to cough up whenever you give into the urge, and stick to it. When you've successfully kicked the habit, spend the money on a reward or donate it to a charitable cause.
Or, if you are trying to stop overeating, add 10 minutes to your workout every time you overeat. A punishment related to the behavior will probably be most effective., Some habits, such as procrastinating, can be difficult to change because the solution seems so daunting. “Stop procrastinating” can seem such a big task that you wouldn’t be able to do it. Try splitting up your goals into small, achievable steps. You will get the “reward” of seeing success sooner, and your brain is less likely to resist your ultimate goal as “too big” to accomplish. Instead of saying “I’ll stop eating junk food,” say, “I’ll eat a healthy breakfast.” Instead of saying “I’ll go to the gym more often,” say, “I’ll go to yoga on Saturday mornings.” As you find success in those small steps, increase them to meet your ultimate goal.For example, instead of saying “I’ll stop procrastinating today,” set yourself a goal of “I will stay focused on my work for 30 minutes today.”
The highly popular “Pomodoro method” can help you. Use a timer and set yourself a block of time in which you will focus on your work without doing anything else. Make this block short, no longer than 45 minutes. It can be as short as 20. The goal is to set yourself a task that’s reasonable and achievable.After you’ve finished that block, take a little break! Do something fun, surf Facebook, check your texts. Then, set yourself another block.
This type of technique can “trick” your brain into setting new, good habits because you see immediate success (something your brain likes).

, Because habits are created when a behavior is rewarded in some way, a great way to create new habits is to reward yourself for good behavior.The most successful reward will be one that comes immediately after the desired behavior, and which is something you genuinely want or enjoy.
For example, if you are trying to break the habit of being late for work, you could reward yourself with a cup of gourmet coffee each day you arrive on time, until the reward is no longer needed., Try to replace your habit with something new and positive in your life. The key is to have a plan for an alternative action to take when tempted to engage in a bad habit. For instance, if you're trying to stop smoking, eat a sucker, do breathing exercises, or walk around the block when you would usually light up. Filling the void left by your old habit with another activity will help you avoid backsliding.
Try to make sure the alternative action isn't boring or unappealing. If you can make your new habit something you actually want to do, something you enjoy, or something that results in some obvious (and ideally immediate) positive outcome, it will be easier to make the switch., Behavioral conditioning is a long process, and breaking a habit takes time, so you have to stick with it. Be patient and kind with yourself.


Conventional wisdom and self-help books have suggested that it takes 28 days to break a habit. The reality is more complicated, as recent studies have suggested that how long the process takes depends on both the individual and the habit, and can range from as few as 18 days or as many as 245.Even though this process varies between individuals, it is probably safe to say that the first few days will be the hardest. Some neuroscientists suggest people go through a ""withdrawal"" period during the first two weeks, as our nervous systems struggle to deal a a change in the chemicals triggering the ""reward"" centers of our brains., Telling yourself you can't do something is a bad cognitive habit that will reinforce your belief that you can’t. Remember: being harsh on yourself for having a hard time or lapsing isn’t helpful to you, and it can make bad habits worse.If you notice that you’re criticizing yourself, remember that things that seem contradictory can coexist. For example, imagine that you want to break the habit of eating junk food, but you “gave in” and had a bag of chips with lunch. It could be easy to beat yourself up for this. However, being kind to yourself acknowledges your lapse and recognizes that this isn’t failure. You don’t have to continue giving in because you gave in once.
Try adding and to your statements and creating positive plans for the next time you face a challenge. For example: “I had that bag of chips with lunch. I’m upset with myself for that, and I can help myself by packing snacks to take to work so the vending machines don’t tempt me.”
You can also add the word ""but"" and follow it up with a positive statement, e.g. ""I totally screwed up, BUT everybody makes mistakes sometimes."""

Alert your friends and family to the telltale signs you’ve been watching too much cable news, such as becoming easily agitated, paranoid, not answering the phone, panicked and restless.Make a point to check in with your family and friends. Don’t wait for them to ask you how you are doing. Consider saying something like, “Hey, I wanted to check in with you to let you know how I’m doing with changing my news viewing habit.” This will provide a lead in for them to feel comfortable to ask questions.;
, Typically 30 minutes of news can provide you with ample coverage; any more than that and it gets repetitive.


Create a schedule of all your daily events. Include news reading, viewing or listening as a small portion of each day, and no more. Setting limitations and tracking your time on a daily schedule or planner will help you hold yourself accountable to your goal.
Apply the same rules to internet news. Give yourself a chance to break your news addiction by limiting your online news reading to set times of the day. If you see headlines, don't click to go there unless it's during your allotted time.

, If you watch more than your allotted amount of news put money into the jar. The money will be given to your friend or family member. Or, it could be donated to a non-profit organization that helps people with addiction.


This principle is similar to using a Cuss Jar when trying to stop a family member or yourself from cussing.Instead of cussing, the goal can be news watching.

, If you free up your time by reducing your news watching, there will be time to do it. If part of the problem is that you have too much time on your hands, try something new.Research indicates that if you have a hobby you will be healthier and less depressed.For example, take a class at the local community college, tackle a project you’ve had on your “to do” list for years or make a concerted effort to see friends and/or family members more often.

, Going cold turkey is one possibility, which is a successful technique for many people. Abstaining from seeking news will likely be challenging due to the constant influx of news that fills online, TV and radio channels.

Assess the level of your problem.,
Evaluate your mood after spending time watching news programs.,
Determine the underlying causes.,
Formulate a plan to build coping skills.,
Seek professional help.",How to Curb Your Addiction to News2," Determining how afflicted you are with an addiction to the news will help guide you in your journey of self-help and potential therapy. Ask yourself a series of questions and write down your answers. Once you see the list you have written, take time to think about the ways your life is limited by your behaviors. Introspection is the process of directly attempting to access your own internal processes. . When you figure out how and why you react the way you do, then you can solve many personal struggles. The level of your discomfort will inspire you to change your behaviors. Here are some questions you can ask yourself about your addiction to the news:


Have any of your relationships been negatively affected by your news watching behaviors? Ask those closest to you for their input as you may not be completely aware of how your actions impact others. This will show you that you news watching is not only harming you, but others as well.
Does the morning news define how you will act and feel for the day? Does your last news check-in of the day determine how you will sleep at nights? If you allow the news to define your day and affect your sleep, then you are being controlled by your addiction.
Do you rudely interrupt conversations to be able to hear a news item while you're out shopping, dining or spending time with others? Hurting other people’s feelings just to hear the news shows that you place news at a higher priority than others around you.
Do you believe 24 hour news stations matter more than any other stations on television? Would you forgo other things in life just to feed this habit? This outlook is limiting your perception of the world, and thus limits your experiences.
Do you feel deprived if you don't know what is currently happening in the world? Do you suffer from FOMO, Fear Of Missing Out? Recent studies indicate that if you suffer from FOMO you are likely feeling disconnected and dissatisfied with your life.Are you a person who fights to be the first to hear breaking news? The urgent need to stay on top of the news is a lot of pressure to be putting on yourself and it may be affecting your behaviors.

, Your feelings are a true indicator that you have let a news addiction dominate your life. If you feel stressed, anxiety-ridden and convinced that the world is out of control, you're overly reliant on news. If you are positive and upbeat one moment and then you become suddenly angry when you hear the news, this is a sign of addiction.Has your usual optimistic self been transformed into a pessimistic and joyless self who only sees the dangers, the panic, the fears and the terrible future ahead of you? Too much news will do that.
Are you unable to react rationally to stressful situations? Do you snap at family members or become agitated if someone dares to suggest that things aren't really as bad as you are making them out to be?
Have you started to become more paranoid or uneasy in public. Continuous exposure to an abundance of news can make even the most levelheaded individual feel paranoid or concerned that something terrible is about to happen.

, Real change does not occur without identifying the emotional underpinnings of your behavior. Are you struggling with anxiety, stress, or depression? You may be using the news to distract yourself. Unfortunately, it may be causing more harm than good. Most stories on the news are filled with tragedy, crisis and leave you feeling helpless.


Manage your anxiety, stress or depression in healthy ways that include relaxation techniques, physical exercise or yoga.When you are relaxed your muscles loosen, blood pressure and heart rate drop, and your breathing slows and deepens. Spend time relaxing rather than watching the news to avoid your emotions. Also, if you do watch a disturbing story you can use relaxation techniques to calm down.

, Following a problem solving model will give you structure for creating change. You have identified your addictive behaviors and now you must determine clear objectives, implement them, make adjustments as needed and monitor your progress.Determine clear objectives. One objective may be that you set a schedule and keep a log of how much time you spend watching the news. Self-monitoring leads to real change.Pick a start date for your plan and start. Don’t delay the inevitable. Start as soon as possible.
Recognize your growth and reward yourself. If you successfully meet your daily, weekly or monthly objectives, celebrate your accomplishments. Perhaps you could go to a movie, attend a sporting event or plant a tree in honor of someone you admire. Positive reinforcement will motivate you to continue with your plan.
If a strategy just isn’t working for you, then stop using it. Find an alternative and plug it into your plan. Don’t look at it as a failure; instead look at it as a correction in the course toward your goal.
Your new behaviors will build over time and become second nature to you. You can fade or lessen your strict adherence to the steps of your plan and maintain positive outcomes., If you have difficulty managing your addiction to the news, then seek counsel from a professional trained to deal with addiction. Contact you doctor or trusted friend or family member for a referral in your area.


Cognitive-behavioral therapy is one of many types of therapies that are effective with addictions, depression, and anxiety disorders.Group therapy is also effective when coupled with a problem solving approach.Groups may be focuses specifically on news addiction, or can be formed to help with social and coping skills.

Strengthen your support system.,
Be a good role model for others.,
Keep life in perspective.,
Lighten up your viewing choices.,
Expect ups and downs.",How to Curb Your Addiction to News3," Relationships must be nurtured to survive. Social support is essential for your physical and psychological health.If you’ve been handcuffed to the news for any period of time, your relationships have likely suffered. Reach out to others to build or repair your relationships. Until you are 100% confident with the changes you have made, you will need the support of others.


Engage in real and online social situations that expand your interests beyond news stories. For example, take a music lesson, volunteer for a project to help animals, or children in need. It will restore the idea that there is more to life than news.
Shared interests bring people together. Investigate and join a group that might interest you. There might be a comedy groups, or city recreation league that will provide the opportunity to meet new people.

, If you meet someone who you suspect is addicted to the news, refrain from talking about the news. Bring up different subjects to divert the conversation toward a more positive direction. You can always excuse yourself from a conversation if it becomes difficult or annoying.


Without being pushy or overbearing, share your experience with the person and offer to help him. You can suggest all the strategies that helped you manage your addiction to the news.
Teaching others what you have learned will give you a sense of accomplishment and internal reward far above what watching the news will provide.
Learning to overcome and manage an addiction to the news will increase your self-esteem., It is important to keep the information we hear in perspective. A lot of news narrows down the information to a specific, terrible situation. There are usually time constraints so they pack in as much death and destruction as possible. If you inundate yourself with this information, it will skew your perception of reality.


Pause and think clearly and you will realize the chances of the same disaster happening again or even at all, are minuscule. Influenza is a very good example of narrow reporting. A certain amount of people die, but in a country with 350 million people, 50 influenza deaths is a small amount. Don't assume there is a pandemic without good evidence.
When you're tempted to believe that things are getting worse because of the news, stop and ask yourself something like: Are they really? And why do I think that? Are those facts credible? Taking the time to question the fear-mongering news stories can break the cycle of being obsessed with them.

, Watch movies or TV shows that don’t involve the news or disasters. For example, you can watch shows about home improvement, or biographies of historical figures. Add some humor to your life to balance the negativity of watching the news. It can be healing.Periodically ask yourself if you have laughed very much in the last week or month. If you can't remember the last time you did, then find a way to get a good dose of laughter. Call a friend who makes you laugh, or go to a comedy club to support comedians. Once you feel the benefits of laughter you will make it part of your routine.

, Life is filled with things that challenge you, and also make you want to celebrate. Much of life happens between those two points. You are able to appreciate the celebratory moments because you know what it feels like to struggle. If you are feeling down you can feel confident that the good will eventually arrive.

Intervene as soon as possible.,
Be supportive.,
Seek professional help.,
Choose a positive way to confront your loved one.,
Indicate your intentions clearly.,
Stress the negative effects of drug abuse.,
Educate your loved one about the benefits of treatment.",How to Admit Someone to Rehab1," Intervention becomes more difficult as the addiction worsens. Do not put off helping your loved one. Make a well developed plan to intervene and carry it out as soon as feasible. The longer you wait the more harm may come to your loved one, depending on his specific circumstances and addiction severity.


If the situation becomes life threatening, you may be able to admit the person to a psychiatric hospital against his will. If you believe that your loved one is at serious risk of harming himself or others, discuss this with his therapist immediately or call your local emergency number (such as 911) in case of immediate danger.;
, Social support from friends and family is crucial to recovery from substance abuse.Tread carefully and learn how to appropriately support your loved one. The process of drug intervention requires you to address the person's lifestyle and problems, yet you must be careful not to make the other person feel that his freedom of choice is being threatened.


Don't criticize or judge. If you respect the other person you will get respect in return, which means that your opinion will become more valuable to him. For instance you can say something like, ""I know you have been struggling with this for a while and I just want you to know that I am here to help and support you in your recovery."" Avoid saying things like, ""I am so sick and tired of you being drunk and high.""
Help your loved one make the right decision, but do not force anything on him. This can damage the relationship and lead to less likelihood that he will receive treatment. You can say something like, ""I will support you in getting the treatment you need. Please let me know how I can help. I want what is best for you.""
Avoid arguments. You need to show support for your loved one's well-being rather than try to prove him wrong. Make the impression that you are a friend, not a foe. You can do this by being calm, avoiding aggression (such as raising your voice), and dealing with your own anger or sadness regarding your loved one's problem. If you find the situation is getting worse you can say something like, ""It seems like this is turning into and argument and I don't want to fight. Maybe we need a break from talking about this for a bit.""

, Professionals who specialize in drug intervention can help your chances of convincing the individual to go to a rehabilitation center.At times, the professional interventionist may not intervene directly but rather help you in doing so, especially if you are a close relative or friend of the person and he feels more comfortable talking to you. Some rehab centers have professional interventionists on staff that can help you with the intervention process.


If you are planning a group intervention, get professional assistance.Professionals (therapists, psychologists, etc) can help assist you in deciding what type of confrontation or treatment may be useful for your loved one. Contact your insurance and your loved one's if possible for treatment options.
If your loved one already has a therapist, you can ask your loved one politely if you can have permission to speak to his therapist. Keep in mind, you may have to sign a release in order to talk with the therapist. You can then explain your concerns and request assistance. Be wary that the therapist may not be able to perform the intervention herself due to boundary concerns.

, Choose an appropriate place for your discussion. Choose the meeting place wisely. Select a location where the person with addiction does not feel threatened or embarrassed. For example, it may be better to meet privately rather than in public places. At times, people with addictions can become withdrawn from the outside world, so go to the person's home if you can.


You may choose to confront your loved one alone or with a group of people, as in an intervention.Decide which approach you think will benefit your loved one most.

, Don't make your loved one feel like you are trying to trick him into going to a rehab center. Instead, you should be able to discuss this problem with the person with addiction openly and then direct the conversation towards a solution. Withdrawal from many types of drugs can be life-threatening. Going to a center where the withdrawal can be supervised can help alleviate the withdrawal symptoms. The centers are staffed so if anything happens during withdrawal, they can be there to assist.


Use “I statements” such as, “I feel sad knowing that you are struggling so badly with your addiction.” You can follow up by saying, “I would feel so much better knowing that you were getting treatment and being safe.”
If it helps, write down what you want to say beforehand so that you can practice being clear and indicating your concern.

, Emphasize the affect your loved one's problem has had on you, as well as family and friends. For example, try to help the person realize that addiction is not just a problem that is isolated to one person, but rather something that affects the whole family and society negatively. At times, a major convincing factor for seeking help can be love for others rather than for the self.


Depending on the type of drug used, you can educate your loved one about the consequences of using this drug. For example, if your loved one drinks alcohol to excess, you can explain that you are concerned for him due to the many health effects that drinking alcohol can cause such as memory issues, heart problems, digestive problems, bone damage, liver disease, eye problems, a weakened immune system and increased risk of cancer., One reason individuals may avoid treatment is due to stigma, or negative beliefs, about mental health and therapy services.You can help your loved one by addressing the myths and stigma about treatment.


Explain to your loved one that treatment is not meant to be seen as punishment. You can say, ""Treatment is about getting the help you need. I hope you don't see it as a punishment. I don't see it that way, but as a fresh start for you.""
You can educate your loved one that individuals who do not get treatment are at a much higher risk of relapse than those who receive therapy.You could say, ""You know, I read that research shows that getting treatment helps people stay sober and not relapse.""
Short-term treatment methods such as residential therapy and medication therapy often last less than 6 months. Hence, you may be able to present the addiction recovery treatment as just a short-term phase in the person's life that will have long-term benefits.

Once your loved one has agreed to go to a rehab center, you should be able to admit him there as soon as possible.


Help your loved one discuss the requirements of the rehab (rules, regulations), as well as schedules (therapy, exercise, leisure time, etc).
Ask about evidence-based practices. EBPs are therapy interventions that have research which shows they are helpful for a particular disorder., The longer you stay in a secure or supervised location, the more likely you may be to recover and maintain sobriety.However, this can be costly. Thus, it may be important to first make sure the person can fully afford rehabilitation treatment.You can help your loved once communicate with his medical insurance company about treatment options.

Prepare for withdrawal symptoms.,
Help your loved one reduce stress.,
Personally escort the person to the rehab center.,
Continue to be supportive.",How to Admit Someone to Rehab3," Different substances vary drastically in their withdrawal severity and symptoms.However, it is important to research and understand the effects of withdrawal associated with the substance that your loved one is trying to quit.

Some examples include: getting adequate sleep, taking bubble baths, meditating, and watching funny movies.

, Social support is especially crucial during the moments and days before being admitted into rehab; the person may show signs of second thoughts or resistance toward treatment. Make sure you or someone else helps the individual get himself ready for treatment and is there for him as he is admitted.Otherwise, you may have to repeat the whole process again, which can become more difficult if the first attempt has failed.


When times get hard, remind your loved one why he wants to attend rehab. Reasons may vary, but some examples include to: regain a sense of control, be able to be a productive member of society, reduce the negative health effects of substance us, increase positive choices, etc. You could say something like, ""Remember why you decided to go to rehab? You wanted to get your life back. I know it seems like it will be so hard, and I know it will be a challenge, but it will be worth it in the end.""
Explain that you will be supportive of the person while he is in treatment. You could say, ""If you need anything while you are here please let me know. I believe in you and I know you can do this if you put your mind to it.""

, Since social support is crucial to maintaining treatment and sobriety, you may want to continue to be supportive of your loved one while he is in treatment.Being there for your friend or family member can help him remain in treatment and be successful.


Visit the admitted individual frequently if allowed and show your love and support throughout the process. One way to show your support is by attending group or family treatments that are suggested by the treatment facility.
Try to motivate the person going through recovery by promising a gift that will be presented after the therapy is complete. This may give hope to the person and a positive attitude towards returning to normal life. You could say, ""Once you complete treatment we can go on a trip together. It will be great to experience a new place sober.""
Encourage your loved one to call you if he is having a difficult time in rehab. You can say, ""I am here for you so please don't hesitate to contact me if you want to talk or need help."" Some programs don't allow contact with family members for a length of time, check and see first if contact will be allowed and when.

To make a cup of green tea, place 1 teaspoon of dried tea leaves into a tea infuser or teabag, place the tea in a mug, and then pour a cup of boiling water over the tea. Let the tea steep for about 5-10 minutes, then remove the infuser or teabag., White willow bark contains the same active ingredient as aspirin and it may even provide the same pain relieving effects. Try drinking a cup of white willow bark tea to get some relief from kidney stone pain. Keep in mind that white willow bark tea may cause stomach irritation for some people. Do not give white willow bark tea to children under the age of 16.To make a cup of white willow bark tea, place 1 teaspoon of dried herbs into a tea infuser or teabag and place in a mug. Then, pour one cup of boiling water over the herbs. Steep the tea for 5-10 minutes, then take out the infuser or teabag.
Drink one cup and then wait for a few hours to see how the tea affects you.

"
Call your if you have serious or severe symptoms.,
Ask about prescription pain medications.,
Save the stone if you pass it.",How to Relieve Kidney Stone Pain2," In some situations, home remedies may not be enough to treat your kidney stone pain. In these situations, you will need to call your doctor right away. If you go to the emergency room, they will run urine tests and send you for an abdominal ultrasound or CT to determine if you have kidney stones. Call your doctor if you experience:severe pain around your abdomen, sides, groin, or genitals
bloody urine
a burning sensation when you urinate
nausea and/or vomiting
fever and chills
flank pain that radiates to your groin

, If home remedies do not provide enough pain relief, then you may want to ask your doctor about proscription pain relievers to help you cope with the pain of passing a kidney stone. Even if you are already on a prescription pain reliever, if you are still in pain, then let your doctor know. You may need a higher dosage or a more powerful medication., If you pass the kidney stone while you are at home, then you should save it and bring it to your doctor for analysis. Having your kidney stone analyzed will enable your doctor to determine what type of kidney stone it was and make recommendations about how to prevent another kidney stone in the future. There are many types of kidney stones, including calcium stones, uric acid stones, struvite stones, a cystine stones."

Wash your hands with soap and warm water.,
Empty the urinary catheter bag of urine for easier catheter removal.,
Get into a comfortable position for removing the catheter.,
Put gloves on and clean the drainage tubing.,
Identify the balloon port of your catheter.,
Deflate the catheter balloon.,
Remove the catheter.,
Inspect the catheter to make sure it's intact.,
Throw away the used catheter and urine bag.",How to Remove a Urinary Catheter1," Make sure you soap your hands and forearms well, and rub them together for at least 20 seconds. This is approximately the length of time it takes to sing the familiar song, ""Happy Birthday to You"" two times. Follow by rinsing well.You'll follow the same routine of washing when you finish removing the catheter.
Dry your hands well with a paper towel, and throw the towel away. This is a good opportunity to make sure that there's a trashcan nearby. You'll need the trashcan for disposing of your catheter.;
, Your bag may have a drain spout that you remove from its sleeve, a clamp that you open to the side, or an opening that you twist. Drain any urine in the bag into a toilet bowl. You may also use a measuring container if your medical provider is keeping track of your output.


When the bag is empty, close the clamp or twist the cap on the bag. This will prevent dripping.
If your urine is cloudy, foul-smelling, or if you notice any sign of red, contact your health care provider.

, You'll need to be uncovered from the waist down. The best position to be in when removing a catheter is to lie on your back with your legs spread and your knees bent, feet flat on the floor.


You can also lay in a butterfly position. Lie down and spread your knees apart while keep your feet together.
Lying on your back will also relax your urethra and bladder, making it easier to remove the catheter.

, It is important to wear gloves so that you lower your risk of getting any infection. Once the gloves are on, use an alcohol wipe to clean the connection spot where the drainage tube connects to the catheter. You should also clean around the catheter.If you are a man, use a saline (saltwater) solution to clean the urethral opening on the penis.
If you are a woman, use a saline solution to clean around the labia and urethral opening. Clean by starting at the urethra and then moving outward to avoid any spread of bacteria.

, The tubing of the catheter will have two ports. One port empties urine into the urinary bag. The other allows you to drain the small water-filled balloon that holds the catheter inside your bladder.


The balloon valve should have a colored valve on the end.
You may also see numbers printed on the balloon valve.

, The small balloon inside your bladder will need to be drained, or deflated, in order to remove the catheter. Your medical provider should have provided you with a small (10 ml) syringe. This syringe should fit precisely into the balloon port. Insert with a firm push-and-twist motion.


Slowly and carefully, pull the syringe away from the port. The vacuum effect will pull water from the balloon in the bladder.
Continue until the syringe is full. This should indicate that the balloon is empty, and ready for removal.
Do not pump any air or liquid back into the balloon as it could burst and injure your bladder.
Always make sure the amount of fluid withdrawn from the balloon port matches the amount of fluid infused prior to attempting removal. If you are unable to withdraw the appropriate amount of fluid seek professional assistance.

, If possible, clamp the catheter tube with artery forceps or a rubber band to keep any urine from flowing out of the catheter while you remove it. Then, gently pull the catheter out of the urethra. It should come out easily.If you feel any resistance, it means that there is most likely still water in the balloon. If this is the case, you will need to put a syringe back into the balloon port and take out any extra water like you did in the previous step.
Men may feel a stinging sensation as the balloon travels down the urethra. This is a normal experience, and not a cause for concern.

, If it seems to have broken or cracked, there may be pieces left inside. If this is the case, contact your medical provider immediately.If this is the case, do not throw the catheter away. Keep it for your medical provider to examine.
These syringes are not considered to be contaminated with biological waste because no bodily fluids are present in this line unless the balloon has burst. These syringes can be disposed of through normal means in a secure, hard plastic container with a lid.

, Once you have removed the catheter, place it into a plastic bag. Seal the bag, then put the sealed bag with your other household trash.Clean up the area where the catheter had been inserted with a saline solution. If there is any sign of pus or blood, contact your health care provider immediately.
Remove your gloves and wash your hands once you are done.
For a pain-relieving effect, you can apply some lidocaine jelly to the area around your urethra.

Check for signs of inflammation or infection.,
Keep track of the time when you go to the bathroom.,
Drink plenty of fluids.",How to Remove a Urinary Catheter2," Signs of infection include reddening, swelling, or pus around the area where catheter had been removed. Fever may also indicate the presence of infection.


Continue to flush the area with warm, salty water. Bathe and wash as usual. While you may have discontinued baths when your catheter was inserted, showers are fine. Now that you've removed the catheter, you can take baths as well.
Your urine should be clear or light yellow. Presence of light pink urine is also normal for the first 24 – 48 hours following catheter removal, as a slight amount of blood may have entered the urinary tract. Urine that is dark red in color is a sign of blood, and foul-smelling or cloudy urine may indicate infection. If either of these are present, contact your medical provider immediately.
You may experience a slight rash on the area where your catheter has been removed. Cotton underwear allows for freer airflow to the area which aids healing.

, After removing a catheter, it's important to keep track of your urination patterns. If you have not urinated within eight hours of removing your catheter, contact your health care provider.


It's normal for urination to become a little irregular once your catheter is removed. It's common to find yourself needing to urinate more frequently than normal.
You may experience a slight discomfort when urinating. If this persists beyond 24 – 48 hours following catheter removal, this may indicate infection.
You may also find that you have difficulty controlling your urine flow. This is not unusual. Keep track of incidents that concern you, and ask your medical provider about these incidents at your next visit.
Keep a urination diary to help your doctor determine whether or not any further steps are needed on the path to your recovery.

, Drinking six to eight cups per day of water will help aid recovery of your urinary tract. Drinking a lot of water can help to increase your urine volume while also flushing out any bacteria or microorganisms in your bladder and urethra.Avoid drinking caffeine as it may irritate the bladder.Limit your fluid intake after 6:00 pm. Drinking too much liquid in the evening may wake you up during the night.
Elevate your feet when seated, particularly in the evening.

Remove a catheter permanently after its use has come to an end.,
Change your catheter regularly if you need your catheter for a long period of time.,
Remove your catheter if you start having unwanted side effects.",How to Remove a Urinary Catheter3," Urinary catheters are inserted temporarily following many surgical procedures. Once you have recovered from the surgery, or the obstruction has been removed, you don’t need the catheter anymore.For example, if you have prostate surgery, you will generally receive a catheter that can be taken out 10 to 14 days after surgery.
Follow your medical provider's post-surgical guidelines and recommendations. These will be individualized to your health care situation.

, Your catheter will only need to be replaced if you cannot independently empty your bladder. People who get a catheter because they have a chronic illness or incontinence (a condition where you have a problem holding urine inside) that has been caused by an injury may need to have a catheter for a long period of time.


For example, if you suffered a spinal cord injury that has caused you to develop incontinence, you will need to have a catheter in place for a long period of time. Replace your catheter with a fresh one every 14 days or as directed by manufacturer or physician recommendations.

, Some people experience complications when they get a catheter. One of the most common negative side effects is developing a urinary tract infection. If you see any pus near your urethra, or have cloudy, bloody, or foul-smelling urine, you may have a urinary tract infection. Your catheter will have to be removed and you should talk to your doctor about treating your tract infection.


You may also notice a large amount of urine coming out from around the catheter. If you do notice this, remove the catheter. It is most likely defective.
If there is no urine draining into the catheter, there may be an obstruction in the device. If this is the case, it needs to be removed immediately and you should go to the doctor right away. Do not irrigate your catheter without first consulting a healthcare professional.

Take showers, not baths.,
Wear the right underwear.,
Urinate often.,
Get moving.,
Clean from front to back.,
Wash before and after having sex.,
Avoid feminine sprays and douches.,
Drink cranberry juice.,
Take herbal supplements.,
Avoid substances that irritate the bladder.Certain foods and drinks can put you at greater risk of getting or exacerbating a UTI.",How to Prevent Urinary Tract Infections," Especially for women, lying in a bathtub can make the urethra susceptible to infection, since it's easy for water and bath products to enter the body. Showering eliminates the problem and can go a long way toward preventing urinary tract infections.;
, Believe it or not, the underwear you choose can have a big impact on whether you get a UTI. Keep these factors in mind next time you go underwear shopping:


Silk or polyester underwear traps moisture and bacteria against the body, increasing your risk of getting an infection. Cotton is a more breathable fabric, allowing air to circulate and preventing bacterial growth.
Wearing thongs and other tight underwear can also cause a problem. Save these for special occasions and don't wear them for more than a few hours.
Avoid wearing tights and hosiery that aren't made with breathable fabric.

, Holding urine inside when you feel the urge to go increases the chances that bacteria present near your urethra could make its way inside. Urinating pushes bacteria from the area, reducing the chance of infection.


To flush the area often, drink plenty of water. Try to urinate once every hour or hour and a half.
If your urine is yellow, you should be drinking more water. Aim for eight glasses of water a day to keep your urinary tract flushed.

, Sitting for too long with your legs crossed, especially if you do it on a daily basis, can create the right environment for bacteria to breed. It's important to get up and walk around several times a day.


If you sit at a desk for work, make a point of taking walking breaks in the fresh air outside.
Long airplane rides might make it necessary to sit in one position for hours. When the seatbelt light turns off, get up and walk down the aisle a few times.

, After having a bowel movement or urinating it is very important to wipe from front to back, so you don't risk getting fecal matter in your urethra. This is a very common cause of urinary tract infections, so if you take this simple measure, you'll save yourself a lot of trouble.

, Sexual intercourse is another situation that leaves you more susceptible to getting bacteria in your urethra. Take the time to wash yourself with soap and water both before and after having sex to greatly reduce your risk of getting a UTI.


Ask your partner to wash before sex, too. Many UTIs are contracted when a person is touched with a partner's hands or other body parts that have not been washed with soap and water.
Urinating after sex also helps flush the bacteria that may be present near the urethra.
Avoid having sex with someone while he or she has a UTI. Men are especially at risk of getting an infection from a partner who already has one.
UTIs occur more frequently with a new sex partner. They should subside once you and your partner have been having intercourse for awhile. , These products contain chemicals and perfumes that can irritate the urethra and cause an infection. The body produces natural cleansers to keep the internal vaginal area clean, so using soap and water on the exterior body parts should be sufficient.Powders, especially scented powders, should also be avoided since they can irritate the urethra.
Use gentle, natural cleansers if you do decide to clean the internal part of your vagina.

, Studies show that regularly drinking cranberry juice prevents infections. UTIs are often caused by E. coli, and cranberry juice contains proanthocyanidins, which prevent E. coli from attaching to the bladder and urethra.Try drinking low-sugar cranberry juice, since it has a higher cranberry concentration.
Unfortunately, cranberry juice has not been shown to treat infections once they begin; it's strictly a preventative measure.

, There's no conclusive research to show that these supplements prevent UTIs, but they are reputed to help treat infections.


Goldenseal extract is taken to prevent all types of infections and is also said to be helpful in preventing UTIs.
Juniper oil increases urine volume, which aids in flushing bacteria away from the urethra.

,


Alcohol and caffeine can dehydrate you if they are consumed in large quantities. If you feel a UTI coming on, they can cause it to turn into a full infection.
Acidic foods and drinks like orange juice, and tomatoes can irritate your bladder. Avoid them altogether if you're particularly prone to getting urinary tract infections. Lemon Juice alkalizes the body and is a useful means of bringing your pH balance back into balance. Lemons are the only citrus fruits that assist in alkalization.

Recognize risk factors for kidney failure.Although some risk factors are outside of your control, such as ethnicity (there is a higher risk of kidney failure in African Americans, Mexicans, and Pima Indians), most risk factors are lifestyle-based and as such can be modified.,
Monitor your blood sugar levels regularly to take some stress off your kidneys.As a diabetic, you will have high blood sugar levels, and this can put a lot of stress on your kidneys.,
Lower your sugar and refined carbohydrate intake to keep your blood sugar at a healthy level.,
Keep your blood pressure low.,
Eat fats in moderation.,
Reduce the amount of salt you eat to decrease your blood pressure.Eating a lot of salt can cause you to have high blood pressure.,
Try to eat less protein to take some stress off your kidneys.,
Stop drinking and smoking.Both alcohol and tobacco are substances that can have very negative effects on your kidneys.,
Get plenty of exercise to keep your kidneys healthy.,
Visit your doctor for regular check-ups to keep track of your kidneys' health.",How to Prevent Kidney Failure As a Diabetic1," Lifestyle-related risk factors for worsening kidney disease include:


Smoking
High blood pressure that is left untreated
Chronically elevated blood sugar levels
A sedentary lifestyle
Being overweight or obese.;
, Depending on the type of diabetes you have, your doctor will recommend that you test your blood sugar levels one to three times a day. Your doctor will also give you a set target range that you should try to be at when you check your blood sugar levels to take some of the stress off your kidneys. This range will depend on your own personal health so talk to your doctor about the level you should be at. To learn how to check your blood sugar levels, click here.


If you have type 1 diabetes, you will most likely have to check your blood sugar levels three or more times a day.If you have type 2 diabetes, you will most likely have to check your blood sugar levels one or more times a day.Monitoring your blood sugar levels is key to helping you better control them, and to keep them in a range that will not worsen your chances of developing kidney failure down the road.
The most effective way to control blood sugars is through proper diet and exercise and then medications.

, When you are diabetic, you already have increase sugar levels. Because of this, eating a high-sugar diet or refined carbohydrates while being diabetic can speed up the process of kidney failure. Because of this, it is important to try to eat a low-sugar and low-glycemic index diet as much as possible. Cut back on or avoid the following::


White bread, white rice, packaged pancake and waffle mix, muffins, etc. are all refined carbohydrates (Note that whole grains consumed in moderation are much better for you to eat than refined carbohydrates, especially if you are diabetic.)
Soft drinks like soda and drink powders.
Candies, pies, cookies, and cakes.
Dried fruit.
Ice cream.
Jams, sauces, and salad dressings.

, Diabetics spend a lot of time focused on their blood sugars; however, perhaps surprisingly, it has been shown in medical trials that blood pressure is equally important to blood sugar levels in the prevention of worsening diabetic kidney disease.Ideally, you want to aim for a blood pressure below 140/90 (the top number being the ""systolic reading,"" and the bottom number being the ""diastolic reading"").
Speak to your doctor about how best to achieve that blood pressure goal if you are not within that range already (and note that there are always exceptions, so it is important to speak to your doctor before making any dramatic lifestyle or medication changes).

, While it was once believed that all fat is bad, we now know that fat is an essential part of our diet and certain types of fat should be consumed in moderation. Trans fats should be avoided altogether, but monounsaturated, polyunsaturated fats and some saturated fats are necessary for a healthy diet. Avocados, nuts, seeds, certain oils (olive, peanut, canola, corn, sunflower), and fatty fish, are all good sources of healthy fats.Eat lean meats sparingly.
Trans fats are found in fried foods, candy, and commercial baked goods like cookies, cakes, frozen pizza, pie crust, and crackers. Avoid using margarine and any foods with ""partially hydrogenated oils"" listed on the ingredients — these are trans fats., This is because salt constricts your blood vessels, making it harder for your body to circulate blood. Try to only eat a maximum of 4 grams of salt per day. High-salt foods that you should try to avoid or reduce your intake of include:Extra table salt on your food.
Too many sauces and salad dressings
Cured meat like bacon, jerky, and salami.
Cheeses like Roquefort, Parmesan, and Romano
Snacks like pretzels, chips and crackers
Fast food

, Protein can be difficult for your kidneys to process because it can contain a good deal of toxins that your kidneys have to work through. If you are concerned about your kidneys’ health, try to limit your protein intake so that they don’t have to work as hard. Try to limit the amount of protein you eat to 40 to 65 grams a day. Foods that have a lot of protein include:Beans; nuts and seeds (pumpkin, squash, watermelon seeds, almonds, pistachios); cooked lentils; oats; green peas
Tofu and soy products.
Meat like chicken and turkey breast, pork loin, and lean beef
Fish like cod, tuna, salmon
Cheese, particularly low-fat mozzarella, Swiss cheese, and whole parmesan
Eggs, yogurt, and milk
Note that it is important to keep some protein in your diet in order to have balanced nutrition; it is just about eating protein in moderation rather than in excess if you are worried about the health of your kidneys.
In fact, it is best to eat a plant-based (preferably vegetarian or vegan diet). You can obtain more than enough protein by consuming different types of vegetables, whole grains, and especially different beans, legumes, and nuts.

, Smoking can also cause you to have high blood pressure.

, To control your weight and keep your kidneys running properly, you should try to exercise for at least 30 minutes three to five times a week. Try to pick exercises that you really enjoy so that you are more motivated to stick to your exercise regimen.Try running, swimming, biking, hiking, rock climbing, or kick-boxing. Anything that gets your body moving and elevates your heart rate is a good thing.
Be sure to get clearance from your doctor before beginning any exercise program for the first time or after a long period of inactivity.

, Seeing your doctor regularly can help you stay on top of any illnesses that might develop because of your diabetes. In particular, ask your doctor to regularly check for signs of:


Hypertension (high blood pressure).
Diabetic kidney disease.
Kidney failure.

"
Reduce the amount of sugar in your blood with hypoglycemic medications.,
Lower your cholesterol with statin medications.,
Take an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor to lower your blood pressure.,
Take sulfonylurea medications to stimulate your insulin levels.,
Talk to your doctor about getting a prescription for a thiazolidinedione to lower your body’s insulin resistance.,
Talk to your doctor about preparing for dialysis if you already have chronic kidney failure.",How to Prevent Kidney Failure As a Diabetic2," Hypoglycemic drugs act by increasing the uptake (or absorption) of sugar from the blood.A commonly prescribed hypoglycemic medication is Metformin. The usual dosage is generally between 500 mg and 1 gram once or twice a day depending on your blood sugar levels.
Metformin is the most commonly prescribed medication in diabetic patients.

, When you reduce your cholesterol levels, you also reduce your chances of developing hypertension (high blood pressure) that can lead to kidney disease. If you already have high blood pressure, you are generally advised to keep your cholesterol levels under 4.0 mmol/l.


Doctors commonly prescribe a statin called atorvastatin. The dosage is normally 10 to 80 mg a day, depending on your cholesterol levels.
You can also use red rice yeast which contains the same active ingredient as statins.
Your doctor may also put you on other cholesterol medications like fish oil depending on your cholesterol numbers.

, This drug works by reducing a chemical called angiotensin that is found in the blood. Angiotensin makes the blood vessels in your kidneys constrict, which makes you develop high blood pressure. When you take angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, your blood vessels can relax, which lowers your blood pressure.A commonly prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor is lisinopril. The normal dose is between 5 and 20 mg a day depending on your blood pressure.
In addition to lowering blood pressure, this class of drugs (the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) also has a ""protective effect"" on the kidneys, so the benefits are multiple.

, These drugs stimulate your beta cells’ release of insulin from the pancreas. They also increase the number of insulin receptors and make your body’s insulin mediated glucose transportation more efficient.The most commonly used sulfonylureas include:


Chlorpromazine (an oral tablet given at 150 to 250 mg per day).
Tolazamide (Tolinase: an oral tablet given at 100 to 250 mg/day at weekly intervals).
Tolbutamide (Orinase: an oral tablet given at 250 mg to 2g per day).
Glyburide (Diabeta or Micronase: given orally at 1.25 to 20 mg per day).
Glipizide (Glucotrol: given orally at 5 mg per day).

, This type of medication is only active in the presence of insulin. It is generally prescribed when other medications have not worked to get your blood sugar levels to the level they need to be at.Rosiglitazone (Avandia) is an example of a thiazolidinedione generally given initially at 4 mg per day or may be divided every 12 hours.
These medications are only occasionally used and are not necessary for all diabetics.

, If you are already experiencing kidney failure, you can talk to your doctor about preparing for dialysis in the future, hopefully years from now. Dialysis involves diverting your blood to a special machine that helps to remove the waste products in your blood while preserving the salt and water to keep you functioning properly.

Have your doctor test for microalbuminuria.,
Understand the progression of kidney disease.,
Look out for signs of fluid retention.,
Take note if you experience a lack of appetite.,
Be aware of itchiness as one of the later symptoms of kidney failure.,
Talk to a doctor if you find that you are having trouble concentrating.,
Watch out for muscle cramps, nausea and vomiting caused by an electrolyte imbalance.,
Check to see if your abdomen is swollen.",How to Prevent Kidney Failure As a Diabetic3," One of the earliest signs of kidney issues is microalbuminuria, which is the presence of protein and albumin in your urine. Often diabetic patients with kidney damage show no overt symptoms, and no changes to their urinary patterns or frequency. Therefore, it is important to request specific tests such as this one from your doctor, as it is the easiest way to detect and damage to the kidneys in the early stages.Protein in your urine (as detected on the microalbuminuria test) is usually a red flag that your kidneys are not in optimal health, and that it is time to begin steps to prevent any further damage.
This test is recommended to have once a year. If you have type 1 diabetes, testing should begin five years after diagnosis. If you have type 2 diabetes, testing should begin annually starting at the time of diagnosis., What starts as small amounts of protein in your urine (called ""diabetic nephropathy"" by medical doctors), if left untreated eventually progresses to chronic kidney disease and ultimately to kidney failure.This is why showing up for regular testing, and then following your doctor's advice for lifestyle modifications and medical treatment, is key to delaying or altogether preventing the development of long-term kidney disease and kidney failure.

, Your body will begin to retain fluid because when your kidneys start to fail, they become less able to remove excess water from your body. When this occurs, you will experience swelling around your ankles and feet because your body is holding on to fluid.One of the main signs of fluid retention is the skin around your eyes becoming puffy.

, When your kidneys stop working, they have a harder time processing toxins that they can normally deal with. This will cause these toxins to accumulate in your body, which will keep your body from functioning normally. One of the first things that will be affected by this toxin accumulation is your appetite.

, Your kidneys process all of the good and bad stuff that you put into your body. When they stop working properly, waste will build up in your body. This waste buildup can actually cause your skin to become irritated, which will result in your feeling itchy.

, When your kidneys stop processing waste, toxins can build up throughout your body. This means that toxins can also accumulate in your brain, making it harder for you to function properly. This can result in you having a hard time concentrating on anything for a long period of time., Muscle cramps, nausea, and vomiting can occur because of an imbalance of electrolytes in your body. Electrolytes are ions that are found in the body that help to maintain the normal functioning of the body. When you don’t have enough electrolytes, your muscles can cramp up. At the same time, you may begin to feel nauseous, which may cause you to vomit.The most common electrolytes include sodium, potassium, phosphorus, and calcium.

, Ascites is the medical term for a swollen abdomen caused by an accumulation of fluid. When your body accumulates fluids because your kidneys are not working properly, your abdomen will more than likely swell up."

Learn to travel smartly.",How to Stay Active when You Have an Overactive Bladder1," You may feel like limiting your fluids is the obvious solution. However, staying hydrated is vital. Remember, you may want to limit your intake so you are not drinking too much.When you drink, limit the drink to between six to eight ounces. Drink every hour or two.
Monitor the color of your urine. If it is light yellow or almost colorless, you are properly hydrated. It if it a darker color, you need to drink more.;

, Breathable clothing helps with airflow and can keep bacteria from breeding. Avoid nylon or heavily synthetic materials., Doctors recommend cotton underwear to help airflow. There are controversial reports that suggest that thongs may cause UTIs.Good cuts of underwear include loose boxers for men and briefs, boyshorts, or hipsters for women.You should always clean underwear and change them daily. Bacteria can build up in there. Further, change sanitary napkins frequently if you have your period.
You may want to try sleeping without underwear on, which will allow air to help keep things dry.

Know when to see a doctor.",How to Pee in a Bottle," If you experience frequent urination, or worry about certain situations in which urgent urination may be an issue, you may want to invest in a hospital bottle. These devices are built with an angled opening to make it easier to urinate in without spilling. They are also very large and can usually accommodate multiple urinations.Hospital bottles are available online or through licensed medical providers. They can usually be purchased for a relatively low cost.;
, In choosing a bottle, it's important to select a bottle that is an appropriate size. While it's impossible to accurately predict precisely how much urine you will excrete, you can ensure that your bottle is large enough to contain an average person's urine volume. Every person's body is different, but urine volumes generally range between 120 ml and 465 ml, or approximately four to 16 fluid ounces.Choose a bottle that can hold at least 465 ml, or approximately 16 ounces.If the bottle is bigger than that, it shouldn't be a problem. Remember: it's better for a bottle to be too big than too small.
The average soda bottle size is 12 fluid ounces, or approximately 355 ml. Larger soda bottles come in 1.75 liter sizes (1750 ml, or approximately 59 fluid ounces), but remember that a soda bottle of any size will have a very narrow opening.Sports drink bottles like Gatorade and Powerade tend to have a wider mouth. For example, Gatorade offers a 20 fluid ounce (approximately 591 ml) bottle designed to have a wide mouth opening. Because of this, many people prefer using sports drinks bottles to urinate into., Whether you're alone in a car or tent, or have others with you, it's important to mark your designated pee bottle to avoid any potential confusion.You can keep it simple by drawing a big ""X"" on the bottle in permanent marker, or be more explicit in your message (like ""Do not drink,"" for example).

, Female urination devices, or FUDs, are essentially small funnels built for women to urinate standing up or into a bottle. There are many brands of FUDs, including GoGirl and Freshette, which can be used by women who need to urinate but can't find a toilet.To use an FUD, simply hold the funnel under your vagina, relatively close to your body. Urinate into the device, and angle the narrow end into the mouth of a bottle.You can find an FUD online or at many retail stores, including outdoor gear stores.

, In addition to the actual bottle, you'll need to bring adequate cleanup supplies. If you're a woman, this will mean bringing toilet paper or tissues to wipe up with. You'll also need soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, regardless of gender., If at all possible, retreat to a secluded location. If you are in a car, being seen by others shouldn't be a problem. If you're at a crowded event, like a sports match or a parade, and cannot get to a restroom, urinating in a bottle will be a little more difficult. You want to avoid being seen, as it is both embarrassing and illegal to expose yourself to others.


Find a place where you can be alone and won't be seen by anyone else. This may mean stepping into a stairwell or hiding behind a building, depending on where you are.
Use your best judgment and be discreet. Do not call attention to yourself, and again, make sure no one will see you.

, If you're using a hospital bottle, the actual act of urinating will be fairly easy. The bottle has an angled top to prevent spilling and splash-back. However, if you're using an empty drink bottle, you'll need to angle the bottle to ensure it doesn't spill or overflow. Simply tilt the bottle at an angle to your body so that your urine flows against the bottom of the bottle, ideally at the downward-angled part of the bottle's bottom.If you're a woman, you'll need to wipe up afterwards. This will require having toilet paper on hand. Be sure to wipe front to back in order to avoid a potential urinary tract infection, which can happen if bacteria from the rectal area is introduced into the bladder-opening area., Once you've finished relieving yourself, you'll need to properly dispose of the bottle. It is illegal to dispose of human waste on the side of the road because of the serious health and sanitation hazards that roadside workers and landscapers face. In fact, in some states, there is an enhanced litter charge for anything deemed ""dangerous litter."" For example, in Wyoming (and numerous other states across the U.S.), getting caught disposing of urine on the side of the road can result in a nine month jail sentence.Be sure the cap is securely tightened on the mouth of the bottle. This will ensure that the bottle will not spill if tipped or dropped.
Store the bottle in a secure location on your person or in your car.
When you reach a trashcan or restroom facility, you can either throw the bottle in the trash, or pour the urine into a toilet.

, After urinating, it's important to wash your hands. If you are able to access running water and have soap on hand, lather the soap between your hands and rinse them under running water for approximately 20 seconds. This will help prevent the spread of germs and reduce the chances of getting yourself or others sick.If you cannot access running water, which may be the case since you could not access a toilet, you should still clean your hands with antibacterial hand sanitizer or hand wipes. These alcohol-based products kill bacteria on your hands, helping to prevent the spread of germs.To use hand sanitizer, simply squirt out enough of the product to adequately cover your hands and rub both hands together, covering all fingers and hand surfaces until the product dries., If you're prone to frequent urination, or if you know you will be in a situation in which you won't have access to a restroom, you may want to avoid drinking fluids before and during that situation. For example, if you're going to be on a long car trip, limit your fluid intake for one or two hours before you depart, and restrict how much you drink during the trip.Do not deprive yourself completely. If you are thirsty, you should absolutely drink some water to prevent dehydration. Just try to limit how much you drink to avoid emergencies.Avoid diuretics like coffee, tea, cola, and other caffeinated beverages. Diuretics increase the frequency and urgency of urination, which may create an emergency situation when restrooms are not available., Over time, going to the bathroom when you don't really have to go will make your bladder accustomed to feeling the urge without having a full bladder. As part of a long-term bathroom habit, it's best to hold off on urinating until you actually need to.However, if you're embarking on a road trip or visiting a place with poor restroom access, you may want to consider urinating whenever the opportunity presents itself.Plan bathroom breaks into every trip or outing. Try to anticipate where you will and won't be able to access a restroom, and plan accordingly.Don't rush. Allow yourself to complete your urination, or you may find yourself feeling the urge later on.It's also best to allow urine to flow at a natural pace, rather than squeezing pelvis to force it out faster., Most urinary urges most likely stem from simply drinking too many fluids or ingesting too much of a diuretic. Other urinary urges stem from abdominal pressure from factors like pregnancy or being overweight.However, some urinary urges may be caused by an underlying medical problem. Talk to your doctor if you experience any of the following symptoms:

Fasting blood sugar in a regular individual is 70 to 110. Your doctor may tell you which range you need to keep More likely he may tell you to stay in the 130s; the goal in general is to maintain the normal range of a non diabetic individual.


There is an issue to be concerned about if you are a candidate whose blood sugar can drop very low in the morning. Your doctor may tell you to keep the fasting blood sugar little higher in those cases.;
, If you are on insulin titrate insulin, be diligent especially with lantus at bedtime and the humulin or humalog insulin premeals based on your blood sugar.

,, A healthy diet is very close to diabetic diet. You must have protein, carbohydrate and fats in proportions in each meals, You can include dark green vegetable along with fruits also in your diet. Proportion is the key in diabetic diet.

, Personal hygiene is the most important aspect in prevention.

, Emptying the bladder fully each time when you void is very crucial aspect. You should void immediately after each sexual encounter.

, Hydration also may help to flush the urinary system.

, If infection is noted you should visit the doctor for antibiotic treatments.


Sometimes, the doctor may prescribe preventive antibiotics after treating the current infections, especially if it's occurring frequently.
Routine visits to the endocrinologist or internist for diabetes management and checking of hemoglobin a1 C is also helpful in blood sugar control, which may help to reduce the chance for infections in general, including urinary tract infections.

, Foul smelling urine, pain while urinating, frequent urination, fever, lethargy are few signs and symptoms. If you have lower back pain it can be pyelonephritis which is little more serious than regular urinary tract infections. Lower back pain can be from other causes too like kidney stones.

Use the bathroom often.,
Treat any unresolved constipation.,
Eliminate foods and drinks that cause bladder irritation.,
Reduce fluid intake.,
Quit smoking.,
Get more exercise.,
Balance your diet.,
Strengthen your pelvic floor muscles.,
Use tricks to reduce the amount of leakage.,
Manage your blood sugar.",How to Not Pee Your Pants when Laughing1," Trying to hold off on using the bathroom will lead to many more instances of leaks. Use the bathroom whenever you first feel the urge to go.Also, make sure you use the bathroom whenever you can if you’re going long distances between stops.;
, Constipation contributes to stress incontinence by increasing abdominal pressure and stimulating nerves near the rectum that increase urinary frequency.You can take simple steps at home to treat constipation, including:Eating more high-fiber fruits, vegetables, and grains
Staying hydrated
Staying physically active
You can find more specific information at How to Regulate Bowel Movements


, A variety of foods and drinks can irritate your bladder or act as a diuretic (which means it makes you have to urinate more often).You may react to some but not all of these options. Try to isolate them in your diet to find out the ones that increase your stress incontinence. Some common options that increase stress incontinence include:Caffeine
Carbonated beverages
Citrus
Chocolate
Alcohol
Spicy foods

, If you still have occurrences after eliminating bladder-irritating beverages, then try to reduce your overall fluid intake;however, do not risk dehydrating yourself. Only reduce the amount of fluid you drink if you already drink more than the suggested eight to ten glasses of water a day.


Reduce the amount of liquid that you are drinking after 4:00 if you are having problems in the evening and at night.

, In addition to a wide array or other health complications, smoking can also irritate your bladder, leading to overactive symptoms and increased incidence of stress incontinence. Many smokers also develop a chronic cough, which can cause more instances of leakage.Trying to stop smoking cold turkey rarely works for most smokers. Take advantage of available smoking cessation aids such as nicotine patches and gum, as well as support communities to taper off your tobacco addiction.
You can find more information related to smoking cessation at How to Quit Smoking.

, Carrying extra weight can place increased pressure on your bladder and pelvic floor muscles.Professionals consider a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher overweight (with 30 meaning obese).Even the moderate loss of some excess weight can lead to dramatic improvement with symptoms.A great exercise routine for shedding extra pounds includes thirty minutes of moderate aerobic activity (such as brisk walking or cycling) five times a week. If you prefer high-intensity workouts (such as playing sports), then aim for seventy-five minutes a week.Note that weight training is not as effective at burning calories as aerobic exercise. In fact, chronic heavy lifting can increase stress incontinence by reducing the strength of your pelvic floor.Learn more about calculating your BMI at How to Calculate Your Body Mass Index (BMI).
Some doctors suggest that you wear a tampon if you are having stress incontinence symptoms when you do exercise like running, as this increases support in the vagina.Remember not to leave you tampon in order to prevent toxic shock syndrome.

, Eating right is just as important to losing extra weight as exercise. Cut out processed foods, sugary foods and beverages, and sources high in saturated fat. Instead opt for a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean meats (fish and skinless chicken), and whole grains. Consult your doctor about the most effective changes you can make to your diet.

, Weakened pelvic floor muscles (often from childbirth) are a leading cause of stress incontinence. Up to 75 percent of women with the condition have success with Kegel exercises to strengthen these muscles (though both men and women can do them).YHave patience because it can take weeks or even months to show results.To perform Kegel exercises, isolate the muscles by intentionally stopping the flow of urine next time you go.Once you know what using those muscles feels like, hold them tight for an eight count before relaxing them while counting to ten. Do ten repetitions three times daily.You can also start with a lower count and increase it over time.
You can also try vaginal weights, which are cone-shaped weights that you insert into your vagina like a tampon and help to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles. You will start with a low weight, holding it for one minute twice a day. Once you can hold that weight for 15 minutes, you move up to the next heaviest weight.Yoga has also been shown to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles. Postures like fish, pike, or crow work in the very same way as Kegel exercises., These steps take time. While you’re waiting for results, you can take other steps to reduce the appearance and amount of leakage you experience. You should:


Cross your legs when you start laughing or feel a cough or sneeze coming on, which will help support your bladder and reduce pressure.
Line your underwear with a stress incontinence product. These pads will stop any staining on your clothing and reduce odor.
Tighten your Kegel muscles and buttocks when sitting to reduce other unintentional leakage.

, If you’re diabetic, then changes in blood sugar can lead to increased incidence of stress incontinence.Monitor your blood sugar regularly and keep it under control by staying physically active and watching your diet."

Recognize when to see your doctor.,
Submit to any diagnostic testing.,
Ask about medication options.,
Consult your physician about surgical options.",How to Not Pee Your Pants when Laughing2," If your symptoms don’t improve from steps at home or if the leakage begins interfering with your activities of daily life, then make an appointment with your doctor.Your doctor will have a variety of steps available based on the severity and other specifics of your case, including both medications and surgical intervention in severe instances.


Give your doctor a complete picture of your medical history and tell him what steps you’ve already tried.

, Your doctor will perform a physical examination of your abdomen and genitals, likely asking you to clench several muscles in the process. She may also want to run other diagnostic tests, which may include:Urine sample testing for infection, the presence of blood, or abnormalities that would increase the sensitivity or irritability of your bladder
A neurological examination to identify any nerve damage in the pelvis
A urinary stress test, during which the doctor will observe for urine loss while you cough or bear down
Bladder function testing, which will measure the amount of urine left in the bladder after urination and pressure inside the bladder

, Your doctor will likely encourage you to continue with home treatment steps (possibly even augmenting your routine). He may also recommend a medication to help reduce your stress incontinence. Medications that can help with mild to moderate cases include:Anticholinergic medicines—oxybutynin (Oxytrol, Ditropan), tolterodine (Detrol), and trospium (Sanctura)—to help relax the bladder muscles and reduce contractions and leakage
Antimuscarinic drugs—atropine, solifenacin—to stop bladder contractions (may increase the amount of urine left in the bladder after emptying)
Imipramine—a tricyclic antidepressant—that relaxes the bladder muscles to help with full evacuation
Estrogen creams and vaginal tablets or rings that can help women who have gone through menopause to increase the strength of the pelvic floor muscles

, When all other options have failed to relieve your stress incontinence symptoms, your doctor may suggest surgical options as a last resort. Your doctor will base the recommendation of a specific procedure on your sex and other criteria. Options include:Anterior vaginal repair, which restores vaginal walls strength when bladder prolapse is involved (the bladder bulging into the vagina).
Artificial urinary sphincter, which is a device used mainly in men to stop urine leakage.
Collagen injections, which thicken the area around the urethra to reduce leakage. This option can require multiple procedures.
Retropubic suspension, which is a procedure that lifts the bladder and urethra to reduce strain and pressure.
Vaginal sling procedures, which support the urethra with the use of a sling to reduce strain and pressure.

Drink lots of water.,
Use pain relievers.,
Take prescribed medications.,
See a urologist for treatment of large stones.,
Learn the cause of your kidney stone.",How to Pass a Kidney Stone Fast1," One thing you can do to help with your kidney stones is drink large amounts of water. This treatment method has not been proven effective, but increasing your fluid intake has other positive benefits as well.Try to drink way more water than you usually do a day, even if you drink the recommended amount. The recommended amount while you have kidney stones is two to three quarts (1.9 to 2.8 liters) a water a day. Have water on you at all times and continuously drink it. The more water you drink, the more diluted your urine will become.


This may help dissolve the salts in the kidney stone, which may help you pass the stone.
This may also help prevent a urinary tract infection, which is common with kidney stones.
Don't make yourself sick by drinking too much water at one time.;
, The most common symptom of kidney stones is pain. To help with this, you can take over the counter pain relievers, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen (Tylenol), in small doses. NSAIDs include naproxen (Aleve), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and aspirin. NSAIDs seem to cause fewer adverse reactions than opioid pain relievers, so you might consider trying these before asking your doctor for a prescription pain reliever.Always follow the dosing and instructions on the label. The standard dosage for ibuprofen is 400 to 800 mg every six hours. Standard dosage for acetaminophen is 1000 mg every six hours. Standard dosage for Aleve is 220 to 440 mg every 12 hours. Use one of these medications as needed for moderate to severe pain.
Be aware that two NSAIDS should never be taken together because this can reduce your kidney function.
Your doctor may also prescribe you strong pain medication, such as opioids,or prescription antispasmodic medications, such as tamsulosin (Flomax), alfuzosin, nifedipine, doxazosin, and terazosin. , In some cases, your doctor may prescribe you a water pill (diuretic). These will help break down deposits in your urine, which will help you pass your kidney stone even faster. This is most common when the composition of your kidney stones is calcium based. In this case, thiazide can help to reduce calcium levels in your urine. Increasing your body’s magnesium levels may also be helpful as a long term therapy to decrease oxalate kidney stone formation.Your doctor may also give you potassium citrate.These pills bind to calcium to prevent it from being excreted in your urine. This helps to prevent excess calcium from accumulating in your kidneys, thus avoiding formation of calcium kidney stones.
Your doctor may also give you an alpha blocker to help relax the muscles in your urinary tract, which will make it easier and less painful to pass them.If your kidney stone is caused by infection, it may be necessary for you to take antibiotics as well., In some cases, the kidney stone may be too large to break up on its own, or it may be blocking your urinary tract.Your doctor will refer you to a urologist, who may use one of the following methods to break up the stone:



Shock wave lithotripsy: The doctor will use a special machine that delivers shockwaves to the stone, causing it to break up and allowing you to pass it through your urine. This is a non-surgical procedure, and the most common treatment.Percutaneous nephrolithotomy: The urologist will make an incision in your back and use a fiberoptic camera to locate the stone and remove it.This surgery is performed under general anesthesia and you may need to stay in the hospital for a few days.

Ureteroscopy: The urologist will use a miniature camera, this time inserted through your urethra. Once the stone is located, the urologist will use a laser to break it up.Ureteral stents: A stent is a hollow tube that may be used to allow drainage around a large stone or support healing after surgery. It is temporarily inserted in the ureter — if left in too long, stones can form on the stent itself., Once the stone is broken up, your doctor may ask you to urinate through a sieve so the kidney stone can be filtered out of your urine. You will collect the bits of stone and give them to your doctor so she can determine the cause of your kidney stone.Your doctor may want to measure your urine output for 24 hours after you pass the stone. This way she can see how much urine you produce in a day — you may be more likely to develop stones if you don't produce enough urine.If your doctor determines you have calcium oxalate stones, she will suggest dietary changes to prevent future stones. You will need to reduce your sodium intake, as well as animal protein, and make sure you are getting adequate calcium. In addition you will have to be conscious of not eating foods high in oxalate. These foods include spinach, rhubarb, nuts, and wheat bran.If your stones are calcium phosphate stones, you will need to reduce sodium and animal protein. You will need to focus on calcium-rich foods.To prevent uric acid stones, you will simply need to cut back on animal proteins.Struvite stones can form when you have an infection, such as a urinary tract infection.Cystine stones are caused by a hereditary disorder called cystinuria. This disorder causes kidneys to release too much cystinuria, an amino acid.If you have cystinuria, you will need to increase your fluid intake to prevent future stones from forming.

Know how the bladder works.,
Learn about bladder control.,
Be aware of the causes of incontinence.,
Disregard the myths about incontinence.",How to Manage Urinary Incontinence in Children1," The bladder is a bodily organ that is essentially a muscular storage sack for urine. Normally, the bladder muscle sack can stay relaxed and expand to accept urine for several hours.The muscle that forms the bladder sack is called the detrusor muscle, which is also responsible for bladder emptying. The other main muscles of the bladder are called the sphincters, which are two rings of muscle surrounding the bladder outlet through which it empties.


One sphincter is involuntary (you aren’t aware of it) and the other is usually under our control, making it our voluntary sphincter. The latter is the muscle you can use to hold the urine back until you go to the bathroom.;
, There are nerves in your body that provides you with the sensation of bladder fullness. This is the early warning system that the bladder is ready to empty. When you urinate, the nerves to the detrusor muscle signal it to contract or squeeze, while at the same time, the nerves to the involuntary sphincter make it relax.


When you release your voluntary sphincter, you allow yourself to urinate.By around age two, most children become aware that the sensation that they feel “down there” is the need for the bladder to empty. This allows them to express the need to go to the bathroom.
About a year later, they develop the ability to “hold it” until they have a chance to go to the bathroom., There are issues that can cause problems when a child is learning how to “hold it”. While most kids develop the ability to hold their urine and go to the bathroom when they have the opportunity to do so, problems can arise that can mess up a child’s ability to control her bladder. These issues that are related to childhood incontinence can include:A bladder that is unable to store the usual amount of urine.
Weakness of the detrusor muscles or sphincter.
Structural abnormalities of the urinary tract.
The body producing larger amounts of urine than is normal.
Bladder irritation from infections, such as urinary tract infections, or other bladder irritants.
The bladder receiving unexpected and premature nerve signals to empty.
Something in the area of the bladder keeping it from filling completely, such as other excrement caused by constipation.
Excessive postponement of urination, or holding it for too long.
Chronic constipation.

, If your child has been dealing with incontinence for an extended period of time, chances are she is dealing with more of an issue that simply being too lazy to get to the bathroom. A lot of parents tend to think that daytime incontinence is a display of laziness, but it is important to keep in mind that something else might be causing your child to have accidents. Common thoughts that parents have that should probably be ruled out if your child has been dealing with incontinence for awhile. In these situations, you should know that:Children who wet themselves are not just too lazy to go to the bathroom.
Children who wet themselves are not too busy playing or watching TV.
Children who wet themselves want to go to the bathroom and do not willfully wet themselves.
Children who wet themselves do not choose to wait until the last minute.
Wetting themselves does bother them.

Recognize the pain of kidney stones.,
Notice severe symptoms.,
Know the risks.,
Diagnose kidney stones.",How to Pass a Kidney Stone Fast3," Kidney stones are generally very small and can occur without any symptoms. The symptoms start when the stone gets large enough to block the kidneys, block the ureter (tube leading from the kidneys), or if they have caused an infection. The main symptoms is pain, which is generally:Severe but usually intermittent
Sharp or stabbing
Localized in your back, usually along the edges of your back, in your lower abdomen, or in your groin. The pain placement will depend on where the stone is sitting in your urinary tract.

, Although pain is the most common and consistent symptom, there are other symptoms that you may experience with kidney stones. This will depend on how large the stone is and how it is affecting you. If you experience any of the following, contact your doctor immediately:Nausea
Vomiting
Sweating
Bloody, cloudy, or foul-smelling urine
Fever
Pain while urinating
Extreme pain in your back or lower abdomen that won't go away

, Kidney stones are a very common condition that can affect anyone at any time. This condition affects around 5% of the population at some point in their lifetime, though this number is on the rise. You are most at risk for kidney stones if you are a white male between the ages of 40 and 70 and white women from age 50 to 70.


Despite this high risk, the number of cases of kidney stones in young adult patients has doubled in the last 25 years. Though no clear cause has been discovered, researchers believe this has been caused by obesity, weight issues, or the increase in the consumption of soft drinks.Other risk factors include history of kidney stones in your family, your diet, some medications, taking more than 2 g of vitamin C a day, history of kidney disease, and your ethnic background. White males are three times more likely to get kidney stones than African-American men. , Once you go to the doctor, she will ask you for a history of your symptoms, check you for current symptoms, and take a urine sample. This sample will undergo laboratory analysis to check the levels of minerals and other substances in your urine. Before proceeding with treatment, your doctor will need to confirm that you are suffering from kidney stones and not something else.


Your doctor may also order some imaging techniques, such as x-rays, CT scans, or MRI scans.

Look for signs of an overactive bladder.,
Look out for a cause for the ""sudden-urge-to-urinate"" phase.,
Be aware of overfilling.,
Notice if your child is holding it for too long.,
Consider behavior modification therapy.,
Create a schedule.,
Use an alarm system.,
Extend the voiding time.",How to Manage Urinary Incontinence in Children2," There are some common signs that your child has an overactive bladder. Signs that your child might have an incontinence problem related to under filling include:Your child dashes to the bathroom, crosses her legs, and wiggles or drops to the floor, sitting hard on her heel.
If asked, your child will often admit that she releases a little urine on the way to the bathroom.
Many children also will admit that, sometimes, they run to the bathroom but only void a small amount of urine, even though they felt like they really needed to go. , Some kids, while they are growing up, go through a phase where they suddenly, without warning, need to go to the bathroom really badly. This underdeveloped control, which presents itself as urge incontinence, often resolves with time as the child matures. However, this can also be the symptoms of a functionally small bladder or an overactive bladder.


There are some medications that can actually increase a bladder’s holding capacity. You should talk to a doctor about the options for dealing with a small or overactive bladder., There is a filling condition, called overfilling, that can also lead to incontinence. Overfilling is a less common condition that occurs when the bladder won’t or can’t empty and has an usually large capacity. Symptoms of an abnormally large capacity bladder include:Voiding large volumes of urine frequently during the day. This can happen if the kidneys produce enormous volumes of urine. You should take your child to a doctor if you notice your child voiding a large amount of urine every time she goes to the bathroom, especially if there is a change in the amount from usual.
Infrequent voiding, which is considered less than two or three times a day. This can be a sign of a spinal nerve problem, such as spina bifida or cerebral palsy. If your child has not been diagnosed with a spinal nerve problem, it is unlikely that this is the cause of your child’s incontinence.

, Sometimes, if your child gets in the habit of holding his urine too long, it can result in over filling of the bladder. Your child’s bladder can become enlarged if he is a chronic urine holder, which means he avoids going to the bathroom, even when he really, really has to pee.


When this goes on for a long time, the muscles related to urinating become over trained, which means the muscles relax poorly, leading to bladder dysfunction like incontinence.This happens frequently when a child does not want to use the bathroom at school or other public places.

, Behavioral modification may be able to help your child with her urge incontinence. Most experts today favor behavior modification therapy over drugs as a first line treatment for daytime wetting of almost all types. Behavior modification is a method of training to relearn a skill such as bladder control. The therapy must be done strictly and consistently in order to get the desired results, such as your child being able to control her bladder.


Behavior modification therapy generally works best in children who are older than five or six years of age. This is because younger children generally lack the self-discipline to stick to the therapy schedule. However, each child should be analyzed on a case-by-case basis.
Child psychologists can provide good advice on how to go about creating a schedule., If your child suffers from an overactive bladder, you need to create a schedule to help him. After your child goes to the bathroom in the morning, begin a strict timed voiding schedule. Normally, parents pick every two hours as the scheduled voiding time. Your child must go to the bathroom every two hours, even if he says he doesn’t have to go at that specific time. That is actually the point, to get him to the bathroom before he has a bladder spasm.


If you wait for the bladder spasm, you are reinforcing the absence of control. If your child does go and attempts to void, even a little, it reinforces his control about when and where he goes.
If your child has an overfilled bladder, you should create the same schedule with an added step. Your child should wait four to five minutes after going to the bathroom and then try to go again. This is called double voiding in an attempt to reduce that lingering bladder volume. The goal is to change voiding habits and allow the bladder to carry a more normal volume of urine., In addition to a schedule, set an alarm to help your child remember to go to the bathroom. It can be hard to remember to go to the bathroom every two hours. Because of this, its important to set up an alarm system. When your child is at home or visiting family, such as staying at Grandma’s house, set alarm clocks that go off every two hours.


You can set these alarms on a smartphone or alarm clock. You can also get your child a watch that beeps or vibrates silently every two hours as a reminder for when she is at school.You may also consider trying a bed-wetting alarm if your child has nighttime incontinence (bed-wetting).

, Once you have followed this schedule for four to six weeks, you should extend the voiding time. Normally, you should see improvement within four to six weeks. However, this does not mean you should stop the schedule. You should extend the time so that your child tries to urinate every three or four hours, rather than every two.

Notice urinary tract infections.,
Keep irritation at a minimum.,
Change your child’s clothing when it becomes wet.,
Ask your doctor about antibiotics.",How to Manage Urinary Incontinence in Children3," You need to pay attention to your child to look for certain causes of incontinence. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are most common in girls who have just started school or have recently been potty trained. In addition to incontinence, UTIs can also cause frequent urination, a burning sensation when she urinates, cloudy or dark colored urine, strong smelling urine, and pain in the lower abdomen. UTIs can be treated with antibiotics.Some children who get frequent UTIs also have a condition called asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU). These children, most frequently girls, have bacteria colonizing the bladder, meaning that they reside there, similar to having bacteria quietly living on our skin. This increase in bacteria in the urine can sometimes be the cause of frequent UTIs., Many kids, particularly girls, will develop irritation and inflammation in the area of the urethral and vaginal openings when they have a UTI. You can use certain creams to help relieve the irritation your child feels. In particular, a zinc oxide-containing skin barrier cream or ointment such as Desitin or Triple Paste can be very helpful.You can purchase these creams at your local pharmacy. Follow the directions on the bottle or box that the cream comes in., The bacteria that creates a UTI thrives in moist areas. When your child experiences incontinence and leaks a bit of urine onto her clothes, it’s important that she changes into dry clothes to keep her from getting a UTI or to relieve the symptoms of her UTI. This will also keep it from coming back.


You can explain this to her so that she does it herself, or you can ask her to tell you when this happens so that you can help her change.

, If your child has recurrent UTIs, you should talk to the doctor about getting antibiotics to clear up the infection and prevent new infections. Your child’s doctor will be able to tell you whether or not antibiotics are the appropriate treatment for your child to prevent infections. Your child will need antibiotics if he has an active UTI.


The most common antibiotics used for prophylaxis, or prevention of infections, are nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim sulfa. These are usually given once a day, at bedtime, at about ¼ of the usual full treatment dose given to adults."

Be aware of constipation.,
Have your doctor check your child.,
Ask your child to drink lots of fluids throughout the day.,
Increase your child’s fiber intake.,
Give your child laxatives.",How to Manage Urinary Incontinence in Children4," Another common cause of incontinence is constipation. When large amounts of stool stays in the body rather than being expelled, it can limit how much room the bladder has to expand and causes the bladder to have unpredictable contractions, both of which cause incontinence.Constipation usually causes infrequent bowel movements for 3 days or more in a row, hard, pebbly stools, very large stools, or pain when moving the bowels., If you aren't sure how bad your child's constipation is, have a doctor figure out whether or not your child has a lot of stool backed up in her system. This can be done with the use of X-rays or through a physical examination.


Knowing for sure that your child is constipated will help her overcome her incontinence issues., Many kids with urgency and incontinence tend not to drink much fluid, which actually makes their constipation worse. Try to have your child drink at least eight glasses of water each day to stay hydrated.If your child doesn’t like drinking plain water, you can give him fruit juices, milk (no more than 2-3 cups a day), and sports drinks., To help fight constipation, increase your child's daily fiber intake. Fiber is one of the best ways to get your child’s bowels working properly. There are plenty of foods that are high in fiber. Try introducing as many foods that are high in fiber as possible into your child’s diet. Foods high is fiber include:


Fresh fruit and vegetables, including raspberries, blueberries, green peas, spinach, collard greens, acorn squash, kale, and broccoli.Whole grain breads with at least three to four grams of fiber per serving.
High fiber cereals, such as Raisin Bran, Fiber One, Shredded Wheat, and All Bran.
Beans, including black, lima, garbanzo, and pinto beans. Lentils and popcorn are also high in fiber., Adding fiber-rich food to your child’s diet may not be enough. If your child is still having problems, try child-safe laxatives. One laxative that is safe and frequently used is propylene glycol, more commonly known as MiraLax.


MiraLax causes water to be transported into the bowel, thereby softening the stool and improving movement.You should check with your child's doctor for guidance before giving MiraLax or other laxatives to your child. Most kids require between ½ capfuls and two capfuls per day, and the dose may be adjusted as needed."

Sleep at least seven to nine hours per night.",How to Manage Crohn's Disease in the Summer," When you have Crohn's, you'll quickly learn that there are a specific set of foods that will cause discomfort, pain and a flare up of symptoms. Knowing these foods can help you manage your symptoms during the summer season.Although many Crohn's patients share similar ""trigger foods,"" you will most likely have a set that is unique to you and your disease.
Many people are sensitive to and should avoid foods like: dairy products, high-fat foods (like fried or fast foods), caffeine, alcohol, spicy foods or food with a high amount of fiber.Keep a list or journal of your trigger foods handy and make sure you're very familiar with them and where they occur. Knowing them can help you navigate summer barbecues, cookouts and vacations much better.;
, Choosing leaner cuts of protein is always a good idea if you have Crohn's; however, during the summer months, it can be tempting to deviate towards fattier cuts of meat, like hot dogs, ribs, hamburgers, fatty cuts of steak, sausages or chicken wings.


Whether you're going to a barbecue or grilling outside, it can be tempting to choose protein sources that are higher in fat or more processed. Avoid these foods as much as possible.
These fattier cuts of protein can cause a flare up of symptoms. The fat is harder to digest which causes stomach aches, cramping, bloating and diarrhea.Limit your portion sizes. It's hard to digest more than 6 oz of protein per serving. So measure portions to 3 – 4 oz total to prevent further issues. Three ounces of fish, meat, or poultry is roughly equal to the size of the palm of your hand.

, Although summer is known for some unhealthier choices, it's also known for a wide array of fresh fruits and vegetables. Be sure to fill up on these delicious and nutrient-dense foods.


Fruits and vegetables are great foods to include during the summer. They're more readily available, less expensive and are more flavorful.
If fibrous foods cause symptoms, stay away from vegetables like: cabbage, kale, broccoli, cauliflower or brussels sprouts.
Instead, choose well-cooked vegetables. For example, grilled peppers, eggplant or onions are very flavorful, nutritious and will most likely not upset your GI system.Try to fill half of your plate with fruits and vegetables.
Fruit is a great item to have in place of a high-fat dessert (like ice cream or pie). Use fruit as a sweet ending when you're cooking out or attending a barbecue.

, When you have Crohn's disease, it's important to stay away from trigger foods; however, many common summertime condiments and side dishes can contain some of your trigger foods.Be wary of items that are high in fat, are overly acidic or are very spicy. These could cause symptoms.
When it comes to condiments, be mindful when using or eating: spicy barbecue sauce, hot sauce, salsa, mayonnaise or sour cream.
Also be aware of ""diet"" or sugar-free items. These may contain artificial sweeteners that can cause symptoms as well.
Common summertime side dishes can also cause problems. Potato salad, coleslaw, macaroni salad or potato chips are notoriously high in fat. Not only are they not the healthiest item, the high-fat content can give your GI system a lot of problems.

, One important thing to consider diet-wise in the summer is hydration. With increased temperatures and humidity levels, it's easier to get dehydrated.


Dehydration can make chronic diarrhea or constipation worse (both of which can be common to those suffering from Crohn's).Make sure to be constantly drinking in the summer. You should be aiming for at least 64 oz (1.9 liters) of clear, hydrating fluids daily; however, due to the increased heat you may need upwards of 80 oz (2.4 liters) daily.
Choose beverages like: water, flavored water, sparkling water (if carbonated beverages don't bother you) and decaf coffee and tea.

, You might notice that summertime brings on more alcoholic beverages. Whether it's a summery sangria or a wine spritzer, try to minimize your alcohol consumption.


Alcohol is a common GI irritant that can cause symptoms or make them worse when you have Crohn's disease.Alcoholic beverages that have a higher sugar content (like wheat beers or mixed drinks) are known to cause an increase of symptoms.Although some patients with Crohn's disease can tolerate some alcohol, keep your consumption moderate. Only have one drink a day and drink it slowly along with a lot of water.
Caffeine is a GI stimulant which can cause bloating, cramping and diarrhea. Stay away from those iced lattes and other caffeinated beverages during the summer. Choose decaf instead.

, Whether you're just going to a friend's cookout or you're traveling, to best manage your Crohn's, you need to plan ahead. This will help you be prepared for a variety of situations.If you're going to a barbecue or cookout, ask the host what's being served. This can give you an idea if you'll be able to eat the food or not.
If you don't feel like you'll be able to eat or can't find out what's being served, plan ahead by having a small meal. This can help prevent you from getting overly hungry.
If you're on vacation and are planning to go out to eat, look online at the restaurant menus. Find a few options that would be appropriate for your diet.

, A great way to handle summer festivities and events is by bringing your own food with you. That way, you know for sure there is something you'll be able to eat.


If you're going to a barbecue or cookout, ask the host if you can bring something. It'll be a nice gesture, helpful to the host and ensure there's something you can eat as well.
If you want to bring more than a dish, talk to the host and ask if they mind if you bring a small meal for yourself. Explain that you have Crohn's disease or are on a special diet and you want to be sure to have something available to you.

, Another time that you can bring food items with you is when you go on vacation. Consider planning ahead and having items on hand that you'll be able to eat and tolerate.


If you're going on vacation, think about what types of foods and how much food you can bring with you. This will depend on where you're staying. A hotel may have limited food storage, whereas a beach house probably will have a pantry, refrigerator and freezer.
If you're going to a hotel, call ahead and ask for a small mini fridge in your room. That way you can store cold items.
If you're going to rent a house, make sure to pack foods or purchase foods to keep at home that you can eat.
Also, consider bringing a cooler or bag with you. That way while you're traveling you don't have to rely on gas-station food, airport food or fast food for your options.

, Crohn's disease can be treated with a variety of medications — both prescription and over-the-counter. Have these with you at all times and make sure you have an intervention plan as well.


If you are traveling, you need to bring all prescription medications with you. Also, make sure you have a full stock of over-the-counter medications that you regularly use (like a stool softener, anti-diarrheal or acid reducer).
Do some research ahead of time on emergency facilities around where you will be staying. This should be part of your intervention plan. What hospitals, emergency rooms or urgent cares are near your hotel, rental, or campsite?
Also, keep a list of all your doctors and their phone numbers (including the emergency line) with you as part of your intervention plan. This way, if you're traveling you or someone with you can contact them if needed.

, Again, planning ahead with Crohn's disease is essential. This is especially true when it comes to finding the closest restrooms.


If you have Crohn's, there may be times when you need to use the restroom immediately.
If you're going to a cookout or barbecue, ask the host where the closest restroom is for guests as soon as you arrive.
If you're traveling, plan bathroom stops along the way. Check which exits or towns have a gas station, convenience store or restaurant immediately off the highway that you can get to quickly.
If you're going out to eat while on vacation, make sure to ask the hostess where the closest restrooms are in the restaurant for patrons.

, Although foods play a huge role in whether or not your Crohn's disease is well managed, there are lifestyle factors that can affect it as well. This is especially true with stress.


Studies have shown that those people who suffer from Crohn's disease note more severe symptoms and more flareups with daily and low-grade stress levels.Summer can be a relaxing and fun season — make sure to focus on relaxation techniques and de-stressing.
Go to barbecues, cookouts and vacations. This time away from work and being together with family and friends can help keep your mood elevated and distract you from your Crohn's disease.
Also try: exercising regularly, talking to a Crohn's support group, doing meditation or yoga or listening to music.
If you're having difficulty managing your stress, consider talking to a behavioral therapist for additional support.

, Crohn's can be a serious disease and it can be very difficult to manage. Talking with your physician regularly can help you better manage your condition.


Since Crohn's needs a lot of management on your part, keeping in touch with your doctor can help you better manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life.
Talk to your doctor about your diet and symptoms. Ask them to help you find a diet and eating pattern that will minimize your overall symptoms.
Also ask you doctor for a referral to a dietitian. Many dietitians focus on GI disorders and can help you plan your summer while also reducing your symptoms or the possibility of having a flare up.
If you do have a flare up, call or contact your doctor immediately. Don't wait until symptoms have subsided. Even if they treat you with over-the-counter medications, it's good to let your physician know what's going on.

, One way to help manage your Crohn's disease is by being physically active. The summer is a great time to be active since you can do more exercises outdoors.


Exercise is a great form of stress relief, can help keep your bowels regularly and work to help prevent symptoms of Crohn's.Aim for 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise five days a week (for a total of 150 minutes) or 75 minutes of high-intensity exercise. Be sure to include two to three days of strength training each week as well.
Indulge in some fun summertime exercises. Try swimming, going for a hike, surfing, rollerblading or rock climbing.
If you're currently having a flare up, stick to light activities like yoga or tai chi.

, You might be surprised to find out that sleep is another essential habit to help manage your Crohn's disease. Make sure to get an adequate amount of sleep, especially during flareups, to help manage your symptoms.


Studies have linked sleep disturbances and lack of sleep with Crohn's disease and increased prevalence of symptoms.Summertime may come with some schedule changes with vacations, time off of work and more parties to go to; however, always try to get at least seven to nine hours of sleep each night.
Even if you're out late at a barbecue or staying up later while on vacation, try to sleep in later.

Arrange for a blood test.,
Get tested if you are of African or Indian descent.,
Speak to a genetic counselor.,
Have your unborn baby tested for sickle cell anemia.",How to Prevent Sickle Cell Anemia1," Sickle cell anemia can be passed on by birth if one parent or both parents have the sickle cell gene. If you inherit the sickle cell gene from one or both of your parents, you will carry the sickle cell trait (SCT). You may not develop any of the symptoms of sickle cell disease, but you can pass the trait on to your children. Your doctor can perform a blood test to determine if you carry the sickle cell gene.If you are aware there is a sickle cell trait in your family or your partner’s family and you are pregnant, you and your partner should get tested for the sickle cell trait. This will help to determine if your unborn child is at risk of the condition.
There is a 1 in 2 chance that your child will have the sickle cell trait if both you and your partner have the trait. However, there is a 1 in 4 chance your child will develop sickle cell anemia if both you and your partner have the trait.;
, The sickle cell gene is more common in individuals from Africa and India as well as Mediterranean countries, the Caribbean islands, Saudi Arabia, and South and Central America.In the United States, the gene is more common in individuals of African American descent.

, If you find out you carry the sickle cell trait, you may talk to a genetic counselor while you are pregnant or before you try to get pregnant. A genetics counselor can explain the risks of having a child with sickle cell anemia as well as treatment options and preventative measures you can take.You can get a referral for a genetic counselor through your primary care doctor or your OB-GYN, if you are pregnant.

, If you or your partner carry the sickle cell trait and you are pregnant, you may ask your doctor to test your unborn baby for the disease. Your doctor can test your unborn baby by using a fetal blood draw. This test will tell you if your child will be born with sickle cell disease.If your unborn baby is diagnosed with sickle cell disease, you may discuss terminating the pregnancy with your partner. This is a personal choice and should be done with care.
Early diagnosis of the disease is important, as it allows the parents to learn more about the disease and be prepared for treatment of the disease once the baby is born. Proper treatment of the disease, especially in the early stages of life, can improve the baby’s chances of survival during childhood.

As a precaution, you should try to avoid smoking tobacco or consuming alcohol.You should try to drink at least eight 12-ounce glasses of water a day, especially during warm weather. Staying hydrated will help to prevent oxygen loss and reduce your risk of dehydration, especially if you already have sickle cell anemia.

, You should have a diet that includes a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables. You should also eat a lot of whole grains to ensure you are getting vitamins and nutrients from your food.Your doctor may recommend that you also take a folic acid supplement, as your bone marrow needs folic acid and other vitamins to produce new red blood cells. Always follow your doctor's instructions on dosage for supplements.

, You should try to get sufficient rest, with at least eight hours of sleep a night. You may try creating a sleep schedule, where you go to sleep at the same time every night and wake up at the same time every morning.

Consider using over-the-counter, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (called NSAIDs), such as: ibuprofen, naproxen sodium, or indomethacin, and aspirin which are effective in relieving pain and swelling.,
Ask your doctor whether he would recommend prescriptions of drugs for arthritis including steroids called corticosteroids such as prednisone: These can be taken orally or injected directly into the joint to quickly stop inflammation.,
Check with your doctor: Find out if there are any reasons why you should not use either hot -- or cold -- applications, such as: You should not apply heat to an inflamed joint.

,
Place a towel or extra padding under the heat or cold source, or wrap either hot or cold-packs, ice-packs in a towel.

,
Avoid cold applications when they would not be appropriate such as because cold will shrink already diminished blood vessels, for instance if you have one of the following conditions:


poor circulation,
vasculitis, inflamed blood vessels,
Raynaud's phenomenon.

,
Consider using ordinary heat as a natural muscle relaxant, an especially good remedy for muscles in spasm from joint pains of arthritis; it can also be used to stimulate circulation.,
Try a warm shower or bath or soak in a hot-tub or whirlpool bath, if appropriate.,
Ask your doctor about penetrating and relaxing applications of electromagnetic radiation using heat lamps: Use a special ""infrared"" bulb (not ultraviolet, ie: not sun lamps).,
Use cold as advised by your doctor, and ask about vapocoolant sprays and mentholated gels that are applied on the skin as applications that produce cold relief.

,
Use ordinary cold for joint pain caused by a flareup including:


soothe excited nerve cells,
reduce swelling in an inflamed joint,
constrict blood flow.

,
Consider alternating heat and cold, five minutes or so of each at a time.",How to Manage Rheumatoid Arthritis Conventionally," Some people cannot take those types of drugs, however, because they have reactions, a peptic ulcer or kidney disease.;
, ""Corticosteroids are never used for more than a few days to avoid side effects."" But, when over-the-counter drugs are not effective -- or when the disease is progressing very rapidly -- then other kinds of medications include drugs such as:Gold compounds, D-penicillamine, antimalarial drugs, and sulfasalazine that may be prescribed. Gold compounds can slow the formation of bone deformities, and are usually injected directly into the joint.
Or, a drug that actually suppresses the immune system might be prescribed and that includes: methotrexate, azathioprine, or cyclophosphamide. Realize this suppression could lead to being opened to infectious ailments; so one should wash hands and keep them away from the eyes, nose, ears, etc.

,,,,



Caution: do not apply heat on already inflamed or badly swollen joints ""unless"" advised by a doctor.

, For everyday pain, heating pads, heat packs and of course hot water bottles are all about equally effective, though some therapists suggest that wet heat (a hot water bottle) is better than dry (an electric blanket). Plastic hot packs including gel packs can be heated in a microwave oven or in hot water until hot are a versatile approach to pain relief:


for muscle pain (sore muscles),
to promote blood circulation,
to nourishes and detoxifies muscle fibers.

, Some infrared ray applications are called diathermy which uses deep heat as the infrared rays can penetrate the joints and seem to radiate from the middle outward. This heat produces blood vessel dilation, called vasodilation (enlarging), of the blood vessels in the tissues includes deep warmth produced by improved circulation.

,,, Keep your icepack and/or heating pad not too cold or too hot. Cold and heat packs are available commercially, but you can also use ice in a plastic storage bag — and then switch to use a hot pack.

Address mobility issues.,
Place items within arms reach.,
Put heavy things on wheels.,
Elevate furniture that is low to the ground.,
Get assistance.,
Apply for a home modification grant.",How to Make Your Home Comfortable if You Have Rheumatoid Arthritis1," When you have RA it may be difficult to get in and out of your home easily. Maybe you have a lot of stairs that you have difficulty walking up and down. Maybe you just have a few stairs but no railing to help keep you stable while you walk up them. Whatever the issue, find a way to eliminate or minimize it.


In cases of severe RA, you may become unable to walk on your own. If this is the case, you will need to install a wheelchair ramp if there are steps up to your home.
For example, the bathroom may become slippery, and it may be difficult for you to navigate in and out of the shower without risking a fall. Try installing grab bars near the shower, bath, and toilet as well as any other place where you feel insecure.;
, If you have RA, it can be hard for you to bend down or reach high places. If this is the case, you should organize the things that you use often so that they are within arms reach. This may take some time to do, as it will require you to reorganize many items in your home.One room in the house where this can be especially helpful, but the organization can be difficult, is the kitchen. Place items that you use daily, such as condiments, tools, and dishes, on your counters or in upper drawers. Also, place refrigerated items that you use most often on the upper shelves of your refrigerator.
When planning your organization, consider what your needs are during the times when you are feeling the worst, not for when you are feeling the best. When you are feeling the worst, these changes and modifications will help the most.

, If you have items in your home that you need to move on a regular basis but they are heavy, put them on wheels. Adding wheels to things like furniture will help you to move them to clean under them or rearrange them.If you have groups of things, like craft project supplies, that need to be moved around when you are not using them, consider storing them in a lightweight rolling suitcase. This will allow you to move them more easily.

, It can be hard for those with RA to move on and off of furniture that is low to the ground. With this in mind, lift low furniture up with the use of furniture leg extensions or specialized products.One specialized product that can raise up a low surface is a raised toilet seat.
You can also use furniture leg risers to lift up other furniture, such as your couch, chairs, and bed.
You might consider installing taller kitchen counters to help.

, If you need to make a lot of changes to your home, you should get help in doing it from your support system. That support system may include both family and friends, as well as paid caregivers.


It can be hard to ask for help, especially if you are used to being self-sufficient. However, you need to remember that those that love and care for you will be willing to help you in your time of need and that it is only pride that will keep you from getting the assistance you need.

, You may be able to receive a grant to help fund any renovations that you do. Some of these grants are offered by government programs while others may be given by non-profit organizations.You might consult the National Directory of Home Modification Resources to find grants and other resources that you qualify for.

Hire help.",How to Make Your Home Comfortable if You Have Rheumatoid Arthritis2," It can be hard for those with RA to cope with cold temperatures. Because of this, it is a good idea to keep your home at a relatively high temperature. If you cannot afford to keep your whole home heated at a high temperature, consider getting a space heater and heating the room that you spend the most time in.


You can also use targeted heating products, such as heating pads, electric blankets, and hot water bottles, to keep yourself warm., If you have RA, it is likely that you have pain and discomfort on a lot of days. In order to brighten your mood, you should fill your home with bright light from both natural and artificial sources.Open up your window treatments and let the light in. Just because you are stuck inside, that doesn't mean you can't enjoy the daylight.
Put full-spectrum bulbs in your lamps. Getting a lot of full-spectrum light can brighten your mood when you are feeling down.

, When you have RA it is important to have soft surfaces to sit and lay on. Buy furniture that is heavily padded and add additional pillows to existing furniture that needs more padding.


If you can't change all of your furniture, focus of the pieces that you sit on and lay on the most. Invest in a quality mattress and chair that will be comfortable for you.
While soft beds and seats may help, you should not add rugs to pathways, as these can pose a tripping hazard. Carpets are fine as long as they are properly secured to the floor. If they are torn or loose, you should replace them., If you have RA, common tasks can be very difficult to complete. However, there are products that can ease the discomfort and difficulty that comes along with doing routine tasks. In particular, there are many products made specifically for people with arthritis.For example, there are many kitchen gadgets that can make cooking easier for those with RA. Some of them include jar openers, soft handles utensils, and two handled pots, which are easier to pick up and carry for people with RA.Consider ways to make access to shelves, cabinets, and closets easier. For example, you might install a lazy susan into your kitchen cabinet to make food easier to grab., If you can afford it, hire someone to come to your home and do chores that cause you pain and discomfort. It could be that you hire someone to come in and cook meals for you or you hire someone to clean your house. Whatever causes you the most discomfort, focus on eliminating those tasks from your day.Even if you cannot hire a helper all of the time, it can be helpful to get temporary help if you are having a flare of symptoms that has made chores especially painful.
If you do not have the financial ability to hire a helper, you can ask your friends and family for help.
You might speak to a social worker or with the human resources department at work to help you locate government resources and other sources of assistance."

Your doctor/surgeon should provide you with a lot of detail, so don't worry too much about doing extensive independent research.
Usually, most details of your surgery will be explained during your first appointment.;
, As an autoimmune disease, lupus affects you systemically. This means that when you are considering an upcoming surgery, it's important to take into consideration the various organs that can be affected indirectly. Your primary care physician and any specialists you have will know the details of your lupus, and can inform your surgeon of any additional accommodations he or she must make for your disease.


For example, if you have a joint condition, your rheumatologist will give you a recommendation letter about all the drugs you have taken because some drugs may interact during surgery.
For other affected systems like the heart (cardiologist), kidney (nephrologist), digestive tract (gastroenterologist), and nervous system (neurologist), doctors will give recommendation letters, including the details of laboratory tests, drugs, and any prior interventions.

, Some medications can interact, causing harmful effects during or after surgery. Informing your surgeon of any over-the-counter medications or prescriptions you take will allow them to monitor and prepare for any potential drug interactions.


All medicines including vitamins and herbal supplements should be taken down in notes including the dosage and the frequency on how many times you’re taking them per day.
Additionally, take note of any dietary supplements that may not immediately come to mind as medications.

Vitamins and supplements such as vitamin E, gingko biloba, and garlic can increase your risk for bleeding.
Herbal supplements such as Kava, St. John’s wort, and Valerian can interfere with the medicines that are used for anesthesia.


Stop taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 3-4 days prior to surgery. NSAIDs can cause excessive bleeding due to their blood-thinning properties. For this reason, it is always recommended that you stop taking these drugs at least three days prior to surgery.
NSAIDs include medication such as ibuprofen (Advil) and acetaminophen (Tylenol).
However, some NSAIDs can still be continued, as they do not cause the blood to thin. These include non-acetylated salicylates such as salsalate, diflusinal, and magnesium trisalycylate.
In any case, follow the advice of your doctor or surgeon.

, Some steroids, called “stress doses”, are given during surgery to control inflammation and swelling. However, if you have been taking steroids on your own 3 weeks prior to surgery, the surgeon may not give stress doses in order to avoid complications such as adrenal insufficiency. Informing your surgeon of personal steroid use can help prevent serious complications.


Steroids taken for long periods of time can result serious side effects such as Cushing’s syndrome.

, Prescription blood thinner medications such as Warfarin, Clopidogrel, Apixaban, Dabigatran, and Fondaparinux can be taken by individuals with lupus, with the approval of their doctor and surgeon. The decision to take these blood thinners prior to surgery should only be made with your doctor's specific knowledge of your condition.


The doctor who prescribed your blood thinners will be the one responsible to communicate to the surgeon what to do with the medications before surgery.

, Raynaud's is a condition that causes your extremities (fingers, toes, tip of the nose, and ears) to feel numb, especially when exposed to cold temperatures. It causes small arteries to narrow, limiting circulation of blood in those areas. The operating room could be cold, and Raynaud’s phenomenon could disrupt normal blood flow to your arteries and veins, interfering with the surgery.


If untreated, this could lead to death of the tissues in the finger, rendering them useless and prone to gangrene/infection.
By informing your doctors of this condition, special care will be taken to ensure a warmer temperature or provide sufficient blankets to maintain a safe body temperature.

, Sjögren's is an autoimmune disease that affects the exocrine glands in the body, particularly the mucous membranes and other moisture-secreting glands, decreasing saliva and tear production and causing the mouth and eyes to dry. The low humidity levels of most operating rooms can exacerbate symptoms of Sjögren's and severely dry out mucous membranes. It is important to communicate to your surgeon if you have this condition, to prevent excessive dryness and irritation of the mucosa and its linings.


During surgery, artificial saliva for your mouth and moisturizing gel for your eyes can be given to you.
You should bring all your moisturizers to the hospital to keep your eyes and mouth moist, especially after surgery.

, Getting an adequate amount of rest and sleep can relieve anxiety and tension caused by the upcoming surgery. Try to get at least an hour of rest directly prior to the surgery, and 7 to 8 hours of sleep the night before to relax your tense muscles and stabilize your vital signs.


You can also express your thoughts to your family and friends to relieve tension.

, Nurses and technicians will be monitoring and recording your baseline vital signs – this will serve as a basis for identifying any abnormalities and keeping track of your stability during surgery. During surgery, your vital signs will be continuously monitored. Taking vital signs is important in order to identify any unusual changes happening in the body.


Any abnormal condition will change the values of your vital signs, alerting your medical team to a problem.

, The type of anesthesia used will vary from case to case. Anesthesia is given to keep you sedated or numb for the duration of the surgery. This will prevent you from becoming conscious or feeling any pain.


The anesthesiologist is the one who decides what kind of anesthetic agent will be used during your surgery – it can be general, spinal or epidural, or local anesthesia.
The anesthesiologist will also monitor your vital signs to determine any adverse effects of the anesthetic agents.

, Also known as the recovery room, this is where nurses will wait with you and monitor your condition. They will stay with you until you regain your normal level of consciousness and stable vital signs.


If you are not sedated the nurse will continue to monitor you until the numbness goes away.
If your vital signs are stable for hours, the surgeon, anesthesiologist, and the nurse will decide that you are ready to go out from the recovery room.

, Right after surgery, pain medications will be ordered by your attending physician to manage your pain. Surgery can be very painful, as layers of your skin and muscle have been cut and manipulated.


Pain medications are given round the clock or as needed by the patient.

, Usually, symptoms of lupus worsen after surgery. Because your system will compensate to heal damaged muscles and tissues, inflammation is inevitable. Steroids and other medications will usually adjusted to manage any inflammation in the body.


These adjustments are made by your attending physician.
The physician will manage your case effectively to avoid post-operative complications and unwanted symptoms.

, You should ask your medical team about anything that you haven’t understood or about any clarifications on what to do after your hospital discharge. Don’t ever hesitate to ask them, as they can answer your questions honestly and help you to fully recover from your surgery.


Making sure you know what to do before leaving the hospital will alleviate stress and help you avoid confusion.

, Your doctor will give you an appointment a week after you’re discharged, or as early as possible, to monitor your condition for any abnormalities. Follow-up check-ups help understand your current condition and what to do if any untoward symptoms occur.


These follow-up appointments will continue for some period of time as you recover.

Take regular rests until you feel fully ready to go on. If you're feeling the fatigue warning signs, stop. Don't wait for them to get worse. Be ready to stop when you need to and don't drive yourself into the ground over anything, even activities of daily living. Pushing when it's too much can cause you to lose a lot more time recovering from the overexertion than you would've spent just resting when you need to.;
, Ever. Only measure success against your own past efforts. Be prepared to accept a completely random level of physical ability. You may feel almost like normal sometimes - seize those moments to do things that are important to you or that you missed most.

, He or she will be able to treat you more confidently if your medical records are up to date. You'll also build trust and understanding. It's also important to find the right doctor, one who understands the physical nature and severity of the illness.


If your primary physician is not experienced with chronic fatigue, first visit a specialist. Then find a primary care physician who has other chronic fatigue patients. It's very common for primary physicians to be insensitive and they may give bad advice if they don't understand your limitations. A doctor who's willing to learn is all right, but you may have to put up with that doctor's trial and error process of learning until he or she does understand your condition. The more rare your condition is, the likelier specialists will give you better, more useful advice and treatments.
Do not try the same treatment, if it failed. Many primary physicians have a regular series of advice, treatments and regimens mostly geared toward sedentary, normal people improving their health. These can be too difficult and humiliating, so don't torture yourself trying what didn't work again and again.
Taking long walks does not help chronic fatigue, but may mean that you can't keep up with the dishes or brush your teeth for a couple of days resting up.
Keep personal written records of all treatments, regimens and medications that had adverse effects. It's a long slog to find the right medications for any chronic illness and you don't need to repeat failed trials.
Bring a healthy caregiver to your doctor appointments who can explain your condition and bring the doctor up to speed on the results of your medications and treatments. Work with your caregiver before going so that you're sure he or she has the information memorized. It gets complex sometimes, and doctors may not listen to what a sufferer says. They will listen to the healthy people who live with the patient; so bring someone else as your interpreter -- or you may be ignored while the doctor tries to judge your tone of voice or body language for clues or symptoms. They will always look for the most common cause of symptoms, which is why chronic fatigue is so often mistaken for lack of activity, exercise and will power.

,


Keep a food diary. Compare what you've eaten with how you feel immediately afterward and how you feel later in the day. Fibromyalgia and some other chronic fatigue conditions often cause food sensitivities and allergies. Until you know which foods to avoid and which ones give you energy, chart the results of everything you take in. Some healthy foods like milk, whole grains with gluten and so on may give you unexpected problems and have to come off your list even if they'd be good for anyone else. Don't feel bad about it, this is just part of living with the disease. You're not a fussy eater when you have real allergies and sensitivities.
Avoid foods that give short bursts of energy, such as sugar and caffeine. It's easy to instinctively go for foods that are easy and give a short term buzz - coffee and sweet-rolls, tea and biscuits, sweet chocolate, and so on. Unfortunately, the times that you're feeling the most tired are the times you should avoid these, as the burst of energy will be followed by an energy crash that will make you feel a lot worse in the long run.
Enjoy foods that offer slow-energy-release, such as starchy foods, proteins including beans and peas. The effects are longer-lasting, and you'll be healthier in the long term.
Eat raw fruits and vegetables, because uncooked foods are quicker, easier to prepare and contain more nutrients - win-win!
There are many foods that have properties that are especially good for you - including sprouted seeds and pulses, very dark chocolate, iron-rich foods, anything with high levels of vitamin B12...

, Being chronically ill is stressful enough in itself, and many doctors believe that stress could be a contributor to CFS symptoms. So, when at all possible, make things easy on yourself by keeping your schedule flexible and your goals attainable.


Consider eliminating television news. News stories are presented in a dramatized way like a cop show, for maximum suspense. The video also affects your body, as if you were an eyewitness to the hotel fire or in the war zone. Reading news online or in a print newsletter distances it and may give you more information than can be condensed into a two minute television report where they rely mostly on shocking video.
Consider eliminating television in real time in favor of TiVo or Netflix and other sources where you can filter the commercials out. Interruptions every three minutes can be stressful, like living with a screaming toddler. The volume goes up and your train of thought is disrupted. This minor aggravation for most people can add up to a lot of stress during an activity that's supposed to be relaxing! Consider purchasing your favorite shows on Amazon and find various ways to get your entertainment uninterrupted.
Keep a personal journal. Vent about everything that aggravates you and also write out everything that makes you happy or calm, makes you feel better, lifts your spirits. It's different for everyone but charting what you do every day for a week or several weeks will show you patterns that can let you change your priorities. Dropping an obnoxious acquaintance and spending more time with a casual friend who always makes you feel good whenever you connect can enrich your life.
Don't argue about your health issues with people in person. Take discussions online to forums where you can express your opinions clearly and relax while getting your views understood without having to deal with being shouted at, people's bad debate tactics, personal insults, criticism and other nasty tactics people use during in person arguments.
Reduce or eliminate domestic arguments. Find other ways to resolve personal conflicts that do not involve shouting matches. The people you live with may be inconvenienced by this, but they're also inconvenienced a lot more if the stress of a fight over who did the dishes means you can't do them for a week.

, Doing a little is better than doing nothing - in bad times it can boost your morale and keep you from getting lethargic, and in good times it can help you to build up your endurance.


In your personal journal, look for activities you can do sitting down or do when you're not at your best. Accomplishing something that's in reach, like mindlessly sorting through old papers, is still a real accomplishment that will leave you more free time when you have a good day to actually get out into the garden or go out with friends.
When you're so loopy tired you can't do anything productive, relax with a good book or a computer game. The same time sinks that sedentary people waste their lives in can keep your mind off the fatigue and put you in a better mood. Reading is especially good at bedtime or when you need a nap, a few pages may get your mind off all your stresses and let you sleep.

, The fact is that you're not able to manage as much as others - accept it and don't push yourself too hard. Others had better accept you as you are, because you are dealing with a physical limitation as real as a missing limb. They need to know that, so don't hide it and pretend every things fine.


Don't make firm commitments or deadlines without explaining to the others involved that it's ""as health permits."" Most people are understanding once they know the truth, or they aren't worth your time. This is a big favor to them because otherwise when you have a bad day, they could be left in the lurch if they don't have an alternate plan. You will have those bad days, no one can predict the weather or what your body will do next.
If fatigue affects your memory, always turn down requests to remember something for someone else. ""Would you remind me to pick up the milk?"" is a recipe for disaster, because you're more likely to forget to remind them than they are to remember the milk in the first place. Remind them of your condition and say something like ""Sorry, I can't count on being able to remember my own keys. You probably ought to write it down or put it on a timer in your phone."" You can add a joke to it like ""My memory is a steel trap - it mangles everything that gets into it."" Most people don't mind giving reminders but they get disproportionately aggravated if they asked someone for a reminder and that person didn't remind them. That sets them up to be able to blame someone else (you) for forgetting the milk. It's like asking someone with a bad back to pick up that fifty pound sack - a bad idea all around and a constant source of stress if you don't learn to say ""No"" to things you can't count on doing easily.

, Work with your physician or healer to try to identify some things that bring about the more intense symptoms. For instance, many people with CFS have dietary, environmental or chemical sensitivities. The more of these you understand, the better you can live. Some are avoidable, like food sensitivities. Others aren't, but at least you can look at the weather predictions and know whether to even try to make it to an event.

, Many sufferers have found that alternative medicine has really helped alleviate their symptoms. Acupuncture, homeopathy, Reiki and hypnotherapy to name a few could make a difference; however, remember that every sufferer is different and you may need to experiment to uncover a treatment that works for you.

, More and more doctors are recognizing the reality of this illness, which means more people are actively dealing with their condition. There are organizations dedicated to supporting those with your condition, and they can help you to feel that you're not alone.

They can help you to assess the seriousness of the change and what should be done, if anything. Your primary care doctor will most likely to refer you to neurologist during the flare up for the follow up and change of therapy.If you cannot get in to see your doctor for quite awhile, ask to have a consult over email or over the phone. Getting feedback from your doctor is important, even if it is not in person.
While initial diagnosis and ongoing monitoring of multiple sclerosis therapy, blood tests, and adverse effects of treatment can be addressed by your primary care doctor, periods of flare ups should be addressed by neurologist.;
, There are some MS flare symptoms that will get worse for a while but then go away. This is due to central nervous system inflammation that eventually decreases. Discuss all new and changing symptoms with your doctor and decide whether they need immediate treatment or if you can wait to see if they go away on their own.Some symptoms that may not need treatment include mild sensory changes and increased levels of fatigue, as long as they don't limit a person's activities. These mild sensory changes include feelings of numbness or pins-and-needles sensations. However, fatigue may be one of the first sign of a MS flare up coming on.

, Don’t wait until your symptoms become severe, or some changes may be irreversible. Most experts believe in initiating therapy early before inflammatory processes worsen the injury to the nervous system., If you are having a severe flare, then you may need treatment with medication. It is a severe flare if the symptoms are interfering with your daily life or your ability to function safely. This type of symptom flare could include loss of vision, loss of balance, tingling in your in your hands and feet, incontinence, memory loss, depression, extreme weakness, or an inability to move.Treatment for this type of flare-up usually includes a round of corticosteroids. A high dose of IV corticosteroids, sometimes followed up with a longer course of oral steroids, can help to eliminate inflammation in the central nervous system.
Common corticosteroids that are used for flare-ups include methylprednisone and prednisone.
There are other drugs used in managing remission-flare ups of MS such as disease-modifying/immunomodulating drugs which have been shown to greatly reduce relapses. However, it can take a few tries to find the drug that works best for the individual, and these drugs are available only by injection., If you have lost some level of function due to a flare in your MS, it's important to work to get it back. For example, losses in movement and balance can be counteracted in many cases by targeted physical therapy and losses in speech can be worked on with a speech therapist.Even setbacks with memory and mental acuity can be worked on with a cognitive remediation specialist.
Discuss your rehabilitation options with your doctor, your physical therapist, and any other health professional you deal with due to your MS.

, While it is important to continue on with your life even when having a MS flare, you need to keep your safety and comfort in mind. Thus, if you are having a flare you may need to adjust your activities so that you can avoid pain or so that you can protect your safety.


For example, if you are having increased instability when standing or walking, you may need to use helpful equipment. This could include a wheelchair, cane, or crutches.

, If you are having a MS flare, you may need to address the psychological impact of the setback, along with the physical impacts it is causing. This could be as simple as talking to family and friends about how the flare is making you feel so that you can get their emotional support.


Dealing with the psychological impact of the setback could also require discussing your problems with a professional, such as a psychologist or a therapist.

, While individuals with MS can have vastly different symptoms, there are some that are more common. Some common symptoms include:Fatigue
Walking difficulties
Numbness
Tingling
Stiffness
Spasms
Weakness
Vision problems
Dizziness
Bowel problems
Bladder problems
Sexual problems
Pain
Emotional changes
Cognitive changes
Depression

, There are some symptoms of MS that are less common but could still be related to the condition. If you have any of these symptoms, you may be having a flare:Speech problems
Swallowing problems
Tremors
Seizures
Breathing problems
Itching
Headache
Hearing loss

, In order to gauge whether your symptoms have increased or new ones have emerged, it's important to keep track of the symptoms you already have and how severe they are. Use a tracking form, which can be found online, to track your symptoms day by day.Tracking your symptoms closely can help your doctor to stay updated with your treatment's progress, as well as tracking any setbacks.

, If you have MS, it is very important that you take your medications regularly. The drugs your doctor prescribes can help keep your symptoms under control and can help to prevent flare-ups.If you are unable to cope with the side effects from your medications, don't just stop taking them. Instead, talk to your doctor about the side effects and what can be done to minimize them.

, Stress can trigger MS flare ups, so do your best to avoid stressful situations. Use relaxation techniques, meditation, or yoga to keep your stress level down., Many people with MS can get a flare when they are exposed to hot temperatures, whether it be from hot weather or being in a room that is extremely hot. It is best to try and avoid this situation if at all possible, in order to keep flares to a minimum.In order to avoid getting overheated, stay out of the direct sun and avoid activities that will cause you to get overheated. Additionally, make use of air-conditioners and cool beverages to stay cool.
Avoid taking a very hot showers which can worsen symptoms.

, Even a fever can bring on flares, so be careful when ill that you take measures to avoid getting a fever. This could include taking medication to keep your illness under control or taking a cooling bath or shower when you are beginning to get overheated from the illness.


If you are sick, you should see your doctor. They should be able to advise you about how to keep a fever at bay.

, The healthier you are, the more likely it is you will be able to keep the symptoms of your MS at bay. For instance, getting ill, such as getting the flu, can set you back and cause flare-ups. In order to avoid illness, get regular medical care, use preventative care, such as the flu shot, and avoid unhealthy activities and foods.An example of an unhealthy activity that can make your MS flare-up is smoking. In order to take care of your health, you should consider quitting smoking.
When exercising, which is important for your health, you should make sure not to get too overheated, which can cause an MS flare. Make an exercise plan with your medical professional so that you can balance the need for exercise with the need to stay cool.

, Local and online support groups can be a wonderful way to connect with others with MS. To find local or online support group go to National Multiple Sclerosis Society and enter your zip code to find a group near you or to join an online group."

Women who have heavy menstruation, or who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or have recently given birth are at a higher risk of developing iron-deficiency anemia.
Furthermore, people who have undergone major surgery and/or physical trauma accompanied by heavy bleeding, have gastrointestinal conditions like Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis, or have peptic ulcers are also at risk for having iron-deficiency anemia due to bleeding tendencies associated with these diseases.;
, Eating unhealthy food such as those bought from fast food chains could lead to series of health conditions including anemia. Maintaining a healthy diet that is rich in iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid can help you gain a healthy body.


Such vitamins and minerals can be found in: vegetables such as spinach, beetroot, and tomatoes; fruits such as pomegranates, peaches, and prunes; and moderate consumption of red meat. The recommended dietary allowance for iron in both male and female are as follows:
7-12 months – 11 mg; 1-3 years – 7 mg; 4-8 years – 10 mg; 9-13 years – 8 mg; 14-18 years – 12 mg; 19-50 years – 12 mg; 51 years and older – 8 mg.
For vitamin B12, the recommended daily allowance for both male and female are as follows: 1-3 years – 0.9 mcg; 4-8 years – 1.2 mcg; 9-13 years – 1.8 mcg; 14 years and older – 2.4 mcg; Pregnant women – 2.6 mcg; and Breastfeeding women – 2.8 mcg.
The recommended dietary allowance for folic acid for male and female includes: Birth to 6 months – 65 mcg; 7-12 months – 80 mcg; 1-3 years – 150 mcg; 4-8 years – 200 mcg; 9-13 years – 300 mcg; 14-18 years – 400 mcg; and for 19 years and above – 400 mcg.

, Hormones play a crucial role in maintaining health and thus preventing anemia. However, in cases where certain hormone levels are unstable, there is a significantly increased chance of developing certain diseases which lead to anemia.


For example, hypothyroidism or low levels of thyroid hormones may cause anemia. A low level of thyroid hormones significantly affects erythropoiesis (the process of making red blood cells in the bone marrow) which in turn decreases the level of red blood cells in the blood stream, causing anemia.
In women who are in their perimenopausal stage, levels of estrogen tend to increase, resulting in uterine overgrowth and breakdown, leading to irregular heavy bleeding causing anemia.

, Many diseases can cause anemia and these include:


Crohn’s disease (a disease which causes digestive bleeding)
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (an autoimmune disease which causes blood abnormalities leading to heavy menstruation and gastrointestinal bleeding)
Chronic Kidney Disease (a disease wherein your kidneys fail to produce sufficient quantities of a hormone called erythropoietin, which stimulates the bone marrow to produce red blood cells).

, Pregnant women need to increase their intake of dietary iron to support their own health, along with their baby's. When insufficient iron is given to body, it may result in a decreased production of red blood cells causing anemia.

, Inherited conditions are from genetic linkages or anemia being transferred from parents to children. One type of genetic anemia is called aplastic anemia.


This kind of anemia is rare but often a serious health condition where the bone marrow which produces blood cells fails to do its job and results in decreased levels of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
Sickle cell anemia is an inherited disease with a lifelong course. People with this condition tends to have sickle-shaped blood cells instead of the normal “doughnut” shaped cell. Sickle cells also tend to be stiff and sticky, leading to an increased risk of blood flow blockage.
In thalassemia, blood hemoglobin lacks the specific protein chains it needs in order to do its function. Thalassemia can either be Thalassemia major or Thalassemia minor depending on the inherited faulty gene from both or one parent, respectively.
Hemolytic anemia occurs when the bone marrow is unable to replace the red blood cells and is destroyed earlier than the normal life span of 120 days. Symptoms vary from mild to severe. This type of anemia quite often can be treated and controlled, though this depends on the severity of the condition.

, Typically, people with this kind of anemia often feel tired and sluggish. This is due to the fact that the red blood cells do not function efficiently when transporting oxygen to different parts of the body. Common symptoms may also include:


Poor appetite, slowed growth and developmental/behavioral problems in infants, pale skin, weak nails, headaches, and dizziness, as the decreased red blood cells in the circulation disrupt bodily metabolism.
Most people with this type of anemia crave unusual non-food substances like ice, dirt, and laundry starch which, according to studies, is a normal behavioral response to iron-deficiency anemia.
Overtime, a person with this type of anemia may develop the so-called restless leg syndrome which creates a creepy-crawly sensation on the arms and legs. Further study is required to explain the relationship between restless leg syndrome and anemia, but 20% of patients with restless leg syndrome also have anemia.

, This type of anemia is caused by a Vitamin B12 deficiency and it is often characterized by feelings of tiredness accompanied by a sensation of having cold hands and feet.


This is because vitamin B12 is needed in the production and maturation of red blood cells which stabilize bodily metabolism.
Over the span of time where the vitamin deficiency is not treated, nerve problems may occur such as numbness and tingling of the upper and lower extremities, muscle weakness, irritability, and the possibility of walking problems because vitamin B12 is needed by the nerves to function efficiently and regulate movement mechanisms.

, Symptoms of decreased red blood cells may include the following: tiredness, weakness, shortness of breath, pale skin, dizziness, headaches, and chest pains.


Additionally, decreased white blood cell production symptoms may also include: fever, infections, and lingering flu-like symptoms because the functions of white blood cells is to fight infection throughout the body.
Furthermore, decreased platelet production is associated with bleeding, bruising, petechiae (red spots), nose bleeds, bloody stool, and skin rash because the main function of platelets are to stop bleeding tendencies.

, Certain specified symptoms are associated with this type of anemia and these symptoms includes:


Jaundice (yellowish discoloration of the skin), pain in the upper abdomen, reddish to brown urine, enlarged spleen, leg ulcers and pain.
The symptoms included may resemble other medical problems associated with blood disorders, so the patient will need to be tested extensively before a diagnosis is made.

, Miscarriage or stillbirth is a severe manifestation of alpha thalassemia, a form of thalassemia. stillbirth happens because affected fetuses suffer from severe anemia and heart failure during the course of the mother’s pregnancy. Additional symptoms include:


Bone deformities, as the bone mineral metabolism is usually affected by this condition; jaundice occurs from high levels of bilirubin (an end-product of hemoglobin degradation); enlargement of the spleen, liver, and heart occurs due to excessive destruction of abnormal red blood cells; and presenting a pale and listless appearance.
In patients with thalassemia minor, there may be small red blood cells but no obvious symptoms. However, in thalassemia major, infants in their first year of life often progress to having severe anemia which results in slowed growth and bone problems.

, The most common symptom of sickle cell anemia is bodily fatigue due to lack of oxygen in the blood. Sudden pain may affect the bones, lungs, abdomen, and joints as a result of sickle cell crisis.


The pain can either be acute or chronic. Acute pain associated with sickle cell crisis often lasts for hours or even days. Chronic pain lasts for weeks to months and may limit your daily activities. It can also be very mentally draining.
Subsequent and prolonged sickle cell crises can damage your bones, kidneys, lung, and heart.

, Most infants with this type of anemia develop birth defects which include bone defects, eye and ear defects, skin discoloration, and congenital heart defects. They may also have developmental problems such as low birth weight, slow growth, small head size, lower than normal height, and intellectual disability.


Adults may manifest symptoms such as less developed sex organs, starting menstruation earlier, starting menopause earlier, and experiencing difficulty in getting pregnant and carrying pregnancy full term.
All of these symptoms are due to the fact that fanconi anemia greatly affects the bone marrow, resulting in abnormal red blood cells leading to developmental delays and multi-organ dysfunction.

, If your doctor suspects that you have iron-deficiency anemia, he/she will likely work you up for series of tests which including a complete blood count (CBC).


This is a test which measures the number of red blood cells and white blood cells, and also measures the levels of hemoglobin (the red pigment in the blood), levels of hematocrit (the proportion of red blood cells in the blood), and the mean cell volume (the volume for the average red blood cell in a given sample) by drawing a blood sample, usually from veins located inside of the elbow and back of the hands.
The person may feel a little pain upon the insertion of the needle and slight throbbing upon the withdrawal of blood.

, A serum ferritin test measures the amount of ferritin (the blood cell protein that contains iron) using a blood sample.


The blood sample is then tested using the serum iron test (which measures the level of iron in the blood serum) and the total iron binding capacity test (which assesses your body’s ability to transfer iron)
The serum iron test and the total iron binding capacity test can be helpful if the serum ferritin level ranges from 46 to 99 microgram per liter. However, a bone marrow biopsy may be necessary for a definitive diagnosis.

, This test is done with no special preparations, but the doctor will first check your blood pressure and heart rate. The procedure can be done by a hematologist, oncologist, nurse, or a specialized medical technologist.


The bone marrow exam takes at least 30 minutes. Local anesthesia is used at the injection site to reduce the pain. A large bore needle is used to collect the bone marrow tissue from the chosen site, which is usually at the top ridge back of the hipbone. For infants, the site is on the lower leg part.
You may feel a little pain upon insertion and after the procedure you may feel tenderness within the area for a week or more. For clients whose symptoms and physical evaluations are negative, a trial for iron approach can be considered and checked for one month.

, Serum vitamin B12 is the commonly used method for diagnosing this type of anemia. A serum B12 amount of less than 111 pmol/mL may reliably indicate deficiency.


While an amount less than 89 pmol/mL can define neurological deficiency. Folic acid levels should also be known because folic acid co-exists with vitamin B12 levels. Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead also to deficient red cell folate levels.
The test is performed by withdrawing a blood sample from the vein inside the elbow. which will make you feel a little pain upon insertion. The doctor may also request that you avoid eating or drinking for 6- 8 hours before the test.
Bone marrow aspiration can also be used to find a distinctive diagnosis for vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiency. Bone marrow aspiration is done by making a small incision (usually on the back of the hipbone) before inserting a needle into the bone marrow. The doctor will then withdraw bone marrow fluid. You may feel a short sharp pain as the needle is inserted. The procedure should only take a few minutes.

, A complete blood count is the initial step for a diagnosis of aplastic anemia. In aplastic anemia, the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and reticulocytes (immature red blood cells) in the blood is insufficient, resulting in several complications that can lead to organ disfunction over time.


Hemoglobin electrophoresis (a test for the different types of hemoglobin in the blood stream) can show elevated levels of fetal hemoglobin (a hemoglobin type found in newborn babies), which are also observed in patients with aplastic anemia.
The test is done by withdrawing a blood sample from the vein inside of the elbow or at the back of the hands. A bone marrow biopsy may also be done to check for the blood cells quantitatively and qualitatively. In aplastic anemia, the blood cells tend to be hypo-cellular, which means that there are abnormally few blood cells in circulation.

, The first step in diagnosing this type of anemia is getting a complete blood count to check for the following: red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, hemoglobin, and hematocrit. Other blood tests include:


Reticulocyte count, as these cells are often present in high amounts in hemolytic anemia. The doctor will ask you if you do have hemophilia (a blood clotting disorder), fainting history, and other conditions before taking this test.
Haptoglobin test, this is a test to measure the levels of haptoglobin (a chemical that combines with hemoglobin). Levels of this tend to be low in hemolytic anemia.
Test for bilirubin levels. If these are high, it can suggest the presence of this kind of anemia. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy can also be done.

, A complete blood count is again the initial step. Patients with thalassemia often have few healthy red blood cells and low hemoglobin levels. Those who have alpha or beta thalassemia traits tend to have smaller sized red blood cells.


Prenatal testing can also be done by taking a sample of amniotic fluid/tissue from the mother’s placenta called amniocentesis. This test can show if the baby has thalassemia and how severe it may.
The doctor will use an ultrasound providing a guide for the insertion. You will be asked to lie on your back, exposing your abdomen. A thin, hollow needle will be inserted into the uterus to take a sample of fluid.

, A simple blood test for hemoglobin can detect if a person has sickle cell anemia.


Doctors can also diagnose whether a baby has sickle cell anemia before birth by taking a sample of amniotic fluid/tissue from the placenta.
This test can be done as early as 10 weeks of pregnancy to determine the sickle cell gene.

, Genetic testing is the primary approach in diagnosing fanconi anemia. A chromosome breakage test is often used. If FA is present, chromosomes in the blood sample tend to break and rearrange when mixed with test chemicals.


Cytometric flow analysis: If FA is present, the chromosomes in the blood will tend to break rapidly upon receiving a test chemical.
Mutation screening: This detects mutations in your genes and usually uses skin cells.

"
The first step is to really LISTEN to, and BELIEVE the individual.,
Grief is something that comes later, when an individual starts to realise and have to accept that there are things they are no longer able to do.,
Help the individual during the time taken to diagnosis this condition.,
Take the time to research and read about this condition in order to help them to deal with this condition.,
It takes time and understanding to help them deal with their limitations.,
Let them do the things they wish to do (such as cleaning house, shopping, arts and crafts, or light yard work ... Don't fuss at them even though you feel that they will ultimately hurt because of their efforts.,
Be there to pick them up when they crash or ""hit the wall"", either physically or emotionally.,
Remember that symptoms will vary from day to day.",How to Help People Newly Diagnosed With Fibromyalgia," If you really care for a person, why would you think they could or would make up a tale about having unexplained or uncontrollable pain. Especially pain that isn't eased by medicine.;
, It can be something as simple as not be able to hold a knife or a peeler to prepare veg. It is part of the process, and comes in stages; as fibromyalgia slowly manifests itself, it causes a real loss in all areas of life. What matters most to them may not be what you think, their priorities may be different. Give them time to grieve and don't expect the person with fibromyalgia to be cheery about it and take care of your feelings.

, Diagnosing fibromyalgia is limited to information gathering rather than lab tests, x-rays, etc. The symptoms are numerous and can mimic other symptoms of illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and other medical conditions - it is a process of elimination in most instances and this can be timely and tiring.


Go to doctor's appointments with them and explain their symptoms to the doctor. Doctors don't listen to what the patient says, they're too concerned with the patient's body language, tone, a thousand symptoms the patient may not even be aware of. Specialists will read these symptoms within their specialty. Doctors do listen to caretakers and healthy friends or family members of a sick person, so you can eliminate lengthy, costly misdiagnoses with this simple favor. Also, pain and fatigue from fibromyalgia can interfere with the patient's ability to communicate in an organized way, while you're not being sick gives you the advantage of being able to present the information in a more coherent way.

, Many with fibromyalgia feel that people don't understand their condition and this creates a great deal of anxiety and ultimately feelings of doubt. Stress causes symptoms to flare, so anxiety and doubt will make your loved one a lot sicker, often very fast.

, Self-worth becomes an issue as time goes by and they begin to realize they are limited and can no longer do the things they once could. It's also important not to expect them to do things they can't or get angry if they try some day to day activity and fail.


Fatigue may make them crabby and tearful like a toddler who's been up too long without a nap. Understand this and don't pick up a circular argument at the point your loved one is stumbling like a drunk. That can set off a bigger flare and make things go worse fast.
Don't ask your loved one to remind you of things. The shame of forgetting to give a reminder is excruciating. It's like asking the guy who's got a bad back to pick up a heavy load - just remembering to take medications on time and other necessary routine things is an enormous effort for someone with fibromyalgia.
Pain can have the same effects on mood as depression, the big difference is that pain medication lightens mood as fast as the right anti-depressant does for someone with chronic fatigue. If your loved one starts spiraling down and sounds hopeless, miserable, fault finding with self or others, defeated... just ask if they've taken their pain medication. That reminder can spare them hours of agony. Even if they are depressed, the pain makes it so much worse that the pills will probably help.

, Learning their limitations is one of the hardest things they will have to deal with.


Likewise, don't count on them for routine tasks and activities. Life for someone with fibromyalgia becomes a matter of seizing ""Launch windows"" when their body's functioning better than usual, to accomplish as much as possible before the crash. Let them set the pace and don't get angry when they can't manage something they thought they could. Almost all people with fibromyalgia overestimate what they can do and make plans they can't carry through on. It can take years to learn how to plan around it and even then, plans always have to be flexible.
Don't pressure them to do things. Remember that when you're trying to get them to pick up some of the housecleaning or go out to an event with you, they're weighing that against being able to take a shower, get dressed afterwards or manage to get out of bed. You can't judge what they're capable of by what they manage on their good days when they're pushing hard because they want something. That activity you find so exciting that you think would be so good for them may not be possible or may not be practical compared to something else they'd rather do with their limited energy.

, Learning to deal with Fibromyalgia takes time and the more support you can give them in the early days, the easier you can make this process. It's a learning process for both of you. Many things you take for granted in life are no longer practical or can't be counted on for someone with fibromyalgia.

, This can be frustrating and make life unpredictable. Try to ""go with the flow"" as much as possible and not make the person feel guilty for breaking plans at the last minute.


Always assume that your loved one is trying as hard as possible to keep up with life. It's much more common for people with fibromyalgia to overestimate what they can do and try too hard than to lay back and give up.

Try not to eat foods that contain gluten, if any at all.,
Do some research to find out what foods typically have gluten in them.,
Read ingredient labels as this is the only way to truly know if gluten is in the products you're buying.,
Look for gluten-free items on restaurant menus.,
Seek the advice of a nutritionist/dietitian specializing in gluten-free diets to know more about what you can and cannot eat, what alternatives you can use for the food you will not be able to consume, and more importantly, to learn how to build a menu that will provide your body the required nutrients it needs to function while still being interesting and palatable.

,
Follow your gluten-free diet strictly.,
Talk to your doctor about any drugs that can help aid in absorption that can help you increase your intake of nutrients.,
Participate in a celiac disease support group.,
Note any symptoms you have if you start having a flare.,The FDA requires food to state that they are GF on the products package (gluten free) if they are under 20 ppm, parts per million.",How to Live With Celiac Disease," Gluten is found in foods made with grains, like breads, pastas and snacks containing wheat, rye,barley and malt. The gluten in oats is still under investigation as to whether is has the same effect on the body. Any kind of flour can contain gluten.


Some foods you can eat are those made of corn, buckwheat, nuts and legumes, rice, potato, and millet.

, The obvious offenders are breads and pastas, but beer, various condiments, boxed foods and bakery items may contain gluten as well.

, With the new requirements of listing allergy information on labels, all products containing wheat or gluten should be advertised as such. Look for the nutrition box on the packaging; the ingredients list and allergy information are usually in the same vicinity. Read all the fine print.


This is important because some processed foods like bouillon cubes, french fries, and even soy sauce may contain gluten.

, If you don't see any, ask your server if there are any dishes that aren't made with gluten. If your server doesn't know, the chef or manager on duty should be able to find the information for you. Your knowledge of gluten products will come in handy here.

,, If you do not do so you run the risk of developing severe and potentially life-threatening complications such as other autoimmune disorders, intestinal cancer, anemia, liver disease, hypoglycemia, and bone diseases.

, You may be able to participate in a clinical trial as well. A daily multivitamin can help give you the nutrients you need. In rare cases your doctor may prescribe corticosteroids like prednisone.

, You can find one online or ask your doctor if he knows of any local groups.


The Celiac Disease Foundation, Celiac Sprue Association, and the Gluten Intolerance Group are some examples of the many support groups you can join.

, Keeping a food journal will help you pinpoint triggers. This will help you eliminate problem foods.


The typical symptoms of Celiac disease in children include constipation, abdominal pain, bloating, nausea and vomiting, indigestion and decreased appetite leading to weight loss, lactose intolerance, intermittent diarrhea, and stools that are smelly, bloody, and ""fatty"".
Adults are less likely to experience symptoms that are digestive in nature. Instead the disease may present in the form of unexplained iron-deficiency anemia, seizures, osteoporosis, missed menstrual periods, infertility, tingling and numbness of the extremities, and a skin rash called dermatitis herpetiformis.

Get enough sleep.,
Reduce sunlight exposure.,
Try meditation.,
Get regular moderate exercise.,
Avoid large groups of people or people who are sick.,
Engage in activities that provide comfort.",How to Handle a Lupus Flare1," One of the known symptoms of a lupus flare is fatigue. A person suffering from a lupus flare needs adequate rest to overcome their symptoms and go about their daily activities.Try to get at least eight hours of sleep at night. Get yourself into a routine by going to bed and waking up at the same time each day.
Naps during the day can also help to reduce fatigue.;
, Many lupus flares are triggered by sunlight exposure. Therefore, it's important that you protect yourself from sunlight by wearing sunglasses and using an umbrella to shield your skin from direct sunlight.Avoiding direct sunlight and reducing sunlight exposure, as simple as it may seem, can make a big difference in the frequency and severity of lupus flares.
Also remember to wear sunscreen with a sun protection factor of at least 55 before going outside, even on cloudy days (harmful UV rays can penetrate the clouds).
Use sun protection and go out in the sun only when absolutely necessary.

, Stress can lead to a lupus flare.Meditation can be used as a technique to calm the body and mind. It is often used by people suffering from illness to attain physical relaxation, mental calmness, and psychological balance.Some evidence suggests that meditation can help improve the quality of life for lupus patients in particular.Mindfulness meditation is a simple and effective way to begin a practice of daily meditation:Sit in a comfortable position, whether in a chair, cross-legged, or kneeling.
Begin to pay attention to your breathing. Your mind will eventually wander. When you catch your mind wandering, bring your attention back to your own breathing.
Don’t stop to dwell on or judge your thoughts.
Continue this process for a short time, such as five minutes if you are trying it for the first time. Repeat this practice frequently, at least once a day. As you begin to practice mindfulness meditation regularly, you can gradually increase the length of the sessions, if you desire.

, Exercise is good for your physical health and it can also help to control stress, which often causes flare-ups.Try to get 30 minutes of moderate exercise every day.


Some good exercises to try include walking, biking, swimming, or taking an aerobics class.
Choose something that you like doing and that is appropriate for your current fitness level.

, People with lupus are more susceptible to viral infections, so it is best to avoid large crowds as much as possible.You may also want to steer clear of people when they are sick to protect yourself.

, Lupus may become a very painful disease. However, there are a few ways to handle the pain and make your day more comfortable. These techniques can also help reduce stress, lessening the risk of a flare.


One of these comfort measures is a good massage. A good massage can be very relaxing and soothing, as it can help to relieve both joint pain and systemic pain.
See a massage therapist, perform self-massage or ask a family member or friend to massage the painful area for you.
Use heat therapy. Another way to ease pain and promote comfort is by using heat. For example, a hot shower or a hot bath can ease systemic pain. For localized pain, a hot towel or a hot compress can be placed over the affected joint or area.
Make sure the hot compress or hot towel does not burn the skin. Place a dry towel around the hot compress if it is too hot.
Heat helps to relieve pain by increasing the blood circulation at the site of the pain.

For example, look at the TV guide and find when your favorite programs start. Look up online games that can entertain you, or play (massively multiplayer online role playing games).


Video games can occupy some idle time, but avoid being addicted to them. This can be a strong temptation, but you may regret it after you get better. When it comes to any idle activity, manage your time. Every 30 minutes take a 5 minute stretch or have a drink of water.
Stay on top of schoolwork if you are a student. Homework may not be the most entertaining thing to do, but it is definitely something you should. Likewise, homework requires time. It's best to work on your homework in parts rather than leave the entire thing for the night before it is due. If you are missing out on homework because of your condition, try to keep up with readings and lessons. Ask someone in your classes to send you notes or keep you up to date with what homework is being assigned. You may also ask your teacher about these things.
Take up intellectual hobbies if you're no longer in school. Many science projects welcome online volunteers and you'd be amazed at how much research can be done while you're in bed. If you liked science in school, you can help with real projects on the Internet.
Take up online activism, look into causes you're passionate about and see if you can put in some time spreading the word on social media like Facebook and Twitter.;
, Try keeping yourself busy with products that are not electronic, since staring at a screen all day can get old and is hard on your eyes. Some examples of non-electronic things include:


Literary entertainment. Read a book. Pick anything you enjoy, experiment with authors and genres.
Write a letter or an article, perhaps to a newspaper, or even a wikiHow article.
Toys, such as Etch-A-Sketch
Board games. Correspondence chess is great.
Puzzles, such as Sudoku (Some newspapers have them, but they are also free online), or crossword puzzles.
Get some interesting craft books: These products can be found at a local craft store/online. Some come with the materials included, which saves on effort and money. Crafts can include knitting, crochet, jewelry making, beading, leather crafts, whittling, braiding, paints, sketchbooks, sculpting, weaving, and much more.

, These will help you express your feelings and promote mental health, likewise giving you something to do. You can also browse through other people's blogs/journals for interesting information and all sorts of things.


If you enjoy blogging, consider creating multiple online blogs on different topics you're knowledgeable about. Getting readers and attention is very good for morale and you're doing a public service with your niche column on something you personally love. You'll also meet others who love it doing this. Answer all comments on your blogs unless they're from trolls.

, This can be very entertaining and it keeps your mind sharp. These days, you can buy a decent inexpensive guitar, or consider a pair of drumsticks and a practice pad (electronic drum). You can look for tutorials online, especially on YouTube.

The tin whistle or penny whistle is a flute-like instrument that's very easy to learn, small and can be handled in bed. Practice is easier if it doesn't involve getting up and moving around as much.

, Find free online courses in drawing and painting, start with a sketchbook and some charcoal and pencils. It's a lifetime study and learning how to draw realistically can gain a lot of social attention or even some money. At the point you can draw one popular subject well, other people will give you cash for your drawings.


Because learning to draw takes a long time, start posting your daily art online. You can see your progress a lot easier if you look back to last week's or last month's drawings to tell how much you've improved.
Get involved in art communities to socialize, get support and encouragement and teaching from more experienced artists. You'll improve faster and enjoy art more with online friends cheering you on.

, If you have Mononucleosis, this is a bad idea. You can spend bad days researching recipes and studying cooking, then pull your ideas together in a grand performance on a good day. Planning is tons better than moping.

, Crafts, baked goods, cards, ATCs (Artist Trading Cards) or anything you have the know-how to build that can be done on a low energy day is a good idea. Power tools are a good idea, especially something like a Dremel tool where you can polish or shape stones and wood to make jewelry, small boxes or puzzles.

, Light exercise is good to stretch your muscles and control your weight. Invest in some hand weights or an exercise ball to keep the pounds at bay. You can also try yoga or tai chi.

, Dream about anything in the world. Experiment with lucid dreaming. Lie down and think of something pleasant. If you doze off, you will sleep pleasantly.

, Write a short story, poem, or novel about whatever you feel. Think about your old friends. Send a kind letter to a neighbor/friend you admire anonymously.


Every year in November, an online event called <a href=""http:NaNoWriMo</a> brings together hundreds of thousands of people creating a 50,000 word novel within a month. Participate, and if you don't finish your novel within November, keep going on it till it's done.

, Make a special playlist (without any music that tires or stresses you) to listen to while you are sick.


Judge your playlist on how you feel listening to the music, not on what other people think of it. Some people feel a lot happier listening to heavy metal or angry punk music than they would music that gets labeled ""Soothing."" Go with what you really feel.

, Chill with buddies. Hang out online in chat rooms.

, Maybe there are a few tricks your pet can learn that you've been meaning to teach them for awhile.

, Put your most precious thoughts down on paper, or just express the artistic side of you.

, Fun ways to learn are to watch YouTube videos, listen to music, and watch TV all in the language of your choice. It adds dimension to average entertainment, and opens your eyes to a new culture.


If you're learning a new language, socialize with others taking the class and visit websites in that language. Constant exposure will help you learn faster and retain it much easier.

, Once you stop worrying about it, it'll put your mind at ease and you can get to sleep.

, Goals that may have seemed impractical years ago like writing a novel, becoming an artist, becoming involved in science may turn out to be easier than doing the everyday things you used to do. Sort out what you really want in life and then start putting it together little by little.

, You'll feel relaxed and rejuvenated.


Try out that new facial you never had time for before, or maybe a new foot-scrub. Soak in the bath-tub to pass some time or try a new way to do your hair.

, There are even clubs of people who enjoy origami.

Eat the right kinds of foods.,
Eat more fruits and vegetables.,
Consume the right meats.,
Increase fiber intake.,
Avoid certain foods.,
Take supplements.",How to Heal Fibromyalgia Naturally1," Though it is not widely accepted in mainstream medicine, fibromyalgia is considered to have inflammatory or chemical-sensitive components. Because of this, following an anti-inflammatory diet can be beneficial. The anti-inflammatory diet emphasizes whole foods, preferably organic foods if possible. It also avoids all preservative and additives.


On this diet, avoid all processed and prepared foods.;
, You should increase the number of fruits and vegetables you eat every day. Fruits should constitute about half of your food intake per day. Include a variety of fruits, especially berries such as blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, gooseberries, and blackberries. They have antioxidants and other components that have anti-inflammatory properties.Make sure to also include a variety of vegetables. Dark leafy greens, such as Swiss chard, spinach, mustard greens, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and field greens, have tons of vitamin E, which help reduce inflammatory molecules in your body., There are certain kinds of meats that can help you decrease inflammation related to fibromyalgia. Increase fatty fish, which contain omega-3 fatty acids. These are natural anti-inflammatory substances. This includes salmon, tuna, cod, and other fresh fishes.Avoid red meat unless it is grass-fed and organic.

, Foods high in fiber have been shown to help reduce inflammation markers in the blood. Eat more foods with whole grains, such as wheat bread, whole wheat pasta, long grain brown rice, and other healthy grains.Nuts, rich in fiber as well as antioxidants and other inflammation fighting vitamins and minerals, can help repair damage caused by inflammation., There are certain foods and condiments that you should avoid. This includes sugar and sugar substitutes that are not naturally derived, such as Splenda or Equal. Also avoid hot beverages, alcohol, coffee, and hot spicy foods. These can open up the blood vessels and cause flushing, which leads to inflammation.


You can, however, add in spices such as ginger, turmeric, and garlic, which have anti-inflammatory properties. You can also use naturally derived sweeteners, such as honey, agave nectar, Stevia, or Monk Fruit., There are some supplements that you can take along with the anti-inflammatory diet that can help you treat fibromyalgia or treat the symptoms of the disease. Before you take any of these, ask your doctor. When taking them, always follow manufacturer’s instructions. You can take B-complex vitamins, vitamin C, vitamin D, magnesium, zinc, and selenium. You can also take fatty acids, such as omega-3 fatty acids found if fish oil and other supplements.


You can also take 5-HTP, which is a precursor for serotonin, one of the neurotransmitters that helps people sleep.
Look into nervine herbs. There are a number of safe and effective herbs that can help get you some restful sleep. Consult a qualified health professional and ask them about using valerian, chamomile, or passionflower to help you get better sleep.
Try out probiotics, which can help support your immune system."
"
Take corticosteroids.,
Use NSAIDs.,
Try immunosuppressants.,
Take anti-malarial drugs.",How to Handle a Lupus Flare2," Corticosteroids are drugs that reduce inflammation. They can also decrease joint pain, inflammation from rashes and headaches. Low doses of oral or topical corticosteroids are often offered as a means of managing lupus cases that do not involve major organ systems.Your physician can prescribe the right corticosteroid and dosage to treat your case of lupus. Ask your physician about potential side effects of the corticosteroid that he or she recommends, and how to manage them.

, Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and naproxen sodium can help with the pain felt during lupus flares. However, lupus patients are more susceptible to complications caused by taking NSAIDs (including hypertension and renal dysfunction), so discuss this method of treatment with your physician before beginning it., For serious lupus flares, immunosuppressants can be used. In lupus, it has been established that the body's own immune system attacks the body's cells. Immunosuppressant medications can decrease this immune response of the body, lessening its effects., In some cases of lupus, antimalarial drugs can be used to treat joint pain, rashes, fatigue, and other symptoms of flares. Your physician can determine if anti-malarial medications such as hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate may provide you some relief. He or she can also discuss potential side effects, which include:Digestive problems such as stomach, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea
Headache and/or dizziness
Blurred vision
Trouble sleeping
Itchiness

Consult your physician before beginning any alternative treatments.,
Take dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) supplements.,
Introduce flaxseed to your diet.,
Consume fish oil.,
Follow an anti-inflammatory diet.,
Experiment with an herb called astragalus.",How to Handle a Lupus Flare3," Research on lupus is still ongoing, and there is much about the disease that is still unknown and unverified by scientific evidence. For this reason, there are a number of traditional and alternative treatments that might help reduce your lupus flares, even if they are not yet widely adopted. However, you should discuss these treatments with your physician before beginning any of them.


Your physician will need to be informed about all treatments you are using, so that he or she can provide you the most effective care plan.
Your physician can also tell you about potential side effects or complications of using an alternative treatment method, based on your particular case and symptoms.

, This type of medication, a weakly androgenetic steroid, can stabilize the symptoms of lupus, as studies have shown an inverse relationship between the levels of androgen in the body and the progression of lupus. Ask your physician if this treatment is right for your case, and about potential side effects (such as acne-like skin eruptions)., Flaxseed is a substance thought to lessen inflammation. There is some indication that it may help kidney function in some lupus patients (kidneys are some of the organs most affected by lupus).Try adding flaxseeds to cereal or to tomato or orange juice.
Flaxseeds can also be taken in the form of flaxseed oil. The recommended daily dose (usually only a teaspoon or two) can be taken with water or mixed with salad.

, Fish oil can also be used to handle lupus flares. Recent studies have shown a potential decrease in lupus flares among people taking fish oil regularly. Fish oil contains omega-3 which can help decrease inflammation.Fish oil is usually taken in the form of oral capsules.
Talk with your physician about the amount of fish oil you should take each day, based on your health condition.

, Because lupus is an inflammatory disease, eating a diet that reduces inflammation is important. Stick to fruits, vegetables, proteins, and other foods that do not promote inflammation and avoid foods that are known to cause inflammation.


Avoid the nightshade vegetables, which include peppers, eggplant, tomatoes, and white potatoes. These foods contain solanine that contributes to inflammation and pain., Astragalus (Astragalus membranaceus) is an herb that can be taken to reduce an overactive immune system in lupus patients.Astragalus root is boiled in water for a few minutes to make a brewed tea."
"
Avoid using birth control pills if possible.,
Learn to recognize a coming flare.Each person’s lupus case is different, and has different symptoms.,
Understand that infections can cause a lupus flare.,
Eat a healthy diet.,
Don’t over exert yourself physically.,
Find emotional support.,
Be aware that taking a new drug can also trigger a lupus flare.",How to Handle a Lupus Flare4," Birth control pills may cause lupus to flare up as well as raise the risk of developing lupus.Talk with your doctor about birth control alternatives if you are sexually active.

, Over time, you may come to recognize that a certain symptom, such as unusual fatigue or a rash, is associated with flares in your case. Once you recognize the signals of a coming flare, you can act beforehand to reduce its severity. For instance, if your signal of a flare is fatigue, make sure to get extra rest as soon as you begin to feel tired, as this may lessen the flare.

, If you have an infection of any sort, your chances of having a lupus flare increase. This is because viral or bacterial infections attack the immune system; this attack can trigger the flare.


Maintain your personal hygiene.
Wash your hands frequently in order to prevent the spread of microorganisms that could potentially cause infection. You should make sure to use water and soap when you wash your hands. If no water or soap is available, antibacterial gel such as hand sanitizer will do in a pinch.
Maintain a clean environment. While keeping yourself clean is important, keeping your environment bacteria free is also important to keep your immune system from being triggered. Clean all of the surfaces of your house with antibacterial cleaning supplies, vacuum or air carpets often, and wash your sheets and towels regularly.
Stay up to date on flu and pneumonia vaccines., Following a healthy diet may help to prevent future flare ups. Eat lots of whole foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. Try to minimize salt, fat, and animal protein. Avoid milk, dairy products, and red meat as well. Also stay away from caffeine, citrus fruits, paprika, salt, tobacco, and sugar as well.

, Physical stress from overworking and lack of rest can worsen the symptoms of lupus and cause a flare. Regular moderate exercise, however, can help reduce flare-ups and symptoms. Try to keep your activity levels and resting time balanced., Emotional stress is often caused by being confronted with a situation that you don’t necessarily know how to remedy, including long-term illnesses like lupus. Since avoiding stress is one way to reduce lupus flares, finding emotional support is important.Talk to a trusted family member or friend. Expressing how you are feeling can help to alleviate stress you feel. Your confidant may also be able to give you valuable insight.
Talk to a therapist who can give you professional tips on how to work through the situation that is causing you stress.
Ask your physician for information about support groups made of other people with lupus.

, Always talk to your doctor before starting or stopping a medication, including herbal medicines and supplements. Talk to a lupus specialist about the drugs that may cause your condition to get worse. Drugs that are commonly known to cause lupus flares include:


Antibiotics that contain sulfonamides
Some herbal drugs like echinacea
High-dose birth control pills
Penicillin

Find a support group.",How to Heal Fibromyalgia Naturally2," There is strong evidence that patients with fibromyalgia can benefit from exercise. Research has indicated that while it may be difficult to get motivated, mild-moderate physical activities is very effective for fibromyalgia. The idea is start with low impact physical activity like walking. It can be very tough to get started, so when you begin, don’t push too hard.


Get up once every hour or two and take a slow walk around your house or apartment building. Walk the dog two or three times more than you normally might. Take the stairs more often and park further away from the grocery store.
Try Tai Chi and Qigong. For a group activity, check your local area for classes. You can also look into yoga and low-impact aerobic exercise classes or groups.Make sure that you rest in between your exercise. Try to find a meditation class. The practice of meditation can significantly and positively impact your mood and your stress levels.

, Since fibromyalgia causes pain and muscle tension, a massage is a great way to help reduce these symptoms. The techniques used in massage can also help you relax as well as reduce your paint and stiffness. You can generally find certified massage therapists in all kinds of locations, such as massage parlors, spas, and gyms.


If you aren't sure, ask your doctor, friends, or family for a recommendation., In addition to meditation, try some deep breathing exercises to help you relax. There are a few breathing exercises that might help. For deep breathing, lie flat on your back. Try using pillows under your neck and knees to help you get comfortable. Put your hands on your stomach, palms down. Take a slow, long deep breath to expand your belly, breathing from your diaphragm. The diaphragm creates a heavy suction that pulls more air into your lungs than rib cage breathing. Repeat this as often as you are comfortable.


Your fingers should separate as they lie on your belly if you are doing it right.
You may get dizzy at first, which is normal because of the amount of air you are taking in. If at any time you feel uncomfortable, stop. , To add a layer to your deep breath, add a humming breath to it. Breathe as you would with deep breathing. As you exhale, make a humming sound with your throat. This action helps strengthen the diaphragm and can help you relax more., There is another breathing exercise that may help you relax more. For this exercise, sit down in a chair. Take three short inhalations through your nose. On the first intake of breathe, lift your arms. Reaching in front, keep the arms at shoulder level. On your second breathe, move your arms to the side. Keep your arms at shoulder levels during this breathe. On the third breathe, lift your arms up over your head.


Repeat this exercise in a series of 10 to 12.
If you get dizzy, stop. Your lungs will take over and return to your natural rhythm.

, Biofeedback is a technique that uses the mind and body to help control involuntary reactions, such as blood pressure, heart rate, and muscle tension. To start biofeedback, talk to your doctor. He will give you special equipment that will show you when your body is doing a certain thing. You can then use this equipment and your own actions to help you control those functions.


For example, if your heart rate is elevated, you can use the equipment and targeted mental and physical actions to help slow it down., There have been a few studies that have shown the benefit of acupuncture with the pain associated with fibromyalgia. Look into certified acupuncturist in your area or ask your doctor for a referral. To try it out, go to at least three visit before you make a decision on if it works for you. If it is, continue the treatment.


You may have to make a decision on whether or not acupuncture is cost effective for you. It can get expensive, so try to weigh the pros and cons of the treatments against the cost.Never try to perform acupuncture on yourself or let someone who doesn't know how perform it on you.

, Being diagnosed with fibromyalgia can be a difficult emotional process. Find a group of people that can go through this process along with you. This will help you feel less alone and you will be able to commiserate with those who have the same condition as you.


Two places to start are the Fibromyalgia Network and the National Fibromyalgia and Chronic Pain Association (NFMCPA)."
"
Learn about the disease.,
Watch for the symptoms.,
Diagnose fibromyalgia.,
Treat fibromyalgia medically.",How to Heal Fibromyalgia Naturally3," Women tend to develop fibromyalgia more often than men. The symptoms can develop slowly or they can begin after some form of trauma, either physical, mental, or emotional. The causes of fibromyalgia are unknown. There appear to be genetic and gender factors.


The immune system may be involved, because fibromyalgia often presents after infections and is often associated with autoimmune disorders like lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis., There are a few symptoms that you can look for that might be a sign you have fibromyalgia. Widespread pain is the most common symptom. This pain is most often described as a constant dull ache. Fibromyalgia may be diagnosed if the pain has lasted for at least three months and is on both sides of your body. The pain also has to be both above and below your waist to be diagnosed as fibromyalgia.


Those diagnosed with fibromyalgia have significant fatigue, at least partly because of sleep difficulties. Sleep can occur for long periods, but is often disrupted by pain, restless legs syndrome, and sleep apnea. Even if an individual with fibromyalgia has slept for a long time, they may still wake up tired.
People with fibromyalgia report ‘’fibro fog’’, which is a condition that disrupts the ability to focus, to pay attention, and to concentrate on any mental tasks.
Other symptoms can include depression, headaches, and abdominal discomfort or cramping., Diagnosing fibromyalgia can be difficult and a serious problem because there are no specific diagnostic lab tests for fibromyalgia. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) has a set of criteria necessary to diagnose fibromyalgia. These criteria are similar to the list of symptoms given above. However, the symptoms need to have caused pain for over three months and without interruption for the week prior to the visit. The doctor will also count how many out of 19 areas on your body you are feeling pain. He or she will also assess the severity of your other symptoms and see how well they are affected by your pain.


The doctor will also rule out any other possible condition that might be causing your symptoms.Many physicians still have doubts.If a physician is doubting your symptoms, the best advice is to find a physician experienced with fibromyalgia. You may need a referral to a rheumatologist in your area if you can’t find one on your own.

, Although the cause of fibromyalgia is not known, what is known is that there are drugs that affect the activity of some brain neurotransmitters, which are brain substances that act as chemical messengers between brain cells and nerves, that can be of some benefit for patients with fibromyalgia. There are three drugs approved to treat fibromyalgia. These are Duloxetine (Cymbalta), milnacipran (Savella), and Pregabalin (Lyrica).


Drugs can also be used to treat other symptoms, such as sleep issues. These include cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril), amitriptyline (Elavil), gabapentin (Neurontin), or pregabalin (Lyrica). Other drugs to help with sleep, such as benzodiazepines or Ambien, are not recommended."

Children, older adults, and illegal drug users are more likely to have septic arthritis.Other risk factors include:Having existing joint problems such as gout or lupus.
Taking medication for rheumatoid arthritis.
Having fragile skin that breaks easily.
Having a weakened immune system.
Having joint trauma such as animal bites or puncture wounds.
Having recent surgery.Taking immunosuppressants.;
, Septic arthritis generally comes on quickly.Symptoms are usually in one joint, though in rare cases may affect two or more areas.One of the most common symptoms of septic arthritis is swelling around the affected joint. This is caused by a buildup of infected fluid around your joint. Watching for swelling in one joint can help you diagnose septic arthritis.Pay attention to any warmth and redness that accompanies the swelling. This can also indicate septic arthritis.

, The swelling caused by septic arthritis infection can also bring on mild to severe pain. It can also lead to an inability to fully move your joint. Watching for any pain and immobility in the joint can help you diagnose septic arthritis and seek prompt treatment.Recognize that your pain may get worse when you move the affected joint.
Avoid forcing a painful joint to move. Septic arthritis may also lead to an inability to move the joint.Listen for crying or whimpering in infants and small children when the joint is moved. This is a sign of pain and may indicate that the child is suffering from septic arthritis.

, Infections, including septic arthritis, are often accompanied by a fever.This is a sign that something out of the ordinary is happening in the body.Taking the temperature can indicate a fever which may be the result of septic arthritis.Recognize that chills, muscle aches, sweating, and headache are common symptoms of a fever.These may also accompany a fever with septic arthritis.
Seek immediate medical attention if your fever is higher than 103 degrees Fahrenheit (39.4 degrees Celsius). In a small child, contact your doctor as soon as you realize they have even a slightly elevated temperature. This can indicate a serious infection.

, Two symptoms that are common with a fever are fatigue and weakness.These can also accompany septic arthritis. If you experience fatigue and weakness along with other symptoms of septic arthritis, you may have the condition.Recognize typical symptoms of weakness and fatigue, which include: delayed or slow movement, muscle cramps, muscle twitching, and uncontrollable shaking. Feeling run down is the most common symptom of fatigue.Be aware that your fatigue and weakness may lead to a decreased appetite, which can also signal septic arthritis., Most symptoms of septic arthritis are physical. However, some may be emotional or behavioral, especially in infants and small children. Noticing if you or another person are irritable can indicate septic arthritis, especially when in conjunction with other symptoms.Look for fussiness in children and infants. This can accompany any irritability they have., Only your doctor can definitively diagnose septic arthritis. If you have sudden onset of severe pain in a joint or any other symptoms of septic arthritis, contact your doctor as soon as possible. Prompt diagnosis of septic arthritis can minimize potential joint damage, including degeneration.Schedule the first available appointment by letting the doctor’s staff know that you have the symptoms of septic arthritis.
Seek emergency medical attention if your doctor is unable to see you. Emergency rooms and emergency care centers can also diagnose septic arthritis.

, During your appointment or exam, explain to the doctor that you suspect you may have septic arthritis. Discuss any symptoms you are experiencing as well as other relevant information, such as if you recently had surgery or a puncture wound. Your doctor will consider this information while examining your joint for signs of septic arthritis.Answer any questions the doctor may have honestly. Remember the doctor is trying to make a proper diagnosis and formulate the best treatment plan to minimize the risk of more serious conditions. If you are an illegal drug user, this information could be important information for a diagnosis.

, Depending on the examination, your doctor may order additional tests. These can give a more definitive diagnosis of septic arthritis.Your doctor may prescribe the following additional tests:


Arthrocentesis, which requires inserting a small needle into the joint for a sample of the synovial fluid. This test can indicate the presence of bacteria and assess your white blood cell count. It can also help your doctor figure out what medications to prescribe as treatment.Synovial fluid with greater than 50,000 white cells with a predominance of Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes (PMN) is significant for the disease and needs treatment. Other than the cell count, a doctor will do a gram stain of the synovial fluid as well as a culture of the fluid. This will help guide treatment.
Blood culture, which requires taking blood with a small needle.A blood culture can determine what signs of infection are in your blood.This test can help your doctor figure out the severity of infection in your joint., In addition to joint fluid and blood tests, your doctor may also call for imaging tests. These can confirm the presence of infection as well as if your joint is damaged.Imaging tests often used for diagnosing septic arthritis include:X-rays.
MRI scans.
CT scans.
Bone scans.
Ultrasound.

, Based on the outcome of an examination and any testing, your doctor may diagnose you with septic arthritis. Your doctor will talk to you about the results of your testing, including any damage in your joint. Your doctor will also discuss your treatment options.


Ask your doctor any questions you may have about the diagnosis or treatment.
If you have a MRSA infection you will need to treated with IV antibiotics such as vancomycin. This is the safest option for treatment given the prevalence of MRSA in hospitals and the community.

"
Determine the stage and severity of your breast cancer.Before being able to realistically discuss treatment options with your doctor, you will need to know the details of your breast cancer.,
Opt for surgery.If breast cancer is detected, the most common first line of treatment is surgery.,
Consider chemotherapy.One of the areas of greatest growth in the treatment of (and cure for) breast cancer is in the development of a variety of different chemotherapy options.,
Have your axillary (armpit) lymph nodes examined.Since surgery is almost always the first-line approach to the treatment (and cure) of breast cancer, at the same time as the surgery is being performed the surgeon can also take a first-hand look at the lymph nodes surrounding your breast and in your armpit.,
Follow-up with regular screening after treatment.Even after you have been cured of cancer (or after your breast cancer is in ""remission,"" meaning that it can no longer be picked up on medical tests), you will need to continue with regular screening to detect any possible recurrences.",How to Cure Breast Cancer1," Things to be aware of include whether it is present in one or both breasts, the size of the tumor, whether there is one lump or multiple lumps, and whether or not it has spread to the lymph nodes in your armpit and/or to other areas of your body (called metastasis). All of this information will help your doctor to determine the stage of your cancer, which will in turn dictate your treatment options. The stages of breast cancer are:


Stage I — The tumor is localized to the breast and is less than 2 cm in diameter.
Stage II — The tumor is present in the breast and axillary (armpit) lymph nodes. It may be up to 5 cm in diameter.
Stage III — The tumor is greater than 5 cm in diameter, and has spread to local areas surrounding the breast.
Stage IV — The cancer has spread (metastasized) all throughout the body. This stage is unfortunately not curable.;
, You can either receive what is called a ""lumpectomy,"" in which only the worrisome lump is removed and not your entire breast, or a ""mastectomy,"" in which your whole breast is removed. Some women even receive what is called a ""double mastectomy,"" in which both breasts are removed, even if the cancer is only present in one breast. This is often to diminish their risk of developing breast cancer in the other breast down the road (as sometimes having it in one breast can predispose you to developing it in the other breast down the road).


At the time of surgery, you can opt for breast reconstruction if you wish. This can be done at the same time as your breast is removed, or it can be done at a later date.
Many health care plans cover breast reconstruction surgery for women who have breast cancer. On the other hand, it is generally not covered when received for cosmetic reasons such as a breast augmentation.
If your cancer is of an early enough stage, surgery alone may be enough.
Radiation may or may not be done in addition to surgery depending upon the extent of your cancer. Your doctor will advise you.It is often recommended to proceed with chemotherapy (at least hormone-based therapy) following surgery to be certain that you give yourself the absolute best chance to be cure.

, There are three classes that you can consider:


Hormonal or endocrine therapy — When you are diagnosed with breast cancer, your doctor will test for the presence of estrogen and/or progesterone (hormone) receptors on the cancer cells. If your cancer tests positive for either estrogen and/or progesterone, your doctor will suggest that you take a hormonally-based treatment such as Tamoxifen. This will inhibit any further growth of your cancer and help to give you the best chance of cure.
Regular chemotherapy — If your cancer is at risk of having spread to other areas of your body, your doctor will likely recommend a standard chemotherapy regimen that travels throughout your body to hopefully eliminate any breast cancer cells that have spread beyond the breast itself.
Molecularly targeted therapy — Your doctor will also test your breast cancer for a protein called HER2. If it is positive for this protein, your doctor can offer you molecularly targeted therapy to help fight the breast cancer and to optimize your chances of cure. These agents include trastuzumab and lapatinib, which both treat HER2-positive breast cancers.

, Visualizing these lymph nodes is key, as the presence of cancer cells in the lymph nodes will alter your doctor's approach to treatment.


Your doctor may also do a sentinel node biopsy, in which the lymph node most likely to be infected with cancer is removed and tested. This lymph node is identified when the surgeon injects a dye or radioactive substance near the tumor, then looks for which lymph nodes are dyed or radioactive. The node is then removed and tested for cancer cells.If the cancer has not spread to your lymph nodes, usually a combination of surgery followed by hormone therapy (such as tamoxifen) is sufficient to cure your cancer.
On the other hand, if it has spread to your lymph nodes, your doctor will advise surgically removing the affected lymph nodes as well as the affected breast, and also offering you a generalized chemotherapy regimen in addition to hormone therapy.
Note that, if your cancer has spread beyond your lymph nodes into distant areas of your body, a complete ""cure"" of your cancer will not be possible. The cancer can only be completely cured if it is isolated to the breast itself, or if your doctor is able to remove the lymph nodes prior to any further spread beyond them.

, Follow-up screening recommendations generally consist of:


Regular physical exams with your doctor every three to six months for the first three years following treatment, where your doctor examines your breasts for any abnormalities. This can be reduced to every six to 12 months for the next two years, and annually thereafter.
Continued mammograms and a chest radiograph annually following treatment.
There may be additional screening protocols in place for people with more severe cancer, or for those with a genetic syndrome who are predisposed to cancer recurrences or to cancer developing in other areas of the body.

"
"
Note that the effectiveness of treating (and curing) breast cancer depends on how early it is detected.In some ways, the best form of ""treatment"" is prevention.,
Follow through with all screening tests.Women are advised to receive a mammogram every two years from the age of 50 onwards.This is a specialized form of x-ray that can detect abnormalities in the breast.,
Receive genetic testing if you have a family history of breast cancer.If you have a family history of breast cancer, and the affected family member tests positive for the BRCA gene, you are also advised to be tested for the presence of this gene.",How to Cure Breast Cancer2," This is why a huge effort has been made in the medical community to educate people about the importance of regular screenings for breast cancer, so that if any suspicious lumps are detected, their likelihood of being cured is as high as possible.

, If an abnormality is detected, further testing (such as an ultrasound, a biopsy of the abnormality, or possibly an MRI) will be performed to confirm whether or not it is breast cancer that needs to be treated.

, If you have it, it increases your chances of both breast cancer and ovarian cancer. The good news, however, is that if you test positive, you are aware of your heightened risk, and your doctor will offer you more screening tests than the average woman to optimize your chances of early detection and cure.


Women who are at high risk for getting breast cancer, like those with BRCA gene, will start getting mammograms earlier.
Some people who test positive for the gene also receive what is called a ""prophylactic double mastectomy,"" meaning that they have their breasts removed before any cancer develops as a means of preventing it from occurring in the first place.
This is a matter of personal preference, as it does have a significant cosmetic impact.

Since many pediatricians and health professionals are reluctant to diagnose it as such, you should know for yourself what kinds of behaviors might indicate the condition. High or low tolerance to pain or touch, clumsiness, sensitivity to light or loud sounds, or fear of crowds are some of the most widely recognized symptoms of sensory processing disorder.Additionally, your child might exhibit autism- or ADHD-reminiscent symptoms, such as poor social skills, poor impulse control, or difficulty focusing on tasks.;
, In order to treat your child’s perceptual issues, you’ll first need to better understand what stimuli they find problematic. Do so by taking notes about your child’s behavior, noting any tantrums or incidents of bad behavior, as well as any other problems you suspect are related to their sensory faculties. Write down what seems to have triggered a tantrum, how your child responds, and how long the tantrum lasts.For example, some parents reported thinking their children’s tantrums were random and impulsive. Upon tracking their triggers more closely, though, they found that the tantrums actually occurred every time the child had to put on footwear or heard about having to do so., One of the most widely reported symptoms of sensory processing disorder is extreme epidermal sensitivity to clothing. Sartorial features which other people fail to notice or find only mildly uncomfortable can seem unbearably irritating to the sufferer of sensory processing disorder. If your child complains about clothing or throws fits when getting dressed, try buying soft, natural fabrics and avoiding artificial, chafing ones, such as acrylic or polyester.Instead, try using clothing that can provide comfort, such as heavy clothing, weighted vests, or compression jackets. These items have been shown to have a calming, soothing effect on some anxious or frightened children and even animals., Many children with sensory processing disorder have trouble adjusting to changes in routine, feeling that these changes indicate their lack of control and security. You can combat these anxious feelings by drawing up a schedule for your child and sharing it with them well ahead of time. This calendar will provide them a much-needed sense of structure and reliability, as well as help them prepare for future events or activities.Make sure that your child can easily see and read the calendar, and ask them for input or to help drawing it out when you’re creating it. This participation will help them feel like they have some control and input in their routine.

, Even children with the most mild cases of sensory processing disorder will become overstimulated and need to withdraw from others from time to time. During these episodes, your child will need a safe place to retire for a half hour or so, so make sure your child has a special retreat within your home that they can go to when feeling stressed or overwhelmed.Many parents find that this measure can even help prevent future tantrums. If your child gets overstimulated easily, have them take a break from social playtime or other stimuli every thirty minutes instead of waiting for an episode.For example, build a pillow fort in your child’s room, hollow out a corner in their closet, designate a ‘safe place’ armchair in the living room, or make a treehouse or playhouse into a specially designated zone.

, Many children suffering from sensory processing disorder find that certain ‘sensory-friendly’ toys can help distract, entertain, and soothe them. Such special toys can also provide the sensory stimulation they crave and even ultimately improve their symptoms.Look for toys that light up, make sounds, and provide interesting textures. For example, sensory balls, tactile puzzles, beads, blocks, and Bop it! or Simon Says boards are all good sensory toys.
Additionally, familiar tokens such as worry stones and favorite stuffed animals can help suffering children feel relaxed and secure.

, Outings are some of the most exciting times for your child, so they can also be a prime time for tantrums or episodes of overstimulation. Packing a portable kit full of calming, re-orienting tools will mean that you can meet and address such behavior even when you’re out of the house.For example, fill a pack with noise-canceling headphones, a favorite toy, sunglasses to shield bright lights, a compression vest, and a snack to prevent hunger tantrums or sugar crashes.

, Despite the reluctance in professional medical circles to define, accept, and standardize the diagnosis of sensory processing disorder, parents and community groups have had considerable success organizing special facilities and events for affected children. These venues and events feature softened lighting, decreased sound volumes, time-out areas and break times, and other sensory-friendly amenities.Check out online sensory processing disorder support forums in order to find local theaters, libraries, museums, theme parks, and even hair salons that offer special programming for your child.

Talk to your child’s teacher about sensory processing disorder.,
Check out the comfort of your child’s seat and desk.,
Have the teacher move your child’s desk to the front of the class.,
Allow for regimented breaks throughout the day.,
Move your child’s lunch away from the main cafeteria.,
Have your child exempted from loud assemblies or activities.",How to Help a Child with Sensory Processing Disorder2," While most official psychiatric and pediatric organizations don’t recognize sensory processing disorder, there are many sympathetic educators and administrators who are open to working with parents and children on the issue. Make an appointment with your child’s teacher and any relevant administrators so that you can discuss in-class options for making your child’s educational experience more sensory-friendly.Be sure to bring any pertinent background information and documentation to the meeting. For example, bring any medical or psychiatric reports detailing your child’s symptoms and problems, as well as any educational pamphlets you might have about the nature of the disorder.

, Just as children affected by sensory processing disorder can be particularly sensitive to irritating clothing, they can also find seating arrangements more uncomfortable and distracting than other children do. Make sure their chair fits well, so that their feet rest flat on the floor and the chair does not pinch or scrape in any way.If you find that your child responds well to fidget toys and sustained physical movement, try a seat cushion or inflatable pillow that will allow them to move around.

, Many parents find that their child’s performance at school improves if their desk is moved closer to the teacher. This way they can focus more easily on the teacher’s words, see fewer intervening distractions, and be a more easily supervised pupil.Additionally, ask the teacher to keep your child’s desk away from the window, a loud radiator, or the hallway. If your child is sensitive to light, ask to have any fluorescent lamps removed or placed further away.

, Just as your child benefits from time-outs at home, they will benefit in school from the same kind of punctuated breaks at school. Ask the teacher to allow several ten-minute time-outs throughout the day, especially after highly social activities.Ideally, your child could use a mini-trampoline, suck on a piece of candy, or go for a mini-walk during these breaks, as receiving sensory input during this time will make the time-outs even more effective.

, Due to its loud, social nature, many children with sensory processing disorder find lunch time to be a particularly overwhelming period in the day. If your school reports that your child has had problems during lunch, ask for permission to let your child and a friend eat lunch in a quiet room outside of the main cafeteria.


Children with sensory processing disorder are notoriously picky eaters, so contact a pediatric nutritionist for strategies to improve your child’s eating habits and diet., In addition to lunchtime and recess, special assemblies, sports events, and other social activities can be particularly overwhelming sensory experiences to your child. These can incite meltdowns and other behavioral setbacks, so if possible you should keep them out of such environments.If your school is unwilling to do so, ask that they be allowed to take breaks with a teacher escort, or that they be allowed to wear headphones or sit near the door.

Consult your pediatrician for advice and recommendations.,
Hire a specialist for regular therapeutic appointments.,
Visit sensory gyms for hyposensitive children.,
Engage in soothing therapy for hypersensitive children.,
Follow your therapist’s prescribed “sensory diet.” In addition to the organized appointments with your child’s therapist, your therapist will probably also recommend that you follow some basic practices at home.",How to Help a Child with Sensory Processing Disorder3," Once you think your child might have sensory processing disorder, gather a list of the symptoms you’ve observed and make an appointment to share them with your child’s pediatrician. Based on your doctor’s conclusions, they can either send your child for further testing or refer you directly to a specialist.If your child’s teachers, coaches, or other adult family members have ever noted similar problems with your child, bring documentation of these episodes to corroborate or flesh out your own observations. The more information your pediatrician has, the more specific and on-target their referral and help can be.

, Once you’ve been referred to a specialist, you’ll probably begin working with an occupational therapist. Based on their specialized diagnosis, they’ll decide what plan of treatment to pursue. Generally speaking, a hypersensitive child will receive soothing therapy designed to calm their senses. A hyposensitive case will undergo maximally stimulating sessions resembling vigorous play time.Due to the fact that sensory processing disorder has not been accepted by the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, it occupies a tenuous position within most insurance plans. If your insurance provider won’t cover your child’s case, you can expect to pay about $7,000 a year for hour-long weekly appointments with a therapist., If your specialist deems that your child is hyposensitive, they’ll probably prescribe therapeutic sessions in sensory gyms. These places can look like big jungle gyms, replete with bouncing balls, climbing apparatuses, toys, and puzzles. The idea is that your child is under-stimulated, so they need to be re-engaged with their environment through multi-faceted and varied cognitive and physical sensations.If you can’t afford a therapist, you can still take your child to a sensory gym. Look up local establishments calling themselves sensory gyms and you can attend and play with your child using the special equipment provided., While hypersensitive children can also benefit from the safe, fun activities supplied by sensory gyms, it’s also believed that they can be treated by calming therapies intended to soothe their overactive senses. Methods such as weighted vests, rubbing the skin with a soft-bristled brush, and joint compression have been said to reduce tactile defensiveness and general sensitivity.Some support forums and methodologies advise using these methods at home as well. Activities such as the ‘sandwich game’—where your place pillows on either side of your child and apply pressure until your child wants to stop playing—can be done easily and at home, but be sure to ask your therapist about them before trying it out and monitor your child's response to it., Using a washcloth to scrub and apply pressure during bath time, playing with sensory toys at home, reducing visual clutter, and taking regular time-outs are all ways you can carry occupational therapy into the household and everyday routine."

Know your options.,
Ask about watchful waiting or active surveillance.,

Consult your doctor and ask about vaccine treatment.,
Eat healthy.,
Be active.,
Quit smoking and drinking.,
Do calming forms of exercise.,
Get acupuncture.",How to Cure Prostate Cancer," Your medical team will prescribe the best treatment plan for you. However, it's important to know your options and why one might be better than another. The options for treatment are based on:The stage of the cancer (how far a cancer has spread)
Your age and health status. If you have many health problems (comorbidities) and are unable to tolerate treatment such as radiation or surgery, your doctor may advise a less aggressive approach of treatment.
Your preference of treatment. Some patients prefer to wait and see, while others prefer more aggressive treatment such as surgery.;
, These are the least rigorous treatment options and usually beneficial for those who are at minimal risk for metastasis.Active surveillance is usually used when one needs to be monitored closely but no treatment is recommended at the moment.
Active surveillance is done using regular prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood tests, digital rectal exams (DREs), ultrasounds to observe the progress of the tumor, and/or biopsies.The downfall of this process is that this may give your cancer an opportunity to grow and in doing so limit treatment options.
This is an option for men who have been diagnosed with a very early stage of prostate cancer or have too many other health problems to undergo treatment.Prostate cancer is usually a slow growing cancer and therefore these patients can have routine tests to check if their cancer starts to grow more rapidly., As the name suggests, radiation therapy utilizes high-intensity rays or particles to kill cancer cells. This therapy can be used as a first-line defense in a slow-growing or low-intensity cancer limited to the prostate gland.Radiation therapy is also the first-line treatment for metastasized cancer.
Two types of radiation therapy can be used: beam radiation and brachytherapy (internal radiation).During external beam therapy, you lie on a bed while a machine moves around your body, directing radiation to your prostate. This treatment usually requires treatments 5 days per week for several weeks.
During Brachytherapy, a small rice-sized radioactive seeds are placed in your prostate. The radioactive seeds slowly deliver low doses of radiation over time. Eventually the seeds stop giving off radiation and do not need to be removed.

, Cryosurgery (also known as cryotherapy or cryoablation) utilizes freezing and can be used for the treatment of early-stage prostate cancer. However, this procedure is not popular with doctors and cannot be utilized for men who have large prostate glands.This technique uses transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) during which several hollow probes (needles) are applied into the prostate via the skin area between the anal opening and scrotum.
Freezing gases are passed through the needles to destroy the tumor.
The procedure is performed under spinal, epidural, or general anaesthesia.
Side effects of this procedure include bruising and soreness.
Although cryosurgery is an economical choice, its long-term benefits are not known.

, Also called androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) or androgen suppression therapy, the main aim of hormone therapy is to decrease the concentrations of male hormones (androgens). Decreasing or stopping androgen concentrations often helps in shrinking the prostate cancer cells.The primary androgen is testosterone and it is also the main hormone that cancer cells rely on to help them grow. Cutting the supply of testosterone by giving hormones that inhibit its production may help inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells.
Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogues: these drugs decrease the level of testosterone generated by the testicles. This treatment is occasionally called chemical castration or medical castration.
Anti-androgens or androgen receptor inhibitors: these drugs bind to the androgen receptors and block them so your normal hormones cannot bind the receptors and signal the testicles to produce more testosterone.Besides these drugs, there are a few other therapies that can be used (female estrogens and ketoconazole). Consult your doctor which therapy is most appropriate for you.

, Radical prostatectomy is when the surgeon removes the prostate and its surrounding tissues. However, radical prostatectomy is performed in a variety of ways:During radical retropubic prostatectomy, your doctor will perform a skin incision to your lower abdomen to remove the prostate and surrounding tissues. He may also remove the lymph nodes if needed.
Another choice is the perineal approach (perineal prostatectomy) in which the skin incision is done between the anus and scrotum. However, this approach is seldom utilized as it causes erection problems and complications are associated with the removal of lymph nodes.
However, one benefit of perineal prostatectomy is that the duration of the procedure is short and it may be used as an alternative surgical option if you suffer from other medical conditions accompanied by decrease pain and quick recovery.

Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP), is another option where numerous small slits are made, and specialized instruments are used to take out the prostate.
This procedure also includes inserting a video camera for visualization by the surgeons. It is somewhat beneficial as compared to the open surgery that includes less incisions, low blood loss and increase healing time, it is cost effective, less scarring, and faster recovery.
The latest approach utilizes robotic interface, called the robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP), and is performed by robotic arms that are controlled by the surgeon.

, Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill proliferating cancer cells. The drugs may be administered intravenously or orally in the form of a pill.Chemotherapy is usually a treatment option for men with prostate cancer that has already metastasized in distant areas of the body.
This may also be the treatment option for men who do not respond well with hormonal therapy.

, Vaccination is often utilized for progressive prostate cancer only when hormonal therapy fails.The treatment is individualized for each patient and the vaccine is made from your own white blood cells.
Your white blood cells will be collected and exposed to prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) outside the body. The white blood cells are then transferred back to your body with the idea of building immunity against the cancer cells.
Although vaccine therapy does not seem to stop prostate cancer from growing, it seems to help to increase life expectancy in men with advanced cancer., The treatment for prostate cancer may cause nausea and changes in taste causing you to eat less and lose weight. However, it is important to eat well to help your body fight the cancer. Avoid eating too much, because this may fuel the cancer’s growth. Instead, focus on eating lots of fruits and vegetables to provide your body with plenty of nutrients. Try to eat 2 and ½ cups or more of fruits and vegetables every day.


Eat lots of cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and kale, because these have been linked with a lower risk of prostate cancer. Tomatoes, soy, and beans may also be helpful.You should also try to limit dairy because consuming dairy products has been linked with an increased risk of prostate cancer., Exercise improves overall health in addition to maintaining your weight and improving your mood. Clinical studies suggest that men who exercise before and after a prostate cancer diagnosis, have better chances for survival and improved quality of life. Talk to your doctor before starting any exercise program.
Always start slowly when beginning a new exercise regimen.

, Avoid things that increase your risk of prostate cancer such as smoking and heavy alcohol drinking.Not only are these bad for your risk of getting prostate cancer, but they are bad for your overall health and increase your risk of other diseases too.

, Stress, depression and anxiety are common responses to prostate cancer diagnosis, symptoms and the treatment regimen. Learn to manage your stress with exercise and relaxation techniques.Try meditation, yoga, controlled breathing and/or visualization to relieve stress.
Give yourself between 15 and 30 minutes a day for relaxation and use this time to insert positive images and outlook about your illness.
Exercise also helps manage stress by boosting endorphins., Acupuncture is an ancient Chinese practice that has been around for centuries. Although it is not scientifically proven method for treating prostate cancer, it can ease stress and insert positive energy to you, which in turn will improve your own outlook on life."

However, it is likely that you will deal with many physical changes. Finding ways to feel physically better can help you handle your illness.Your doctor will be one of your greatest resources. After you have processed the initial diagnosis, schedule a follow-up appointment.
Prepare a list of questions to ask. Writing them down ahead of time will help you remember key points.
You can ask things such as, ""How will this affect my energy levels and my appetite?"" You could also say, ""Are there any physical restrictions I should be aware of?""
You may also want to ask about your short-term and long-term prognosis. Ask your doctor to be as honest and specific as possible.

, After you begin to understand your particular type of cancer, you can begin working to make a treatment plan. Many people feel better when they feel like they have a little bit of control over their medical care. Tell your doctor that you want to be involved in decision making.Discuss whether you are going to pursue the most aggressive treatment possible. Sometimes surgery is an option, but comes with risks.
Talk to your doctor about all of your options. Give yourself time to think about each possible course of treatment.
Involve your partner or a close family member in your decision making process. It can be very helpful to have some advice from a person you are close to.
Ask your partner to accompany you to your medical appointments. He or she can help you process all of the information you are taking in.

, Your treatment plan should also include ways to handle the day to day symptoms you will experience. Talk to your doctor about the potential side effects of your illness and medications. Make a plan to cope with anticipated physical symptoms.Many cancer patients deal with pain. Talk to your doctor about prescription pain killers and natural remedies.
Loss of appetite is another common problem. Keep foods on hand that are easier to digest, such as soup and oatmeal.
Chemotherapy drugs can cause fatigue. Allow yourself extra time to rest. You might also feel better if you can do light physical activity, such as taking a short walk.
Your sex drive might suffer. Have an honest conversation with your partner about other ways to still have intimacy. Try extra hugging and cuddling.

, It is important to try to be as healthy as possible when you are dealing with cancer. Your body needs plenty of nutrients to fight your illness. Try to eat a healthy diet.A balanced diet can help you fight fatigue. Try to eat whole grains, plenty of fruits and vegetables, and lean proteins.
If you are having trouble keeping foods down, try eating some homemade vegetable soup. You'll get lots of nutrients and hopefully avoid upsetting your stomach.
Remember to stay hydrated. Cancer medications can cause dry mouth and cracked skin, so it is important to drink as much water as possible.
Get plenty of rest. Allow yourself to take naps as needed and go to bed as early as you like. Average adults need 7-9 hours of sleep. You may need more.

, Although it is frustrating, you may not be able to complete all of your regular tasks. It's okay to delegate some of your responsibilities. Allow your friends and family to help.When people offer to help, take them up on it. If your neighbor asks what she can do, it is perfectly fine to say, ""It would be so helpful if you could pick up a few things for me the next time you are at the grocery store.""
Ask your partner to take over some extra responsibilities around the house. Maybe you've traditionally been the cook. It's okay to take some time off from making dinner.
Talk to your boss about your situation. Explain that you may need to take a reduced role on some big projects.

Find a support group.,
Keep a journal.,
Ease your anxiety.,
Maintain a positive attitude.",How to Cope With Cancer3," Many people find it helpful to talk to others in the same situation. Cancer support groups can be a wonderful resource. Consider joining one in your area.Ask your doctor for a recommendation. Many hospitals and treatment centers will have several groups to choose from.
Try joining a group for people with your specific type of cancer. For example, if you are dealing with breast cancer, you might find it comforting to be around other women dealing with breast cancer.
There are also online support groups. Your doctor or nurse might be able to guide you towards a good fit for you.
Lean on friends and family. If you don't want to join a formal support group, let the people close to you know that you will need their support.There are also support groups for people whose loved one has cancer. That might be helpful for some of your family members.

, Dealing with cancer is a very emotional experience. You might feel overwhelmed by the wide range of feelings you are experiencing. Try tracking your thoughts in a journal.Writing down your thoughts can be very therapeutic. Don't worry about what you're writing--just get your feelings out honestly.
Keeping a journal can also help you track patterns. For example, maybe you see that you are feeling most anxious the night before a chemo treatment.
Finding patterns can help you figure out what is most bothering you. Then you can actively seek solutions.

, It is normal to feel very nervous when you are dealing with cancer. There are a lot of unknowns and a lot of changes. Try to look for ways to reduce your tension.Mediation can be very helpful. Download an app on your phone that will allow you to listen to guided meditations.
If you are physically capable, try doing some light yoga. It can help ease anxiety.
Talk about your feelings. If your anxiety is causing problems such as insomnia, you might consider seeing a counselor.

, There is actually some research that shows that the power of positive thinking can actually help you deal with cancer. That does not mean that you need to put on a happy face all of the time. It doesn't mean that you need to try to find a silver lining about your situation.Keeping your spirits up means that you try not to let the cancer mentally defeat you. Try saying to yourself, ""This is hard, but I'll get through it.""
You can remain optimistic while being realistic. For example, you might think, ""This is a road block in my life that is difficult. But I have a great support system, and I'm going to beat this.""
Ask your friends and family to try to remain as positive as possible. They don't need to offer you phony platitudes, but they can offer you encouragement and support.

Ask for professional mental help with children.",How to Cope with Cancer As a Family," Learning that someone in the family has a serious medical condition can illicit many different feelings. Some may feel scared and sad, while others could feel anger and denial. Know that there aren’t any right or wrong feelings.


Children may not know how to react and will often take cues from their parents about how to respond. Know that your children may be looking to you before they know what to feel. Although it may be difficult, try not to respond in a way you wouldn’t want your children to.For example, if you want to send the message that it’s okay to cry, then don’t try to hide your tears or grief from everyone. However, you may also want to enforce the idea that your children should remain hopeful by considering treatments and adopting a healthy lifestyle.;
, Hearing the news of a cancer diagnosis is overwhelming and frightening. Although everyone handles it in different ways, holding it in typically makes things worse. Talk to your family about how you feel about the news, whether you are the person with cancer or it is someone else in the family. Not only will getting your feelings out in the open likely make you feel better, but you can find out how everyone else is feeling, which gets the family on the same page.


Consider the personalities of everyone in your family to find out how to get them to open up. Some work better in one-on-one settings, while others are more responsive in group settings.You might start by simply saying, “Well, we had some big news this week. How are you feeling about it?”

, The age of your children will guide your discussions about cancer. You can consult with a doctor, nurse, or mental health provider on how to share the news with your kids. In general, it's best not to tell them everything at once, but a little at a time. Try to get a thorough understanding of the diagnosis and prognosis before sharing so that you can address any of their concerns.You might say, ""Daddy has a sickness in his lung called cancer. This happens when abnormal cells grow fast and spread. Daddy will need to visit the doctor and take special medicines to help him get better.""
It may also help to read children's books that depict a story of someone being very sick in order to give your child a contextual reference from which to process the news.

, When you do talk to your children about cancer, you can expect a variety of reactions. Encourage them to ask questions. And try to address their fears. Understand that some kids may act out as a way of demonstrating their sadness or confusion, while others might act ""numb"" or like they don't care at all. Generally, such behavior will stop after the child comes to grips with the news.


However, some kids may have trouble coping with the fact that a family member is sick.Get professional help from a counselor or therapist if your child is having trouble coping.

, Your family likely has lots of questions about your diagnosis. Getting the answers straight from the doctor can give them the support they need. Having them involved in your diagnosis and treatment plan may help them feel more optimistic about the future and can bring you closer together., If the diagnosis is terminal or end-stage cancer, the process of coping will also be a process of saying goodbye. Both adults and children will have varying ways of coping with the impending death of an ill family member. Grief specialists identify several stages that families go through during this time. Here's what you can expect.Crisis: This period may be marked by anxiety, guilt, or anger. Meeting with a therapist or support group is practical during this time to process the emotions surrounding the news.

Unity: Everyone comes together to define their roles and focus on the needs of the ill family member. You might decide on medical services or make legal and burial arrangements.

Upheaval: Unity fades if the dying process goes on for an extended period. Everyone's lifestyle endures major shifts. Negative emotions may reemerge. Family relationships may become strained.

Resolution: Family members begin to reflect on memories with the person and their place in the family. Unresolved issues resurface and may need to be addressed. If seized appropriately and facilitated by a grief counselor, families can use this time to heal old wounds and make peace with the past.

Renewal: After the person dies, the final stage of grief begins with a memorial and celebration of life. Family members may feel both sadness and relief that their loved one is no longer suffering.

, Sometimes loved ones disagree on cancer treatment options. Whether you are two parents with conflicting goals for a child's treatment, or several siblings at odds over a parent's treatment, discord will only make the process harder.If possible, it's always best to consider the desires of the ill person to some extent.


Present the options like ""Mom, you can go through chemotherapy or you can sign up for a clinical trial with this new drug. What do you want to do?"" Giving the person a voice can help them feel empowered, and take the burden of choosing from your own shoulders.
However you choose, everyone needs to be on board to participate in treatment so that there is some degree of harmony in the decision. Changing diets for the whole family or moving across the country to get better access to specialized treatment requires everyone's participation. Have a family session with a mental health provider who has experience with end-of-life care to help facilitate a discussion with your loved ones.

, Depending on who in the family has been diagnosed with cancer, you will likely witness role reversals within the family unit. The primary caretaker of the family may now become the person who needs the most help. The children in the family may also need to increase their workload when it comes to household responsibilities. Having a family member with cancer is an adjustment, but it is doable.


The relationship between the spouses may also change. Intimacy may become a problem, and marriages can become strained. Consider attending a therapy session to speak with a counselor if you are having troubles in your relationship after learning of a cancer diagnosis., Not focusing on the fear and enormity of the situation may be difficult, but it is in everyone’s best interest to stay positive. Chances are, the person with cancer is already worried and frightened about what lies ahead, and concentrating on the “doom and gloom” aspect of the sickness isn’t helping. Putting on a brave face can inspire others in your family to do the same, and can make living with the situation much more bearable.When the person is having a “good” day, plan family outings or a game night. Try to maintain as much normality and usual family time as you can.

, Feeling sadness is normal after the initial diagnosis, but keep an eye on your family members for signs of depression during this difficult time. The person with cancer isn’t the only one who can suffer from depression; those around them can, as well. Depression is a serious matter that could have long-lasting or even tragic consequences, if it isn’t addressed.


Signs of depression include an overwhelming feeling of sadness that lasts for weeks and doesn’t seem to get any better, causes problems with day-to-day activities, and has the person feeling hopeless or worthless., Sometimes, the best thing to do after a cancer diagnosis is to keep things as routine as possible. Continue going to work and exercising, if you are able. Allow your children to participate in the same activities as they have before. Adjusting to cancer is already difficult, and completely changing the normal way of life may be too much to handle.Maintaining a sense of normalcy can help everyone hold it together during this confusing and upsetting time. Having a set routine provides structure which can be helpful when the unpredictable can happen with your loved one’s sickness.

, Providing care for someone else is often very taxing. The most important thing that caregivers can do is to take care of themselves. In the case of families, it’s important to look out for and care for each other.


Ensure you are getting enough sleep, eating healthy foods, and engaging in activities you enjoy. Feeling good yourself can help improve your mental health and allow you to better care for others., Those with cancer and those who are supporting them can go to support groups to talk to others about what they are experiencing. Although you want to cope with the diagnosis as a family, sometimes, you just can’t talk to your family about everything. Patients may not want their families to hear all of their concerns, and the families may not want the patients to hear their fears. Support groups are safe places in which all matters can be discussed without fear.


Ask your doctor about support groups in your area, or contact your local hospital for information. Online support groups are also available if you can’t leave the home, or if you can’t find any in your area., When your friends offer to cut the grass for you or carpool the children around, let them. Accepting help may hurt your pride initially, but you’ll likely find that it’s extremely helpful in the long run. Also, don’t feel like you are putting your family and friends out by asking for help—they are probably more than happy to contribute to your family.If you need help but don’t have anyone who is offering, look online for handyman services or someone who will provide assistance in whatever you need help with. Sometimes, spending a little money is worth the help.

, Cancer is likely new territory for you and your family, especially your children. They may take this news harder than anyone, and you might not feel like you know what to do for them. Taking your child to a therapist may be what they need to really talk about how they feel, and learn how to adjust to this major change."
"
Adjust to the health care system.,
Ask the child's doctor:


The type cancer
Recommended treatment
Expected length of treatment
Side effects (ask for literature) from chemotherapy regiment(s)
Long term prognosis, chances of relapse,
Names and phone numbers of support groups
Available literature defining the type cancer
The name of an oncologist most experienced in that particular cancer

,
Be totally honest with your child and everyone you know, no matter how painful it sounds.,
Understand your love and support is more critical now than ever before.,
Listen to your child.,
Create a will, despite how much painful it is.,
Believe.",How to Cope when Your Child Is Diagnosed with Cancer,"


Ask for maps or a tour of the hospital,
Have each professional explain the part they play in providing care,
Determine exactly where treatment will take place,
Make hospital rooms as homey as possible, bringing things like blankets from home make the environment much more comfortable,
Have activities on hand for time spent in clinic (such as art, a certain subject, etc.), puzzles, and board games are always good,
Clarify the role of the child's referring doctor,
Review the written materials provided by the team or available through your American Cancer Society,
Ask team members to describe how the ""system"" works, ask other parents who have dealt with cancer in their child. Cancer support groups are very helpful because you meet people in similar situations,;
,, Your child, now more than ever, will be totally dependent upon you and will place a trust in you to keep he/she aware of everything that is happening to them (and to each of you). Should your child ask difficult questions (and they will), it is important you be honest with them. Be prepared to discuss death whether this is the prognosis or not. Children fear death until you gently allow them to accept the term (death). DO NOT deceive your child. You will soon discover your little bundle of joy has the heart, stamina and fortitude of a lion! Their concern becomes not of their fears or pain, but how mommy and daddy are weathering this battle.

, A child will be less fearful if you are with them each step of the process in making them well. You, as the parent, have the right to accompany your child. You are paying the costs. There will be times when you inform a physician, surgeon, whomever, you intend to be at your child's side unless surgery is involved and even then, up until the time of being wheeled to the O.R.. Should you be divorced, do not attempt to shut the stepparents out of the support group. Regardless of how you may feel toward one another, your child may not feel the same and will need all of you now.

, Children, from infants to young adults, will attempt to hide their pain in the presence of loving parents. Learn to listen to what they are not saying and learn to observe their mannerism's when you suspect they are not feeling up to par. Regardless of what you may think, should your child say they are in pain, they are in pain!

, All persons from teenagers through adults should complete a will. Teenagers should specify who will receive radios, stereo equipment, clothing, sentimental items and any other real property. The contents of the will should be discussed with each person who will receive items. Each recipient will know, and will not be able to dispute, the content and wishes of the will.

, Believe it or not, the most important thing to do is believe they will be okay. If you show hope, your daughter/son will too. A positive attitude truly reflects and cleanses your body. Take this information from a past child cancer survivor.

Doctors do not recommend the use of ear candling.Ear candling is when you take a hollow cone made of paraffin and beeswax with cloth, light one end and place the other end in the ear.,
See your doctor.,
Place a warm compress over the affected ear.,
Consider these tips as well.",How to Relieve Ear Congestion," If you have just been on an airplane, you may feel a blockage in your ear that will clear itself. However, if you have recently had a cold or suffer from allergies, you may be experiencing ear congestion that is similar to nasal congestion. If you are having difficulty hearing, you also may be suffering from excessive wax buildup. Seek the advice of a doctor if your symptoms last longer than 48 hours and are accompanied by pain.;
, Some of the time, ear congestion will be due to fluids caught in the Eustachian tubes, which are a part of the middle ear. If you think you might have fluids caught in your ear, here are some tricks using gravity that you can use to relieve congestion.
/images/thumb/7/7e/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-2-Version-11.jpg/v4-550px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-2-Version-11.jpg
/images/thumb/7/7e/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-2-Version-11.jpg/v4-300px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-2-Version-11.jpg









Tilt your head to the side (preferably the side that has blockage), and hop slowly and steadily. Be careful doing this — you don't want to fall down. This can sometimes help dislodge fluid that is caught in the ear canal.
Lie down on your side with your head resting on a pillow. Keep the ear that's congested facing downward. Rest like this for an hour. Again, gravity may help pull the fluid out from your ear.

, Sinus congestion feels a lot like your ears are plugged, and so sinus congestion might really be masquerading as ear congestion. For some, nasal irrigation may bring quick relief of sinus symptoms without the use of medications.The neti pot works by thinning out mucus and flushing it out of the nasal passage.
/images/thumb/0/08/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-3-Version-11.jpg/v4-550px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-3-Version-11.jpg
/images/thumb/0/08/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-3-Version-11.jpg/v4-300px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-3-Version-11.jpg









Note that you should not put fluid into your ear if you have a perforated eardrum or suspect an ear infection. See a doctor instead.
All neti pots come with their own set of instructions that should be followed. Typically, however, one first prepares an irrigating solution made up of 16 ounces lukewarm (and sterile) water, along with 1 teaspoon of salt. Fill your neti pot with the saline solution.
Tilt your head at a 45 degree angle and bring the tip of the neti pot to your top nostril. The saline solution will go into one nostril, travel through your nasal cavity, and come out of the other nostril. If the solution drips into your mouth, just spit it out. Blow your nose and repeat the process on the other side.
How often should you irrigate with a neti pot? People suffering from severe sinus problems or allergies found relief irrigating daily.Once symptoms get better, the recommended usage is three times per week.

, If your ear congestion is a result of seasonal allergies or a cold, take decongestant as directed. This will work to reduce swelling in your ear canal. You also may take an antihistamine and a decongestant together as long as you follow label instructions.

, Try putting your index finger in your ear and moving the index finger gently upwards. Ears are shaped differently, so this may take a bit of finessing. Move your finger around gently until you have created a vacuum. Try to suction the fluid out of your ear.
/images/thumb/5/58/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-5-Version-11.jpg/v4-550px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-5-Version-11.jpg
/images/thumb/5/58/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-5-Version-11.jpg/v4-300px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-5-Version-11.jpg








, Put hot, slightly steaming water in a large bowl, cover your head with a towel, and rest your covered head over the steam bath. The steam may help thin out and loosen the mucus, which you can then spit out into another bowl.
/images/thumb/6/63/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-6-Version-10.jpg/v4-550px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-6-Version-10.jpg
/images/thumb/6/63/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-6-Version-10.jpg/v4-300px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-6-Version-10.jpg









Try putting tea or other herbs into your steam treatment. Some teas like chamomile have anti-inflammatory and antiseptic qualities, making them a nice addition to the steam treatment.
Hot showers, trips to the sauna, or humidifiers will also do the trick. Avoid placing any steaming object near your ear, as the steam produced this way can sometimes be too hot.

, If you are flying, or driving in high altitudes, you may experience ""airplane ear."" Fast changes in altitude cause air pressure changes and can trigger airplane ear.
/images/thumb/8/8d/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-7-Version-10.jpg/v4-550px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-7-Version-10.jpg
/images/thumb/8/8d/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-7-Version-10.jpg/v4-300px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-7-Version-10.jpg








, This often will clear the air in your inner ear. Chewing gum will create more saliva to aid in swallowing.
/images/thumb/4/40/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-8-Version-10.jpg/v4-550px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-8-Version-10.jpg
/images/thumb/4/40/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-8-Version-10.jpg/v4-300px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-8-Version-10.jpg









Practice the Valsalva maneuver. Pinch your nostrils closed with your fingers and gently blow your nose to regulate the air pressure. You should hear a slight popping sound if you did it correctly.

, Take an antihistamine 30 minutes to an hour before boarding your flight or driving in high altitudes. Antihistamines will decrease irritants within the ear canal that may cause swelling, which will in turn help the air pass more easily through your inner ear.
/images/thumb/d/dd/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-9-Version-10.jpg/v4-550px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-9-Version-10.jpg
/images/thumb/d/dd/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-9-Version-10.jpg/v4-300px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-9-Version-10.jpg








, Filtered earplugs are available at pharmacies or shops within an airport.
/images/thumb/8/8a/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-10-Version-10.jpg/v4-550px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-10-Version-10.jpg
/images/thumb/8/8a/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-10-Version-10.jpg/v4-300px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-10-Version-10.jpg








, Blockage, or what doctors call ""impaction,"" occurs when the wax gets pushed deep into the ear canal.Apply an over-the-counter earwax remover if your congestion is due to wax buildup. Use as directed on the package.
/images/thumb/a/a0/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-11-Version-7.jpg/v4-550px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-11-Version-7.jpg
/images/thumb/a/a0/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-11-Version-7.jpg/v4-300px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-11-Version-7.jpg









Q-Tips and other objects like rolled napkins can make impaction even worse. Q-Tips will remove some wax, but pushes the rest deeper into the ear canal, exacerbating the problem.
People who wear hearing-aids may also suffer from higher rates of impaction., Equal parts apple cider vinegar and isopropyl alcohol, dropped carefully in the ear canal with an eye- or ear-dropper, can help dissolve some earwax as well as remove fluid that may be caught behind the wax.
/images/thumb/e/ec/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-12-Version-7.jpg/v4-550px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-12-Version-7.jpg
/images/thumb/e/ec/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-12-Version-7.jpg/v4-300px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-12-Version-7.jpg









Alternately, use a mild (3%) hydrogen peroxide and drop a few drop into the ear. This will clean the ear in addition to easing the earwax.
Note that you should not put fluid into your ear if you have a perforated eardrum or suspect an ear infection. See a doctor instead.

, This is supposed to create a vacuum, drawing wax out of the ear. Clinical trials have raised questions about effectiveness, however, and doctors worry about the risk associated with the practice.
/images/thumb/a/a8/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-13-Version-7.jpg/v4-550px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-13-Version-7.jpg
/images/thumb/a/a8/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-13-Version-7.jpg/v4-300px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-13-Version-7.jpg








, If your congestion is accompanied by pain in the inner ear or your outer ear is sensitive to the touch, you may have an ear infection. This is especially common in young children. Your doctor will prescribe the following treatments for you.
/images/thumb/b/b7/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-14-Version-7.jpg/v4-550px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-14-Version-7.jpg
/images/thumb/b/b7/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-14-Version-7.jpg/v4-300px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-14-Version-7.jpg









Take antibiotics as instructed. Ear infections need to be treated with antibiotics to rid your ear of the bacteria that caused the infection.
Use a prescribed ear-drop, such as antipyrene-benzocaine. This is a numbing drug that will not alleviate congestion, but will help to ease the side effect of pain.

, Use anything from a heating blanket to a hot water bottle. The heat from a warm washcloth will help to loosen congestion and ease the pain.
/images/thumb/6/6a/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-15-Version-7.jpg/v4-550px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-15-Version-7.jpg
/images/thumb/6/6a/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-15-Version-7.jpg/v4-300px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-15-Version-7.jpg








, If you have any questions, talk with your doctor about their usefulness and relevancy in your case.
/images/thumb/3/3f/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-16-Version-7.jpg/v4-550px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-16-Version-7.jpg
/images/thumb/3/3f/Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-16-Version-7.jpg/v4-300px-Relieve-Ear-Congestion-Step-16-Version-7.jpg









Only take antihistamines if you ear infection is accompanied by congestion.Antihistamines will dry out your throat and respiratory passages, so it's recommended that you drink plenty of water.
If your toddler has an ear infection, bottle-feed him or her upright if possible.Don't put your toddler to bed with a bottle, and try to take your baby off of the bottle as soon as your child's physician feels it's appropriate.
Gargling with a saline solution can help ease a sore throat that accompanies many ear infections, as well as soothing the Eustachian tubes.Try a simple solution of warm water and a teaspoon of salt; or water, a bit of lemon, and honey. Gargle for 15-30 seconds and spit out.

Wear a wig.,
Use a prosthesis.,
Wear camouflage makeup.,
Play around with your clothing style.,
Accentuate your style.,
Be proud of yourself despite changes.",How to Cope when Cancer Changes Your Appearance1," The effects of chemotherapy cause a variety of negative physical symptoms, including hair loss. To cope with this drastic physical change, some people with cancer choose to wear wigs. The wigs allow them to feel more like their old selves.


If you find that the wigs are scratchy on your head, opt for a light hat. Additionally, some companies offer baseball hats with hair sewn into the bottom, so that it looks like you’re wearing a hat over long hair, and you don’t have to feel the itchy effects of the hair.;
, Doctors may remove body parts to eliminate the source of the cancer. Obviously, this is a huge change for anyone. Wearing a prosthesis can help you feel better about your physical appearance, as well as possibly help you lead a similar life to what you led before.

Ask your doctor for information about how to obtain these pieces., Some cancer and cancer surgeries can leave a person with scarring that can affect their self-esteem. It may also cause changes to their skin tone and overall complexion. Typical makeup may help to cover minor skin changes and scars, but you may require a heavier-duty product, like camouflage makeup.

Ask your doctor about obtaining prescription camouflage makeup. Your doctor may also be able to offer advice on how to best apply the makeup., People with cancer who are undergoing treatment usually aren’t particularly active. Additionally, any steroids they take may cause weight gain. If you can’t exercise to lose or keep the weight off, consider wearing bigger clothing that may hide what you feel uncomfortable about. Wearing looser clothing may also help if your skin is feeling extra sensitive because of the medications and treatment.


However, you may find that you feel more uncomfortable wearing clothing that is too big. Donning clothes that fit properly could make you feel better about yourself. The bottom line is you should do what makes you feel best about yourself, both physically and mentally., You may find that wearing accessories helps you feel better about your appearance. Wearing earrings, scarves, and necklaces can help women play up their femininity, as can wearing makeup and using it to create the appearance of eyebrows, if yours are gone. You may find that taking these small steps can make a huge difference in how you feel about yourself.


If your fingernails are fragile because of the cancer or treatment, try using oil to keep them protected and from breaking. Additionally, use dark nail polish if you find that the treatments are making your nails look discolored. Glitter-based polish can also help to hide ridges., Fighting cancer is a hard battle. You shouldn't have to add to that by being self-conscious about your appearance. If you choose to use makeup and supplies, that's your choice. But, don't feel like you have to hide or be ashamed of physical changes caused by cancer. Do what's right for you.

Consider age-related hearing loss.,
Rule out trauma induced hearing loss.,
Perform a self-test for hearing loss.,
Determine if you struggle with one-on-one conversations.,
Notice whether you can hear clearly in noisy situations.,
Think about if you’re changing your behavior.,
Notice if other people comment on your hearing.",How to Recognize Hearing Loss1," Hearing loss that occurs gradually with advancing age is called presbycusis. Hearing loss associated with age is very common and affects nearly half of individuals over the age of 75. This form of hearing loss is the result of several changes to the ears that occur over a lifetime.Chronic health conditions such as hypertension and diabetes can kill sensory cells in the ears that do not grow back.
Exposure to loud sounds that have resulted in the death of sensory cells adds up over time.
Age related changes to structures to the ear, such as the eardrum and ossicles, affect the ability of the ear to function optimally.;
, People of all ages can suffer from hearing loss due to trauma of some sort. If you have recently experienced a physical trauma that may explain your hearing loss, this may be the culprit.Very loud sounds can damage your eardrums, and so can prolonged exposure to noise. Sound is measured in units called decibels. Sounds under 75 decibels usually do not cause traumatic hearing loss even after prolonged exposure. Sounds measuring 85 decibels or over are associated with hearing loss after prolonged exposure. Examples of these potentially damaging sounds come from motorcycles (95dB), sirens (120dB), and firecrackers (150dB).
To reduce your risk of trauma-induced hearing loss, limit your interactions with things that are loud enough to cause hearing damage. These can include plane engines, lawnmowers, motorcycles, chainsaws, powerboats, and MP3 players. If you do come into contact with these things, try to wear ear plugs or head phones. Keep your MP3 player at a low volume.
Damage from flying or diving (barotrauma) can cause hearing loss as a result of unequal pressure between the internal parts of the ear and the external environment.If you have experienced any of these things, make sure to tell your doctor.
If you've recently been sick, hearing loss can be explained by congestion or an infection that damaged your ears. In some cases, antibiotics can be used to help and the damage is rarely permanent.

, Hearing loss can often come on gradually, but there may be signs emerging that indicate that you have a problem. By figuring out the problem early, you can often seek treatment to delay further hearing loss. Honestly assess your hearing. Don’t be too proud or scared to admit that you are having some trouble hearing.Determine if you have ringing in your ears. This may be a symptom of hearing loss.
Pay attention to how things sound to you. Are you struggling to hear people, music, or television?
Do you ask people to repeat themselves?
For a week, pay close attention to your hearing.

, If you are suffering from hearing loss, you may find that you struggle with normal conversations. If you are talking to someone one-on-one, you may miss things the other person has said or need the person to speak louder. You may have major difficulty following conversations involving more than two people.When you are talking to people, you may have to ask others to repeat themselves often.
When you engage in conversations with people, you may think that other people sound muffled. You may also feel like people are mumbling when they talk.
When you are in a conversation with other people, you may find yourself agreeing or nodding your head even though you're not sure what's been said., Another sign you may be suffering from hearing loss is that you have trouble hearing in noisy environments. When there is background noise around you, you have difficulty hearing conversations, music, or the television. You may also experience difficulty hearing certain environmental sounds, such as birds chirping.You may have trouble hearing in noisy situations, like conferences, restaurants, malls, or crowded meeting rooms.
You may have difficulty in conversations involving more than one person because there are too many sounds for you to hear or differentiate between.

, One side effect of hearing loss you may not even realize you are doing is changing your behavior because of your hearing. Decide if you are withdrawing from social situations that you once enjoyed because of difficulty hearing. For example, you may have stopped attending functions you used to enjoy, like plays, concerts, or movies, because you can’t hear.Think about if you have changed habits at home. Do you turn up the volume on the television louder than you used to? Do you listen to your music at a louder volume than you used to?
Figure out if you avoid phone calls because you can’t hear the person on the other end.
Determine if you now read lips in the movies or on TV, or if you intently watch a person's mouth while they are speaking. You may also have started watching television with the subtitles on because you can’t understand what the people are saying.

, Maybe you haven’t noticed any changes in your hearing because it has been gradual. However, other people may start to comment on your hearing loss. Think about whether or not other people have mentioned that your difficulty hearing is a concern. You may also notice that people are getting surprised or perplexed because you misunderstand what they say.Do people that you talk to seem bothered that they need to repeat themselves? Notice if other people are annoyed when they are talking to you because you are having trouble understanding them.
Are other people complaining that you turn the volume of the television or radio too loud?
Have people commented that you talk too loudly?
Do people change their speech pattern when repeating themselves to help you understand them? Examples of this include talking louder, facing you directly when speaking, or slowing their speech and exaggerating their lip movements. This may indicate that the individual thought they were speaking at an audible level previously and suspects that you have hearing loss.

Try over-the-counter medicine.,
Get prescription medicine.,
Purchase oil products.",How to Relieve Ear Infection Pain2," There are a few different kinds of medicines you can buy to help relieve ear pain. Ear drops can help with the pain. You can also use acetaminophen (like Tylenol) or ibuprofen (like Advil) to help relieve pain.Do not use aspirin in children under the age of 2 years or in any child or teenager after the flu or the chicken pox.Giving aspirin to a child or teenager can lead to Reye's syndrome, which is a potentially fatal disease that causes the brain and liver to swell. The risk of a child or teen developing Reye's syndrome is even higher after the child or teen has had chicken pox or the flu., Most adults with mild ear infections heal within a week using home remedies. However, if the ear infection is severe enough, your doctor might prescribe antibiotics. Generally, antibiotics are only used in severe cases and not for every ear infection. If the pain or infection is bad enough, your doctor can prescribe eardrops or other medicine.For children younger than six months of age with an ear infection, antibiotics should be given immediately. Do not try to use home remedies for an ear infection on a child.
Amoxicillin is the most commonly prescribed drug for ear infections.Your doctor may recommend taking 500 mg every 12 hours or 250 mg every 8 hours for a mild to moderate infection. For a severe infection (patients with fever) your doctor may prescribe 875 mg every 12 hours or 500 mg every 8 hours.
Your doctor may also prescribe amoxicillin-clavulanate if your infection does not respond to amoxicillin or if you have severe ear pain and/or other symptoms, such as a high temperature.If you are allergic to penicillin, then your doctor may prescribe cefdinir, cefpodoxime, cefuroxime, or ceftriaxone instead.
Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are bacteria that may be to blame for your ear infection. Taking antibiotics should attack the bacteria. However, if your infection does not seem to improve within 48 to 72 hours after starting antibiotics, then call your doctor.

, There are a number of commercial ear oil products that can be purchased in most stores or online. Examples of these include: Wiseways Herbals, NOW Ear Oil Relief, HerbPharm Kid’s Mullein/Garlic Ear oil, and Gaia Herbs Ear Oil with Mullein/St John's wort. Try these if you don’t want to make your own.


Make sure to follow the directions for use.
If your child has an ear infection, do not try to treat it yourself. Ear infections in young children are more likely to lead to serious complications, such as hearing loss, facial paralysis, brain abscess, and meningitis.Take your child to see a doctor right away if he or she is having ear pain.

Recognize the symptoms of an ear infection.,
Monitor the risks for ear infections.,
Contact your physician.",How to Relieve Ear Infection Pain3," An adult or older child should be able to identify if she has an ear infection. An infant cannot, so you will have to look for symptoms. The symptoms of an ear infection include:Tugging or pulling at the ear (this may be the only sign in some infants)
Ear pain, especially when lying down
Irritability, crying, and fussiness
Difficulty sleeping
Hearing loss
Fever of 100oF or higher
Loss of appetite
Drainage from the ear
Dizziness or a feeling that the room is spinning
Warmth, redness, or pain around the ear
Swelling or itching

, Ear infections cannot be caught from another person. However, certain conditions can lead to ear infections. Be alert for ear infections if you or your child encounter any of the following conditions:Allergies, colds, or sinus infections
Cold climates
Changes in altitude or climate
Pacifier or sippy cup use, or drinking a bottle while lying down
Exposure to smoke
Family history of ear infections

, Most ear infections can be treated at home. However, some ear infections are severe and need to be taken care of by a doctor. Call your doctor if any of the following apply:Fever of 100 degrees Fahrenheit or higher
Severe pain
Severe pain that suddenly stops. This may indicate a ruptured eardrum.
Drainage from the ear
Any new symptoms, such as dizziness, headache, swelling, or weakness in the facial muscles
If the ear pain lasts more than 24 hours
Change in hearing ability

Visit your doctor.,
Use an over-the-counter painkiller to manage mild pain.,
Get moderate opioid painkillers to address moderate pain.If Acetaminophen and NSAIDs don't effectively manage your pain, you may ask your doctor for a prescription to receive stronger painkillers.,
Talk to your doctor about getting Morphine treatment for severe pain.Your doctor will give you a moderate painkiller first, then gradually move you to stronger or higher doses according to your pain state as well as your response to the medication.,
Adhere to the therapy plan written by your doctor.,
Take antidepressants to reduce neuropathic pain (pain caused by damage to nerve tissue).Antidepressants have a positive effect in controlling the burning or prickling sensation caused by neuropathic pain.,
Get a prescription for an anti-convulsant.,
Use local anesthetics to treat specific pain sites.,
Treat the cancer itself.It is important to remember that undergoing treatments such as surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy to shrink the size of your tumor will in itself decrease your pain.",How to Control Cancer Pain1," Let your doctor know of any pain that you are currently experiencing. They may be able to prescribe a medication or recommend a pain killer. Furthermore, they will inform you about any medications that might interfere with your current treatment.
, You can easily buy over-the-counter medicines to manage your daily pain.These OTC medications include Acetaminophen (Tylenol) as well as NSAIDs, a popular class of anti-inflammatory drugs that help block the pain receptors in your brain from receiving pain signals.


NSAIDs are usually recommended for bone or muscle pain, because they reduce the inflammation and swelling that can put pressure on the affected body part.NSAIDs are available in tablets, injections, liquids, suppositories, and topical creams.
NSAIDs include Ibuprofen (Advil) and Sodium Naproxen (Aleve).
Do not take NSAIDs if you suffer from a gastrointestinal disorder, peptic ulcers, or are taking blood thinners unless directed to do so by your doctor.

, Opioid painkillers such as Codeine and Tramadol can help to manage moderate pain, but something stronger like Morphine may be necessary for severe pain. Your oncologist is the only person who can determine what medicine is suitable to manage your pain, so don't try to self-prescribe.


Note that opioid pain medications often cause constipation as a side effect. Therefore, if your doctor begins you on these medications, he or she will likely also put you on an appropriate bowel regimen as well.It is easier to prevent bowel problems by treating them before they arise, rather than waiting until after the fact.

, Note that you will need to be monitored when using Morphine, because it has the potential for side effects.


Morphine is available in many dosage forms, such as:

Sustained release tablets, to be taken once or twice daily.
Immediate release tablets or liquid, to be taken every 2 to 4 hours.
Injections to be given directly or through a drip in a hospital.
Subcutaneous injections.
Dissolved tablets under the tongue.
Patches stuck directly to the skin.


Morphine can cause constipation, dry mouth, and itching or blurred vision.

, It is very important that you take all your medications as instructed by your doctor, even if you don't feel like you need them immediately. This is because skipping any of your doses can result in a sudden worsening of pain. Pain is best treated by getting to a level where you can prevent it before it becomes overwhelming.If you felt pain before your next scheduled dose of medication, ask your doctor to increase your dose or to change the dosage form you’re taking.
If you have sudden breakthrough pain, take a breakthrough painkiller pill (your doctor will instruct you which ones to take in such situations).

, These medications can also be useful in treating the depression that may accompany your fight against cancer.


Examples of antidepressants include Fluoxetine (Prozac) and Sertraline (Lustral). Side effects can include dry mouth or drowsiness.

, Anti-convulsants such as Gabapentin (Neurontin) can also be used to treat nerve-related pain. This requires a prescription from your doctor., Local anesthetics can be useful in certain cases of localized pain, such as mouth ulcers. Local anesthetics are commonly found as gel formulas, such as Orabase. These gels form a protective layer on the ulcer that insulates it from painful sensations.


Getting an epidural anesthetic can treat severe back pain by directly injecting medication into your spine.

, For instance, many people who have incurable cancer (such as men with prostate cancer that has metastasized to the bones) continue to receive treatment (in this case, that shrinks the size of their bone metastases). This, in turn, decreases the amount of pain they feel (in this case, it reduces bone pain).


It can wind up being one of the most effective strategies of pain management, even though the treatment itself is aimed at the symptoms rather than being aimed at actually curing the cancer.

Visit an ear, nose, and throat doctor.,
Visit an audiologist.,
Ask for a pure-tone test.,
Get a middle ear test.,
Undergo further testing.",How to Recognize Hearing Loss2," If you suspect hearing loss, you should visit an ear, nose, and throat specialist to get a physical exam. You may be required to give a medical history and explain certain behaviors or habits related to your hearing. This doctor will rule out any underlying medical condition that may be causing your hearing loss.Your doctor will physically examine the ear to see if there is excess water or wax in the ear causing hearing problems.
You may want to visit your general physician first if you are not sure if you have any hearing loss.

, You may choose to see an audiologist for a hearing exam. If you see a general physician or ear, nose, and throat specialist first, they may refer you to an audiologist when they discover any hearing damage. If you know you have hearing damage, you may choose to go to the audiologist first, but you may have to sign a waiver since the FDA requires a patient to go to a general physician first before an audiologist.Your audiologist can help you determine the extent and type of hearing loss that you have.
An audiologist will also help you determine what treatment options are right for you, such as hearing aids.

, You may be given a pure tone test to help determine the extent of your hearing loss. A pure-tone hearing test determines the tones you can hear. You will be required to wear earphones as you listen to different low and high pitches. The test helps determine what frequencies you cannot hear.You will also be given different pitches in each ear. Your ears may have different types or severities of hearing loss, so this test will help determine the specific hearing loss for each ear.

, The audiologist may also want to perform tests that evaluate how your middle ear is functioning. These tests look for any fluid in the middle ear, if there are problems with the eardrum, or if wax is blocking the ear canal. The doctor may also check for the amount of air in the ear canal, which can give vital information about the eardrum.Acoustic reflex measures can help the audiologist figure out where the hearing loss is and what type of hearing loss you have.
Middle ear tests are most common with young children, but they are performed on adults.

, There are other tests the audiologist can perform to check for hearing loss. You may be speech tested, where you repeat back a speech that you listen to. You may also undergo auditory brainstem response (ABR), where electrodes monitor your inner ear and the brain pathways used for hearing.These tests may not be necessary to determine your hearing loss or the type of hearing loss you are experiencing.

Recognize the signs and symptoms of hearing loss for infants.,
Look for signs of hearing difficulties in toddlers.,
Recognize hearing loss in school-age children.",How to Recognize Hearing Loss3," Many times hearing loss is associated with age or an infection, but can also be present right from the start of a child's life. Infants can be more difficult to gauge because they cannot directly communicate their symptoms like adults or even older children. If you notice any of these symptoms in your infant, they may have hearing issues:Your child does not turn to the source of a sound by three to four months of age. By four months your child should awaken or startle to loud sounds, calm at the sound of familiar voices, and respond to familiar voices occasionally with smiles or coos.
Your child pays attention to vibrating noises or noises that can be felt rather than heard.
Your child turns their head when they see you, but not if you only call out their name. This is usually mistaken for not paying attention or the child just ignoring you, but it could be the result of a partial hearing loss.

, Toddlers may also experience hearing problems. This is a critical stage for development since important speech skills are gained through listening and imitation. Paying attention to language development is a good way to recognize hearing difficulties.By 24 months, toddlers should be able to point to familiar objects, listen to stories and songs, and follow basic commands. If a child over the age of two is unable to express basic needs or only make certain sounds, they may be having trouble hearing.Rule out other explanations for language problems. Many children may have oral-motor problems that are part of neurological or cognitive delays. It could also be a physical problem with the mouth or tongue. A speech pathologist will be able to evaluate whether the problem is physical in the mouth or ear, or whether there could be other explanations., Children who attend school may see performance related problems develop. If your child is sitting closer to the teacher to understand them, asks for things to be repeated, or doesn’t respond to noises, they may be suffering from hearing issues.If your child’s academic performance is suffering, it may be a sign of hearing problems. Children may have trouble following directions or listening to information. You can ask your child about their hearing, but some children may be embarrassed or not realize their hearing is different than other people’s.
Your child may have problems interacting with other children or not be developing socially like they should because of hearing problems.
Most schools have hearing specialists that can perform further testing on your child."
"
Observe how the adult reacts to when approached.,
Notice changes in basic interactions.,
Take measures to help them cope with hearing changes.",How to Recognize Hearing Loss4," If you have an adult, especially an elderly adult, who seems to be startled easily when someone approaches them, they may have a hearing loss. For example, if you knock and enter a room, and they act startled when they finally see you, they may be having trouble hearing what's happening in their environment.


The adult may also not realize someone has entered their home or the room until after the fact.
The adult may not realize someone is speaking to them until they are physically touched or they have turned towards the person speaking.
This can difficult and frustrating, especially for elderly people. Take extra steps to ensure you don't startle them to prevent any traumatic reactions., Hearing loss in someone else can be difficult to recognize since you are not experiencing the symptoms. Look for signs like turning the TV volume up excessively, constantly asking you to repeat yourself, or a general lack of awareness of sounds around them.Any of the problems commonly mentioned above in recognizing hearing loss in yourself can also apply.

, If you know someone who has experienced hearing loss, you can try to help them cope and adapt to the change. This can include getting them devices that amplify the radio or television, hearing aids, or even louder alerts for basic necessities like alarm clocks and phones. You can also help by speaking clearly in front of them and avoiding loud environments that can drown out people around them and cause frustration.


You may want to take them to an audiologist or a doctor that can evaluate them and recommend treatments.

Use adaptive behaviors.,
Use technology to improve hearing.,
Turn the negative into a positive.",How to Recognize Hearing Loss5," One of the most difficult parts of hearing loss can be learning to adjust your lifestyle. When someone is talking, try to stand directly in front of them so that mouth movements can clue you in on what they're saying.If you're in a crowded place, sit closely so that mouth-to-eye contact is easy and unnoticed by the larger group. When possible, try to avoid noisy places.
Use a phone or television amplifying device to help make your day-to-day life easier.

, The medical technology to help with hearing loss has greatly improved in recent years. On the most basic level, a hearing aid will take sounds from around you and amplify them into your ear. There are a number of different hearing aids depending on the extent of your problems and personal problems.One type of hearing aid is an ear canal hearing aids. These go down into your ear canal. They are not very noticeable, so they may be a good choice for discretion. These don't need much power to work, so you don't have to change the batteries often. The ear canal hearing aid can cause wax build-up in the ear canal.
Another type of hearing aid is an in the ear hearing aid. These fit the lower or upper part of your ear. They are used most frequently for people with minor hearing problems. This type of hearing aid has a large battery, so they have a longer life than some of the other types. They may also cause a build-up of wax in the ear.
The third type of hearing aid is the behind-the-ear (BTE) hearing aid. These have a hook that goes over your ear and sits just behind your ear. This piece connects to a part that is put into your ear canal. This type of hearing aid is large and noticeable; however, it has more power to pick up hard-to-hear sounds.
The last type of hearing aid is an open fit hearing aid. This is a type of BTE model, but with no piece inside the ear canal. This lets sounds at a low-frequency enter the ear naturally, while the hearing aid amplifies higher frequencies that may be hard to hear. This type of hearing aid is more intricate with more parts, so it can be more difficult to use.
If hearing aids are not proving effective, speak to your physician regarding other options such as a cochlear implant. This type of device works differently than a hearing aid. It is inserted surgically and functions to directly stimulate the nerves present in the inner ear that send signals to the brain for hearing., You may notice how your hearing loss is negatively affecting your interactions with friends and, family; it may also be affecting your work. However, losing your hearing doesn't need to spell doom. Many times a loss of hearing can help people develop rich inner lives rather than constantly being drawn into what is happening around them.Educate those around you on your shifting needs. It can be frustrating if your family or friends are not altering their interactions with you, but they can't know what you don't tell them. Be an advocate for yourself and tell them what makes life easier for you. This will eliminate a lot of tension that may come up and force open communications.

Move away from blaring sounds.,
Use hearing protection.,
Turn down the volume.,
Look into quieter electronics.,
Get regular checkups.,
Take supplements.,
Decrease fatigue and stress.,
Remove earwax.,
Find alternative medications.",How to Prevent Tinnitus," The most common cause of tinnitus is damage to the sensory hair cells in the inner ear from exposure to loud noises. Moving yourself away from the center of blaring sounds such as at concerts or sporting events can help prevent damage to your ears that causes tinnitus.Avoid placing yourself close to any device that is blaring noise. Sounds higher 85 decibels can harm your hearing.For example, if you at a concert, don’t stand right next to speakers. If you are in the street with a lot of construction, stand as far away from jackhammers or other loud equipment as you can. Likewise, if your partner is mowing the lawn, stay indoors.
Let your ears rest occasionally. Do something that doesn’t involve loud noises such as hiking or biking in a park.;
, In some cases, you may not be able to move away from loud noises such as a shotgun firing or a concert. Wearing protective hearing devices to dampen sound can protect your hearing and prevent tinnitus.Buy earplugs or earmuffs to for any occasion in which you’ll be exposed to loud noises.Be aware that if you use chain saws, are a musician, use loud machinery in industry, or shoot firearms, you should always wear hearing protection that covers your entire ear.Protect children’s ears in the same way as you would your own. Earmuffs are often an easier option for children than earplugs., Any device that emits sound can harm your hearing. Keeping sound at a reasonable level can minimize your risk for tinnitus.Select a volume on electronics such as TVs, video games, laptops, and tablets at the lowest sound possible.
Set the volume of personal listening devices, such as a cell phone, MP3 player, or anything that requires headphones, at a conservative level. No one else should hear what you’re listening to. Be aware that ear-buds are more likely to contribute to tinnitus and hearing loss than other headphone models. Consider getting a pair of noise-cancelling headphones, which can help you listen at a low volume., If you’re on the market for new electronics and personal devices, see if you can find out decibel levels as you consider your options. In fact, many new models have a label with decibel ratings. Buy the lowest rating you can find to prevent tinnitus.Ask personnel at stores if they know about the lowest decibel ratings available for the product you want. Many companies also include this information on their websites.

, Seeing your doctor at least once a year protects your overall health. Keeping yourself healthy will promote good ear health, but if you are concerned about hearing loss or tinnitus, tell your doctor to pay special attention to your ears. This may identify conditions that cause tinnitus.Schedule an appointment with your regular doctor or see an otolaryngologist, which is also called an ENT — ear, nose, and throat doctor.
Tinnitus can be caused by the following: depression, insomnia, vascular abnormalities, conductive hearing loss due to outer ear or middle ear disease, and drug toxicity. It is important to address any underlying problems that may be lead to tinnitus.
Ask your doctor to check your cardiovascular health. Blood vessel disorders such as high blood pressure can lead to tinnitus. Vascular tinnitus can be caused by an Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM), which is a tangle of blood vessels that are poorly formed and poorly functioning.
Be aware that getting early and proper diagnosis and treatment for the following conditions can also help prevent tinnitus: ear and sinus infections, brain tumors, positional vertigo, thyroid abnormalities, Ménière’s disease., Just as certain nutrients help protect your eyes and heart, there are some vitamins and antioxidants that may protect hair cells and your cochlea. Taking supplements such as magnesium and N-Acetyl-Cysteine (NAC) may minimize your risk of hearing loss and prevent tinnitus.Get the antioxidants N-Acetyl-Cysteine (NAC) and Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALCAR) at your local pharmacy or health food store. They can protect your cochlea from loud noise and may even reduce damage after you hearing a loud noise. Make sure to follow dosing directions to avoid toxicity.
Take a daily multivitamin with magnesium and vitamins A, E, and C. These vitamins can protect the hair cells of your inner ear from damage, which contributes to tinnitus. Avoid taking megadoses of these vitamins, which can harm your health. You can also consider getting these vitamins from foods in your diet.

, Although noise is the primary cause of tinnitus, fatigue and stress can also contribute to tinnitus. Making sure that you get enough rest and managing the stress in your life may prevent you from getting tinnitus.Try to keep a flexible schedule that gives you time to relax or get away from stress.
Stay away or remove yourself from stressful situations. If you can’t, relax yourself by taking deep breaths.
Get seven to nine hours of sleep every night to reduce fatigue and allow your body to heal from the day. Take a 30 minute break during the day, during which you can reduce fatigue and stress.

, Too much earwax can block your ear canal and cause tinnitus. Keeping your ears free of wax buildup can not only prevent tinnitus but also hearing loss.Don’t clean your ears too often, however, because some wax helps keep your ears healthy.


Wipe the outside of your ear and outer ear canal with a soft, moist cloth or paper tissue.You can also use an over-the-counter earwax removal drops to remove wax.Never put anything in your ear! Stay away from cotton swabs (Q-tips) or other tools to remove wax. These can cause serious harm to your ears and hearing.Have your doctor remove excessive wax buildup.

, Over 200 drugs are considered ototoxic, which means they can damage your hearing and cause tinnitus. Avoiding these medications for prolonged periods or finding alternatives may minimize your risk for developing tinnitus.Talk to your doctor about substituting the following drugs to prevent to minimize tinnitus:Antibiotics such as polymyxin, erythromycin, vancomycin, neomycin
Cancer medications such as mechlorethamine and vincristine
Diuretics or water pills such as bumetanide, ethacrynic acid, or furosemide
Antidepressants such as paroxetine, sertraline, amitriptyline
Quinine for malaria
Aspirin

Breathe in pleasant aromas to relax and reduce inflammation.,
Use visualization to improve your mental state.,
Exercise to improve your fitness.",How to Control Cancer Pain2," Try using aromatherapy, which is based on inhaling the vapors of essential oils such as lavender, chamomile, jasmine, or peppermint oils in a warm bath. Aromatherapy can decrease inflammation, relax muscles, improve your anxiety, maintain your sleep pattern, and reduce nausea.


Having a warm bath in itself can also be soothing, helping to alleviate generalized muscle aches and pains.
If you find that your pain is localized to a particular area of your body, you can also try using heat or a cold pack applied directly to that location to soothe the pain.

, During visualization, you try to imagine a scene or a place that will make you feel comforted and happy. You can try doing this by thinking of a place or memory that makes you happy, and visualizing it in detail. This can improve your mood and help you control cancer symptoms and reduce the severity of pain, stress, and tiredness.

, Going for a walk, doing yoga, or engaging in other physical activities can help to improve your overall health. Exercise also releases endorphins, which are natural pain-killing substances in the brain, so it can also help to combat cancer pain. Speak to your physician about an exercise program that is safe for you, depending upon the stage and severity of your cancer.Exercise can also help to alleviate stress and depression, and enhance your general mood, so the benefits are multiple.

Get an ear reflexology chart online or refer to one in a book.,
Study the layout of points on an ear reflexology chart.,
Identify specific areas within regions.",How to Read an Ear Reflexology Chart1," Before you can learn how to read an ear reflexology chart, you will need to get yourself a good one to consult. You can find ear reflexology charts online or in a reflexology book. For best results, get a large poster size chart. The ear has 90 standardized reflexology points, so it can be difficult to read an ear reflexology chart if it is too small., You will see a logical pattern of reflex points located on the different sections of the ear. The reflexology points are located on the outer ear and the outer ear canal area, as well as on the ear lobe. The reflex points for your organs are located on the inner area of the ear canal.


The way that reflexology points correspond to the human body may make more sense if you think of the ear as an upside down person in the fetal position. Areas of the head and neck correspond to the lower part of the ear (the ear lobes) and the center of the ear corresponds to internal organs. Then, the upper part of the ear corresponds to the lower parts such as the anus, legs, and feet.

, Many reflexology charts are color coded and these color coded areas point to specific regions of the body that you may stimulate using reflexology massage. If you are trying to locate a specific organ’s pressure point on your ears, try looking in a mirror and comparing the shape of your ear to the shape of the ear in the chart.

Understand noise-related hearing loss.,
Learn to recognize potentially dangerous noise levels.,
See a specialist if you suspect hearing damage.,
Turn down the music.,
Protect your hearing at work.,
Be careful at live concerts and shows.,
Protect your baby or child's hearing.,
Be careful with ototoxic drugs and chemicals.,
Protect yourself from diseases which can lead to hearing loss.,
Avoid head injuries.,
Don't try to clean out your ears.,
Lead a healthy lifestyle.",How to Protect Your Hearing," Frequent or prolonged exposure to loud noises is one of the most common causes of hearing loss, despite the fact that this type of hearing loss is completely preventable.


Our brain registers sound thanks to a spiral-shaped organ in the inner ear called the cochlea. The cochlea is covered in thousands of tiny hairs which register sound vibrations and turn them into electrical impulses to be processed by the brain.
When your ears are exposed to loud noises, these tiny hairs can become damaged, resulting in hearing loss. Although short, intense noises (like fireworks or a gunshot) are sometimes the cause, the most common cause is regular exposure to excessive noise (listening to music too loudly, working in a noisy environment).
It's important to realize that once this type of hearing damage occurs, it cannot be reversed. Therefore it is very important to take measures to protect your hearing before it's too late.;
, A large part of protecting your hearing is learning to recognize potentially dangerous noise levels. Then you will have a better idea of what to avoid.


Prolonged exposure to noise levels above 85 decibels is considered to be damaging to your hearing. To give you an idea of where 85 decibels lies on the scale:

Normal conversation: 60 to 65 dB
Motorcycle or lawnmower: 85 to 95 dB
Music at a nightclub: 110 dB
MP3 player at maximum volume: 112 dB
Ambulance siren: 120 dB


Taking measures to reduce noise levels by just a few decibels can be hugely beneficial for your ears. This is due to the fact that every 3 dB increase in the noise level effectively doubles the amount of sound energy being released.
As a result, the amount of time you can safely spend listening to a certain sound rapidly decreases the louder the sound is. For example, you can safely spend up to eight hours listening to an 85 dB sound, but you should only spend 15 minutes exposed to noise levels above 100 dB.
If you can't hold a conversation with someone who is standing two meters away from you without shouting, the noise level is damaging to your ears.

, If you are having any trouble with your hearing or are experiencing ear pain, it's a good idea to consult a specialist.


Depending on the issue, you may need to see an ear, nose and throat doctor (an Otolaryngologist), or a licensed audiologist.
Each of these will perform a series of tests to determine whether your hearing has been damaged.
While there is no cure for hearing damage, hearing aids can ease the problem by magnifying sounds as they enter your ear. Of course, they are expensive and may not always work, so it's important to protect your hearing.

, Listening to loud music through earphones has been identified as one of the major causes of hearing loss in young people.


The volume on your MP3 player is too high if it completely drowns out all background noise, or if it feels uncomfortable to listen to. Switch to headphones instead of earphones, as these provide better sound quality at a lower volume.
Try to follow the 60/60 rule when listening to music on an MP3 player. This means you should listen to music at no more than 60% of your music player's maximum volume, for no more than 60 minutes at a time.
You also need to be careful when listening to music in enclosed spaces, such as in a car. Turning the volume dial down just a couple of notches can make a huge difference to your hearing., Some workplaces can be described as ""hazardous sound environments,"" where workers are exposed to loud noises for prolonged periods of time. This includes work environments such as factories with noisy machinery and construction sites.


Nowadays, most workplaces have to follow strict regulations to protect their employees' hearing. Workers are required to wear noise canceling ear muffs or earplugs if the average daily noise level is above 85 decibels.
However, people who are self-employed are responsible for their own hearing, so don't forget to wear hearing protection if you're doing activities like mowing the lawn or doing home improvements.
If you are concerned about the noise levels in your workplace, speak to an occupational health and safety officer or to someone in the human resources department.

, Attending concerts or shows where you're exposed to loud, live music can be damaging to your hearing. For example, many people experience a ringing sound in their ears after leaving a concert, which should be taken as a warning sign.


To protect your ears while listening to live music, strategically position yourself away from any amplifiers, speakers or stage monitors. The further away you are from the source of the sound, the better.
Take ""quiet breaks."" If you're spending the night at a music bar or club, try to go outside for five minutes every hour. Just giving your ears a break from the constant noise exposure will do them some good.
Another alternative is to wear earplugs while you listen to live music. This can reduce the sound levels by 15 to 35 decibels, but shouldn't muffle your hearing or affect your enjoyment of the concert.
If you are a musician yourself, try to avoid practicing at full performance volume and wear earplugs while playing, if possible.

, If you are pregnant, it's important to avoid loud noises because a fetus's hearing can be damaged in utero. Similarly, young babies and children have thin skulls and developing ears, and are very sensitive to loud noises.


If you are pregnant, avoid loud concerts or workplace noise that exceeds 85 dB (about the level of a motorcycle engine), which has been linked to hearing loss in children. Loud noises during pregnancy has also been linked to a low birth weight and preterm delivery.Newborns should never be exposed to sudden loud noises. Noise above 80 dB has been linked to hearing loss and infant anxiety.
Young children have more sensitive hearing than adults, so if an environment seems loud to you, it is even louder to your child. Buy protective headphones or earplugs or avoid loud environments like rock concerts or front row seats at the fireworks display., Ototoxic drugs and chemicals are those which have the potential to damage your hearing.


The most common ototoxic drugs include salicylates (such as aspirin) and anti-malarial drugs. Industrial strength chemical solvents have also been linked with hearing loss.
To avoid hearing damage caused by drugs and chemicals, take all medications as directed and report any unusual side effects to your doctor.
If you work with chemical solvents, talk to your occupational health and safety officer about the preventative measures you can take., There are quite a number of illnesses and diseases which can lead to hearing loss. The most common of these are: measles, mumps, rubella, whooping cough, meningitis and syphilis.


The best way to avoid hearing loss caused by these diseases is to avoid contracting these diseases in the first place.
Get babies and children vaccinated and see a doctor immediately when you fall ill, as prompt diagnosis and treatment can prevent the development of more serious complications like hearing loss.
Avoid STDs like syphilis by wearing condoms during sex., Damage to the middle and inner ear due to head injury or trauma can result in hearing loss. Therefore, it is important to protect yourself from head trauma in any way possible.

Always wear a helmet when riding a bike or playing any kind of contact sports, as even a concussion can negatively affect your hearing, and always wear a seatbelt when travelling by car
Protect your ears from otitic barotrauma (damage caused by changing air pressure) by taking all necessary precautions when scuba diving.
Prevent yourself from falling by being aware of safety at all times. For example, do not stand on the top rung of a ladder.

, Many people attempt to clean out their ears using cotton buds. However, cotton buds simply pack earwax deeper into the ear, potentially damaging the thin, sensitive skin and negatively affecting your hearing.


Most people don't need to clean out their ears, as your ears need a certain amount of wax for protection and any excess will naturally be expelled.
But if you feel you have excess wax in your ears, you can get rid of it using an earwax removal kit. To use, place a couple of drops of earwax solution into your ears before bedtime, over the course of a couple of nights. The solution will soften the earwax, causing it to flow out naturally., Making certain healthy lifestyle choices can help to protect your hearing and ward off hearing loss for years to come.


Get plenty of exercise. Cardio exercise like walking, running or cycling helps to improve blood flow to your ears, which is good for your hearing. It's even better if you can do your exercise somewhere nice and quiet, like the woods or a secluded beach, as this also gives your ears a break from the hustle and bustle of daily life.

Quit smoking. A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that people who smoke (or are regularly exposed to secondhand smoke) are much more likely to experience age-related hearing loss.
Decrease your caffeine and sodium intake. Both caffeine and sodium can have a negative effect on your hearing -- caffeine decreases blood flow to the ears, while sodium increases fluid retention which can lead to swelling in the inner ear. Try switching to decaf coffee and tea and lowering your salt intake."

Limit your exposure to loud noises.,
Wear protective hearing devices.,
Monitor the volume of noise at home.,
Protect yourself from traumatic head injury.",How to Prevent Hearing Loss1," One of the most common causes of hearing loss is repeated exposure to loud noises.By reducing your exposure to loud noises as much as possible, you may be able to prevent hearing loss.Recreational activities such as concerts, hunting or shooting, snowmobiling can significantly impact your hearing.Consider wearing ear protection when doing outdoor activities such as mowing the lawn or whacking weeds.Many people work in places that require them to hear loud noises on a consistent basis. For example, working in factories, the military, transportation services, or construction may hurt your hearing.Noises above 85 decibels can harm your hearing.;
, Hearing loss related to sound is 100% preventable by taking proper measures to dampen sound.Purchase and wear protective hearing devices such as earplugs for any occasion in which you’ll be exposed to loud noises. Earplugs and earmuffs are options to help protect your hearing.Make sure to protect children’s ears from loud sounds with protective devices.You can purchase protective hearing devices from a wide variety of locations. For example: sporting stores will sell devices for activities like hunting and snowmobiling, music stores will offer protection for concerts and playing loud instruments, and hardware stores will sell products for noise from construction., You can help prevent noise-related hearing loss in your home by watching the volume of your appliances and also the volume at which people speak.By keeping sound levels to a minimum, you may minimize your risk for hearing loss or other conditions such as tinnitus.Keep the volume of electronics such as TVs, tablets, and video games at a minimum.If you use personal listening devices, keep the sound at a conservative level. Buying noise-cancelling headphones may help you listen at a lower noise level.Ear-bud type headphones are more likely to cause hearing loss than typical headphones. When using earbuds, it is highly recommended that you keep the volume to a minimum, especially if you are using special noise-canceling ones.
If you are wearing headphones and someone within 3 feet (0.9 m) can hear what you hear — it's too loud!
Buy quieter products. Many electronics come with decibel ratings on their packaging. Compare these ratings and buy the lowest you can find.Give your ears a break. Limit your time with devices that can produce high decibels, such as a TV or stereo. Find activities that do not involve high volume noises, such as hiking or biking in a park.

, Suffering a blow to the head can lead to hearing loss, temporarily or permanently.Make sure you are taking the proper precautions to protect your head while biking, skating, skateboarding, riding a motorcycle or scooter, or doing anything else that might lead to a head injury."

Learn the types of ear infections.,
Get a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine PCV.,
Get vaccinated against the flu.,
Treat the flu.,
Take care of a cold.",How to Prevent Ear Infections1," There are two different kinds of ear infections. There is acute otitis media (AOM), which is an ear infection of the middle ear canal in the area behind the ear drum. These are more common in children. There is also otitis externa (OE), also known as swimmer's ear, which is an infection of the canal outward and can be bacterial, polymicrobial, or fungal. These are more common with swimmers and diabetics., Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), which are called PCV13, fight against pneumococcal bacteria. These bacteria, which include haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, are one of the main reasons that ear infections occur. This vaccine can be given to both adults and children.The schedule for this vaccine includes four doses given at two, four, six, and 12 to 15 months of age. For infants that start immunization at seven to 11 months of age, three doses are given.
Children who are starting immunization at 12 to 13 months of age need only two doses. Those children who are over two years old are given only one dose.

, Getting the annual flu shot is also an important prevention method. The flu is another one of the most common causes of ear infections. Vaccinations can prevent you from getting the flu, thereby reducing your chances of getting an ear infection. Streptococcus pneumoniae, the bacteria that causes the flu, can be adequately vaccinated with a single injection. It is generally a good idea to get a new flu vaccine each flu season, as the flu tends to change throughout the year.This vaccine can be given to adults and children who are six months or older., You can also prevent ear infections by treating the flu if act before an infection has had time to develop. When you get the flu, start treatment right away. Try Tamiflu within the first 48 hours of the start of your symptoms for it to be effective. Tamiflu, also known as oseltamivir, is an antiviral medication that acts against the flu's genetic material. It helps inhibit viral replication and works to shorten the severity and duration of your symptoms.


This is only available by prescription, so visit your healthcare provider for a prescription.Look for typical flu symptoms, such as high fever, severe muscle aches, congestion, runny nose, cough, and poor appetite., Just like with the flu, treat a cold right away so it doesn't turn into an ear infection. A cold can be treated early in order to cut down the severity and duration of symptoms. There are many different ways to treat a cold, but any treatment will help you avoid an ear infection. Start taking zinc at the first signs of a cold. Studies show that, if you take zinc within 24 hours of your first symptoms, you have a greater chance of decreasing the duration of the cold.


You can buy zinc as a lozenge, tablet, or mouth spray as well as supplements that are available over-the-counter. Try to take between 75 to 150 mg daily to shorten the duration of a cold by 42%.Watch for an upset stomach.
Also try 1,000 – 2,000 mg of vitamin C daily to prevent infection(the recommended daily amount for healthy adults is 120 mg). Vitamin C can be found in fruits, vegetables, juice, and as a supplement.You can also try 175 – 300 mg of Echinacea daily to enhance immune function. It can be taken as a supplement or liquid"

Wad up some toilet paper.,
Moisten the toilet paper wads.,
Put the toilet paper wads into your ears.,
Dispose of the toilet paper earplugs when you remove them.",How to Make Earplugs2," Get two clean, dry pieces of toilet paper and wad them up so that they look like two small balls. The wads should be big enough to fill your ear canal, but not so big that they will not fit inside of your ear canal.

Keep in mind that you should only use toilet paper earplugs if you have no other option. Do not use toilet paper earplugs on a regular basis because pieces of the toilet paper may stick in your ears and cause an infection.Only use toilet paper earplugs as a short-term fix, such as when you are at a concert. Do not sleep with toilet paper earplugs in your ears.

, Hold each of your wads of toilet paper under a low stream of water for a few seconds to moisten it throughout. Then squeeze out all of the excess water so that the wads just feel damp.If the wads shrink from the water, you may need to add a little more toilet paper to each wad.
Wetting the toilet paper is important because dry toilet paper will not block noise as well. Dry toilet paper fibers may also stick in your ears and this can cause an infection.

, Stick the toilet paper wads into your ear canals to see if they fit. If the wads do not fit or if the fit is uncomfortable, then you may need to adjust them by adding or removing some of the toilet paper.Make sure that you reshape the wads before you try to put them into your ear canals again.

, Do not reuse the toilet paper earplugs at all or you may develop an ear infection. Throw them away right after you take them out of your ears.

If you need another pair of earplugs, use two new, clean pieces of toilet paper.

Purchase a bag of cotton balls.,
Wash your hands.,
Break off a small, dime-sized piece of a cotton ball.,
Wrap the cotton ball in a protective plastic wrap.,
Test the fit of the ear plug.,
Tie the end of the plastic wrap.,
Test out your ear plugs.,
Replace the earplugs on a weekly basis.",How to Make Earplugs3," These come in multiple sizes, but you can generally get a bag of 100 cotton balls for less than $5.00. You can find them in the health care section of your grocery store or local pharmacy.

Choose regular size cotton balls rather than jumbo size ones.
You can purchase sterile or non-sterile cotton balls since the cotton balls will just be wrapped in plastic anyways.

, It is important to make sure you are handling the cotton balls with clean hands as this will reduce the chance of infection in the ear canal.Use an antibacterial soap and wash with warm water. Dry with a clean hand towel.

, Roll the cotton ball piece into a round ball. The ball should fit comfortably inside of your ear canal.

, Use a plastic wrap that is flexible and not sticky, such as some plain plastic wrap. Cut the plastic wrap into a piece large enough so it can wrap around the cotton ball, but so it leaves a little tail. Wrapping the cotton in plastic wrap will prevent harmful fibers from getting into your sensitive ear canal and reduce the possibility of infection or injury from the cotton ball.Wrap the plastic wrap so it tightly covers the ball, but not so it crushes it into a flat shape.
If you use scissors to cut the plastic wrap, make sure they are clean. You can wash them in an antibacterial soap or dish soap with a clean sponge.

, Gently insert the wrapped cotton ball into your ear canal to assess its fit. Just pay attention to how comfortable it feels inside of your ear.


The ear plug should feel snug, but not like it is cramming into your ear canal or stretching it out. If it feels loose, then you will need to adjust the size as well.
You can add additional material from the cotton ball to the ear plug or you can take out part of the cotton if it is too large.
Be sure not to cram the ear plug too far into the ear; this could cause damage to the ear canal. The ear plug should rest just at the entrance to the ear canal, not beyond it.

, After you have tested the ear plug and have adjusted its size so it fits correctly, take a small rubber band and wind it around the tail of the plastic wrap. Make sure it is tightly closed around the wrap.


Take your pair of scissors and snip off the small tail of the plastic wrap. Be sure to leave a little bit hanging out of your ear so that it will be easy for you to remove the earplug.

, If you plan to use your ear plugs during the day, try wearing them in a busy cafe or restaurant. This will let you know how effective the earplugs are at reducing noise.

If you plan to sleep in the ear plugs, take a nap to test them out. If you sleep on your side, you might need to adjust the size of the plug for the ear that you keep pressed to the pillow.

, Because the material of the ear plugs is cotton, it will not hold up against a thorough cleaning. You should replace the cotton ball ear plugs every five to seven days to prevent bacteria from ear wax or oil building up in your ear canal. This could lead to a painful infection.

Store your ear plugs in a sanitary container, such as a clean plastic sandwich bag.

See your doctor regularly.,
Remove ear wax.,
Avoid prolonged use of certain medications.,
Control fevers.,
Immunize against viruses that can cause hearing loss.",How to Prevent Hearing Loss2," Even if you don’t have specific problems with your ears, it’s a good idea to see you doctor and monitor your ear health. This can help identify problems that could cause hearing loss.You can see your regular doctor to monitor your ear health or see a specialist for the ears, which is called an otolaryngologist.
If you have any symptoms of ear infections or a perforated eardrum, including bleeding or discharge of pus from your ears, see your doctor or go to the hospital as soon as possible., Buildup of earwax, which is also called cerumen, can cause hearing loss. Keep your ears clean to help prevent wax buildup and possible hearing loss.Use a soft cloth to wipe around the outside of your ear and on your outer ear canal.If you like, you can wet the cloth slightly with warm water.Wrap a paper tissue around your finger and gently wipe your outer ear and outer ear canal with the tissue.Apply an over the counter ear drops to remove wax.Avoid using cotton swabs or other instruments to clean your ears as this can run the risk of puncturing your ear drum or other serious complications.Avoid cleaning your ears too often. You need some amount of wax to maintain your ear health.
If you have significant ear wax buildup, consider seeing your doctor for cleaning. This is the safest way to remove the buildup and may also help you hear better.

, There are some drugs that can damage your inner ear from prolonged use. Avoiding these drugs as much as possible or for prolonged periods may minimize your risk for developing hearing loss or tinnitus.Antibiotics such as gentamicin and some chemotherapy drugs can affect hearing.Very high doses of aspirin or anti-malarial drugs may cause hearing loss.Loop diuretics may cause hearing loss.Some signs of hearing loss related to ototoxic drugs are: onset or intensification of tinnitus, fullness or pressure in the ear not related to infection, development of vertigo., Diseases that cause high fevers, such as meningitis, can damage your cochlea and impair hearing.If you have an illness accompanied by high fever, take measures to control the fever as much as you can.For temperatures above 102°F (38.9°C), you can take acetaminophen or ibuprofen to help bring down the fever.Adults can take aspirin to bring down a fever.Because of potentially fatal side effects, do not give aspirin to children with a fever.However, in an unfortunate twist, aspirin itself can contribute to hearing loss if taken in high doses. Make sure you always follow the recommended dose.

, There are some viruses, such as measles or rubella that can cause hearing loss in adults, children, and unborn fetuses. Getting vaccinated against these viruses may help prevent hearing loss in your or your unborn baby.Some viruses that can cause hearing loss are: cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, varicella zoster virus; and West Nile virus. Measles, mumps, rubella and rubeola can also cause hearing loss.You can get vaccinations for measles, mumps, and rubella—which is also called the MMR vaccine.In addition, vaccine are available for varicella zoster virus and vaccine trials for West Nile virus are currently underway."

Wash your hands before you touch your ear.,
Keep your ear lobes clean.,
Cover your ears.,
Limit your child's pacifier use after six months.Some pediatricians have linked extended use of pacifiers and bottles with ear infections.,
Feed young children correctly.",How to Prevent Ear Infections2," Washing your hands is one of the fundamental parts of good hygiene. If you have dirty hands and then touch your ears, there is a chance that you could be spreading harmful bacteria to your ears. Because of this, it is important to wash your hands before you touch your ears and anytime you may have come into contact with germs.Wash your hands after you use the restroom, after using public transportation, and after you shake hands with someone.


Also wash your hand after touching dirty objects (like dirty appliances, dirty dishes, and unwashed linens), before and after you handle raw food, and before and after you eat.

, Cleaning your earlobes can help to sweep away debris that may cause you to develop an infection. Always clean from the inside to the outside so that you don’t push any bacteria from the outside of your ear in further.Try to avoid thoroughly cleaning the inside of your ears because you may in fact push dirt and bacteria further into your ear, leading to congestion and potentially infection.

, Exposing yourself to bacteria and viruses is another way that you can develop an ear infection. This can include swimming and diving in contaminated water. Some surf and swimming spots are near areas where sewage is dumped and there may be harmful bacteria in the water. The constant moisture in your ears may lead to infection. To prevent contaminated waters from getting in your ears, buy ear coverings, swim caps, or ear plugs that can be used under water.


To help dry out your ears after you swim or surf, rinse your ears with a small amount of rubbing alcohol to facilitate drying in the ear.
Check the news or search online to see if the area where you plan to swim is safe. Look for signs posted in the area warning of high or toxic bacteria counts.
This can also happen if you overly expose yourself to air pollution.

, This is because the actions used on them create a negative pressure situation in which bacteria that live in the mouth, such as strep, get drawn into the Eustachian tubes due to this high pressure suction.


Contaminated pacifiers can also lead to ear infections., For infants who are still bottle fed, make sure that formula or juice does not leak out the top of the nipple and dribble into her ears. That can create a moist environment similar to a swimmer’s ear.


Also avoid letting toddlers fall asleep with the bottle because the liquid can move into their ears this way as well.Breastfeeding for at least three months has shown to decrease the risk of ear infections within the first year."

Have diarrhea or vomiting;
, These devices, such as EarCheck, use sound waves to detect whether there is fluid buildup in the middle ear. The device reads the sound waves that are reflected back and determines whether there is fluid in the middle ear. If your child has fluid buildup, you should bring the child to the doctor.However, fluid buildup does not necessarily mean that there is an ear infection.


You can purchase an electronic ear monitor online or at your local pharmacy for approximately $50.
Make sure you follow the directions carefully, and use caution when using these on young children.
Even if your child’s reading comes back as not reporting fluid buildup, you may still want to bring her to the doctor if she is having concerning symptoms to make sure there are no other problems causing her symptoms.

, Your doctor will likely want you to bring the child in so his ears can be checked. Your doctor is particularly likely to recommend this if:Your child's pain is very bad
Your child's pain has continued for more than 24 hours
Your child has recently had a cold, flu, or other infection
There is fluid coming out of the child's ear

, The doctor will use an otoscope, and sometimes a pneumatic otoscope to look into your child’s ear. The device allows the doctor to see the eardrum, and also can be used to blow a small amount of air against the eardrum. The doctor when watches to see if the eardrum moves. This will not hurt.If the ear doesn’t move as much as usual, or doesn’t move at all, it means that fluid has built up behind the eardrum.
However, the most important part of the exam is your doctor seeing what the ear drum looks like through the otoscope. Signs of infection are if the ear drum is red, swollen, or has yellow fluid behind it.

, If your doctor is unable to determine whether your child has an ear infection or is having problems along with one, she may suggest additional tests to help with the diagnosis. Possibilities include:Tympanometry. This device changes the air pressure in the ear and records how much the eardrum moves. If it doesn’t move enough or at all, this indicates that there is fluid behind the eardrum.
Audiometry. This machine will check your child’s hearing. Your child will wear headphones and listen to tones of different pitches and volumes. Your child will be asked to say when she hears something.
A CT scan or MRI scan. The doctor may recommend these imaging tests if there is concern that the infection spread beyond the middle ear. The CT scan uses X-rays and the MRI uses magnets and radio waves to produce images. These tests will not hurt but may involve lying on a table inside a large machine.

, Many ear infections will go away without antibiotics within about two days. Using this approach reduces the likelihood of developing strains that are resistant to antibiotics. But it is best to take your child to the doctor when you first suspect an ear infection, to be sure that it is an ear infection. Your doctor may recommend waiting if:Your child is older than six months and under two years old, has mild discomfort in one ear for less than two days, and a temperature below 102 °F (38.9 °C).
Your child is two years old or older, has mild discomfort in one or both ears for less than two days, and a temperature below 102 °F (38.9 °C).

, Ear aches can cause significant discomfort and some of these techniques may lessen your child’s pain and help him sleep at night. You can try:Warmth. Put a warm, damp washcloth over the infected ear. This may reduce your child’s discomfort.
Pain medication, if your doctor approves it. Ask your doctor whether you should give your child over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol and others) or Ibuprofen (Motrin IB, Advil, and others). Do not give aspirin to children or teenagers because it may be associated with Reye’s syndrome.

, Antibiotics, such as amoxicillin, cefdinir, or augmentin may help clear up a severe bacterial ear infection. They will not be effective against a viral ear infection. If your child does receive antibiotics, be sure to give her the entire course as prescribed, even if your child feels better right away. This will help prevent resistant strains from evolving. Your doctor is particularly likely to recommend antibiotics in the following circumstances:A temperature greater than 102 °F (38.9 °C)
Moderate or severe pain in one or both ears
An infection that has lasted two days or more

, Fluid buildup and ear infections can cause long-term damage and hearing loss if not alleviated. If your child has had more than three ear infections in six months, four infections in a year, or fluid that does not go away after infection is gone, your doctor may suggest ear tubes.The doctor makes a small hole in the eardrum and sucks the fluid out of the ear. A small tube is put in the hole to enable air to flow to the middle ear and future fluid buildup to drain.
Depending upon the type of tube used, they will either come out on their own after six to 12 months or they will be surgically removed when the doctor feels they are no longer needed. The eardrum will heal after the tubes are removed.
The procedure is be done under general anesthesia. It takes about 15 minutes and is an outpatient procedure.

, It can be very difficult for parents to wait to see if the infection will go away when their child is in pain and crying. But avoid the temptation of trying home remedies that are unlikely to help. If you do decide to try an alternative treatment, always talk to your doctor before you do. Some may have side effects or interfere with other medications. Do not attempt alternative remedies without first consulting your doctor. Some common ones include:Homeopathic remedies of herbs or minerals. These supplements are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration the way other foods and medical products are. This means that the dosage and ingredient mixtures are often unreliable. It is better not to use these products on a sick child.
Chiropractic treatments. Scientific studies have not found this to be effective. Chiropraxis can also be dangerous if your child’s skeleton is manipulated in a way that causes injury.
Xylitol. This may prevent, but not treat ear infections. However, the dosages that are required often cause abdominal pain and diarrhea. The Mayo Clinic advises against this option.
Probiotics. These are available as oral medications and sprays, however scientific studies have produced mixed results.

, This will help her avoid colds and the flu, both of which can lead to stuffiness and fluid build-up in the passages of your child’s head. Teach your child to:Wash her hands before eating
Sneeze into the crook of her arm instead of on others or on her hands
Not share cups and eating utensils with others

, Secondhand smoke lowers your child’s immune system and makes him more vulnerable to infections.If someone in your family smokes and cannot quit, ask that person to smoke outside instead of in the house where your child will inhale the smoke. Make sure he change his clothing before coming near the child.

, Breast milk has antibodies and other immune cells that will help your baby fight off ear infections. If you bottle feed, do so with breast milk rather than formula.When feeding, hold your baby so that the head is above the stomach. If possible, hold your baby so that she is supported, but sitting upright. Don't let your baby have a bottle in bed.

, Vaccines will help your child fight off infections from bacteria and viruses that frequently cause respiratory and ear infections. Ask your doctor about the:Haemophilus influenza vaccine (Hib vaccine)
Seasonal flu shot
Pneumococcal vaccine

, Swimmer's ear is an ear infection that occurs when water gets in someone's ear and then gets infected when bacteria grow. The infection in swimmer's ear is in the ear canal, not behind the eardrum. Your child can reduce the chances of getting swimmer's ear by:Not swimming in lakes and streams when the bacteria count is high. Contact your local town officials to ask if there have been recent algae blooms.
Not putting objects in his ears. Do not try to scrape ear wax out with something hard. This can tear the delicate skin on the inside of the ears and increase the likelihood of an infection when swimming.
Drying his ears after swimming and bathing. If your child can't get the water out of his ears, you can try using a hair drier. Use the gentlest setting and keep the hair drier at least 12 inches (30.5 cm) away from your child's head so that it isn't too hot. Then use the hair drier to blow warm, dry air into the ear.

Get a small leftover container from the grocery store (or your own supply).,
Collect all the silica gel capsules that are lying around in your medicine bottles, dog food (yes, some dry dog food comes with them), or other items that need to stay dry.,
Put silica gel capsules into the leftover container.,
The silica gel will need to be refreshed periodically (maybe once a month).",How to Make a Hearing Aid Dryer," The container shown is a Glad 1/2C leftover cup.;
, These are usually small (1/2"" cylinders) or packets that look like large sugar packets (sugar does not work, neither will salt or pepper). The number required is hard to state -- more is better but leave room for the hearing aids.

, Add hearing aids (you can add a layer of paper towel or something over the silica gel to keep the aids from mixing with the silica gel). Cover the container. Do this each evening when you remove the aids. Take the (dry) aids out of the container in the morning. Repeat daily.

, The easiest way to refresh is to stick the capsules into a microwave and ""nuke"" for a minute or so. Just the capsules; no hearing aids in the microwave, please! The water in the silica gel will be driven out of the silica gel by the heat. (You can put the silica gel packets into an oven on its lowest setting for an hour or so, too.)

Check for a fever.",How to Identify Swimmer's Ear," Itching in the outer ear and ear canal is the first sign of swimmer’s ear.Because one of the main causes of an ear infection is through your ear being exposed to water, pay particular attention to itching that arises in the days soon after you have gone swimming.
Infections due to fungi cause greater itchiness than those due to bacteria.;
, If you can see slight redness beginning just inside your ear, you may be developing an ear infection.In most cases, the infection will only take place in one ear.

, You might not be in any real pain yet but have some slight discomfort, indicating an ear infection.This discomfort even more clearly indicates an ear infection if you can make it worse by pulling on your outer ear (called the pinna) or by pushing on the little bump on the front of your ear (called the tragus). Pinna and tragus-induced irritations are considered classic findings in swimmer’s ear.

, At this stage of the infection, any drainage would be clear and odourless fluid.Drainage quickly becomes yellow coloured and foul smelling as the infection progresses.

, At the first signs of an ear infection, go see your doctor. Although this is not an urgent medical issue, the infection can progress to the point of significant pain, chronic ear infection damage, and widespread infection.There is a difference between swimmers ear, an infection in the ear canal usually due to water exposure, and a middle ear infection (otitis media). Otitis media usually occurs during or after an upper respiratory infection or with allergies. Your doctor can help determine which type of infection you may have and the proper treatment.
Do not rely on over-the-counter ear drops. These drops usually do not have effective medication in them to clear the infection and you will need a prescription from your doctor for antibiotic or antifungal ear drops.
Your doctor will examine your ear using an otoscope, which she gently inserts into the beginning of your ear canal. The otoscope helps her see the condition of the ear canal as well as the ear drum (tympanic membrane), which are not visible to you.
Your doctor may also take a swab of your ear to determine the nature of the discharge. This is how the doctor will be able to confirm whether you need antibiotic or antifungal medication. The swab will need to be sent to a lab, but your doctor will start you on drops in the meantime.
Your doctor will usually prescribe antibiotic ear drops to treat swimmers ear. The drops may also contain a steroid medicine to reduce inflammation and pain. She will also give you recommendations to help treat the pain until the infection has cleared.

, You may now be experiencing more intense itching and also increased discomfort turning to pain. The increased pain is due to the development of fluid and inflammation in your ear from this moderate infection.You will have a feeling of fullness inside the affected ear and partial blockage due to the build up.
The pain and feeling of fullness may take a few days to arise and may be worse on yawning and swallowing.

, As the infection progresses, the redness in your ear will become more extensive., The drainage coming from your ear may increase in volume and also might now be turning to pus.Pus is a yellowy-thick fluid that exudes from infections and usually smells bad. Use a clean tissue to dry wipe the pus from your outer ear.

, You may be sensing that your hearing is becoming slightly decreased or muffled.The change in hearing is related to the blockage in your ear canal.
Cover your unaffected ear and see how well you hear out of the affected ear.

, You may now have severe pain spreading to your face, neck, jaw, or the side of your head that is affected by the advanced ear infection.You should see your doctor right away or go to the emergency room if you have severe symptoms.

, You will likely now have complete blockage of your ear canal, reducing your ability to hear out of the infected ear., The redness of your ear will increase and your outer ear may now be swollen and red., As the infection increases, the lymphatic system in your body will be activated to fight. Swelling in the lymph nodes in your neck therefore indicate an increased progression of infection.Use the middle 3 fingers of your hand to check your lymph nodes. Press gently down the sides of your neck and under your jaw line for swelling.

, As the infection begins to affect your body to a greater extent, your body will be working harder to fight off the infection. One way your body does this is by raising your temperature to make the environment inhospitable to infections.A fever will generally be anything over 37.3C or 99F.
There are different ways to monitor a fever, including using tympanic, or ear, thermometers. If you have an ear infection, be sure to take your temperature in the opposite ear. The infection will naturally increase the temperature in the affected ear so you want to be sure you get a true reading of your body temperature.

Look for firm, circular lumps under the skin.,
Examine your skin for rheumatoid vasculitis.,
Look for symptoms of neutrophilic dermatosis.,
Make an appointment with your doctor.,
Diagnose and treat RA to improve other skin disorders.",How to Handle a Rheumatoid Arthritis Skin Problem1," These lumps are rheumatoid nodules, also known as subcutaneous (or under the skin) nodules. Seen in approximately 30% of cases, these lumps typically have diameters of less than 5 millimeters, ranging in size from small pea size to lemon sized lumps. They are usually found on the forearms, elbows, fingers joints, knees, bottom of feet/heel, the back of the hands, back of the head, the ear regions and inside the nose.,,These lumps are usually not painful, but they can be painful if the overlying skin becomes infected or ulcerated.The lumps will be the color of your skin. They are usually movable when applying pressure to them and feel doughy or firm.;
, This is inflammation of the small and medium sized blood vessels of the skin cause by our body’s immune system. Up to 5.4% of people with longstanding/severe RA will experience rheumatoid vasculitis. It can affect many body parts and organs, but the skin is by far the most common site.The following are signs of rheumatoid vasculitis:


Purpura: Look for bruising of the skin known as purpura. Since the blood vessels are damaged, blood can leak out causing bluish or dark discoloration that resembles bruises.Digital ischemia: The inflammation can lead to obstruction of blood vessels, which can be seen on the fingers as digital ischemia. When this happens, the fingers affected will turn dark and may become necrotic or gangrenous.
Ulcers: This is a superficial hole on the skin. Look for open sores or ulcers on the skin due to inflammatory obstruction of blood vessels.Gangrene: Severely obstructed blood vessels can cause the affected areas skin to die and turn black or necrotic. When this happens, you may feel that the skin sounds crumply when applying pressure. You may also see pus oozing from the area, which is caused by bacteria growth from dead tissue. There may also be a foul smell and possibly pain at the site., Nail fold infarcts: These are small vessels obstructed around the area of the nail or fingertips. Since these vessels are really small, you may see small red or dark dots on the finger pads around the nail., The activation of our immune system’s white blood cells (neutrophils) infiltrates all layers of our skin, including the epidermis (outer layer) and dermis (inner layer). There are many diseases associated with this process that falls under neutrophilic dermatosis, some more common than others. Two conditions with this underlying disease process are known as pyoderma gangrenosum and sweet's syndrome.


Pyoderma gangrenosum is characterized by painful, enlarging necrotic ulcers (open sores) with bluish undermined borders surrounded by a diffuse red rash.Sweet’s syndrome is also known as “acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis.” The symptoms include fever, neutrophil inflammation, and painful plaques on the skin. There is also a diffuse underlying red rash that can appear on the arms, back, face and neck.
The skin in this condition may peel or slough off. It is rarely seen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.,, If you suspect rheumatoid arthritis, visit your doctor to get a diagnosis and discuss diagnostic tests and severity of your rheumatoid arthritis. This will help you get the appropriate treatment for your condition.

, RA is a systemic disease which includes the skin. Treating the RA can drastically improve skin systems. Many of these treatments are used for RA and the skin disorders. Therefore, you should expect an overlap of treatment medications.


The most important step is to seek expert advice with regards to diagnosing and testing for RA. Once diagnosis is confirmed, management of RA can help prevent these skin diseases.

Pay attention to pain that develops in your ear.,
Monitor any mild hearing loss that occurs.,
Watch for fluid drainage.,
Note complementary symptoms.",How to Know if You Have Otitis Media1," If you've developed an earache, that can be a sign that you have otitis media. The pain can be a constant, dull ache, accompanied by throbbing, or it can be sharp, stabbing pains that come and go, either alone or in combination with a duller ache.The pain results from the fact that you have infected fluid in your middle ear, which presses on the eardrum.This pain may also spread. You may experience a headache or neck pain, for instance.;
, You may also begin to temporarily lose some of your hearing. When fluid builds up behind the eardrums, it can slow down the signals that go to your brain as they pass through the tiny bones of the inner ear; therefore, you may experience some hearing loss.Some people also hear a ringing or buzzing in their ears that comes and goes., When your ear is infected, you may also have fluid drainage. Pay attention if pus or other fluids drain from your hurting ear. The fluid may be brown, yellow, or white. This fluid means your eardrum has ruptured, and you need to see a doctor., Sometimes, ear infections develop alongside other symptoms, such as a runny nose or sore throat. If you have these symptoms in conjunction with an earache, talk to your doctor about the possibility of having an ear infection."

Talk to your doctor about healing.",How to Get Something out of Your Ear," We cannot always know how or why something ended up stuck in our ear, but treatment varies depending on what the foreign object is. If possible, identify the object before making any decisions regarding care.


The majority of foreign objects lodged in ears are placed there intentionally, usually by young children and toddlers. These include food material, hair clips, beads, small toys, pencils, and q-tips. If you know what your child was doing before symptoms appeared, you may be able to determine what's stuck in his ear.Earwax can accumulate in the ear canal and harden. The buildup of earwax can also develop due to overuse or misuse of q-tips.Symptoms of an earwax buildup include a sense of fullness or pressure in one ear. Sometimes, this the buildup of earwax can cause dizziness and decreased hearing.An insect can be a particularly alarming and annoying foreign object to have in the ear, but also the easiest to detect. The insect's buzzing and movement can be heard and felt in the ear.;
, While annoying, the majority of the time a foreign object in the ear is not a medical emergency. If you cannot remove it yourself, it is typically all right to visit the doctor on the following day. However, in some cases you will need to visit the ER immediately to prevent greater physical harm.


If the object in the ear is something sharp, seek medical care immediately as complications can arise quickly.Young children often place button-type batteries in the ear. These are the kind of small, circular batteries that often go in watches or small household gadgets. If a button battery is in the ear, seek immediate medical attention. The chemicals inside can leak and can cause severe damage to the ear canal.Seek urgent medical assistance if food or plant material is lodged in the ear. These swell when exposed to moisture, creating the possibility of damage to the ear.
If you experience symptoms like swelling, fever, discharge, bleeding, hearing loss, dizziness, or rapidly increasing pain see a doctor right away., Oftentimes, the irritation of a foreign body in the ear is so great we leap into action without considering the consequences. Many do-it-yourself treatment options available at pharmacies do more harm than good when a foreign object is lodged in your ear.


Do not use Q-tips to remove a foreign object from the ear. Q-tips are often our go-to when coping with ear problems, but they do not work when attempting to remove a foreign object. In fact, they may actually push an object deeper into the ear canal.Do not attempt to irrigate the ear yourself. Many drug stores and pharmacies sell ear irrigation kits in the form of suction cups or syringes. While these DIY kits are helpful for day-to-day ear care, you should not attempt ear irrigation without a doctor's assistance if something is stuck in your ear.
Do not use ear drops until you know what is causing your ear discomfort. Foreign objects in the ear can mimic symptoms of other ear conditions. Ear drops can make the problem worse, especially if the foreign object has caused a perforated eardrum.

, Your first recourse should be to tilt your head downward and use gravity to help get the object out. Tilt your head to the side so that the ear with the blockage is facing the ground. Sometimes, this will be enough to let the object drop out.


To alter the shape of the ear canal, pull on the pinna, the outermost part of the ear (not the lobe, but the circle that begins at the top of the ear and stretches down to the lobe). Wiggling this can dislodge the object, after which, gravity will do the rest.Do not strike or hit the side of the head. You can gently shake it, but striking the head could cause further damage., You should only use this method if part of the object is sticking out and you can easily remove it with a pair of tweezers. Do not reach into the ear canal with tweezers.It is not a good idea to try this with anything stuck in a child's ears. See your pediatrician or doctor instead.Clean the tweezers before hand with warm water and antibacterial soap. Foreign objects can sometimes cause perforated eardrums or bleeding and tearing inside the ear canal. This makes your ear extra susceptible to infection.
Grasp the object with the tweezers and pull. Be gentle and go slowly in order to prevent the object from breaking before removal.Do not use this method to remove the object if it is so deep that you cannot see the tip of the tweezers while trying to remove it. Also, do not try this if the person in question will not be still. In such instances, it is preferable that you go to the doctor., If there is an insect in your ear, it can cause a great deal of discomfort by flying around and buzzing. There's also a risk of getting stung. Killing the insect can make removal easier.


Never try to remove an insect with your fingers as it may sting.
Tilt your head to the side so the affected ear is pointing upwards towards the ceiling or sky. For an adult, pull the earlobe backward and upward. For a child, pull it backward and downward.Mineral oil, olive oil, or baby oil works best. Mineral oil is preferable if you have it.Make sure the oil is warm, but do not boil it or microwave it before hand as you don't want to burn your ear. Only a small drop is needed, about as much as you would use when applying ear drops.Ideally, the insect will drown or suffocate in the oil and float to the surface of the ear.You should only use oil if you are attempting to remove an insect. If there has been pain, bleeding, or any discharges from the ear, it is possible that you have a perforated eardrum. It is dangerous to use oil in such instances; do not use oil if you have any of these symptoms. See a doctor after using this method to make sure that all insect parts have been removed from the ear., Inform children to keep small objects away from ears, mouth, and other orifices. Supervise closely children under the age of five when they are around small objects. Be particularly careful with disc and button batteries; keep them in a safe place, out of the reach of small children., If none of the home remedies suggested are viable, it is important to visit a doctor and seek professional assistance. Before doing so, you will want to collect necessary information. If the subject is a child, be sure to ask about all the details of the condition ahead of visiting the doctor. He might be more willing to share details with you than with a doctor.


Most importantly, you should inform the doctor of what is in the ear and how long it has been in there. This will give the doctor some sense for how much of a threat the condition is.
You will also want to tell the doctor about what has happened subsequent to the initial incident. Have there been any side effects? Did you try to remove the object? If so, how did you do so and what was the outcome?

, A doctor may suggest irrigating the ear canal with water or a saline solution to remove a foreign object. This is a relatively quick and simple procedure.


Usually, a syringe filled with clean, warm water is squirted into the ear canal.If successful, any foreign materials will be flushed out during the irrigation process.You should never try to irrigate the ear canal at home. Leave this to medical professionals., Though tweezers might not have worked at home, your doctor should have special medical instruments more adept at removing foreign objects from your ear.


An otoscope, a medical instrument used to illuminate and explore the ear canal, will be used in conjunction with medical tweezers. Your doctor can more easily monitor the tweezers inside the ear and avoid injuring any important or sensitive structures.Specialized tweezers, designed specifically for use on ears, or forceps will be used to gently remove the object from your ear.If the object is metal, your doctor can also use a long instrument that has been magnetized. This will make extraction much easier., Your doctor will hold a small catheter near the foreign object. Suction will then be applied to gently ease the object out of your ear.This is generally used to remove solid objects like buttons and beads rather than organic material like food or live objects like bugs.

, This is particularly common in cases involving young children and toddlers. Kids often struggle to stay calm and still during the above techniques. Doctors oftentimes recommend sedation to prevent movement that could result in an accident and injury to inner ear structures.


Avoid eating or drinking 8 hours before going to the doctor's office if your doctor mentions sedation as a possibility.Follow through with any instructions the doctor gives you before you leave his office. The doctor might want you to monitor the child's behavior in the event of complications. Listen carefully and ask any questions you might have., Occasionally, the eardrum might be punctured by a foreign object. If you have a perforated eardrum, the doctor will likely recommend treatment.


Symptoms of a perforated eardrum include pain, discomfort, a feeling of fullness in the ear, dizziness, and fluid or blood draining from the ear.In general, perforated eardrums heal on their own within two months. But your doctor might recommend a round of antibiotics to prevent infection. She will also advise you to keep the ear clean and dry while healing., After you have seen the doctor, she will likely recommend that you avoid swimming or immersing your ear in water for 7-10 days. This will help reduce your chances of developing an infection. Cover your affected ear with petroleum jelly and cotton ball when you shower or bathe.


Usually, doctors recommend a follow-up appointment within a week to make sure the ear is healing properly and there is no drainage, bleeding, or pain."

Treat the nodules with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.,
Try biologic drugs if your RA doesn’t respond to DMARDs.,
Ask your doctor about steroid injections.,
Consider surgery for rheumatoid nodules.",How to Handle a Rheumatoid Arthritis Skin Problem2," The drugs used to treat rheumatoid nodules are known as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) and work at the molecular level of the disease and drugs known as biologics which work by inhibiting specific immune system proteins.


DMARD drugs options include methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide, azathioprine, and cyclosporine.
Note that treatment of rheumatoid nodules is not required, but there is usually a spontaneous regression or reduction when a specific RA treatment is administered.Use caution with some DMARDs. Some medications may actually cause or worsen the nodules. These include methotrexate and leflunomide for unknown reasons., ,, Tell your doctor if new nodules appear or the previous nodules are getting bigger or painful. You may need a new drug therapy to avoid the appearance of the nodules while treating the rheumatoid arthritis.

, Your doctor might also recommend a biologic response modifier drug. These include etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab, certolizumab pegol, golimumab, anakinra, abatacept, rituximab, tocilizumab, or tofacitinib.Many studies have been completed that saw reduction in these nodules when treating RA with these medications., , , Arrange an appointment with your doctor to discuss your treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. Your doctor will give you a prescription for the medications you may need, and take these medications as directed.

, Injecting steroids within the nodules have been proven to reduce size of the nodules. Therapy though may require weeks of injections by your healthcare provider.,Steroids help reduce the inflammation process occurring at the nodules.


Your doctor will clean the area of the nodules with rubbing alcohol or alcohol pads. A numbing agent/spray or anesthetic may be applied to reduce pain. A needle with steroids will be injected at the site of the nodules.
After receiving the shot, you may feel discomfort at the location, and flushing of the face or chest can occur. Do not excessively move the area, and apply ice to the site if pain occurs.
Note if you are diabetic, steroids can increase your blood sugar., Excision of the nodules may be warranted if nodules remain, worsen, become infected or ulcerated, meaning that the skin is damaged and blood is exposed. The nodules may also be impinging on nearby nerves and producing sharp diffuse pain, and/or obstructing your everyday functioning, as would be the case with nodules on the foot.Your surgeon will assess what kind of anesthesia to provide, either through injection at or around the site or through IV sedation. Your surgeon may ask you not to eat or drink anything after midnight the night before surgery.
The area will be properly cleaned and the surgeon will use a scalpel or other cutting tool to cut the nodule. The surgeon may use a wide margin technique where an oval-shaped excision will be made around the nodule, removing the nodule and small amount of surrounding normal tissue to assure full removal."
"
Combine steroids with DMARDs for mild cases.,
Take IV steroids at your doctor’s recommendation.,
Avoid smoking.",How to Handle a Rheumatoid Arthritis Skin Problem3," With cases of rheumatoid vasculitis that affects the skin and/or nerves, make an appointment with your healthcare provider to discuss prescription medication regimens. Because this is an inflammatory process, taking steroids coupled with a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) such as methotrexate is considered first line therapy.


Steroid doses range from 30 to 100 mg twice daily at onset for two to four weeks.
Methotrexate starts with a dose of 10 mg/week increasing to a dose of 20 to 25 mg/week, based on the effectiveness and side effects. Exacerbation of vasculitis or occurrence of nodules may manifest but it is considered rare. Azathioprine can be substituted for methotrexate in doses of 50mg/day to 150 mg divided daily., Moderate or severe diseases is characterized by organ involvement such as the heart, nervous system or kidneys. Steroids administered by IV will act faster.


The doctor will administer a maximum dose of 250 mg intravenously twice daily.
IV steroids may be used in conjunction with the addition of a biologic drug and/or methotrexate. Several small case studies have been reported with successful usage of biologic.,,, , , , Literature review studies have reported that smoking tobacco has a strong causal link with rheumatoid vasculitis. The cessation of tobacco use diminished RA vasculitis and extra-organ diseases, and with improved survival, points to a better outcome for patients.,Reach out to your healthcare provider, support groups, special counselors for tobacco quitting, and individuals who support your decision and want to help. Your doctor may assess your willingness to quit, then provide you with appropriate treatments such as nicotine gum, nicotine patch, counseling services or prescription medications such as Chantix. Counseling and medication together are more effective than either one alone."

Decide if you want to skip treatment.,
Take oral steroids.,
Apply prescription steroid creams.,
Ask your doctor about steroid injections.,
Ask about potassium iodide or colchicine.,
Consider drugs that block your immune system.",How to Handle a Rheumatoid Arthritis Skin Problem5," In most cases, sweet’s syndrome can resolve on its own. But keep in mind that medications can help speed up your recovery.

, If you do decide to start treatment, the treatment of choice for Sweet’s Syndrome is oral steroids to reduce inflammation. The steroid is usually prednisone, administered at 30 to 60 milligrams daily. Symptoms will clear up in a few days after treatment but therapy may last weeks.Steroids are tapered down to lower doses to help prevent relapse and prevent the body from going through steroid withdrawal. Since prednisone is similar to our body’s hormone cortisol, high dose steroid use can abruptly decrease the production of cortisol. When steroids are stopped suddenly, the body’s levels of cortisol are too low to compensate. Therefore, it’s necessary to taper down to lower doses to help our body start producing cortisol again.
Symptoms of steroid withdrawal include severe fatigue, body aches, weakness and joint pain., Prescription steroid creams may also be used to reduce inflammation. But these will only affect the area they are applied to. Use a prescription steroid cream when lesions appear in one or few places only.

, Steroids will help reduce inflammation at the RA site. Steroid injections provided by your healthcare provider may also be performed, but each area will need an injection of steroids. Typically used if located in one area only.This will provide rapid relief but repeat injections may be needed by your healthcare provider. You will need to discuss with your doctor to establish proper dosing, regimen and timeline.

, Your doctor may also provide you with a prescription for potassium iodide or colchicine. These drugs typically result in rapid resolution of Sweet's syndrome symptoms and lesions. Along with steroids, they are also considered first line treatment.


These drugs may be administered to you by themselves if you cannot take steroids due to side effects or conditions such as severe diabetes.

, Second line treatments include immune system blocking drugs such as Indomethacin and cyclosporin along with antibacterial drugs dapsone and clofazimine. However, indomethacin and clofazimine appear less effective than corticosteroids, potassium iodide, and colchicine.Take as directed by your healthcare professional.

Check for signs of ear pain.,
Watch for decreased interest in eating.,
Look for difficulty hearing.,
Check for a fever.,
Notice problems with your child's balance.,
Look for nausea and vomiting.,
Realize symptoms may not be dramatic.,
Pay attention to drainage.",How to Know if You Have Otitis Media2," Children tend to have acute pain with ear infections. In younger kids, they may not be able to express that pain; however, you can watch for excessive crying, particularly when the child lays down, as well as pulling or tugging on their ears.They may also be more irritable or have difficulty sleeping.

, This symptom is most prevalent in babies that are breast or bottle feeding. As they swallow, it causes more pain in the ear, due to a change in pressure; therefore, the child doesn't want to eat as much because of the pain., Just like in adults, otitis media can cause temporary hearing loss in children. Pay attention to see if your kid doesn't seem to be hearing as well as normal, such as not being able to answer questions well or repeatedly asking ""What?"" when you are talking.In babies, watch to see if they respond to soft sounds as well as they normally do.

, Often, children with this condition will run a fever. Check your child's temperature if you suspect they have an ear infection.A child with an ear infection can run a relatively high fever, from 100.4 to 104°F (38 to 40°C)., Another symptom of a middle ear infection is the child having problems with balance. Because the ear regulates balance, an infection can cause a child's balance to be off. Pay attention if your child suddenly has more trouble walking or staying upright.Balance problems are more likely to be a symptom for kids than adults, but you should take note if you are having balance problems along with other symptoms.

, This condition can also cause your child to be nauseated, due to the vertigo (lack of balance) caused by the ear infection. It can also lead to vomiting. Look for these symptoms along with other signs, such as pain or mild hearing loss., Sometimes, this condition doesn't exhibit many symptoms. In fact, the main symptom may be mild hearing loss, which your child or you may not even notice. It may exhibit as the child not paying as much attention in school, for instance, because they can't hear as well.Other kids may notice their ear feeling ""full,"" or the ear may pop more often.

, Once again, drainage is usually a sign that the eardrum has ruptured. Do not be fooled by the pain relief that often results from an eardrum rupturing.The pressure on the eardrum has been released, but the infection has made a serious progression. You definitely need to go to the doctor as soon as possible if you see yellow, brown, or white fluid draining from the ear."
"
Call a doctor depending on how long symptoms last.,
Go to the doctor if your temperature climbs.,
Talk to your doctor if ear pain is severe.,
Go if you notice drainage.,
Expect your doctor to perform certain tests.,
Understand your doctor may not do anything.,
Visit the hospital if you or your child experience facial paralysis.,
Go to the hospital if you or your child develop pain behind the ear.,
Go to the emergency room if you or child develops signs of meningitis.,
Consider ear tube surgery.",How to Know if You Have Otitis Media3," Pay attention to how long the symptoms are present. You should particularly pay attention if the symptoms appear after you or your child has had another infection, such as a cold, since that makes you more susceptible to ear infections, particularly in children.For babies under half a year old, see a doctor when symptoms appear.
For children and adults who've had symptoms last more than 24 hours, call your doctor for advice.

, If you or your child have been running a fever, it's time to talk to the doctor. A fever is a sign of infection, and you or your child may need a round of antibiotics to help fight the infection.If your child's temperature goes over 100.4°F (38°C), it's time to go to the doctor.

, Severe ear pain indicates it's time to get advice from your doctor. It could be an indication the infection is worsening or spreading. Call your doctor if you or your child's pain is particularly severe.With your child, pay attention to see if they are in more pain than seems normal for an ear infection. For instance, if your child won't stop crying, that may be a reason to talk to the child's doctor.

, Drainage in both adults and children is a sign that you need to go to the doctor. Drainage is a symptom of a ruptured eardrum, and your doctor will need to check out your ear to see if you need treatment, such as antibiotics.If you are having drainage, you should avoid swimming until the infection is cleared up.

, Your doctor will likely start by examining you or your child's eardrum with an otoscope, which just means the doctor will visually inspect the eardrum using an instrument. While doing so, the doctor may also blow a puff of air on the eardrum, to see if it moves like it should.Your doctor might also use tympanometry. This test checks to see if there's fluid in the eardrum with pressure and air.
With persistent ear infections, you or your child might have a hearing test to see if there's hearing loss.

, That is, many ear infections go away on their own, and many doctors are trying to prescribe fewer antibiotics due to bacteria's adaptive nature. In addition, some ear infections are caused by viruses. Either way, antibiotics are not always needed, as ear infections generally clear up in a few days.In addition, ear infections are not contagious, though viruses that can accompany ear infections sometimes are.
Even after ear infections clear up, fluid can stay in the middle ear. It can remain there for a couple of months.
However, you can help with the pain by using ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Be sure to use children's versions of these drugs for your child.

, One rare complication of ear infections is a facial paralysis, when the swelling from the condition presses on the facial nerve. While this condition usually resolves when the ear infection clears up, it's still imperative to get any facial paralysis checked out by a doctor., One complication that can arise from an ear infection is the spreading of the infection to other parts of the body. When you or your child develops pain behind the ear, that could be an indication that the infection has spread to the bone under the ear, the mastoids, an infection called mastoiditis. You may also notice hearing loss, pain, and discharge.This condition is generally treated in the hospital.

, Rarely, an ear infection can develop into meningitis. You may notice you have a high fever, trouble breathing, and a bad headache. You may also have a stiff neck or feel nauseated. You may develop sensitivity to light, as well as a red, splotchy rash. If you notice these symptoms in you or your child, go to the emergency room or dial emergency services., If your child has persistent ear infections, your doctor may consider ear tube surgery. Usually, this procedure is performed if your child has hearing loss or speech delays due to hearing loss. Basically, a tube is inserted in the ear so that fluid can drain more readily.The presence of the tiny hole in the eardrum will not affect hearing. Tubes will remain in place six to 18 months, depending on the type used."
"
Understand age is a risk factor.,
Know that colds can lead to ear infections.,
Understand the season can play a role.,
Look for snoring or mouth-breathing.",How to Know if You Have Otitis Media4," Because children are not fully grown, their ear tubes are smaller and have a more horizontal angle than adults’ ears. This shape and structure makes it more likely that their ears will develop an obstruction of some kind and get infected. Children ages 6 months to two years of age are most prone to ear infections., The virus causing your cold can travel through the Eustachian tube that connects your ear to the back of your nose. If this happens to you or your child, you or your child can develop an ear infection while also having a cold.Group daycares are a hot spot for ear infections. When your kids run around with other kids, some of whom may have colds, they are more likely to a catch a cold themselves.
Be sure to get the recommended vaccinations, such as the flu vaccine once year, as that can protect against infections that could lead to ear infections.

, Generally, children catch ear infections more often in the fall and winter. This phenomenon is due to the fact that cold and flu infections are more prevalent this time of year, which, as noted, can lead to ear infections.Similarly, if you or your child is prone to allergies, you are more likely to develop an ear infection when allergy counts are higher.

, These symptoms can indicate that your child (or you) has large adenoids. Having this condition can put you or your child at risk for more ear infections. Talk to your doctor if you notice this symptom, as you or your child may need surgery to fix it."

Take over-the-counter pain medication.,
Apply a topical steroid cream to your skin.,
Eat foods that help with anti-inflammation.,
Avoid processed foods.",How to Handle a Rheumatoid Arthritis Skin Problem6," Since RA is an inflammatory disease, you can help reduce this process by taking over the counter pain meds such as ibuprofen and naproxen. This will help relieve the pain associated with these skin conditions as well as joint pain associated with RA.


Take these medication with water and food. Be sure to take the dosages recommended on the label. If you have underlying stomach or kidney diseases, seek expert advice before taking these drugs. These drugs can worsen your condition if you have an underlying condition.

, You can purchase non-prescription strength steroid cream from many drug stores. This will help reduce the inflammation process when applied to the affected area. Use as directed. For added benefit, apply a bandage, gauze or dressing over the area after applying cream. This will help reduce the risk of infection.


Remember, the cream can help relieve the inflammation but is not considered a cure for the disease.

, Several studies seem to show a connection between certain foods and the inflammation that characterizes this autoimmune condition.Below are a list of foods/supplements thought to help reduce inflammation.


Omega-3 fatty acids (fish oil): This is a type of fat that has been shown to reduce inflammatory proteins (C - Reactive protein and Interleukin 6) in the body. Many foods that contain Omega 3’s are fish (such as salmon, tuna, and cold water fish). Eat at least three to four ounces, twice a week.

In addition there are supplements in the form of capsules that you can take as well from your drug/vitamin store.


Olive oil: This fat contains healthy monounsaturated fat, antioxidants and oleocanthal, a compound that can lower inflammation and pain. Take two to three tablespoons per day for cooking or in salad dressings or other dishes
Fruits and vegetables: They are packed with antioxidants, which support the immune system and may help fight inflammation. Eat at least 1½ to 2 cups of fruit and two to three cups of vegetables per meal.
Eat nuts and seeds (walnuts, pistachios, pine nuts, almonds). These contain inflammation-fighting monounsaturated fats. Eat 1½ ounces of nuts daily (about a handful)
Eat foods with fiber. Fiber lowers C-reactive protein (CRP), a substance in the blood that indicates inflammation. Getting fiber from foods lowers CRP levels more than taking fiber supplements. Foods that have carotenoids, the antioxidants that give carrots, peppers and some fruits their color, are quite good at lowering CRP.

, Cookies, chips and other snacks can be high in unhealthy fats, which are linked with inflammation. Canned goods such as vegetables and soups are often high in sodium, which boosts blood pressure.


Look for low sodium options, or go with fresh or frozen vegetables."

, Eating foods high in salt and sugar can increase inflammation in your body, including your skin. Try to avoid foods that contain lots of salt or processed sugars. Instead, go for foods that are rich in antioxidants, such as berries, beans, Brussels sprouts, and dark leafy greens., Your dark circles may get darker if you expose your skin to direct sunlight, as sun weakens the collagen in your blood vessels. Weakened collagen means your blood vessels are more prone to rupturing. This can then release blood into the tissues and lead to darker circles under your eyes. Prevent this by wearing sunglasses every time you step outside., If you think the dark circles under your eyes are due to allergies, you should go see an allergist and get tested for certain allergies.

Let the doctor cut off your tag's blood supply.,
Recognize the benefits of professional medical care.,
Allow it to go untreated.",How to Get Rid of Skin Tags1," The majority of skin tags are harmless, but it is best to talk with a dermatologist if you notice that the tag is darker than your skin color, large in size, or unusual in shape. If you remove the tag without consulting a professional you could lose valuable time in the event that it is a sign of a larger problem.Skin tags should not drastically change color. If this happens, talk to a dermatologist as well. They will most likely remove the tag and send it for testing if it is suspicious.;
, Your doctor will numb the skin with a cream and use a scalpel to cut the tag away from the base of your skin. They may also snip the tag off using a sharp pair of medical scissors. This procedure, also called excision, is generally a fairly quick and painless procedure., During an office visit your doctor will use a probe to apply a small amount of liquid nitrogen to the site of your skin tag. This method, called cryosurgery, is also used to remove warts. The tag will fall off once it is frozen., With this method, called cauterization, your doctor will use a small probe to apply a heat source directly to the surface of the skin tag. The heat provided by the electrical current will burn off the tag resulting in an easy and quick removal., With this method, called ligation, your doctor will apply a small band to the base of the tag. This will cut off the blood supply to the upper portion of the tag and cause it to die and fall off your skin. The process can take up to a few days and, depending on the size and location of the tag, may be a bit more painful.

, It is very tempting to treat skin tags at home, but your doctor’s care offers some unique benefits. They will use sterile instruments to prevent infection. They will also rub on numbing cream to reduce your pain during and after the procedure. In addition, some of the methods, such as cauterization, are so advanced that they rarely leave a noticeable scar.Since skin tags have a strong and constant blood supply, they are not considered safe to try and remove without medical supervision.
Depending on the location of the tag, it may require the care of a specialist. Tags by the eyes, for example, are often treated by an ophthalmologist (eye doctor)., You can always leave a skin tag alone. If it doesn’t bother you then there is no medical reason why you have to have it removed. It is highly likely that your doctor will recommend no treatment unless you feel strongly the other way.


Insurance companies also often consider skin tag removal procedures to be cosmetic and not necessary. Make sure to check with your insurance to see if any removals will be covered."

Determine the type of mole in order to assess your treatment options.,
Use a mirror to perform a self-check.,
Check for signs of malignancy in the mole's appearance.,
Contact your doctor immediately if you believe you have melanoma.",How to Get Rid of Skin Moles1," While you may use natural methods to remove moles for cosmetic reasons, you will need to see a doctor for cancerous moles. If you have several moles and one looks different from the others, you should get it evaluated by a doctor. If you’re ever in doubt about a mole, always see your doctor.


Common moles -- Non-cancerous moles are typically pink, tan or brown. They are one color. They can be flat or raised, round or oval, and are typically smaller than a pencil eraser.If you have 50 or more common roles, you are at increased risk for skin cancer and should consult your doctor.
Atypical moles (dysplastic) – See your doctor if you have any large, unusually shaped, or mulit-colored moles, as these may be more likely to develop into skin cancer.Congenital moles (birthmarks) – These are moles that you are born with. Very large congenital moles put you at greater risk for melanoma, so you should consult your doctor regularly to check for signs of skin cancer.Spitz nevi – These moles look like melanoma (skin cancer). They are usually pink or multicolored, raised, and domed shaped. They may bleed or ooze. You will need a biopsy to ensure such a mole is not cancerous. Spitz nevi are more common in children and young adults.Melanoma – A melanoma is a cancerous mole. It will need to be removed. See your doctor immediately if you suspect you have a melanoma.;
, You should check your body for moles once a month. Take off your clothes and stand in a room with bright lighting. If possible, have a full-length mirror and a hand mirror available.Remember to examine your scalp and hairline, behind your ears, and under your arms.
Check your legs, feet, genitals, and the back of your neck, buttocks, and upper thighs.

, Look for the signs of malignancy using the mnemonic ABCDE. The more of the following aspects are true for your mole, the more likely melanoma is:Asymmetry. Cancerous moles can be asymmetrical or uneven.

Borders. Cancerous moles can have uneven, ragged borders, rather than smooth ones.

Color. Cancerous moles are often black or red and can have uneven coloration - some parts may be darker than others.

Diameter. Any mole larger than a pencil eraser may be cause for concern.

Evolving. Most importantly, any mole that is changing - either in size, shape, or composition - may be cancerous and should be treated as such until proven otherwise.
Additionally, the most dangerous form of melanoma, nodular melanoma, has its own criteria:


Elevated. Raised moles are especially likely to develop into melanoma.

Firm. Cancerous moles often become firm or hard to the touch.

Growing. Moles that are growing are special causes for concern.



, If you have any reason to believe a mole may be cancerous, make an appointment with your doctor as soon as you can. Beginning treatment as early as possible is important for successfully curing melanoma, and only a qualified medical professional can guide you to the right treatment plan."

Find the offender.,
Wash your face 1-2 times a day.,
Use moisturizer.,
Consider over-the-counter special creams.,
Consider using aloe vera gel.,
Consider dabbing on coconut oil.,
Consider oatmeal masks.",How to Get Rid of Redness on the Face1," A product in your skincare routine may cause an allergic reaction, pimples, or other irritation. Think about the cosmetics, skin care products, and hair products you use. Cut back on all of them and slowly reintroduce them back into your routine one by one. This way, you can determine which might be causing your skin to break out.


If redness is associated with swelling of the face, especially lips or tongue, or trouble breathing, seek immediate medical attention. In the United States, call 911.
Start with the products you have added most recently, since these are the most likely to have triggered a reaction.
You can schedule an appointment with an allergist or dermatologist. Either can do a patch test, during which small amounts of chemicals will be applied to the skin and the treated skin will be monitored for a reaction.
You may just have sensitive skin. If so, some brands have sensitive-skin product lines; classic examples include the Aveeno Ultra-Calming and Eucerin Redness Relief lines.
After you figure out which chemical is at the root of your redness, cut out any product from your routine that contains that chemical as an active or inactive ingredient.;
, Use warm water: both hot and cold water can cause your skin to dry out. If you wash it the wrong way, you can make your skin more irritated and redder. You should wash with a sensitive cleanser, one without fragrance, and avoid any that contain alcohol or other drying agents. Try products such as Cetaphil or Purpose.


Pat dry with a soft towel when done. Do not scrub your face, which can cause your skin to become more irritated.Try cleansers with sulfates such as Rosanil. These ingredients will help with inflammation.If your redness involves pimples and you do not have sensitive skin, try products that have benzoyl peroxide such as Clearasil.

, After washing your face, immediately apply a moisturizing facial cream (or lotion) over the skin to lock in moisture.


You can also store your lotion in the refrigerator and apply it to your face when cold. Cold products cause the blood vessels in your face to constrict and redness to fade.
Avoid buying products with alcohol, witch hazel, peppermint, fragrance, eucalyptus, or clove oil. These are considered skin irritants and will only make your skin more irritated., The most popular is topical cortisone, which has a steroid in the cream to help alleviate redness, soothe skin, and reduce swelling. Find a cream that contains hydrocortisone in a 0.5% or 1% solution. Use it sparingly 1-2 times a day, but only on the affected areas.


Do not use these creams for long because overexposure to them can actually cause more irritation.
You can also look for more natural calming creams that have ingredients such as licorice, feverfew, tea, turmeric, magnesium, cucumber, or ginger., Aloe vera can help reduce inflammation and relieve pain. You can use the gel from an aloe vera plant or buy it over the counter. Apply the aloe gel to your face twice daily to help decrease the redness.


To extract the gel from the aloe vera plant, remove a large leaf of aloe from the bottom of the plant. Cut down the center of the plant, score the insides, and pull the gel out. Then apply that gel to your face twice a day.You can find aloe vera gel at most supermarkets or drug stores.

, Coconut oil is a natural emollient, which locks in moisture. Be careful putting oils on acne-prone skin: oil can make acne worse. Coconut oil prevents your skin from losing moisture and becoming dehydrated, which is a common reason for redness. It also has lauric acid in it, which has antiviral, anti fungal, and antimicrobial properties to help revitalize your skin. Each night, rub coconut oil onto your face, paying special attention to problem spots that feel extra rough or that are extremely red.You can also use olive oil, almond oil, or rosehip seed oil. They have similar nutrients to coconut oil and will help hydrate your skin.Coconut oil helps alleviate redness when the redness is caused by dryness.

, Oatmeal is great for soothing many different causes of redness, from sunburn to eczema to simple irritation. Buy pure oats and add water to them. Let the oatmeal soak up the water then apply it as a mask. As often as once each day, leave the mask on your face for at least 30 minutes, then wash it off. You can make it with milk for an added boost. Make sure the milk has some fat in it, such as 2% or whole milk. The fatty proteins in the milk help rejuvenate your skin."

Use coal tar.,
Try Vitamin D analogues.,
Get a prescription for anthralin.,
Try topical retinoids.",How to Get Rid of Psoriasis1," Topical corticosteroids are usually the first treatment recommended for psoriasis. If used correctly, they can be quite effective.


Corticosteroids come in a variety of types. There are sprays, creams, gels, ointments, solutions, and foams. The type you choose depends on personal preference, as well as location of the psoriasis (e.g., use a liquid for psoriasis on the scalp), but if you're concerned about choosing the right brand talk to your doctor.Strengths vary. Ideally, you should use stronger types on tough areas like elbows and knees and use a lighter variety on your face and underarms.Creams are usually applied once or twice a day, but you should limit your use of stronger steroids. Overuse can cause rashes and permanent skin thinning and other damages.;

Ask your doctor if these would be helpful for you., Anthralin is a medication that normalizes DNA activity in skin cells, which can lead to a reduction of psoriasis. It comes in cream form.Anthralin has been known to remove scales for some patients, resulting in smoother skin.Unfortunately, anthralin has drawbacks. It can cause skin irritation and stains anything it touches, including hard surfaces like countertops. If you use anthralin, you should only leave it on for a short period of time before wiping it off., Topical retinoids are often used to treat acne or skin damaged by the sun but can be successfully used to treat psoriasis as well.


Retinoids decrease inflammation by normalizing DNA activity in the skin. This can help with symptoms of psoriasis.Sensitivity to the sun is a common side effect of retinoids. You should be sure to use sunscreen while taking topical retinoids.Retinoids are not recommended for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding."

Speak with your health insurance provider.,
Have the mole cut off via surgery.,
Destroy the mole with a laser.,
Freeze other types of nevi with cryotherapy.",How to Get Rid of Skin Moles2," While many insurance plans will not cover cosmetic mole removal, there are other reasons that you might remove a mole. If your mole is bothering you, impairing your vision or functionality, or snagging on jewelry or clothing, your insurance company may cover removal., A dermatologist can usually remove a mole in one or two visits by simply cutting it off. Depending on the size and depth of the mole, your doctor may be able to ""shave"" your mole off so that it is flush with the skin, or may need to make a deeper cut and stitch the skin closed. If cancer is suspected, the mole will be sent to a lab for a biopsy.For most small moles, local anesthesia (numbing of the immediate area) is sufficient to prevent pain during removal.
If the mole grows back, see your doctor immediately, as this is a potential sign of cancer.

, There are dermatologists who treat moles with lasers, but this is not usually the first option. While lasers can destroy the cells of a mole, some people report that the pigmentation returns after treatment, often even darker than before., There are certain types of nevi or skin growths that are not moles, such as sun-induced patches of thick skin called keratosis, that can be removed by freezing and killing them. This is typically done with a cotton swab dipped in liquid nitrogen and takes only a minute or less.In cryotherapy, a residual blister or scab may appear at the site of the treatment, but this normally heals on its own.

Have a biopsy done.,
Undergo an excision surgery.,
Undergo radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and/or other cancer treatments.,
Limit your exposure to UV rays to help prevent future melanoma.,
Have regular skin checks.",How to Get Rid of Skin Moles3," If your doctor suspects that your mole is cancerous, s/he will remove part of it and send it to a lab for testing. A biopsy is necessary to diagnose melanoma.Biopsies can be done quickly and easily in your doctor’s office.
The biopsy will reveal whether a mole is cancerous or not. It may also tell your doctor what stage of cancer your mole is.
In some cases, you may need a surgery called a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). This will help your doctor determine what stage of cancer the melanoma is at.

, If caught early on before it has spread, melanoma can be eliminated entirely via the removal of the cancerous mole. This process, called excision, often requires only local anesthetic (during which the affected area is numbed and the patient stays awake), though especially large or deep melanomas may require general anesthesia (during which the patient is put to sleep).A special type of excision procedure called Mohs Micrographic Surgery has become recognized as very effective in treating two of the most common types of skin cancer, Basal Cell Carcinoma and Squamous Cell Carcinoma, as well as melanoma.In a Mohs Surgery, the doctor progressively removes small sections of effective tissue and examines these under a microscope until s/he finds that the sections no longer contain cancer cells.Excision surgeries, if minor, may only require stitches, while larger excisions may require a skin graft.You may need someone to help you care for the wound after surgery if you have a large surgery site. Talk with your doctor before surgery about what to expect. Follow the doctor’s instructions and keep any follow-up appointments.

, If the cancer spreads beyond the initial mole and into the lymph nodes or other organs, traditional cancer treatments may become necessary. Chemotherapy, radiation, and a variety of other treatments are available for treating skin cancer.Some of these options offer a chance to halt the disease, while others are palliative - meant to improve and/or lengthen the patient's life in incurable cases.
Talk to your doctor to determine your options if a simple excision surgery is insufficient for treating your melanoma.

, Excessive exposure to ultraviolet light (usually in the form of sunlight, but also from tanning beds, etc.) is a major contributor to the development of melanoma.To reduce your risk of developing the types of moles which can progress into melanoma, avoid activities that require staying in direct sunlight for long periods of time, like tanning, outdoor swimming, and so on.


If you do spend time in the sun, use plenty of high-SPF sunscreen of at least SPF 30.
This advice is especially important for pale-skinned individuals, as they are naturally more susceptible to skin damage from sun exposure.

, Having melanoma makes you 5 times more likely to have another, so it’s important to have regular skin checks.Make follow-up appointments with your doctor and consult with your physician about what other preventive measures you may need.You should also have regular skin checks if you or your family have a history of skin cancer.

Wash off with water.

Warning: Do not expose the mole to sunlight while treating it. The juice in citrus fruits can react with UV light to cause photodermatitis, a painful condition resulting in a rash, blisters or scaly skin.Asian Pears - Pears contain arbutin – a naturally occurring form of hydroquinone, which has been proven to be an effective tyrosinase inhibitor. Tyrosinase is an enzyme that helps to produce melanin, the pigment that darkens skin, so inhibiting will produce a skin-whitening effect.The best pear varieties to use are Yaquang, Hongpi, Quingpi, or Guifei.Blend the peel and fruit together along with honey as a binding agent and apply for 15-20 minutes a day, washing off with warm water. Stop if you develop skin irritation.
Pineapple - Pineapple fruit contains compounds that act as tyrosinase inhibitors, thereby whitening skin.Blend four slice of pineapple in a food processor along with a half a tablespoon of honey. Apply for 15-20 minutes a day and wash off with warm water.

These all contain tyrosinase inhibitors that help to whiten skin,but you should be careful when using, as too much may cause an allergic reaction. Mix a few drops of the oil or extract with honey and apply to the mole for 15-20 minutes a day.

, Garlic contains sulphur-rich juices and enzymes that break down pigment-producing cells and lighten pigmentation. Garlic may help lighten a mole. Cut a clove of garlic in half, place the cut side in contact with the mole, and secure it overnight with a bandage. The mole should begin to disappear within 5 days.


Warning: Garlic can irritate and redden your skin.
Apply petroleum jelly to the area around the mole to protect it from the garlic juice.

, Clean the mole with warm water, then soak a cotton ball in apple cider vinegar and place it on the mole. You can secure it with a bandage overnight, but if you wish to irritate your skin less, consider placing it on the mole for only 10-15 minutes, four times a day. The mole may fall off after 10 days or so.


Warning: Apple cider vinegar can make the mole worse at first.
Using apple cider vinegar may leave scars once the mole is removed.
Apply petroleum jelly to protect the skin around the mole.

, Though evidence regarding their effectiveness is inconclusive, both of these oils have long been used to soften and dissolve moles. They may be particularly helpful with raised moles.


Castor Oil -- Mix just a pinch of baking soda and a few drops of castor oil and apply to the mole twice a day. This method is unlikely to leave scars, but it may take a month or more before your mole starts to fade.
Flaxseed Oil – Mix finely ground flax seeds and honey to make a paste. Apply it to the mole for one hour, three times a day. It may take several weeks for the mole to fade.

, Use a cotton bandage to apply aloe vera to your mole and wait until it is completely absorbed, then apply more. After several weeks, your mole may fade.

Hide redness with corrective concealer.,
Wear sunscreen.,
Protect your skin from cold weather.,
Drink water and eat hydrating foods.,
Apply cucumber to skin.,
Apply green tea to skin.,
Cover your skin in petroleum jelly.,
Apply a cold compress.",How to Get Rid of Redness on the Face2," Normal concealers do not hide facial redness well, but a corrective concealer relies on the principle of complementary colors to balance out discolored skin. For facial redness, apply a green-tinted concealer. Apply small dots of concealer over the red areas of your face. Blend it in gently using your fingertips or a makeup sponge.


If the redness persists over time or is too strong to be covered up by concealer, you may have a condition called rosacea. Contact your dermatologist if you think you may have it.Avoid applying a heavy layer. The concealer may or may not cover up all of the redness on your face. Even if a standard, moderate amount does not hide every ounce of unwanted red, you should avoid using a thick coating of it. The green tint might start showing through if there is too much concealer to blend into your skin.

, Your skin redness may be due to sun exposure. Apply sunscreen before leaving the house, even when it seems cloudy. Facial and sensitive-skin sunscreens exist at your local drugstore.


Sunscreen must be at least SPF 30 to be effective.“Non comedogenic” sunscreen avoids clogging up your pores.
You can also buy face makeup or moisturizer that has sunscreen in it.

, In drier, colder weather, your face can get wind burnt and the particles in the air can strip away healthy layers of skin and damage the surface of your skin.If you protect them, your cheeks and nose will be less rosy once you step back inside a room.


When your face is exposed to the cold, the blood vessels constrict, causing your skin to turn white. Once you step into a warmer area, however, all the blood rushes back to your face at once, causing your skin to become bright red.
Wear a scarf, hat, or ski-mask made of non-irritating fibers.

, There are some dietary changes you can make to help with the redness from the inside. Hydrating, cooling foods like carrots, sweet potatoes, apples, celery, coconuts, cucumbers, melons, peaches, papayas, spinach, and broccoli contain antioxidants capable of moisturizing your skin from the inside out.


If your urine is a pale yellow that is almost clear, you are hydrated enough. If your urine is a concentrated yellow or orange-yellow, you should drink more water.
By consuming more of these foods, you can protect your skin from drying out when exposed to cold winter air or other harsh, dry conditions.
Avoid spicy foods, hot drinks, caffeine, and alcohol. These encourage skin redness and will only exacerbate your skin problem., Cucumbers have a high water content and many vitamins and minerals that can help hydrate your skin. Peel and slice a chilled cucumber. Lean your head back and place slices over any red areas of your face for 15 to 20 minutes.


Within that amount of time, the vitamin C in the cucumber should have reduced any pesky redness.Avoid rubbing cucumber over your skin, however, since the friction can cause further irritation.

, Green tea has anti-inflammatory agents and helps constrict blood vessels in your skin, which will help reduce redness and inflammation. Put several tea bags or a few tablespoons of loose leaf tea in a pot of boiling water and remove from heat. Let the tea steep for 10 minutes. Once the tea steeps, pour it into a bowl and lay a washcloth in the green tea, soaking it up as the tea cools. When the tea is at room temperature, run the tea soaked cloth over your face.You can also use chamomile and peppermint tea. Avoid using peppermint tea if your skin is sensitive.
Make sure you use a cloth you don't mind getting stained. The green tea will have a color and will likely stain whatever cloth you use.
Do not rub the cloth over your face vigorously, since that will irritate your skin further.

, Be careful putting petroleum jelly on acne-prone skin: it can make acne worse. For an extra layer of protection on your skin, you can spread a thin coating of petroleum jelly over your face. The petroleum jelly will prevent your blood vessels from constricting and expanding too quickly, which can reduce or prevent most facial redness.If you are unsure, apply to a small area of your cheek where your redness is not the worst. If your skin is is redder or more irritated in a few hours, do not apply jelly to the rest of your face.

, Cold temperatures can reduce redness by shrinking the blood vessels in your skin. This method is especially useful if the redness is accompanied by feelings of burning or swelling. For the cold compress, take a clean, soft washcloth and run it under cool water. Gently press it to the irritated area.You can also use an icepack wrapped heavily in towels, if you want to avoid a wet compress.
You can also place a wet washcloth in the refrigerator for a few minutes to cool it before pressing it to your face.
Do not use rough or cold washcloths.

Stay away from rosacea triggers.,
Ask your doctor about oral prescription.,
Use prescription topical treatments.,
Ask your dermatologist about laser treatments.",How to Get Rid of Redness on the Face3," Rosacea is a chronic skin disorder that comes and goes. It can be hard to predict, but one of the best things for you to do in order to get rid of rosacea related redness before it comes is simply to avoid some of the most common, known triggers of the condition.


Common triggers include sun exposure, heat, alcohol, spicy food, hard cheeses, intense emotions, and changes in the weather such as increased humidity and strong winds.
Emotional upsets for rosacea include stress, fear, anxiety, and embarrassment., Prescription medications reduce skin inflammation and can be prescribed if none of the redness remedies or natural treatments work for you. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, may become pregnant, have other medical conditions, or take other medications before starting new medications.


Your doctor may prescribe you doxycycline, which is an oral antibiotic known to reduce inflammation. A low dose version of doxycycline, known as Oracea, is given initially in high dosages to jump start the drug in your system but then levels out to maintenance dosage levels.
Doxycycline treats not only redness but also the red bumps that are associated with rosacea.
There are many other prescription medications as well. Ask your doctor which is best for your specific case. These are prescribed with moderate cases of rosacea instead of mild ones., Some patients prefer topical treatments to pill ones. Your doctor may prescribe medicated creams such as sodium sulfacetamide/sulfur, Metrogel (metronidazole), or Finacea (azelaic acid), which have the same capabilities as the oral treatment but are applied topically. Each help treat the red bumps as well as redness associated with rosacea., This treatment is often used by patients to help relieve redness for longer periods of time than other treatments. This can also help with noticeable blood vessels on the face, neck, and chest. This therapy is used to help visibly improve the skin and brighten the complexion.


Laser treatment can cause some discomfort, but topical anesthetics and ice packs can be used to decrease discomfort.
This treatment is not a one time only treatment but is given in 3-6 week intervals. It takes a few sessions to get the best effect and is likely not covered by most insurance companies.
It is used mostly when a patient has continual redness that has not responded to other, easier treatments."
"
Use salicylic acid.,
Apply aspirin topically.,
Get a prescription medication.",How to Get Rid of Redness on the Face4," Salicylic acid helps reduce swelling and redness. It has the added bonus of helping to unclog pores. There are gels, wipes, creams, cleansers, moisturizers, and sprays that contain this drug. Try whichever one you think will best fit into your daily routine. Start with a 2% solution of the acid so your skin doesn't dry out., The salicylic acid in aspirin constricts the blood vessels and reduces facial inflammation quite well. To make a topical mask, break a tablet of aspirin in half. Mix a few drops of water with the white powder inside the tablet until a paste forms. Apply the paste directly to your acne. Cover with an adhesive bandage for about 30 minutes.


If you have a tablet form of aspirin, crush the pill and add water to it until it makes a paste.
After 30 minutes pass, the blood vessels should have constricted. The acne and surrounding skin should be notably less red., If you suffer from chronic or severe adult acne, standard skin care products purchased at the store may not be enough to help clear your skin. This is usually when a dermatologist will prescribe a stronger topical cream or ointment to treat your acne with. A doctor can also prescribe oral antibiotics, laser or light treatments, chemical peels, and microdermabrasion.


A doctor might prescribe oral antibiotics to kill the bacteria causing your breakouts. Hormone-regulating medication, such as birth control pills and spironolactone, which was originally a hypertension drug, might be prescribed as well.Usually, topical creams and ointments include ingredients like topical antibiotics, retinoids, sulfur, benzoyl peroxide, and salicylic acid.
It is not unusual for prescriptions to include a combination of these treatments.

"
"
Use oral retinoids.,
Try methotrexate.,
Ask a doctor about skin injections.",How to Get Rid of Psoriasis2," Retinoids also come in oral form and, due to the medication's relation to Vitamin A, they can reduce the production of skin cells. This helps slow the scaling and flaking associated with psoriasis.Usually, oral retinoids are prescribed if your psoriasis does not respond to other treatment options. The main downside is that symptoms of psoriasis often return when treatment ceases.Hair loss and lip inflammation may occur while on oral retinoids. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not take oral retinoids as they can cause severe birth defects., Methotrexate tablets help reduce psoriasis by decreasing skin cell production. They also reduce inflammation.In low doses, most patients experience minimal side effects on methotrexate. An upside to the medication is that it can stall psoriatic arthritis in some patients.Side effects may include upset stomach, fatigue, and loss of appetite. Longterm use is not recommended, however, as severe side effects such as liver damage and decreased production of red and white blood cells can occur if the medication is used too long.Topical application of liposomal methotrexate hydrogel is scientifically proven to be quite effective compared to conventional medication.

, As many oral medication carry heavy risk of side effects and cannot be used long term, injections might be an option if your psoriasis does not respond to other treatments.


Enbrel, infliximab (Remicade), adalimumab (Humira) and ustekinumab (Stelara) are all given by intravenous, subcutaneous, or intramuscular injection. Usually, your doctor will only recommend such procedures if your psoriasis does not respond to other therapies and is causing arthritis.Biologically, such treatments should block interaction between certain cells in order to reduce skin inflammation.If you are taking these medications, you will probably be screened for tuberculosis as the meds have a strong effect on the immune system. They are usually a last resort effort and should only be used with extreme caution and under supervision of a doctor."

Get more exposure to sunlight.,
Look into UVB phototherapy.,
Try excimer lenses.",How to Get Rid of Psoriasis3," UV rays emitted by the sun kill T-cells in the skin. This slows the turnover of skin cells, which can reduce the flaking associated with psoriasis. This is why therapy using UV lights can be a great way to combat psoriasis.Regular exposure to small amounts of sunlight can help with psoriasis. If you live in a sunny area, light therapy can begin with natural light.Talk to your doctor before you add natural sunlight exposure to your skin care regimen. She should be able to tell you the safest way to get sunlight given your skin condition and medical history., UVB phototherapy involves exposure to UV lights through an artificial light source.


This is an excellent choice if you only need to treat specific patches of skin. You can talk to a doctor or dermatologist about where and how to get UVB phototherapy in your area.Narrow band UVB therapy is a type of UVB phototherapy in which smaller beams of light treat specific areas of your skin. Treatment is usually administered two to three times a week. The downside is that burning and irritation may be more severe with narrow band therapy.Goeckerman therapy is a treatment option that combines UVB therapy with coal treatments. As coal makes skin more receptive to UVB light, using the treatment options together boosts the effectiveness of both., An excimer laser is type of laser than can focus UVB lights on only affected skin. It requires fewer sessions than other forms of light therapy and another upside is that healthy patches of skin surrounding psoriasis are generally unharmed. However, some redness and blistering does occur in some patients."

Bathe daily.,
Apply moisturizers.,
Drink less alcohol.,
Try herbs and nutritional supplements.,
Eat an anti-inflammatory diet.",How to Get Rid of Psoriasis4," Taking a warm bath every day can help with psoriasis by washing out flakes and scales.


For added help, add colloidal oatmeal, Epsom salts, or Dead Sea salts to the water as these have properties that help soothe and moisturize skin.Keep water lukewarm and don't use harsh soap. Both can irritate skin. Strive for lukewarm water and milder soaps., Use moisturizers on your skin to prevent dryness. Moisturizers will help relieve the itchiness, redness, and roughness caused by psoriasis.Put moisturizers on right after you shower when your skin is still moist from bathing; this helps lock in the moisture.Avoid heavily scented moisturizers, as these can sometimes irritate psoriasis.

, For some people, drinking alcohol can reduce the effectiveness of treatments for psoriasis.Talk to your doctor about any medications you are on to see if it's safe to drink on your meds.
If you go to an event where people are drinking, it might help to bring a non-alcoholic beverage you enjoy, like a soda, juice, or tea. This way, you can still feel like you're indulging yourself without compromising your psoriasis treatment.
Explain to friends and family members why you need to avoid alcohol. If you're a social drinker, and feel tempted to indulge when going out, having support from your friends can help you abstain from drinking.

, If medical fixes aren't quite working for you, you can try homeopathic options like herbs and nutritional supplements. These can have a positive effect on psoriasis for some people.


Fish oil, which can be purchased at most health food stores or supermarkets, have helped relieve psoriasis symptoms for some. Studies have been mixed on its effectiveness and generally show that while it reduces itching and flaking it might not reduce the size of skin patches. If you're willing to try fish oil, talk to your doctor first as it can interact poorly with some medications in high doses.Folic acid can be taken in pill form. It reduces symptoms of psoriasis for some, but you should talk to your doctor before adding either to your care regimen.Herbs, like Oregon grape cream, avocado and Vitamin B12 creams, aloe vera, and oregano oil can sometimes treat symptoms of psoriasis if used in moderation. Use them according to instructions on the package. With oregano oil, you should always dilute it with water or juice. It should not be used if you're pregnant as it can potentially cause miscarriage., Some people notice a reduction in psoriasis by changing their diet. Eating a balanced diet that is primarily made up of healthy fats, fresh produce, whole grains, and lean proteins is considered an anti-inflammatory diet.Coldwater fish, such as salmon, lake trout, albacore tuna, mackerel, and herring are good sources of Omega-3 fatty acids.
Olive oil, walnuts, flaxseeds, and pumpkin seeds are good plant sources of Omega-3s.
Eat fruits and vegetables that are all colors of the rainbow, such as carrots, strawberries, squash, mangoes, kale, spinach, and blueberries.

Minimize your stressors.,
Perform deep breathing exercises.,
Try progressive muscle relaxation.,
Use visualization.,
Practice positive affirmations.,
Seek help from a therapist.,
Consider other alternative treatments.",How to Get Rid of Stress Hives1," To keep a “Hives Diary,” make an entry every time you have an outbreak of hives. Make sure that you include lots of details about how you are feeling and what has been going on. Some questions you might want to answer in your diary include:Are you cold?
Are you hungry?
Are you upset, angry, nervous, tense, or anxious?
Do you have a chronic condition such as asthma, diabetes or an autoimmune disorder? Has anything happened that might make your chronic condition worse?

, Breathing exercises can relax you, which may help get rid of stress hives. To use deep breathing, lay down or sit in a comfortable chair. Then, place your hands on your stomach with your fingers close together.


Take in a long, slow deep breath and expand your belly as you breathe in. This ensures that you are using your diaphragm to breathe, which can stimulate your parasympathetic nervous system and help calm you. Your fingers should separate as they lie on your belly.

Remove possible triggers from your diet.,
Consider whether you are allergic to something in your environment.,
Minimize your exposure to insect bites and stings.Some people react with hives to the chemicals insects leave in your body when they bite or sting.,
Shield your skin from harsh environmental factors.,
Discuss your medications with your doctor.,
Consider your overall health status.",How to Get Rid of Hives1," You may want to keep a food diary of everything you eat before and after you make any changes. This will help you to identify the problem foods. There are several foods that give some people hives:Foods with vasoactive amines. These chemicals cause the body to release histamines, which can lead to hives. Foods containing them include shellfish, fish, tomatoes, pineapple, strawberries, and chocolate.
Foods with salicylates. These are compounds that are similar to aspirin. Foods that have them include tomatoes, raspberries, orange juice, spices, and tea.
Other common food allergens include peanuts, tree nuts, eggs, cheese, and milk.Some people also find that caffeine and alcohol can trigger hives.;
, If so, you may be able to get rid of your hives by minimizing your contact with these triggers. Some people react with hives to the following substances:Pollen.

Dust mites and animal dander. If you are allergic to dust mites, then keeping your environment extremely clean and dust free may help. Try vacuuming , dusting, and washing regularly. Change your sheets so that you are not sleeping on dusty sheets or pet dander.
Latex. Some people get hives in reaction to contact with latex. If you are a health care worker and think that latex may give you hives, try using latex-free gloves to see if your hives go away.
Other chemicals (cleaning products, perfumes, etc.) can also cause hives if you are allergic.

, Some people experience severe allergic reactions and carry epinephrine injectors in case they get stung. If you work outside, you can reduce your exposure to bites and stings by:


Avoiding bee hives and wasp nests. If you see bees or wasps, don’t antagonize them. Instead move slowly away and wait for them to fly away.

Applying insect repellent to your clothes and any exposed skin you may have. Do not get these chemicals in your nose, eyes, or mouth. There are many products available, but those with DEET are generally effective.

Familiarize yourself with the types of stress-related hair loss.,
See a doctor to confirm a diagnosis.,
Realize that hair will usually grow back on its own.,
Get enough sleep.,
Follow a healthy diet.,
Exercise more.,
See a therapist.,
Give your body time to recover after a major physiological change.,
Check your meds.,
Eat enough protein.,
Increase B vitamins and decrease A vitamins.,
Avoid low-calorie diets.,
Take good care of your hair.,
Avoid over-styling your hair.",How to Prevent Hair Loss Due to Stress," There are three main types of stress-related hair loss as follows:



Telogen effluvium: With telogen effluvium, stress may send a number of hair follicles into a resting phase, stopping the hair from growing. Several months later, the hair attached to the affected follicles may start to fall out suddenly, in greater volume than normal. This is possibly the most common type of stress-related hair loss.

Alopecia areata: With alopecia areata, the immune system turns on the hair follicles and causes hair to fall out, sometimes in large chunks. There may be several factors causing this type of hair loss, and stress is suspected to be one of them.

Trichotillomania: This condition is very different than the previous two, as it involves a person compulsively pulling out their own hair from their head, their eyebrows, or other areas of their body. A person usually develops this condition as a method of coping with stress, anxiety, depression, loneliness, or boredom.;
, With each type of hair loss, the exact link between the hair loss and stress is somewhat unclear.


While stress will sometimes cause the hair loss directly, other times, the stress makes an existing condition worse. In some cases, the hair loss will cause the stress, rather than the other way around.
Although most instances of hair loss will not require any significant medical attention, in some cases the hair loss is not the result of stress (as you might believe), but is in fact a symptom of a more serious underlying issue. Therefore, it important that you see your doctor rather than self-diagnosing.
Some of the more serious conditions which can lead to hair loss include hypothyroidism, autoimmune diseases such as lupus and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). With hypothyroidism and PCOS there are treatment options available which can help hair to grow back. However, with autoimmune related hair loss, the loss is often permanent., If hair loss is indeed caused by stress, the major focus of treatment should be on minimizing or eliminating that stress.


Once the stress is reduced, hair should grow back on its own with no need for drugs or other treatments.The important thing is to have patience. The growth cycle of hair takes time, and it can be a number of months before you see a significant improvement.
Just do your best to avoid stressing about the situation, as this will only make things worse. Have faith in your ability of your hair follicles to renew the hair, and you'll be fine.

, Lack of sleep can contribute to both mental and physical stress, especially if the sleep issues persist over a long period of time. It can affect your diet, your performance at work and your overall mood, which, in turn, can lead to stress or anxiety-related hair loss.


Improve your sleep by getting into a regular sleep pattern - that is, waking up and going to bed at the same time every day. You should aim to be getting at least 7 to 8 hours sleep a night.
Avoid doing anything too stimulating before bed. Don't watch any scary films or TV shows, stay away from the bright screen of your laptop and phone, and don't exercise or eat anything just before bed. Read a book or take a hot bath instead.

, Eating healthily gives your body more energy, enabling it to better cope with stress. Diet also contributes to the strength of hair, making it less likely to fall out.


Eat at least three well-balanced meals per day. Never skip breakfast, as it gets your metabolism going in the morning and helps to prevent cravings for unhealthy snacks before lunch.
Stay away from processed, sugary foods, and those high in trans fats. Instead, eat more fruit and vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and foods high in monounsaturated fats, such as avocados, oily fish, nuts, and olives.
Increase your intake of certain vitamins and minerals which contribute to healthy hair growth and your overall well-being, such as B vitamins, vitamins A, C, and E, zinc, selenium, and magnesium. Omega-3 fatty acids are also beneficial, as they can help to improve the health of the scalp.

, Exercise can be hugely beneficial in helping to alleviate emotional stress. When you exercise, your body releases endorphins - also known as happy hormones - which help you to feel calmer and more relaxed.


The type of exercise you do is up to you - when it comes to relieving stress, try to find something you enjoy, whether it's running, rowing, cycling, dancing, or rock climbing. Anything that gets your heart rate up and puts a smile on your face will be beneficial.
Also try to incorporate a yoga or meditation class into your weekly routine, as these have been proven to effectively reduce stress levels. Alternatively, you could practice meditation at home or at your desk - anywhere you can shut out the world for a few moments and just focus on clearing your mind.

, Emotional stress can become much worse over time if you bottle up your feelings and avoid talking about the source of your stress. Therefore, seeing a therapist to talk through your anxiety issues can be very cathartic, and do wonders to relieve stress.


If talking to a therapist isn't something you're interested in, then at least open up to a trusted friend or family member. Don't be afraid of burdening them with your worries - they'll be more than happy to lend a sympathetic ear.
Even if talking about things doesn't change the source of the stress, it can help to change how you view it and give you some perspective. Talking to friends and family can also help you to realize that you have a strong support system around you and that you don't need to cope with your stress alone.

, Major physiological changes - such as surgery, a car accident, illness, or giving birth to a child - can be very traumatic for your body, even if you feel fine mentally. That's why people often notice their hair falling out three to six months after a major physical change.


When this starts to happen, it's important to remember that the damage has already been done. There's very little you can do to reverse the effects of the traumatic event after it happens.
Therefore, the only solution is to give your body time to recover. The hair loss is not permanent, so once your body recovers from the stressful event, your hair will start to grow back.

, There are a number of medications which can promote hair-loss, thereby making stress-related hair loss worse.


The most common of these medications include blood thinners and blood pressure tablets (beta-blockers). Other medications that might have an effect include methotrexate (for rheumatic conditions), lithium (for bipolar disorder) and some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).If you are taking any of these medications and suspect they may be having an adverse effect on your hair, speak to your doctor about lowering your dosage or switching to another type of medication.

, Your hair is composed mostly of protein, so having lots of protein in your diet is essential for healthy hair. If you're not getting enough, your body can shut down the supply of protein to your hair and use it for the most essential of many other body functions.


When your hair doesn't get enough protein, it shuts down growth. As a result, when existing hair reaches the end of its cycle and naturally falls out (in a process known as catagen) it can seem as if you have less hair than normal.
Don't worry though - once you commit to getting enough protein in your diet, your hair will start to grow again and feel thicker in no time.
The best sources of protein include fish (like tuna, salmon, and halibut), white poultry (such as turkey and chicken), eggs, dairy products (including milk, cheese, and yogurt), beans (like kidney, white, lima, and black beans) and beef, veal, pork, and tofu., B vitamins are necessary for healthy hair growth, so if you're not getting enough of them as part of your diet, your hair could be affected. On the other hand, excess vitamin A can trigger hair loss, so you may need to cut back.


Having low levels of B vitamins in your diet is pretty uncommon, especially in the U.S., but it can be an issue for some people. To naturally increase your intake of B vitamins, eat more fish and lean meat as well as starchy vegetables and non-citrus fruits.
To decrease your intake of vitamin A, try to cut back on any supplements or medications containing vitamin A. Keep in mind that the recommended daily intake of vitamin A (for anyone above the age of four) is 5,000 IU., Low-calorie diets often deprive your body of many of the vitamins, nutrients, and healthy fats it needs to function properly and maintain healthy hair growth.


In addition, rapid weight loss (as the result of following a low-calorie diet) can cause major physical stress to the body, which may trigger hair loss.
It is important to supply your body with all the fuel it needs. If you're trying to lose weight, you should do so by making healthier, more nutritious choices and by exercising regularly.
Aim to lose weight slowly and steadily, rather than trying to do so all at once using starvation tactics. A safe, manageable goal is to lose one to two pounds per week.
Many high-fat, high-calorie foods are actually very good for you, provided you make the right choices. Things like nuts, avocados, and oily fish are all high in monounsaturated fat, but they are also very healthy and should be eaten as part of a balanced diet.

, Taking good care of your hair will contribute to its overall health, making it stronger and less prone to fall out.


Start by using a shampoo and conditioner suited to your hair type. Dry hair will need richer, super-moisturizing products, while oily or very fine hair will require lighter products designed for regular use.
Try to avoid using hair products with too many chemicals in them. Shampoos containing sulfates or parabens should be avoided and more natural, organic ingredients should be used.
Also avoid washing your hair too often, as this can strip hair of natural oils, causing it become dry, brittle and prone to breaking. Every two to three days is a good schedule for most hair types.
Nourish your hair even further by getting moisture and shine treatments at your local salon, or by making natural hair masks at home. Oils such as coconut, argan, and almond can improve the condition of hair dramatically, making it soft and silky.
Keep your hair in good condition by getting it trimmed every six to eight weeks. This eliminates split ends and helps your hair to look and feel great., Overstyling is one of the biggest issues when it comes to healthy hair. Nowadays, many women are obsessed with blow-drying, straightening, and curling their hair using heated styling tools. These wreak havoc on the condition of hair.


Try to minimize the use of styling tools. Experiment with naturally air drying your hair, scrunching your hair using a little hair mousse, or curling your hair using no-heat methods, such as hair rollers.
You should avoid playing with your hair too much, i.e., twisting, pulling, or breaking off split ends. You should also be careful with ponytails - tying them too tightly can cause hair to fall out (traction alopecia). Wear your hair loose as often as possible (especially at night) and experiment with loose, low ponytails and braids. Don't brush your hair too often either.
Be careful when using color treatments on the hair, as they can quickly dry, damage, and over-process your hair. Wait as long as possible between dye jobs, and think long and hard before you decide to go down a color route which involves bleach. Consider using more natural hair coloring techniques, such as henna, which nourishes as it colors.

Since some physical ailments can cause skin to dry and flake, it is important to eliminate those possible underlying factors before attempting to find the ideal solution for the problem.

, Stress interferes with a number of body functions, and can lead to skin problems that produce dandruff. Some people find that the incidence and severity of dandruff begins to ease off once the underlying causes for the stress are addressed and resolved. Implementing the use of exercise or other means to alleviate stress may be especially important if it is not possible to resolve the stressful issues.

, Without the inclusion of foods that provide a sufficient supply of nutrients, the scalp will be more susceptible to dryness and flaking. Pay close attention to the types of fat you ingest, and make sure there is plenty of the water-soluble B vitamins present in the foods you consume. Also include foods that offer an equitable amount of zinc as part of your daily diet.

, Sunlight does more than promote the production of vitamin D3; it also helps to promote the production of healthy oils in the skin when exposure is kept within reasonable limits. Make it a point to spend a few minutes in the sun each day, but take precautions to protect the exposed skin of the face and arms from too much exposure to damaging ultraviolet rays.

, Some gels, hairsprays and other styling products can not only damage hair but also cause the scalp to dry and flake. Try cutting back on your use of the products as well as switch to products that are infused with nutrients that help feed the scalp.

, There are a number of medicated shampoos on the market today that help to reduce hair dandruff by fighting the underlying causes for the skin irritation and flaking. Along with over the counter products, physicians can also provide access to prescription only formulas for advanced cases. Use the products according the instructions for the best possible results.

Reduce the chemicals you use on your hair.,
Protect your hair when you go swimming.",How to Prevent Hair Loss and Damage1," Hair treatments that use chemicals, like hair color, bleach, straightening, or perms, can cause hair damage that makes your hair break off or fall off temporarily.Another type of hair damage and hair loss that can result from hair styling is wearing your hair in a style that pulls too tightly on your hair. This is called traction alopecia. This issue can permanently damage the your hair follicles if you wear a style, like a very tight ponytail or braids, that pulls on your hair for a long period of time. Loosen up any tight hair styles and avoid wearing your hair in a tight hair style all day long. Pain is a sign of too much traction on your hair, which can lead to hair loss.Weaves and extensions can lead to similar hair damage.
Over-brushing your hair can weaken and damage your hair. Over- or roughly brushing wet hair especially can cause breakage.;
, If you color your hair, you should use shampoo designed for color-treated hair. If your hair is chemically treated or suffering from damage, consider a “2-in-1” shampoo.Keep in mind that regardless of cost, many shampoo and conditioner brands provide the same benefits. Don’t feel like you have to splurge to get a good shampoo and conditioner. It’s more important to use a shampoo and conditioner that are made for your hair type than the cost of the hair products.
There is no scientific proof that hair products advertising hair loss prevention or the regrowth of hair actually work. So be wary of these products.Some hair care professionals recommend using baby shampoo, as it is mild on hair.If you're unsure which shampoo or conditioner is best for your hair, consult your stylist or dermatologist.

, Wash daily if you have very oily hair. Though you may think that not washing your hair will slow hair loss, in fact it might speed it up. This is because your hair follicles can’t function properly when they are blocked with yeast, microbes, and sebum., Focus on cleaning your scalp, rather than washing the entire length of your hair. Washing only your hair can create flyaway hair that is dull and coarse. It also makes your hair more prone to breakage and falling out., You don’t need to use conditioner if you use a “2-in-1” shampoo, which cleans and conditions hair with only one product. Conditioner can significantly improve the look of damaged or weathered hair. It increases shine, reduces static on your hair, and improves your hair’s strength., Because conditioners can make fine hair look limp, or weigh down your hair, only use it on the tips of your hair. Do not apply it to your scalp or the length of your hair.You should also avoid rubbing your hair too hard with a towel after a shower as this can lead to breakage and damage. Try instead to ""scrunch"" your wet hair with the towel.

, Let your hair air dry to avoid pulling on your hair while blowdrying or straightening it. If you can’t live without your blow out, use the blowdryer on a low-heat setting and don’t pull at any tangles in your hair. Use a thin comb to lightly pull tangles apart., Styling your hair when it’s wet can cause it to stretch and break. So braid it or twist your hair when it’s dry or damp.Avoid teasing or backcombing your hair as these styles can cause hair damage.

, If you have gotten into the habit of coloring your hair once a month or applying chemical treatments to your hair, ease off on these chemicals. You shouldn’t get a chemical treatment done on your hair too often, as they can damage and weaken your hair follicles, leading to breakage and hair loss.Try to avoid products that promise ""long-lasting hold,"" as these often cause damage to your hair.

, It’s important to protect your hair from the damaging effects of chlorine in pools. Wet and condition your hair before you go swimming. Wear a tight-fitting swim cap when you go for a swim.You should also use a specially formulated swimmers shampoo and deep conditioner after you go swimming to replace lost moisture on your scalp and hair.

Ask your doctor what the lowest dose is that would be effective for treating your condition., Accutane may cause vitamin deficiencies in some patients, so it may be a good idea to have some blood work done. Your symptoms may also be caused by the extremely high doses of Vitamin A your body is getting from Accutane.


Accutane can also cause a deficiency of B vitamins, specifically folic acid, in some individuals.. If you are found to have a deficiency, taking B vitamin supplements may help your hair grow faster and become stronger. You can also try eating foods that are rich in folic acid, such as broccoli, asparagus, green peas, avocados, bananas, papayas, white rice, and beef liver.Healthy levels of vitamins C and E, zinc, calcium, magnesium, selenium, and Omega-3 fatty acids are also needed to help prevent hair loss and thinning. Consider taking multivitamins and other supplements that contain these ingredients.If you take multivitamins, check to make sure they do not contain Vitamin A. If they do, try switching to a different multivitamin in order to reduce symptoms that may be caused by an excess amount of the vitamin in your body., Accutane is thought to suppress the levels of certain pituitary hormones, although its exact effects on the body's hormones are not well understood. Talk to your doctor about prescription medications and lifestyle changes that can help you maintain balanced hormones.Symptoms such as weight loss, decreased appetite, sensitivity to cold, and fatigue may indicate that you have a hormonal imbalance.Eating lots of quinoa, salmon, avocados, broccoli, eggs, and almonds may help you naturally balance your hormones., Stress can cause hair loss, and combined with the effects of Accutane, may worsen your symptoms. If you are very stressed, activities such as yoga, meditation, or even therapy might benefit you., Make sure you eat a healthy diet, rich in lean proteins, anti-oxidant rich fruits and vegetables, and healthy oils.

Talk to your boss about accommodations.",How to Prevent Hair Loss from Lupus," Cutaneous lupus (lupus of the skin) can cause your hair to fall out. Alternatively, your hair loss may be a result of your medication, particularly if you are on a corticosteroid (like prednisone). Talk to your doctor to figure out which of these two reasons you’re experiencing hair loss (also known as alopecia).Hair loss from lupus medications like corticosteroids is mostly reversible, but hair loss from scarring and discoid lesions is generally permanent., If you have been diagnosed with cutaneous lupus (lupus of the skin), you may quickly begin losing hair because the damage that lupus does to your skin can change the normal function of your hair follicles. The sooner you begin your treatment, the sooner you can reverse hair loss.If you haven’t been diagnosed with lupus, but you have been losing hair, talk to your doctor about the possibility that you have lupus. There are lots of other reasons you could be losing hair (heredity, chemical hair treatments, thyroid issues, nutritional deficiencies, etc.), but if you’re concerned, see a doctor. Particularly if you’re also experiencing unexplained fevers, rashes, fingers and toes that turn blue in the cold, fatigue, and joint or muscle pain, there’s a decent chance that you have lupus.The key to stopping hair loss from lupus is early treatment. In most cases, the best way to control hair loss is to control the disease.

, There are such a wide variety of lupus medications that the directions vary greatly. It’s likely that you will need to take some at night, and some in the morning, some with food, and some without. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about what to do if you miss a dose, because that will also depend on the kind of medicine you’re taking., The most common is a corticosteroid, which will help regulate your blood pressure, help your immune system, and decrease inflammation. Your doctor will probably prescribe prednisone, prednisolone, or methylprednisolone. Corticosteroids frequently cause hair loss.If your hair loss is from your medication, you may have to wait until your lupus is under control in order to address hair loss.

, If medication is what’s causing your hair loss, your doctor may be able to change your dose or put you on a different kind of medicine. Keep in mind that you might have to wait a little while to switch medications, though. Even though hair loss can be really unpleasant, it’s important to manage your disease.Depending on the severity of your lupus, your doctor may not be able to take you off the medications that are causing hair loss. However, they may be able to lower your dosage of some medicines while simultaneously increasing your dosage of others. (For example, they may lower your corticosteroid dose and add in an antimalarial, which will help regulate your symptoms without adding many new side effects.) Immunosuppressants and NSAIDS can also be used to treat lupus. Examples of immunosuppressants are azathioprine, mycophenolate, and methotrexate., Check your face and scalp in particular. If there is anything round and scaly or anything that looks like a rash, you are at risk of permanent hair loss because of scarring. Your doctor may be able to prescribe medication or change your current medication to prevent this., Lupus tends to flare up when you are stressed, and flare-ups can cause your hair to fall out. The best way to manage your stress level is to keep your list of obligations to a minimum and exercise often.You can also try relaxation techniques like meditation or yoga.
If you are a religious person, prayer may lower your stress level.
Make time for hobbies and other activities that relax you.
Don’t use drugs, alcohol, or caffeine to reduce your stress. They may seem to help in the short term, but will only make it worse in the long term.
If you’re having a lot of trouble managing stress, talk to a counselor or your lupus doctor. They may be able to help you cope.

, Remember that some people with lupus need up to 12 hours of sleep a night in order to manage their stress levels. Lupus attacks your immune system, so you’ll require much more sleep to build it back up than the average person does. Getting enough sleep will help you manage many of your symptoms, including hair loss.If you’re finding that it’s hard to get out of bed in the morning or that you wake up not feeling refreshed, you may not be getting enough sleep. Talk to your doctor about how much sleep you need, and ask them if a mild sleep aid might help.

, About half of lupus patients get flare-ups as a result of photosensitivity.If you have to be in the sun, wear lots of sunscreen, a hat that protects your face and neck, and long sleeves and pants. Even if it’s cloudy out, when you have to be outside for extended periods, protect your skin. About 70% of ultraviolet rays can still sneak through cloud cover.The sun is especially potent between 10am and 4pm. Try to stay indoors during these hours if you can.
If you’re going to be out for more than a few minutes, put sunscreen on the parts of your body that are covered by clothing too. Most clothing only protects the skin up to SPF 5.Reapply often (about every 2 hours), especially if you sweat.
Don’t forget that UV rays can go through car windows as well. You may want to purchase window shades or protective films.Every day, you should use sunscreen that has broad spectrum coverage against UBA and UVB sunlight, has an SPF of 30 or greater, and is water resistant., UV rays also come from indoor lighting, and they can cause lupus flare ups as well. Particularly if you work in an office that uses these kinds of lighting, you can protect yourself with shades, shields, filters, and tube covers. Don’t forget that many photocopy machines also emit UV rays. Close the cover when you’re using the copier to protect yourself from these rays.

, Depending on the severity of your disease, the Americans with Disabilities Act may cover some of the things you need to work comfortably. Typically, you will be covered under the ADA if one or more manifestations of your disease qualifies as a “disability.”The ADA defines a disability as an “impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.”
Talk with a Job Accommodation specialist if you aren’t sure what your rights are or how to ask your boss for them. The U.S. Department of Labor offers a free service called the Job Accommodation Network (JAN), whose consultants will talk with you about accommodations.For example, if you have high photosensitivity, the ADA might require that your company provide broad spectrum lights.

Learn about the Norwood/Hamilton Scale.,
Figure out which of the seven stages you fall into.,
Seek treatment before reaching Stage Seven.",How to Measure Hair Loss1," The Norwood/Hamilton scale is the accepted scale for assessing male pattern baldness, first introduced by Dr. James Hamilton in the 1950s.


If you suffer from male pattern baldness, being able to identify your level of hair loss as falling somewhere in one of the seven stages identified by the Norwood/Hamilton scale can help a doctor determine how the best treatment method.There will be times when you have to explain your level of hair loss over the phone to a doctor or physician. Being able to point to a stage on the Norwood/Hamilton Scale will be helpful.The Norwood/Hamilton Scale also protects against misdiagnosis. You can make sure your hair loss is following the pattern of male baldness and not merely the result of aging.;
, There are 7 stages of the Norwood/Hamilton Scale used to assess male pattern baldness. Figure out which of the seven stages best reflects your hair loss.


Stage One, which sometimes goes unnoticed, is marked by a very minor recession of the hairline and does not require treatment. Unless you have a family history of baldness, you do not need to worry about Stage one.Stage Two is marked by a triangular recession of the hair lining the frontal temporal areas. The hair around your ears will also recede by several centimeters. Baldness becomes more apparent in this stage.Stage Three is the lowest level of hair loss needed for a person to be considered bald. Temples will be bare, only covered by sparse hair, and the hair towards the front of the head will begin to form a crown. Stage four is marked by these symptoms becoming more severe, and hair further thinning and receding around the temples and the front of the head.In Stage Five, the band of hair that extends across the crown thins. Hair loss around the temples and the ears become larger and more noticeable. This continues into Stage Six, when the bridge of hair across the crown is totally lost.Stage Seven is the most advanced form of hair loss. There is only a narrow band of horseshoe-shaped hair on the sides of the head and the back of the scalp. There may be some hair, forming a semi-circle, over both ears., Once you've reached Stage Seven, hair loss becomes very difficult to treat. If you want to combat male pattern baldness, seek out the advice of a doctor and physician to figure out how to best treat your hair loss before you reach Stage Seven."

Try adding some alum to water.",How to Prevent Hair Loss Due to Hard Water1," Although it is unlikely that hard water will lead directly to hair loss, softening the water you use to wash your hair can help you have a healthy and strong head of hair. The most comprehensive way to do this is by lowering the mineral content of the water. Water softener machines are specifically designed to solve this problem.Water softeners are typically kept in basements or garages, and they work to reduce calcium and magnesium (limescale) in the water.If your home or apartment does not already have a water softener, you might consider buying one.
In some cases, you may also be able to rent a water softener in order to try it out before making the investment of buying one.;
, A much more practical and affordable option is just to get a filter for your shower head. These work in much the same way as a regular water filter, by neutralizing pH levels.You will need to replace your existing shower head, but this is a lot cheaper and easier than buying a full water softening system.


You may have to replace the actual filter inside the shower head every six months or so, but these are relatively inexpensive.
You can expect to pay between $10 and $45 for a filter in the US., One way to get softer water is set aside a bucket of water from the shower or tap which you will use to rinse your hair. Before you rinse, add a spoonful of alum to the bucket of water. The alum will help the minerals in the water to settle at the bottom.You can then scoop up water from the surface to rinse your hair.
This water will be less rich in minerals, and less hard.
You can find alum powder at the spice section of your grocery store.

Get your daily recommended dosage of omega-3 fatty acids.,
Get plenty of zinc.,
Take iron supplements if you have anemia.,
Try biotin supplements.,
Take in more protein.,
Use saw palmetto.",How to Prevent Hair Loss by Homeopathic Treatment1," One of the major causes of hair loss is inflammation, which is a common occurrence when your body isn't getting enough nutrients or is stressed from an underlying condition. Omega-3 fatty acids help to reduce inflammation and can lead to a reduction in hair loss as well as potentially helping your hair grow back.


Fish oil and flaxseed oil are good sources of omega-3 fatty acids. Take 2 capsules or 1 tablespoon of oil every day.
You can also consume omega-3s in the form of salmon, oysters, walnuts, and flaxseed in addition to supplementing your diet with capsules or pure oil.;
, Zinc aids in the synthesis of hair keratin, and it's common to have a deficiency. A zinc deficiency can also lead to hypothyroidism, which is another cause of hair loss.Make sure you're taking in plenty of zinc by eating oysters, shellfish, poultry and other zinc-rich foods and consider taking a supplement in the amount of 30 mg every day., Anemia, which is a condition in which your blood has too few red blood cells, is a common cause for hair loss. Taking iron supplements can help to cure anemia, bringing life back to languishing hair follicles. This isn't a cure-all, however; only take iron supplements if you know you're anemic. See your doctor to determine whether iron supplements could help you stop losing hair.


It is recommend that you get most of your iron through iron-rich foods like spinach, tofu, beans, oysters, and beef. Supplement an iron-rich diet with 325 milligrams per day of iron.
Iron deficiency is more common in women than men, especially around the time of menstruation., Biotin is a B-vitamin that's essential for hair growth. If your biotin levels are low, you may have brittle hair and nails. The general daily recommended dosage of biotin is 2.5 mg, but it's important to consult with your doctor to make sure you take the right amount for your needs.


Don't take more than the recommended daily dosage, since overdosing on biotin is just as unhealthy as having too little in your system.Most hair loss is not caused by a biotin deficiency, so don't expect to get big results unless you're sure that's what's causing the problem. If your hair loss is the result of a hormonal problem or if it's just part of your genetics, biotin isn't going to make a very noticeable difference.

, Hair is actually made out of protein, and when you aren't getting enough, your hair stops growing. Women need at least 46 grams of protein per day to stay healthy, and men need at least 56.The best way to get protein is through your diet, by eating meat, fish, poultry, beans, tofu, nuts, and leafy greens. But if you're having trouble getting enough protein in your meals, you might want to consider taking a protein supplement to make sure you meet the CDC's recommended protein requirements.

, Saw palmetto blocks the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Since DHT leads to hair loss in men, taking saw palmetto supplements may help prevent hair loss. However, the efficacy of saw palmetto as a hair loss treatment is up for debate; according to the National Institutes of Health, there's not enough evidence to show for sure that it helps. It has been used for many years as a hair loss treatment in Native American cultures, so it might be worth a try.The recommended general dosage is 160 mg of saw palmetto extract taken twice a day. Choose an extract comprised of 85 to 95 percent total fatty acids.

Maintain a balanced, healthy diet.,
Take vitamin supplements.,
Check if there is a history of hair loss in your family.,
Try to address any stress triggers in your life.,
Take up a stress releasing activity like yoga, meditation, or running.,
Talk to a therapist or a counselor.",How to Prevent Hair Loss and Damage2," Not eating enough healthy food can contribute to hair loss as you also lose out on vitamins and minerals that promote healthy hair. This is why people with eating disorders lose their hair, as well as vegetarians who are not getting enough protein in their diet. To improve the strength and sheen of your hair, focus on maintaining a diet that consists of:Iron and zinc. These minerals help your hair follicles grow. Lean red meat is rich in both nutrients, as well as non-meat options like soybeans or lentils.Protein. This is one of the building blocks of life, promoting cell growth and repair, even in your hair. Women should get at least 46 grams a day (for reference, 3 ounces of chicken has about 23 grams of protein). Other sources of protein include fish, beans, nuts, and yogurt.Omega-3 fatty acids. Eat fatty fish, like salmon, twice a week to improve your hair’s strength and shine. In addition to silky hair, omega-3s may also help to relieve depression and improve the health of your heart.
Biotin. Eggs are a rich source of this B vitamin, which is essential for healthy growth of your cells and your hair. Eggs are also an excellent source of protein, choline, and vitamin D.
In addition to these vitamin and mineral rich foods, you should also have a healthy amount of fruits and vegetables in your diet. Citrus fruits like oranges, as well as strawberries, pineapple, tomatoes, and dark green vegetables all contain vitamin C. Vitamin C has antioxidant properties that help make your skin and hair healthy by boosting your metabolism and converting fat and carbohydrates into energy.

, Some vitamins, like vitamin D, help to strengthen your hair but are tricky to get through eating. Look for vitamin D supplements and take about 1,000 IU a day.You can also take vitamin B, vitamin E, and magnesium supplements once a day to ensure you are consuming these vital vitamins and minerals.
Keep in mind there is no proven scientific correlation between vitamin supplements and the prevention of hair loss. Rather, supplements will help you maintain the hair you still have and stay healthy overall., One of the most common causes of hair loss for adults is androgenetic, sometimes called male or female pattern baldness. This kind of hair loss is caused by a combination of genetics and hormones.Male pattern baldness affects around half of all men by 50 years of age. It usually starts in the late twenties or early thirties. Symptoms include a receding hairline and the thinning of the hair on the crown of your head, creating a horseshoe shape around the back and sides of your head. Sometimes it can progress to complete baldness.Female pattern baldness is not as common as male pattern baldness. During female pattern baldness, your hair only thins on the top of your head. It’s not clear if female pattern baldness is hereditary, but it tends to be more noticeable in women who have been through menopause. This may be because post menopausal women have fewer female hormones and this can lead to baldness or hair loss.While conventional wisdom on androgenetic hair loss is that men inherit their mother’s father’s hair, or lack thereof, recent studies have shown that genetic hair loss can be caused by baldness from either the mother’s or the father’s genes for both men and women.If there is a history of pattern baldness in your family, you can try over-the-counter hair loss treatments like Minoxidil (brand name Rogaine), which works well when used consistently over a period of time. But keep in mind the goal of these types of over-the-counter medications is to stop the process of hair loss, not help you grow your hair back.Minoxidil should not be used by pregnant or breastfeeding women.
However, there is no way to prevent hair loss caused by genetics.

, Stress and hair loss can definitely be connected, especially if you are dealing with a recent traumatic event or are continually stressed out. Hair shedding caused by physical or emotional stress is called Telogen effluvium, and it can cause you to lose one-half to three-quarters of your hair. Your hair may come out in handfuls while you shampoo, comb or run your hands through your hair.Telogen effluvium is usually temporary, as you recover from stress or a traumatic event. But if you do not address any stress triggers in your life, your hair shedding could become long-term, or chronic. If you get your stress under control, your hair can grow back., You may also want to adjust your daily routine so you have more time to do things you enjoy and to focus on cultivating calm and peace in your life.

, If you feel your stress is out of control or if you are having a hard time dealing with a traumatic event, don’t keep it to yourself. Talking to someone about your issues can help you recover and release any tension or stress.

Egg oil is a more convenient, less smelly alternative to raw eggs.

, Coconut is a rich source of lauric and stearic acids, which lubricate your hair. The oil also penetrates deep into the hair shaft, which prevents the cuticle from becoming damaged and makes your hair look healthy and fresh.Massage your scalp with pure coconut oil using your fingers. Leave it on overnight. Wrap your head to keep the coconut oil on your hair.
Rinse off the coconut oil in the morning in the shower with cool water.

, Styling products, as well as air pollution, can leave a film on your hair that saps moisture and dulls your shine. Dairy products like sour cream and plain yogurt can help to reverse this damage.

, To add some body to your hair, go for an unlikely beauty beverage: beer. The fermented drink contains yeast, which works well to hydrate limp or dull hair.Make the beer flat. Pour the beer into a container and let it sit out for a couple of hours to deplete the carbonation.
Mix ½ cup flat beer with 1 tsp light oil, like sunflower or canola, and a raw egg. Apply the mixture to clean, damp hair. Let it sit for 15 minutes, then rinse it with cool water.
You can also pour flat beer into a spray bottle and spritz it onto dry hair. When the beer evaporates, the remaining protein residue from the wheat, malt, or hops, strengthens your hair.
Apply both treatments every other week.

, Avocado is a good natural conditioner as the fats in the avocado promote hair growth and stronger hair. Its oils and proteins also help to smooth and weigh down any unruly hair.Mash up half an avocado and massage it into clean, damp hair. Let it sit for 15 minutes before rinsing it off with water.
You can amp up the moisturizing power of avocado by combining a mashed avocado with 1-2 tsp sour cream, egg yolks, or mayonnaise.
Apply these treatments every two weeks.

, Aloe vera is a natural moisturizer for your skin and a natural conditioner for your hair. You can use aloe vera in a juice or gel form.Apply a handful of aloe vera juice to your scalp and the ends of your hair. Wash it off with warm water after a few minutes.
You can also create a mixture of 4 tbsp of aloe vera gel with 2 tbsp of coconut oil and 3 tbsp of yogurt. Stir the mixture and apply it on to your hair. Let it sit for 10 minutes before rinsing it off with water.

, Maybe you have hard water in your shower, you spend a lot of time outside without a hat, or you straighten your hair every day. If you do any of these hair dehydrating things, moisturize your hair with honey.


Massage about ½ cup honey into clean, damp hair. Let it sit for 20 minutes. Then, rinse it off with warm water.You can also add 1-2 tbsp olive oil to loosen the honey for easier application.
For really sun-damaged hair, mix honey with 1-2 tbsp of a protein-rich ingredient, like avocado or egg yolk. This will help to replenish the keratin protein bonds of your hair that are damaged by UV rays.
Apply these treatments once a month.

, If your scalp is itchy and dry, or flaking, use olive oil and lemon juice. The acidity in lemon juice helps to rid your scalp of any loose, dry flakes. The olive oil then moisturizes the newly exposed skin on your head.Mix 2 tbsp fresh lemon juice with 2 tbsp olive oil and 2 tbsp water. Massage the mixture into your damp scalp.
Let it sit for 20 minutes. Then, rinse and shampoo your hair.
Treatment can be applied every other week.

Spironolactone may be effective for some women.
There are also surgical options for hair loss, including hair transplants and artificial implants. But this is considered a serious operation and should be done by a licensed physician. Talk to your doctor before you consider hair transplants or implants.

, Sometimes doctors prescribe medicines that can cause hair loss. Chemotherapy drugs for cancer are probably the medicines most known for causing hair loss. But hair loss can also be a side effect of some medicines used to treat acne, bipolar disorder, and ADHD.Diet pills that contain amphetamines can also cause hair loss.

Moisturize.,
Use the right shampoo.,
Avoid processing your hair.,
Avoid brushing hair when it's wet.,
Protect your hair from the sun.",How to Prevent Hair Loss While on Accutane2," Accutane can cause your skin and hair to become extremely dry, and this can lead to hair that is brittle and breaks easily. In order to combat this, make sure to moisturize your hair and scalp regularly.Leave-in conditioners are great for adding moisture to dry hair. Try wrapping your hair in a warm towel to help the product soak in better.Look for conditioners and other hair care products that contain nourishing oils, like argan oil, avocado oil, or olive oil.You can also add moisture with hair masks made from everyday ingredients that you probably have in your kitchen right now. Egg yolks, honey, coconut oil, and olive oil are all great for treating dry hair., Be cautious of harsh ingredients in shampoos, like alkaline and alcohol, that might strip too much moisture from your hairYour hair may be much less oily while you are taking Accutane than it previously was, which may mean that you don't need to shampoo your hair as often. Shampooing your hair too often can worsen the dryness, so only shampoo it as often as necessary to keep it looking clean.
While many alcohols are bad for dry hair, Cetearyl alcohol, Cetyl alcohol, and Stearyl alcohol will actually help it retain moisture.Look for a shampoo that will help lower the Ph of your hair, as this will also help it retain moisture.Fragrance-free shampoos are a good choice for dry hair.Sulfates are not necessarily bad for your hair, but they are known to strip the oil from your hair. If your hair is excessively dry while you are taking Accutane, you may want to look for sulfate-free options., Chemical processes like hair dyes, perms, and bleaches cause the hair to become dry and brittle, as does excessive heat. This can worsen the hair loss you are experiencing while taking Accutane, so steer clear of these treatments while you are taking the medication., Brushing wet hair can cause it to break and split the ends, which makes it more brittle. Try gently running your fingers through your hair to detangle it while it is wet, and waiting to brush it until it is dry. If necessary, use a detangling product., Sun exposure can also worsen your dry hair, so you may want to try staying out of the sun while you are taking Accutane. If that's not possible, take care to protect your strands when you are outside on sunny days by wearing a hat or a scarf on your head."

Be aware of the limitations of the Ludwig Scale.,
Figure out which the of the three types of hair loss you fall into.,
Recognize the signs of advanced and frontal baldness.",How to Measure Hair Loss2," The Ludwig Scale is a scale for measuring the progression of hair loss in females. While it can be a useful tool for assessing and explaining your level of hair loss, it has some limitations.


The Ludwig Scale was made to address female baldness as the patterns of balding in females are often different than in males. Baldness is more a progressive thinning of hair in females. However, sometimes women's hair thins and recedes similar to men's hair, so the Ludwig Scale might not work., There are three types of baldness outlined by the Ludwig Scale.


Type I is marked by hair receding and thinning on the top of the head. It may be hard to notice at this stage, but you may notice a bigger white patch than usual when you part your hair. The frontal hairline usually does not recede at this stage.Type II is marked by thinning, shedding, and a general decrease in volume of the hair overall. Your center part will also continue to widen. Treatment may be necessary at this stage of hair loss.Type III is the most extreme type of female hair loss. Hair is so thin it may not cover the scalp and will be noticeable to most people. Hair will also continue to thin and lose moisture., Female hair loss is not confined to the Ludwig Scale. It can also be frontal and advanced.


Advanced baldness is rarely seen in patients, but it's marked by almost no hair being present on the crown or the top of the head.Some women experience a gradual receding of the hairline, much the same way as baldness occurs in male patients. If this is the case for you, ask a physician if you should use the Norwood/Hamilton Scale instead to measure your hair loss."

Use an online tool.,
Try non-invasive measures.,
Try semi-invasive and invasive procedures.,
Seek treatment.,
Recognize normal hair loss.",How to Measure Hair Loss3," If you're unsure which hair loss scale to use to measure your baldness, you can try using an online tool. Many websites have hair loss calculators that help you diagnose your level of baldness.


Usually, the tools will allow you to put in basic information such as your age and whether or not baldness runs in your family.The tool will also allow you to select your level of baldness, based on visual aids provided as well as multiple choice questions.The tool will give you a level of baldness and suggest treatment options. However, you should never undergo any hair loss treatment without first consulting your regular physician., A doctor can advise you on the best ways to measure your hair loss if standard scales do not work for you. Your doctor will probably go over non-invasive measures first.


Your doctor might have you take a daily questionnaire, where you choose answers from a series of multiple choice questions regarding your level of hair loss. While questionnaires are easy and non-invasive, they are highly subjective and may not provide you with an accurate measure of hair loss.Daily hair counts involve collecting strands of hair in a bag and counting them at the end of the day. Most people lose about 100 strands of hair a day and if you're losing more you may be at risk for baldness.In a standardized wash test, you refrain from shampooing your hair for five days and then shampoo and rinse your hair in a basin with the hole covered by gauze. You will collect the hairs and send them to your doctor for evaluation.Global photography involves photographing hair with special equipment at a doctor's office, equipped with lighting and magnification to assess hair loss. This is a more precise level of evaluating hair loss than other non-invasive measures., If your doctor think you're at a high risk for hair loss, she might recommend trying invasive or semi-invasive procedures to evaluate hair loss.


A hair pluck test, known medically as a trichogram, involves taking hairs from specific parts of the scalp after five days of using a specialized shampoo. The hair is then evaluated in a lab to assess the level of hair loss.A UAT exam involves marking a fixed area on the scalp with a fiber tip pen. Then, all the hairs within the line are evaluated individually with tweezers or other devices at a doctor's office. While this can provide an accurate measure of hair loss, it can also be quite painful.Scalp biopsies are usually used if your doctor suspects you may have a hair loss disorder like alopecia. The biopsy is usually performed under anesthesia, and a 4 millimeter bit of scalp is taken for examination., Once you've assessed your level of hair loss, make an appointment with your physician to discuss treatment options.


Minoxidil (Rogaine) is a foam you rub into your scalp twice a day to combat hair loss. It can be used by both men and women and can encourage hair growth or stop further hair loss. Side effects might include scalp itchiness, hair growth on the face, and rapid heart rate.Finasteride (Propecia) is a prescription drug, taken in pill form, available only to men. It is designed to slow hair loss. Side effects might include diminished sex drive or difficulty with sexual performance, although such side effects are rare.Hair loss surgery is sometimes recommended in extreme cases. Usually, plugs of skin from the back of the scalp are transported into the bald sections. Surgery can be painful, and scarring is a risk.Laser therapy is a somewhat new technique used to treat baldness in both men and women. The long term effect of this therapy is not known, but it has shown to reduce baldness in some patients., If your notice you've entered Stage One on either hair loss scales, this might be normal hair thinning and loss that comes with age. If you're in your 40s or 50s and there is not a history of baldness in your family, this is likely normal hair thinning that comes with age and probably does not warrant treatment.

Look for shampoos that fight hard water.,
Use a conditioner.,
Consider a leave in conditioner.",How to Prevent Hair Loss Due to Hard Water2," There are shampoos available that are specifically designed for hard water that can help you lower the chances of hair loss.A ""chelating"" or ""clarifying"" shampoo is a good choice. These shampoos are designed to tackle and prevent mineral build-up in your hair, but they are harsh so should be used sparingly.Look for a shampoo with the ingredient EDTA.
Only use this shampoo once a week.
Use a moisturising conditioner after you use this shampoo., It's always a good idea to use a conditioner after you wash your hair in hard water. This will help to prevent your hair drying out and becoming brittle, which can contribute to hair loss. Look for a conditioner with natural ingredients that will moisturise your hair.


Argon oil is an intensely moisturising ingredient to look out for.You can find conditioners especially designed for hard water areas.

, To condition your hair even more, you can use a leave in conditioner. This just means you lightly apply it to your hair after washing and let it soak in. Two or three drops of coconut or almond oil gently rubbed into the lower half of your hair will help you to lock in the moisture and prevent dryness.Don't apply more than this or you will end up with greasy hair.
The importance of having a good hair care regime to prevent hair loss is heightened by being in a hard water area.

Add vinegar to the water you use to rinse your hair.,
Try a lemon or lime juice rinse.,
Use filtered water for the final rinse.,
Use rainwater to wash your hair.",How to Prevent Hair Loss Due to Hard Water3," Mix one tablespoon of white vinegar with three cups of water. Take a shower, shampooing your hair as normal. The vinegar can remove built-up minerals from hard water, as well increasing shine and body.When it is time to rinse the shampoo from your hair, use the water and vinegar mixture you created.


Carefully pour the concoction over your head, being sure to soak all strands of hair.Rinse it off after a couple of minutes.
Some people prefer to use apple cider vinegar., An alternative to vinegar, is a lemon or lime rinse. It works in a similar way to vinegar by breaking down residual salts and minerals in your hair. Lemon and lime juice also strips off excess oil, which makes it an especially good choice for those with greasier hair.Mix with the same measurements as the vinegar method, one tablespoon of lemon or lime juice to three cups of water.
After shampooing, massage this solution into your hair and your scalp.
Rinse it off after a couple of minutes., To cut down on your use of hard water, you could use some filtered water for the last rinse when you are washing your hair. You will need about a litre of water for this. Simply pour it over your head a little at a time to wash out the shampoo and conditioner.For a short-term option you could use bottled mineral or spring water.
Using bottled water regularly would get expensive and wouldn't be environmentally friendly.

, Rainwater is also a good substitute to hard water when washing your hair, as it very soft and largely free of salts and minerals. Place a large bucket outside during rainfalls, collecting as much of the liquid as possible.When it is time to take a bath or shower, heat the water in batches in a large pot on the stove to medium heat, and use while bathing.


If you don't use the water straight away, it needs to be kept properly, with a secure lid.You shouldn't assume rainwater is safe to drink."

Try a procyanidin treatment.,
Use a rosemary treatment.,
Use cedarwood oil.,
Give yourself a scalp massage with other oils.",How to Prevent Hair Loss by Homeopathic Treatment2," Procyanindins are antioxidants found in plants like apples, grapes, blueberries, rosehips and green tea. Research in Japan has shown that when a paste containing concentrated amounts of procyanidins is applied to the scalp, it can increase hair growth in men who are balding by neutralizing free radicals that lead to inflammation and hair loss.You can order a tube of procyanidin treatment online. Apply a 0.7 percent solution to the scalp twice a day.
While no research has been conducted on the efficacy of this solution in treating women's hair loss, it is said that procyanidin might increase growth in women whose hair loss is hormone-related.

, Rosemary has been used to cure hair loss for centuries, and it's still an important homeopathic treatment. It helps to promote cell growth on the scalp and decrease the buildup of sebum that can clog hair follicles and prevent hair growth. In addition, rosemary is anti-inflammatory, so it relieves inflammation that leads to hair loss.


To receive the benefits of rosemary, grind fresh rosemary leaves and add a little water to create a paste. Apply the paste to your scalp and let it absorb into the skin for about 15 minutes before rinsing it away.
Alternatively, dilute 5 drops of rosemary essential oil in a tablespoon of jojoba or almond oil, and massage it into your scalp. Rinse it out after 15 minutes.
You can also ingest the rosemary in the form of tea. Place a few sprigs of fresh rosemary in a cup and pour boiling water over them. Let them steep in the water for 5 minutes, then remove the sprigs and drink the tea., Another anti-inflammatory substance, his essential oil is know to stimulate the scalp and promote hair growth. Dilute 5 drops of cedarwood oil in a tablespoon of jojoba or almond oil. Massage it into your scalp and let it sit and absorb into the skin for 15 minutes before rinsing it away., The very act of gently massaging your scalp with a beneficial oil can help promote hair growth. Massaging your scalp helps to slough away dead skin and unplug hair follicles that are clogged, stimulating new growth. You can add a few drops of rosemary or cedarwood essential oil to make the treatment even more effective. Give yourself a weekly head massage using one of the following oils:


Coconut oil
Argan oil

Deal with the underlying cause.,
Decompress to relieve stress.,
Lay off the chemicals.,
Don't use heat tools on your hair.,
Handle your hair gently.",How to Prevent Hair Loss by Homeopathic Treatment3," For men, male pattern baldness is the most common cause of hair loss, and for women, its alopecia, which causes gradual thinning. However, if you have a less common condition that's causing your hair loss, the best way to prevent further loss and foster regrowth is to receive treatment for that condition. Consult with your doctor if you suspect you might have one of the following conditions:



Hormonal fluctuations. This is a common cause of hair loss for pregnant and menopausal women, and it's often temporary. Using birth control can also lead to hormonal fluctuations.

Thyroid issues, such as hypothyroidism.

Scalp infection or skin disorder, such as ringworm or psoriasis.

Alopecia areata, a disorder in which the body's immune system attacks hair follicles.

Certain medications can also cause hair loss. Drugs used to treat cancer, depression, heart problems and high blood pressure might list hair loss as a side effect.

, Hair loss can be the result of a physical or mental shock to the system, and it can also happen if you're constantly feeling stressed. If you know yourself to be chronically stressed, either because you're dealing with something that's out of your control or you're just a high-stress person, do what you can to decrease the stress in your life.


Incorporate yoga, meditation, or nature walks into your routine. Research has shown that spending just 5 minutes a day in a park with trees can help relieve stress.Get regular exercise to help you decompress. Try jogging, biking, or just taking long walks to release endorphins and help your brain feel less weighed down.
Aim to get 7 to 8 hours of sleep per night. Having a sleep deficit leads to greater stress.

, Harsh chemicals found in shampoo, conditioner, hair spray, and hair dye can cause your hair to dry out and break more quickly. To slow hair loss, switch out your chemical-heavy products with natural shampoo (try making your own and hair spray or gel made with organic ingredients.


Commercially-produced shampoo often contains sulfates, an abrasive detergent that's also used in products like dishwashing detergent. It's too harsh to use on hair, especially hair that's in danger of falling out. Use a gentler, all-natural shampoo in its place.
Hair dye and bleach is hard on both your hair and your scalp. The same goes for chemical straightening products. Your best bet is to let your hair grow as its natural shade and texture. You can use henna dye as an organic alternative to chemical dye.

, Using a hair dryer, curling iron, straightener, and any other heat tools is damaging to hair. It can damage both the hair shaft and roots, making the hair fall out more quickly than it otherwise would. Try styling your hair without heat as an alternative. , Pulling, twisting, and rubbing your hair can damage the shaft and cause it to fall out faster. Handling your hair with more care will slow down the hair loss process. Make these simple changes to your routine to keep your hair growing strong:


Don't towel dry your hair vigorously; just pay it gently with a soft towel.
Never brush your hair when it's wet. Use a wide-tooth comb. To get tangles out, hold the hair halfway up the shaft and work from the bottom up, so you're not pulling on your scalp.
Don't wear tight hairstyles that will keep your hair pulled taut from your scalp. Wear it down and free as much as possible.

Allow yourself to gradually get used to your condition.,
Be aware of social stigmas.,
Communicate with people.,
Join a support group for hair loss.",How to Manage Hair Loss During Chemotherapy1," Losing your hair can be emotionally challenging. Accepting hair loss from chemo won’t happen overnight, in part because hair loss is often devastating for women and men. Keeping in mind that it is only temporary and a part of making you healthy again can help you embrace it more easily., For example, don’t wear a wig, hat, or scarf at night or one day a week. You can build up to never using an aid or only on occasions when it’s absolutely necessary.Give yourself daily positive affirmations such as “I am strong and beautiful and will beat this cancer—hair or no hair!” This can boost your confidence and may make it easier to accept your hair loss., Most people are kind, especially if they know you’re battling cancer. However, there are still some social stigmas attached to hair loss and cancer, such as robbing the person of privacy about their illness and lowering of status.These may cause you stress, anxiety, or embarrassment. Confronting negativity and your own feelings may help you get your feelings and focus on promoting your health.See a counselor or doctor to help you actively manage your feelings. Friends and loved ones can also provide you with support.

, It may be stressful thinking about how people will react to your hair loss. Letting friends, family members, and co-workers know about potential hair loss can help avoid uncomfortable questions or looks. This may help you be more at ease and able to focus on your health.Be open about your condition. Saying, “I’m undergoing chemo and it’s caused me to lose my hair” can dissolve tension or minimize unwelcome glances from other people.

Find a good hair stylist.,
Keep your hair shorter.,
Shave your head.,
Grow facial hair.,
Cover your head with a hat.,
Use a colored lotion or powder for your scalp.,
Use a hair piece.,
Get scalp micropigmentation.",How to Hide Baldness1," Getting the right hair cut can make your hair look thicker and obscure thinning spots. While barbers are a good option if you just want a short and simple cut, if you are balding, it will be worth it to go to a hair stylist. Although a stylist costs more, he or she will personalize your haircut to conceal your thinning hair and/or bald spots and will teach you how to style it.;
, If your hair is long, it will get weighed down, which will cause your hair to lay flat and lose volume. It will also separate, allowing your scalp to show through. Shorter hair (but not super short), on the other hand, provides more volume and a ""feathering"" effect, whereby one section of hair covers the edge of the next, so that your scalp does not show through.

, If you do not wish to deal with the upkeep of having a good haircut and/or volumizing your hair, another method to hide baldness or thinning hair is to shave your head completely. This seems counterintuitive, but it can work because it is deliberate. Bald heads are stylish, and people will not know if you shave your head because you like it or because you are losing your hair.


Use an electric razor to cut your hair as short as possible. Then use shaving cream and a razor blade to shave the stubble completely, like you would if you were shaving your face.
Shave your head regularly so that you do not have stubble. Otherwise, if you are balding enough that you only have hair on the sides, long stubble will signal that you are losing your hair.
Protect your head from the sun. Use sunscreen on your head every day, and wear a hat when in the sun to protect your head. Skin cancer can occur anywhere you have skin, even on your scalp.

, Bald or balding men can look very good with facial hair, and it will take attention away from the hair on your head. However, make sure you keep your facial hair short and well-groomed. A wild, unkempt beard will look strange in contrast with your short hair or shaved head, and it will look unprofessional in most workplaces.

, Wearing a hat or a bandana can hide baldness very effectively. Baseball caps are good for informal occasions, but fedoras and straw hats are also very stylish and work for a variety of settings. Wearing a hat also has the benefit of protecting your head from the sun. However, keep in mind that you may not be able to wear a head covering in all situations. Many houses of worship and workplaces require men to remove their hats when entering, and a bandana is too informal for formal settings, like work., Some companies make products that reduce the contrast between your hair and your scalp by coloring your scalp. This makes your skin blend with your hair so that your balding spots are less obvious. This is especially helpful for people with light-colored scalps and dark hair.


Follow the directions on the product to apply the lotion to your skin. Be sure to cover your scalp thoroughly, and allow to dry completely. Once dry, the lotion should stand up to sweat and rain. However, the lotion will rub off on your skin if you run your fingers through your hair, and it will transfer onto your pillowcase at night. The color will remain until you wash your hair.If you choose a powdered formula, be sure to rub the powder in well into your scalp. Cover all places where your scalp shows through your hair. The powder will also bond to your hair, making it appear fuller. Similar to lotion, this will last through wind, sweat, and rain, but it may transfer onto your clothes or pillowcase. It will last until you wash your hair., While toupees and hair pieces are less in fashion today than in previous decades, there are still some good options out there that will cover your baldness well. This works best for men who are not completely bald because the hair piece can be blended in with your natural hair.


Be sure to choose a high-quality hair piece made of real human hair that matches your hair color. Only real hair will look natural.You may also be able to get a customized hair mesh. This involves having human hair knotted into a mesh base. The mesh is then glued or clipped onto the head so that it appears as if the hair is growing from the scalp. The piece has to be cut well for a it to look natural. The mesh also has to be re-positioned when the glue or clips come undone and as the natural hair grows.Have your hair stylist help you touch up your hair piece on a regular basis. Bring it with you when you get a hair cut so that your stylist can incorporate it into your hairstyle.Keep your hairpiece clean, and be sure to adhere it to your head. If your hair piece falls off, that will defeat the purpose of having it.

, This similar to using colored scalp lotion or powder, only the results are permanent. This involves getting micro-tattooed dots all over the scalp. The process is tedious and may take several sittings to cover the entire scalp. Scalp micropigmentation runs the risk of looking harsh and fake if the color is not correct or if it is not done well, so seek out a reputable scalp micropigmentation specialist."

, Use a beautiful, large scarf to cover thinning hair or your scalp. This can keep you from losing body heat in cooler weather. It’s also a nice way to divert attention from your head that may stimulate conversation and boost your confidence.Consider investing in a turban if you don’t want to wrap scarves around your head every day.

Use a boar-bristle brush.,
Choose the right hair color.,
Cover your head with a hat, turban, or scarf.,
Get a wig or hair piece.",How to Hide Baldness2," Getting the right hair cut can make your hair look thicker and obscure thinning spots. It will be worth it to go to a hair stylist who will personalize your haircut to conceal your thinning hair and/or bald spots and will teach you how to style it. Ask your stylist to add layers to your hair instead of keeping it all one length. Layers create more volume and add fullness, which will hide thinning spots., These brushes are more gentle than synthetic brushes and will help prevent breakage, which is important for thinning hair. Boar-bristles also distribute the hair's natural oils throughout the hair shaft, keeping hair healthy and shiny. The healthier your hair, the less thin it will look., Changing your hair color so that there is less contrast between your hair and scalp will help conceal thinning hair. Go for a lighter shade if the color of your scalp is lighter. If you have a darker skin complexion, use a darker hair color shade, such as dark brown or black. While you can dye your hair yourself using home dye kits, if you have your hair stylist do your hair, you can have the dye customized to your skin color and thinning hair needs., Wearing a hat or a pretty scarf can hide baldness or thinning hair very effectively. There are many stylish hats for women, including fedoras and sun hats, and pretty scarves worn over the hair are also fashionable. Wearing a hat or scarf also has the benefit of protecting your head from the sun., Wigs are the best option when thinning hair around the temples or on the forehead becomes too visible or if you are completely bald. Wigs are a great way to increase self-esteem and feel more normal, especially for women whose hair loss is due to cancer treatments or other medical conditions.There are two types of wigs: full wigs that cover the entire scalp, and partial hair pieces that only cover certain spots. If you are completely bald or have very short, very thin hair, a wig made of human hair is your best option. You can have your stylist style it for you and show you how to wear it.

Volumize your hair.,
Use microfibers specifically created for thinning hair.,
Use Minoxidil.",How to Hide Baldness3," Flat hair will lay close to your scalp and will emphasize your bald spots because your hair will separate, and bald spots will shine through. Therefore, styling your hair to maximize volume will help your hair look thicker. Voluminous hair also appears more youthful.


Use a volumizing shampoo. Many shampoo brands offer volumizing formulas that prevent product-buildup, which can weigh down and flatten hair, and which contain ingredients that plump individual hair strands to make hair look fuller. Look for labels that say ""volume"" or ""volumizing"" on the shampoo bottle. After you wash with volumizing shampoo, the effects should last until your next wash.Use a blow dryer and round brush to dry your hair. Use a small amount of volumizing product in your hair. Then blow dry your hair, gently using a round brush to pull your hair up and away from your scalp. This will help your hair dry with fluffy volume and will make your hair appear thicker. Pulling your hair to one side while drying and then brushing it the opposite direction afterward also adds volume.Avoid using hair gel or heavy products that contain silicone. Gel causes hair to stick or clump together, which will cause your scalp to show through. Silicone weighs down hair, counteracting your attempts to get more volume. Stick with lighter products that specifically say they add volume, like texturizing sprays/lotions or mousse.

, Many companies produce colored microfibers that bond to your existing hair. These come in spray or in powdered form.This is the most convenient way to cover thinning hair.Shake or spray the fibers onto your hair. They are electrostatically charged, so they will bond with your hair shaft and make it look fuller.These products usually stand up to sweat, wind, and rain and will remain until your next shampoo.Make sure you choose a color that matches your hair or is slightly lighter. Darker microfibers and colors that do not match your skin tone will look artificial and will draw attention to your hair, which is not what you want., This is an FDA-approved topical treatment for hair regrowth, and many companies sell over-the-counter hair growth products that contain Minoxidil. Follow the directions on the product label, and use the product consistently for at least 8 weeks. Some people will see dramatic results with Minoxidil, while others may not.Products containing Minoxidil come in either lotion or foam form, and they are available without a prescription. Most pharmacies in the United States sell hair growth products that contain Minoxidil.Minoxidil takes time to work. Hair growth usually occurs after the medicine has been used for several months and lasts only as long as you continue to use it. Hair loss will begin again within a few months after you stop using Minoxidil.Minoxidil works best in younger patients with a short history of hair loss. The treatment has not been studied in people over the age of 65, so it may not work for age-related baldness.Follow all directions on the packaging of the Minoxidil product. Do not use more than directed or use a blow dryer to dry your hair immediately after applying the Minoxidil, as it may make the treatment less effective.Do not use Minoxidil if you are pregnant or breastfeeding."

Consider other serious diseases.",How to Make Your Scalp Stop Itching," The simplest cause of an itchy scalp is buildup of hair products and dead skin cells. Therefore, if you aren’t already doing so, begin by making sure you wash your hair at least every other day.Use the pads of your fingers (the soft fleshy part of your finger tip) and gently massage the shampoo into your scalp. Rinse the shampoo out thoroughly with warm, running water. Make sure the water is not too warm though, as this could dry out your scalp even more.
You can also use your fingers to “exfoliate” your scalp. When you are shampooing, reach your fingers all the way through your hair to your scalp and massage the skin. Make sure to do this all over your head, including the back. Don't scratch with your nails though, as this may worsen the irritation.;
, There are several shampoos on the market that are specially formulated to help deal with some of the causes of an itchy scalp. These shampoos may include one or more of the following active ingredients: coal tar, pyrithione zinc, salicylic acid, sulfur, selenium sulfide, and/or ketoconazole. Follow the directions on the bottle carefully, and if it tells you to leave it on your scalp for 5 minutes, then be sure and do so. This will give the product time to work.Remember that these shampoos will take time to become effective. Before giving up on a particular shampoo, give it a few weeks to really kick in. If it doesn’t work after that, try a shampoo with a different active ingredient, or visit your doctor.
Don’t use a medicated shampoo every day, though. These shampoos tend to be very strong, so you only need to use them once or twice a week. For your other washings, you can use a gentle every-day shampoo.

, If you believe that the source of your itchy scalp happens to be the weather, or that the skin on your head is just a bit dried out, try using a good conditioner. Conditioner is meant to moisturize, so be sure to use it after shampooing.Don’t forget to rinse the conditioner from your hair thoroughly. Use your fingers to help make sure the water is able to penetrate all of your hair.

, It is believed that spending time in the sun helps control the fungus on our skin that is thought to cause itchiness. Therefore, try to go outside and enjoy the outdoors for a half hour to an hour to help deal with any itchiness.

Be sure to use sunscreen on your exposed skin when heading outside!

, Sometimes, hair products or styling treatments can build up in the scalp and cause itchiness. Therefore, you should try leaving out a few hair products to see if it makes a difference. If leaving out one particular product seems to work, then you know what is causing the problem.

Try to be systematic about it. Start by skipping one hair product to see if it makes any difference. If it doesn’t, then start using it again, and leave out a different one.
Go easy on the heat styling, too. Applying heat can dry the skin on the scalp, so try avoiding heat styling products, such as the blow dryer, curling iron, and hair straightener.

, Many of the different causes of an itchy scalp are exacerbated by stress. If you can, take steps to reduce your stress levels.Take time out of your day to go for a walk, or to do something you enjoy. If you find yourself in a stressful situation, take a deep breath and remember that you will get through it.

, One of the best ways to deal with your itchy scalp, is to have a doctor figure out the cause of the itching. They will be able to tell you exactly what is causing your itchy scalp, and make recommendations for treatment.Your doctor may prescribe a prescription strength treatment to help soothe your itchy scalp.
In some cases, this will save you both time and money. If you are trying to treat your itchy scalp without knowing exactly what is causing it, you may purchase products you don’t need.

, One way to help with itchiness is to rinse the scalp with apple cider vinegar, which has anti-inflammatory properties.To do this, you will apply a mix of apple cider vinegar and water to your hair. You can repeat the treatment once or twice a week.


Begin by rinsing out your hair and scalp. Let it dry completely. In the meantime, mix equal parts vinegar and water together. If you use 1 cup of apple cider vinegar, then use 1 cup of water.
Apply the mixture to cotton balls and then press the cotton ball against your scalp. Massage the solution into the skin.
Wrap a towel around your head, and leave the solution on for 15–20 minutes. Then shampoo and rinse thoroughly.

, Tea tree oil is a natural anti-fungal, so it works great at treating an itchy scalp. However, it is quite potent so it needs to be diluted before applying it to your scalp. Mixing it with baby shampoo works great.Mix 10-20 drops into half a cup of baby shampoo, and shampoo as you normally would. Be sure to give special attention to your scalp, though. Don’t scratch with your nails. Instead, massage with your finger tips gently.
You can also mix 3 drops of tea tree oil into a tablespoon of vegetable oil and then massage the mixture onto your scalp. Repeat once or twice each week as needed.

, If you have an aloe vera plant, you can simply cut off one of its leaves, and squeeze out the “gel” inside. This is not only an anti-inflammatory, but it is also moisturizing. Apply the gel directly to your scalp, leave it on for 15-20 minutes, then wash out with a gentle shampoo.

If you don’t have an Aloe Vera plant, you can also use the aloe vera gel you buy in a bottle at the store.

, Coconut oil is also great for moisturizing the scalp, and is widely available in many grocery stores. You can either warm up the oil a bit (until it is liquid), dip your fingers in, and then massage your scalp with it, or you can use it at room temperature and massage the gel into your scalp.Leave the coconut oil on your scalp for at least 30 minutes (or even a few hours), and then wash out your hair with a gentle shampoo.
You can repeat this treatment 3 times a week.

, Another common cause of an itchy scalp is known as seborrhea. This can occur in other places on your body as well, but is most common on the scalp. The cause of this condition isn’t clear, but it is believed to be caused by a number of factors, such as your genetics, high stress levels, cold, dry weather, and an excess of yeast on the scalp.This is commonly confused with other skin conditions, so it’s good to have your doctor take a look at it if you want to be sure of what’s causing your itchy scalp.
""Cradle cap” is a type of seborrheic dermatitis that is common among babies and infants. It presents as crusty yellow or brown scales on the scalp.To treat cradle cap in infants, wash the scalp daily with warm water and a gentle baby shampoo. If it doesn't clear up, speak to your pediatrician about medicated shampoo before trying one yourself, as this could cause further irritation.For adults with seborrheic dermatitis, treatment includes corticosteroids, topical antifungal agents, and other topical agents with antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties.

, Dandruff is one of the most common causes of itchy skin on the scalp. It is unclear exactly what causes dandruff, but it has been linked to an excess of fungus that is normally present in the skin, known as malassezia.If you have dandruff, you will likely notice small yellow or white flakes on your shoulders, or on your fingers when you scratch your scalp.


Understand that dandruff is not necessarily a sign that you are dirty or unhygienic. Dandruff may be triggered by a lot of things, such as the weather outside and different hair styling products.
Treatment for dandruff includes antifungal shampoo with or without high potency steroids. Over-the-counter treatments include the use of selenium sulfide 2.5.%, zinc pyrithione 1 and 2%, coal tar, and salicylic acid.

, The term eczema doesn’t refer to a specific skin problem, but rather a group of different, but similar skin conditions. It is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease most common in babies and children, but adults can suffer from the condition as well. It typically presents as red patches on the skin that are very itchy.As with several of the others, the causes of eczema are not entirely clear, but it is believed to be an overreaction of the immune system to some type of irritant.
Stress and anxiety, bathing without moisturizing afterwards, dry skin, over heating of skin, and exposure to solvents and detergents may exacerbate the condition.
Treatment includes topically applied corticosteroids and emollients. Strength of the steroids used should be based upon body location, age, and degree of inflammation.

, Psoriasis can occur anywhere on the body, and usually appears as raised, reddish, scaly patches. Doctors aren’t sure what the cause of psoriasis is, but it may be related to an immune malfunction, which causes the body to create skin cells too quickly.Psoriasis is not contagious, though it could be a result of genetic influences.
Scratching the patches of affected skin on your scalp could cause the hair to fall out.
Treatment depends on the severity of the condition. Mild cases can be managed with topical treatment, while more severe cases may require phototherapy and prescription medication.

, This is a very contagious condition caused by tiny parasites that find their way into your hair. These tiny parasites live and lay their eggs on the scalp, and feed off of blood.While not typically harmful, they are very easily spread, and can be difficult to get rid of. If you find that you are suffering from lice, it is very important to treat the lice problem right away.
It is very important that you get all of the lice (including every single egg) on your scalp, and that you wash all bedding and towels that may have touched your head.
To treat lice you will need to use topical agents in addition to combing out the nits on your scalp.

, If you are suffering from Parkinson’s disease or HIV, you are more likely to suffer from an itchy, dry scalp.

However, remember that having a dry, itchy scalp doesn’t necessarily imply that you are suffering from something serious.

If you are concerned that you may be suffering from a more serious disease because you are suffering more severe symptoms (in addition to an itchy scalp), you should visit your doctor.

Change your diet.",How to Get Rid of Dandruff," Zinc pyrithione is an antibacterial and anti`fungal agent, so it can reduce any bacterial or fungal infection on your scalp that may be causing your dandruff due to seborrheic dermatitis.The Malassezia furfur fungi is thought to be partially responsible for dandruff in some people.As such, buy some from your local grocery store or pharmacy and use it instead of your regular shampoo.


The most common cause of dandruff is seborrheic dermatitis (or seborrhea), which usually occurs on the scalp, ears, face and upper torso.mid-chest, and mid-back.
Seborrhea produces itchy, reddish plaques on skin (scaling), which flakes off as dandruff.
Common zinc pyrithione shampoos include Head & Shoulders, Selsun Salon,Jason Dandruff Relief 2 in 1, and Neutrogena Daily Control Dandruff Shampoo.;
, Coal tar slows down the rate of decay the skin cells on your scalp undergo — it essentially prevents skin cells from dying and forming scaly plaques.Less plaque formation equates to less dandruff. The main downside to using shampoos with coal tar is they don't smell very good and cause painful irritation if you get some in your eyes.


Coal tar is actually a by-product from the process of manufacturing coal. It's considered effective for preventing dandruff caused by seborrheic dermatitis, eczema and psoriasis.
Remember that eczema is characterized by an itchy red rash, whereas psoriasis involves raised patches topped by silvery scales.
Commonly available shampoos that contain coal tar include Neutrogena T/Gel, Denorex Therapeutic Protection, and Scytera.

, Selenium sulfide is another compound that slows down the rate at which skin cells on your scalp die or ""turn over"", thereby reducing scaling and dandruff production. Although unlike coal tar, selenium sulfide is also an antifungal and thought to be able to combat malassezia fungi.As such, selenium sulfide shampoos are a little more versatile because they can treat a wider range of causes. The main downside to using these types of anti-dandruff shampoos is that they can discolor blond, gray, or chemically colored hair.In order to reduce the potential for hair discoloration, only use these shampoos strictly as instructed — don't leave them on your scalp for too long and thoroughly rinse your hair with water.
Shampoos that contain selenium sulfide as an ingredient include Selsun Blue, Dandrex, and Head & Shoulders Clinical Strength.

, Salicylic acid (the main medicinal ingredient in aspirin) is also capable of reducing scale and eliminating dandruff because it can soften dead skin, exfoliate your scalp and reduce inflammation. The main downside to salicylic acid is that it can dry out your scalp if its overused, which can actually trigger more dandruff and become counterproductive.To minimize the drying out effect of salicylic acid, use a scalp conditioner after shampooing.
Commonly available shampoos that contain salicylic acid acid include Ionil T and Neutrogena T/Sal.
Some salicylic acid shampoos also contain sulfur, such as Sebex and Sebulex. Be aware that these brands have stronger odors and may leave your hair smelling unpleasant.

, Ketoconazole is a powerful broad-spectrum antifungal agent that works well against most types of fungi and yeast. These types of shampoo are usually recommended or experimented with when the ones mentioned above are not effective — kind of a last resort treatment. They're available over-the-counter as well as by prescription, and tend to cost more than the other anti-dandruff shampoos.


Unlike most other anti-dandruff shampoos, products containing ketoconazole usually only need to be applied 2x per week at most.Commonly available shampoos that contain ketoconazole include Nizoral, Extina and Xolegel.

, While over-the-counter dandruff shampoos are usually effective, severe cases of dandruff may require a prescription-strength shampoo. Prescription shampoos don't contain any different ingredients than mentioned above, just a higher percentage, which makes them stronger. However, there's no scientific evidence that prescription anti-dandruff shampoos work better than common over-the-counter varieties.Ketoconazole is the compound most often used in prescription shampoos.
Your doctor can examine your scalp to determine the actual cause of your dandruff. You may need a referral to a skin specialist (dermatologist) for a diagnosis.
If your dandruff is caused by an inflammatory condition, such as psoriasis or eczema, your doctor may recommend and prescribe a lotion or cream containing a corticosteroid. Betamethasone is the most common steroid used for dandruff and is found in brands such as Bettamousse and Betnovate. These come in different strengths for different areas of your body (your scalp, for instance, can tolerate a higher strength steroid than the skin on your neck or face), so make sure you get the right one.

, Tea tree oil is a centuries-old antiseptic, antibiotic and antifungal that's derived from the Australian tea tree.If your dandruff is caused by any type of infection, than tea tree oil shampoos or other products may be very helpful. Scrub it into your scalp (being careful not to get it into your eyes), let the oil soak in for a few minutes, and then rinse well.


Tea tree oil has been known to cause allergic reactions in some people, so test it on yourself by rubbing a small amount onto the back of your hand. If your skin has no adverse reaction, you can proceed to use it on your scalp.
If tea tree oil proves too strong for you, try black or green tea instead (both are astringent and contain antioxidants). Boil dry tea leaves in water, strain, and let the tea cool before rinsing your scalp with it.

, Dandruff that's caused by an excessively dry scalp can be remedied with the use of coconut oil, olive oil or baby oil. Once in the shower, massage the oil into your scalp and let it sit and soak in for five to 10 minutes. Then rinse with water and lightly shampoo to get rid of any greasiness. The oils will provide a moisturizing effect and make your hair softer. Coconut oil is also a good antimicrobial that can kill bacteria and fungi.Consider massaging in the oil and leaving it overnight while your sleep. Wearing a protective shower cap will hep protect your pillow from stains.
You should avoid these treatments if you suspect that your dandruff is related to an excessively oily scalp.

, Plain yogurt without any added sugar is a good skin conditioner in general, so consider using it for your scalp if it feels itchy and/or inflamed.The live bacteria in yogurt and its alkaline nature can improve the health of your scalp and help combat any irritation. It will also make your hair feel softer and fuller. Rub yogurt into your scalp after washing your hair. Let it sit for 10–15 minutes before rinsing and rewashing with a small amount of shampoo.


Avoid yogurts with added sugar, flavorings and fruit. Instead, buy Greek yogurt, which tends to be thicker and more natural.
Real Greek yogurt has friendly strains of bacteria called probiotics. Applying these probiotics to skin may help reduce redness, itchiness and irritation.

, Sunlight can be beneficial for dandruff because it can stimulated the production of vitamin D in the skin and ultraviolet (UV) light can kill microorganisms such as fungi and bacteria.On the other hand, too much sun can lead to sunburn, which would eventually lead to more flakiness — so don't overdo it.


Start with spending a little more time outside each day without covering your head.Avoid sunbathing for too long because excessive amounts of UV radiation can damage your skin (scalp) and increase your risk of skin cancer.
While outside, you should wear sunscreen on your face and body to reduce the harmful effects of UV light.

, Dry skin (scalp) can be caused by lack of certain dietary nutrients, such as B vitamins, zinc and healthy fatty acidsDietary deficiency is increasingly more common in the United States and may be related to many different skin conditions and other diseases.


Foods with high levels of zinc include oysters, shellfish, red meat, poultry, eggs, pork, dairy products and most edible seeds.
Foods high in B vitamins include clams, oysters, mussels, liver, fish, beef, cheese and eggs.
Healthy fatty acids can be obtained from fish oils, flaxseed and many types of nuts.
In addition to vitamins and minerals, getting enough water is important too. Dry skin and flakiness is a common sign of dehydration. Aim for eight 8-ounce glasses of purified water each day.

Be aware that certain disease developed in adulthood can lead to an abnormal heart murmur.",How to Cope with a Heart Murmur," This means avoiding processed food, fried food, fast food, red meat with fat residue, sausage and bacon, French fries, butter and whole dairy products.These are all sources of harmful fats that can lead to unhealthy weight gain, a decrease in the velocity of your blood circulation, and an increase in the risk of developing other serious diseases such as atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, heart failure and stroke.;
, This means cooking with vegetable oils like sesame and olive oils and eating more raw nuts and flaxseed.Rather than reach for the standard loaf of white bread or bag of white rice, go for whole grain products such as barley and oatmeal, which are rich in vitamins, omega 3 acids and fibers. This will help to maintain your blood pressure and cholesterol levels, along with your sugar levels as these foods don’t contain white flour or a high carbohydrate index.
Whole grains such as brown rice or whole wheat pasta are good substitutes and you can include whole wheat flour in desserts such as muffins or pies.
Replace fatty meat with seafood and lean meat, and replace whole milk or dairy products with skimmed dairy products.
You can also increase your protein intake by eating other, healthier protein sources such as legumes, beans and peas.

, They are excellent sources of vitamins, minerals, and natural anti oxidants that will boost your immune system and your overall health. They will also provide adequate amounts of different vitamins such as A, B, D, E, or C, along with calcium, iron, magnesium and other minerals that will help to form healthy red blood cells. This diet will help to improve any anemia problems, and keep your vascular system in a good health to avoid any blood pressure problems.Eating fruits and vegetables will also help you maintain your blood pressure, sugar and cholesterol within normal levels and reap the benefits of the low fats and calories and high fiber content found in these foods, thereby preventing the development of any other cardiac disorders.
Avoid canned fruits and fruits preserved in sugary syrup as they contain high levels of sugar.

, Too much sodium can lead to hypertension or other related health problems like renal, cardiac disorders, or high cholesterol. Be aware of hidden sources of salt and avoid them, such as canned, processed food, and soy sauce., This will increase your metabolism and help you maintain a healthy weight.Try not to have a meal right before bedtime, or two to three hours before you go to sleep. Eating right before sleeping will cause all the fats consumed to sit in your body and not be burned or metabolized, as you are not doing any activities to burn or get rid of them. This will also lead to an increase in your weight, blood, cholesterol and sugar levels to possibly dangerous levels.

, These unhealthy habits can have a negative effect on your vascular system and narrow the lumen of your arteries. This will then elevate your blood pressure and put more pressure on your heart to pump and circulate blood efficiently., Performing exercise consistently will decrease your body weight, expel any stress or exhaustion and help to clarify your mind and refresh your body. Regular exercise will also help to regulate your blood pressure levels, and will return them to normal levels. Exercise will also regulate your sugar and cholesterol levels, which also helps to keep your vascular system and your heart healthy.Start with light training such as aerobics and stick to a program you can perform three times a week. Gradually increase this exercise program so that eventually you are exercising every day. Other activities like walking, jogging, cycling, dancing or swimming will also benefit your health.
You can also join a recreational basketball or volleyball team or take up tennis or squash. Yoga is a great way to improve your heart rate and overall health. It is also accessible to all ages and levels of health, with poses you can learn easily on your own, or in a class with the supervision of a yoga instructor.

, Your doctor should continue to check your heart’s rhythm and sounds and evaluate your medical condition along with your lifestyle changes as well as any medication you are taking for your condition to note any improvements or shifts in your body. They should also monitor your blood, sugar and cholesterol levels.Record your daily blood pressure readings in a log or journal to track your progress or any changes. Ask your doctor to look at them to ensure that they are within a normal range.

, In general, doctors do not recommend treatment for heart murmurs as they are not considered an actual disease. Innocent murmurs do not require medical treatment at all as they will not affect or interfere with your daily routine. Instead, your doctor will focus on a therapy for any other medical conditions that may provoke your murmurs, such as rheumatic fever, anemia or hyperthyroidism., Depending on the severity, grade, and location of your murmurs, and the type of heart defect you have (congenital or acquired), your doctor may prescribe a cardiac stimulant like Lanoxin (Digoxin). This medication is available as tablets or injections.Lanoxin stimulates the contraction of your heart by increasing the intracellular levels of calcium. This will help your heart to pump more blood to correct its rhythm, especially if you have a weakened heart muscle.
Lanoxin is usually taken once daily with a doctor’s prescription.

, Blood clots can form in blood circulation to your heart or around the valves of your heart. They are usually caused by a decrease in the blood’s velocity and may cause a stroke or heart attack.Examples of anti-coagulants include Coumadin 2 or 5 mg (Warfarin), Aspirin (Acetyl salicylic acid) or Plavix (Clopidogrel).
Plavix is given only once daily while Coumadin can be given twice daily.

, Excessive water can worsen your condition and even trigger other disorders such as hypertension or renal disorders.Aldactone 25 or 100 mg (Spironolactone) is a widely used potassium sparing diuretic with the ability to expel excess water and sodium from the body without affecting your potassium levels. Aldactone also blocks aldosterone; which is a hormone secreted due to hypertension and a need to retain more sodium and water.
Aldactone is given only once daily in the morning.

, Vasodilators such as Isoptin 80 mg or Verapamil 240 mg will do this. These drugs relax and dilate the peripheral vessels to reduce the peripheral resistance. They will also help the heart exert less stress while pumping.Calcium channel blockers such as Norvasc 5 or 10 mg (Amlodipine) are used to reduce the intracellular calcium levels. This will relax the arterial smooth muscles and reduce your blood pressure.

, Cordarone (Amiodarone) can be taken once daily to control your heart rhythm and ventricular arrhythmia. It reduces the peripheral resistance and slightly increases the heart’s cardiac output, resulting in a decrease in blood pressure and enhancing the heart functions., Catheterization is done by threading a catheter from your large groin artery to your heart.During open surgery, surgeons will replace a damaged valve or treat it, and in cases of septal defects, sew holes in the heart.
The surgical option will only be advised by your doctor or surgeon depending on the severity of your condition and if all other therapy solutions do not work.

, One way to cope with your heart murmur is to get an official diagnosis from your doctor. Your doctor will be able to hear any abnormal sounds with his stethoscope. Listening carefully, he may be able to determine their loudness level, location timing and repetition to evaluate whether they are harmless or abnormal., If your doctor suspects a heart murmur, he will refer you to a cardiologist or a pediatric cardiologist, if the patient is a child. A cardiologist is a specialized doctor in the cardiac diseases field.The cardiologist will use their stethoscope to grade the heart murmurs on a scale from one to six, one being very low and six being very high.
They will also look at the exact point at the heartbeat’s rhythm that the murmur is heard, its duration and whether it is heard more in the chest area or if it is affecting the neck veins too.
They will also note if any changes your body position or any slight physical activity affects the murmurs, causing them to sound louder or more obvious.

, They will check if your family has a history of heart disorders and any first signs or symptoms of heart problems that you or someone in your family has developed.


They will look at your medical profile and check for other underlying diseases that can result in a heart murmur such as rheumatic fever.

, This information will help them determine the murmur’s severity and grade it correctly.The cardiologist will also check for any symptoms appearing on your body, such as swelling at your legs, feet, or the facial area, any signs of skin discoloration at the extremities or at the lips. They may also look for abnormal or delayed growth in children as this may indicate heart issues.
Depending on your physical symptoms, the cardiologist will determine if your murmurs are innocent or abnormal. For abnormal sounds they will do further testing on your heart.

, This will give your doctor a clear picture of your chest area, lungs, heart and surrounding blood vessels. It will also show any enlargement of your heart to more than its usual size and any heart related problems that may be causing your murmurs., An electrocardiogram or “ECG” is done to give your doctor a chart of your heart’s electrical signals or your heart rhythm. They will check the electrical waves drawn on the chart to detect any abnormalities. Any wave abnormalities may indicate defects in the heart structure and function.An “ECG” is done by putting special electrodes on your chest. It does not hurt, although the gel that is used with the electrodes is often cold and you may feel some slight discomfort when the electrodes are removed.

, This procedure uses ultrasound waves to get a detailed image of your heart’s shape, size and the internal structures of the chambers and valves. This imagery is very helpful as your cardiologist can observe your heart while it is contracting and pumping blood to locate areas that are not functioning properly.This test should be performed at a resting state and during stress, or stress echo, where the patient is asked to perform some exercises to exert stress on the heart so it works and pumps faster. This may then reveal or provoke any signs of a heart problem.

, Beyond a loud or abnormal heart beat, your doctor will detect no other symptoms. In fact, this type of murmur will not cause harm to you or restrict your physical activities., Look for signs of cyanosis (bluish of the skin) on their extremities, their face or their lips due to a decrease in the heart’s ability to pump adequate blood. They may also be growing at an abnormal rate and you may have difficulties feeding them., You may also have increased sweating when doing even limited physical activity and constant dizziness or drowsiness., Patients suffering from heart valve defects are usually seen with palpitations or irregular heartbeats that can cause large neck veins. This is due to abnormalities as the heart beats and the decrease in its work out, which can cause an elevation in blood pressure. This will result in signs of hypertension like edema.Your doctor may also notice that you have an enlarged liver or hepatomegaly. An abnormal heart murmur will cause an increase in pressure in the inferior vena cava and the hepatic veins that carry blood from the liver, causing congestion and blood to be retained back at the liver, and its enlargement. , Your heart consists of four chambers and four valves. The two upper chambers are called atria and the lower chambers are called ventricles.


The right atrium collects the non oxygenated blood from the superior and inferior vena cava (two large veins) and pours the blood into the right ventricle through the Tricuspid valve.
The right ventricle then pushes the non oxygenated blood to the pulmonary artery where the blood moves into the lungs through the Pulmonary valve.
After making this gas exchange, the oxygenated blood returns back to the heart to the left atrium, which then transfers it to the left ventricle through the Mitral valve.
The left ventricle then pushes the oxygenated blood to the aorta artery and the blood moves to different body organs through the Aortic valve.

, They allow blood to be transferred in only one direction, preventing it from returning backward through any valves. The “lub-Dub” sound comes from the heart valves opening and closing.


When the two ventricles squeeze to contract, the Tricuspid and Mitral valves are both closed to allow the blood to enter into the pulmonary and aorta arteries respectively, and not to return back to the atriums. This process is called the “Systole” and is heard as the first “lub” sound in your heart beat.
When the two atriums squeeze to contract, the two ventricles are relaxed to receive the blood from them and the Pulmonary and Aortic valves both close. This process is called the “Diastole” and is heard as the second “Dub” sound in your heart beat.

, Innocent heart murmurs usually happen to a person with a healthy heart. The exact cause is not fully known, but one theory is that they can develop when the blood travels through your heart parts more rapidly or with a less smooth movement. Innocent murmurs do not indicate a problem in your heart, though they may persist for a while, or may last for the rest of your life with no detrimental restriction or limits to your physical activity.Harmless murmurs can be caused by physical activity, fever, hyperthyroidism (excessive release of the thyroid hormone), or anemia (less amount of red blood cells “RBCs” to carry oxygen to tissues). All of these conditions can cause your heart rate to speed up, or alter the volume of your blood circulation.
Innocent heart murmurs can also develop during pregnancy. The blood circulation in a pregnant woman is bigger than normal in order to deliver adequate nutrition and oxygen to the fetus.

, This type of murmur can be congenital (from birth), due to abnormalities or defects at certain sites in the heart structure. Several conditions result in an abnormal heart murmur, including:Septal defects, which are holes in the septum wall separating the right side from the left side of the heart. You may have atrial septal defects that are between the two atriums or ventricular septal defects that are between the two ventricles. This defect is congenital and can cause an alteration in the velocity or direction of blood, resulting in heart murmur sounds.
You may have been born with valve abnormalities, such as stenosis to the valves, which can decrease the amount of the blood due to their narrowing. You may also have valve regurgitation, which means that valves can’t totally close, causing the escape of some blood through the valves.
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the enlargement and thickening of the left ventricle muscles. This can decrease the heart’s blood velocity and pumping speed into the aorta, resulting in a blockage. This also harms the mitral valve by putting extra pressure on it that may cause some blood to escape backwards. This also puts extra pressure on the heart muscles to contract and to be able to push blood properly.

, These disease or conditions include:Rheumatic fever, which is an acquired disease from an untreated sore throat or a strep infection. The incomplete cure from a strep infection can affect the heart valves, causing scarring and affecting normal blood flow, which will lead to murmur sounds.
Endocarditis, a condition usually seen in patients suffering from a heart defect. This condition is caused by the inflammation of the inner myocardium muscles and valves due to the spread of bacteria from other sites in your body through the blood circulation. The original heart defect can cause blood clots near the heart valves. These clots can then cause the bacteria to multiply, leading to inflammation that can become a life threatening case.

See a doctor.,
Try minoxidil.,
Consider taking finasteride.,
Look into implants.,
Find out about laser therapy.,
Wear a wig or hairpiece while you seek treatment.",How to Help Your Hair Grow Faster when You Have a Bald Spot5," If making changes to your diet and lifestyle or using other remedies does not seem to help, then see your doctor. It is also a good idea to see your doctor to rule out the chance of a serious medical condition.Your odds of having a condition like lupus are low, but hair loss can be a symptom of this disease, so it may ease your mind to consult your doctor for possible testing.
If the reason for your hair loss is known but it is causing you stress, talking to your doctor can be of benefit as well. Establishing the specifics of your particular condition can help your doctor to determine the best treatment options available.

, Minoxidil (known by the brand name Rogaine, but now widely available without prescription) is a topical lotion that can be used by men and women. It works better on thinning hair than on hairless spots, and must be used continuously in order to keep any beneficial effects going.Minoxidil has about a 35% success rate at stimulating hair growth.
Men and women can use minoxidil.

, Finasteride (known as Propecia) is a prescription pill that stops the conversion of testosterone into DHT, which is a major cause of male pattern baldness. It works best on thinning hair, and must be used continuously to keep up any hair regrowth.Finasteride has about a 66% success rate, but it should only be used by men.
Finasteride can cause birth defects, so women who are or may become pregnant should never use or handle the medication.

, In addition to medications, surgical options have improved as well. Hair plugs or skin graft surgeries may be an option for you. With this procedure, small portions of skin from the back of your head (with hair still growing on them) will be implanted onto your bald spots.Talk to your doctor if you think that this might be a good option for you.

, Low-power laser therapy treatments have shown some early promise as well.Low-powered laser therapy has been shown to increase hair thickness and improve the condition of those suffering from hair loss. Ask your doctor if this option might help with your condition.

, Hair loss can make you feel self-conscious and affect your confidence, so you may want to look into getting a wig or hairpiece while you seek treatment for hair loss. You insurance may even cover the cost of a wig or hairpiece, which will allow you to get a high-quality, realistic looking wig or hairpiece."

Apply warm mineral oil.,
Leave the oil in for several hours.,
Wash the oil off with shampoo or a mild detergent.,
Use medications overnight.",How to Get Rid of Dandruff Fast2," Warm a small bowl of oil and massage it into your scalp.The oil will help moisturize your scalp and reduce flaking. If you want to use a natural oil, 5% tea tree oil has been shown to help in studies. Pure olive oil and pure peanut oil are sometimes recommended instead, but their use is controversial since they may provide food for dandruff-causing fungus.


Rumors about the harmful effects of mineral oil, such as it containing toxins or clogs your pores, are probably unfounded, as long as you use pure mineral oil sold as a skin care product. Products that make claims to relieve dandruff are tested by the FDA and would not be allowed to be on the market if they were harmful or contained toxins.Gently warm the oil. Do not heat it too hot to handle, especially not to smoking temperatures.

, While this treatment may reduce dense dandruff faster than a single anti-dandruff shampoo application, it will be more effective if you leave the oil in for several hours. A shower cap may be handy to keep your hair clean during this time. , Water alone will likely be ineffective at removing the oil. Instead, remove the oil with several applications of shampoo. If this is not enough to remove the oil, try leaving conditioner on your hair for 10 minutes, then rinsing out. A small amount of liquid dish soap can be used as a last resort, but it may damage or dry out your hair.


A tar-based shampoo may also work, and will also help remove additional dandruff, but many people find this substance unpleasant due to its smell and ability to stain., Many oil treatments and long-term care shampoos can also be effective at reducing dandruff if left in for eight hours, typically overnight. Look for an anti-dandruff shampoo that contains both coal tar and keratolytics. If it does not advertise keratolytics, or substances which dissolve dead skin cells, look for urea, salicylic acid, or sulfur in the ingredients list.


Find a well-fitting shower cap before you apply these, if you intend to sleep with them in your hair."
"
Select an anti-dandruff shampoo for mild dandruff.,
Find a shampoo for severe dandruff.,
Use the shampoo.,
Reduce shampooing frequency as condition improves.",How to Get Rid of Dandruff Fast3," There are many different substances that can treat dandruff. For mild dandruff without much inflammation or itching, look for shampoos containing salicylic acid or urea, which break apart dead skin cells. Because there is a chance of drying out the scalp and causing even more dandruff, it is recommended to use it in combination with a moisturizing conditioner to neutralize the side effect., If your flakes are thick, white, and found on the scalp (either alone or in addition to the hair), your problem is likely caused by a species of yeast-like fungus called malassezia.Malassezia is a skin surface yeast that has been targeted as a contributing cause of dandruff in people. This yeast may also have a role in affecting immune systems. For these more severe cases, find a shampoo that lists ketaconozole (at least 1% strength) or ciclopirox in its ingredients. Selenium sulfide (at least 1%) is also effective, but users often dislike the oils it causes to build up on their scalp.


A doctor can prescribe you stronger shampoos than are available over the counter, including 2% ketaconozole anti-fungal shampoo. This is most often prescribed as a foam/shampoo to be used twice a week for initial dandruff relief. After that, it is recommended to be used once a week or every other week.You can also be prescribed a shampoo with 1% ciclopirox , which can be applied twice every week.If you have black, coarse hair, which may dry out excessively from daily shampoo application, consider a topical steroid ointment instead such as fluocinolone acetonide.This can be applied as a pomade to dry hair.

, To apply the shampoo, wet your hair, then massage the dandruff shampoo into your scalp. Let it sit in your hair for five to 10 minutes before rinsing it out. Use your anti-dandruff shampoo once a day, until the flaking, itching, and inflammation is less severe.


If you notice no improvement after a few days of using anti-dandruff shampoo, try a shampoo with a different ingredient. Since dandruff is often caused by a species of yeast, an antifungal shampoo may attack the problem from a different direction.Some people report success when alternating between two shampoos, using each one every other hair-washing session., Once you notice a significant improvement, reduce anti-dandruff shampoo use to two to three times per week, or even less if you can keep your dandruff to an acceptable level. Once the severe flaking is removed, there is typically no need to continue applying every day.


If you are using prescription-strength shampoo, or more than one type of treatment, reduce frequency or stop use after two weeks, or harmful side effects may develop."
"
Stop using hair care products.,
Increase the frequency of shampooing.,
Get more sun.,
Discuss treatment with your doctor.",How to Get Rid of Dandruff Fast4," If the dandruff flakes are thin, translucent, and found only on the hair but not the scalp, they are likely a reaction to hair styling products. Look to see if your hair products contain Paraphenylenediamine, an ingredient that often causes dandruff issues. Also look for products with alcohol and harsh chemicals use in hair dye. These issues can also be caused by using too many products with separate ingredients.This type of scalp issue can be treated by eliminating or switching hair styling products and washing your hair more frequently.If you aren't sure which one is causing the issue, eliminate one at a time until you find the culprit.

, Seborrheic dermatitis, which is a condition that causes irritated, oily scalp skin, can be made worse by the oils from your hair and pores. Frequent shampooing will help to remove irritants and keep your scalp free of dandruff buildup.


Even a quick shampoo and rinse before going out can do wonders for your dandruff.

, Exposing your scalp to moderate doses of sunlight may be helpful. The ultraviolet rays may be helpful in reducing the amount of flakes in your skin. However, increased exposure to the sun is harmful for your skin, so don't lay out in the sun or stay out in the sun for too long. Instead, apply sunscreen before you go out and just spend a little time getting some sun on your scalp., If you are not satisfied with the level of dandruff you have after a few weeks of self-treatment, consult a doctor. Dandruff rarely causes physical problems, but if you would like to get rid of it for personal reasons, a doctor may prescribe stronger medication. He or she may also recommend additional steroid treatment to reduce inflammation and itching as well.


For severe cases, isotretinoin may be prescribed, but as this can have severe side effects, it is only recommended as a last resort."

Wash your hair regularly, but not obsessively.,
Give your dandruff shampoo time to work.,
To help prevent dandruff, brush your hair after you shower and shampoo.,
Avoid stress and stressful situations.",How to Get Rid of Dandruff (Natural Methods)4," Dandruff is caused when your scalp sheds dead skin cells. It is not caused by hair itself.


The Mayo Clinic recommends washing your hair every day with a dandruff shampoo until the flakes subside, and then continuing to wash your hair with the anti-dandruff shampoo 2-3 times per week.Excessive shampooing, especially with harsher chemicals, such as lauryl sulfate, can irritate the scalp and dry it out, causing more dandruff.

, If you choose to wash your hair with dandruff shampoo, leave the shampoo in for at least 5 minutes before you wash it off. This will give the shampoo time to work.

, Brushing your hair will help distribute the oil that is naturally occurring in your scalp and hair over the entire surface of your head.Starting at your scalp, brush outward to help distribute oil from the scalp along your entire head.

, Stress can cause dandruff, so try to exercise your stress away or deal with your stress in other healthy, effective ways.


Eat healthily. What you put into your body has an impact on what your body responds with. An excess of unhealthy foods (fast food, sugary foods, etc.) will often result in skin, scalp and hair problems.
Foods rich in zinc and vitamin B6 are particularly important for maintaining healthy hair and scalp.

Find your pulse.,
Count the beats.,
Analyze the results.",How to Check Your Heart Rate1," Place two fingers (your index and middle fingers) on your neck in the space between your windpipe on the front and the big muscle on the side of your neck, called the sternocleidomastoid. This is your carotid artery, and it is usually the easiest place to check your heart beat. Press lightly until you feel a pulse.Alternatively, you can place two fingers on the outer part of your inner wrist, just under where your thumb and palm curve into your wrist. This is called your radial pulse, which may be fainter or more difficult to find.
You can also find your pulse by placing two fingers on the side of your wrist below your pinky finger. This is called your ulnar pulse and is usually even more faint than the radial.;
, With your index and middle fingers pressed gently against your pulse, use a stopwatch or clock to count the beats you feel in 60 seconds. Since heart rates are calculated in beats per minute, you’ll need to know how many of your own beats you feel in one minute’s time.Make sure that you are sitting still while counting because strenuous activity can cause your heart rate to rise and give you an inaccurate reading.
You can also count the beats that occur in 30 seconds and multiply by two, count the beats in 20 seconds and multiply by three, or count the beats that occur in 15 seconds and multiply by four. However, these methods aren’t quite as accurate as counting the beats for a full minute.

, For a normal adult, including seniors, the average resting heart rate falls somewhere between 60 and 100 beats per minute. If your resting heart rate is consistently above 100 beats/minute, you may want to contact your doctor.If your resting heart rate is usually under 60 (and you are not a trained athlete), you should consider consulting with your doctor – especially if you ever feel faint, dizzy, or short of breath.For children under the age of ten, the average heart rate is around 75-115 beats per minute.

Avoid temporarily raising your blood pressure.,
Learn to use a blood pressure cuff.,
Secure the cuff on your arm.,
Inflate the cuff.,
Deflate the cuff and listen.,
Take the reading.",How to Check Your Blood Pressure1," When you check your blood pressure, there are quite a few factors that can cause your numbers to temporarily rise. Things like stress, smoking, and caffeine can make your blood pressure rise right before a reading. It’s best to avoid these things for at least twenty minutes before you plan to check your blood pressure.Other elements can also cause a temporary increase in your blood pressure, such as exercise, cold temperatures, a full bladder, a full stomach, or certain medications.;
, If you want to check your blood pressure at home using a manual pump cuff monitor, you’ll need to purchase one and familiarize yourself with it. Most cuff monitors consist of the cuff with a center arrow for proper positioning that wraps around your arm, a gauge that indicates the BP reading, a rubber tube that connects the gauge to the cuff, and a bulb that you squeeze to inflate the cuff.You should be able to purchase one at a pharmacy or medical supply store.

, Remove any clothing items that cover your upper arms and wrap the cuff around your arm, placing it at the main artery. Find this artery by tracing a line from your pinky finger to just above your elbow. Center the cuff’s arrow with this artery. Make sure your arm is supported and your palm is face-up, otherwise your blood pressure monitor may show an incorrect reading. With the cuff fully deflated, fasten the cuff snugly around your arm with the Velcro strap.The stethoscope head should be placed over the main artery in your arm at the inner bend of your elbow.

, Use the manual hand pump to inflate the cuff while it is securely in place on your upper arm. Squeezing the hand pump will send air into the cuff and cause it to inflate. You may have to squeeze the pump quite a few times.Keep inflating the cuff until the gauge reads approximately 30 points (mm Hg) higher than your expected systolic pressure number (the top number).
Be sure to keep your cuffed arm level and parallel with the ground during the entire inflation and reading process.

, As you start deflating the cuff, listen for the heartbeat with the stethoscope at the main artery. As you are listening, slowly deflate the cuff with arrow on the gauge going down at about 2-3 mm of mercury per second by turning the air release valve counterclockwise.Try to turn the valve very slowly, otherwise it could ruin your entire reading and make you start over again.
Keep your eyes on the gauge while you deflate the cuff.

, Once you hear the first beat, note the number on the gauge; this is your systolic number. Continue to listen until the heartbeat disappears. Note the point at which you can no longer hear any heartbeat, this is your diastolic pressure number.Keep consistently deflating the cuff as you listen for these two points.
Once you acquire the systolic and diastolic readings, deflate the cuff completely and remove it from your arm, as continuous cuff inflation can result in numbness and tingling in the arm

Eye glasses (Bring your glasses with you so you can put them on after the procedure.)
Body piercings on your abdomen or chest. Tell your doctor that you have them so she is aware., Before your appointment, you should tell your doctor exactly what medications you take, when you take them, and how much you take. This includes vitamins, herbal remedies, supplements, and over-the-counter medications. Bring a list of your medications with you or take the original pill bottles so the doctor can see the prescriptions.If you are on medications that thin your blood or act as anticoagulants, your doctor might ask you not to take them before the procedure. This may include some over-the-counter medications like aspirin.
Tell your doctor about any allergies you may have. This includes allergies to any medications, latex, tape, anesthesia, contrast dyes, iodine, or shellfish., Your doctor will probably tell you when and how much you can eat or drink in the 24 hours before the procedure. It is important that you follow the instructions exactly because a full stomach can cause problems for the anesthesiologist.Your doctor will probably tell you not to eat or drink anything for the 8 hours leading up to the procedure.
Take only the medications that your doctor tells you to take. You may be able to wash pills down with a sip of water. Do not stop taking your medications unless your doctor tells you to.

, If you are sick, even with a minor illness like a cold or flu, this burdens your immune system and makes it easier for you to develop complications. If you wake up the morning of your procedure with a fever, cough, drippy nose, or any other symptoms, notify your doctor immediately.Wash your hands after you shake hands with people and before you eat. This will reduce the likelihood that you expose yourself to pathogens carried by others.
Don’t go near, hug, or shake hands with people who have the flu or a cold.
Avoid being in small confined spaces with lots of people. These are excellent opportunities for pathogen exchange. This may mean not taking public transportation such as the bus or subway.

, Stress causes hormonal and physiological changes in your body which, over time, can weaken your immune system. By easing stress and anxiety before the procedure, you can help ensure that your immune system will remain strong. You can reduce stress by:


Learning as much as possible about your procedure. Your doctor and the hospital can provide you with information. Many hospitals even have booklets of information that they provide and make freely available online. Ask your doctor or hospital if such information is available. If so, it will help you understand the procedure and what you need to do before an afterwards.
Trying relaxation methods. These techniques are designed to help you control your thoughts, emotions, and physical responses to stress. Many people get relief from deep breathing, meditation, visualizing calming images, and progressively tensing and relaxing the different muscle groups throughout your body.Asking your doctor before you start any new exercise regimes. Your doctor may have advice on how you can do it safely. It is extremely important to talk to your doctor because depending on what your health condition is like, the doctor may feel that strenuous exercise is not safe for you. If your doctor gives you the go ahead, you might try taking walks or doing yoga.

, This is sometimes recommended before heart procedures. It lowers the chances of an untreated oral infection seeping bacteria into your blood stream, and from there, infecting your heart. Tell your doctor:What dental work you need to have done and when it is scheduled for
If you have any untreated oral infections

, Smoking damages your heart and makes you prone to infections, including serious lung infections. It also raises your risks of complications arising from:Smoking cessation is one of the most important behavioral modifications one can do to help towards being healthy.


Blood clots
Breathing difficulties

, This may mean that you need medical intervention immediately to treat the infection or prevent you from losing too much blood. Signs to watch for include:Sudden, extreme swelling at the site where the catheter entered your body. It is important that an active infection get treated quickly to prevent it from spreading to your heart and other vital organs.
Bleeding that does not stop. If lying down and pressing on the wound for several minutes does not cause the wound to clot and stop bleeding, get immediate medical attention. The emergency medical responders will be able to help you stop the bleeding.

, If you have the following signs you should speak to a doctor immediately. He may recommend that you have someone drive you to the emergency room. Any of the following symptoms indicate that your wound needs care:Numbness or tingling in the arm or leg where the catheter was inserted.
Increasing bruising. This would suggest that you might have bleeding under the skin.
Swelling or drainage at the site of the wound.
Fever.

, The doctor will probably want you to wash the site daily to prevent infections. You may have a bruise, slight swelling, pinkness, and / or a small lump about a half an inch in diameter at the place where the catheter was inserted. Your doctor may recommend:Changing the bandage daily. If you require more than a simple Band Aid, the nurse in the hospital will teach you how to do it before you are discharged.
Washing gently with soap and water. Do not scrub because this could open the wound.
Not putting any other medications, lotions, or ointments on the site unless instructed to do so by your doctor.

, You can help promote healing by keeping the wound clean and dry. In addition, there are several things you can do to reduce the likelihood of getting an infection or reopening the wound. The length of time your doctor wants you to remain quiet may depend upon your health condition and particular medical history. Your doctor may give you the following instructions:Do not take a bath, go in a Jacuzzi, or go swimming for at least seven days, or when your physician says it is okay.
Wear loose clothing that won’t rub the wound or catch on the scab.
Do not lift more than 10 pounds for seven days. This may mean that you need to abstain from doing housework or grocery shopping. You can thaw and eat frozen foods to prevent having to go grocery shopping.
Rest. You will probably feel tired. Take naps if you need to. Avoid doing strenuous sports like running, golfing, bowling, or playing tennis. Climb stairs carefully and slowly. If you feel bored, try quiet activities like handwork or reading a novel. Stay quiet for at least five days.
Avoid straining during bowel movements if your insertion site is in your groin. Straining your muscles in that area could cause the wound to reopen.
Drink eight to 10 glasses of water per day. This will keep you hydrated, promote healing, and help flush out any dyes that were used to take images of your body.

, It is important that you do not exhaust yourself by doing too much too soon. If you do, it may lower your immune system and make you more vulnerable to complications. Ask your doctor:When you can return to work
For how long you should abstain from sex
When you will be ready to drive. If you are otherwise in good health and healing proceeds as expected, it may be as soon as 24 hours.
If there are any changes to your medications. If your doctor has prescribed new medications or adjusted the doses of your usual medications, make sure you fully understand the instructions for when you should take them and how much.
Attend follow up appointments with your doctor as recommended.

Start the DASH diet.,
Reduce your sodium intake.,
Up your potassium, magnesium, and calcium levels.,
Work in the wonder foods.,
Switch out coffee for tea.",How to Control High Blood Pressure1," That stands for ""Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension"" diet, which is exactly what you should be looking for. It means piling on the whole foods/grains, fruits and veggies, low-fat dairy and skipping the sugar, saturated fat and cholesterol.


This diet has been shown to reduce blood pressure by up to 14 mm Hg.Basically, you'll be cutting out red meat, junk food, and white carbs (including ""white"" sugar, flour, noodles and potatoes,...). You don't have to go cold turkey, but the foods mentioned above should make up the vast majority of your diet.;
, Limit your sodium to about 2,300 milligrams (mg) per day.If you don't feel like you eat a ton of salt, it may just be an issue of not knowing what's in the food you eat. An easy way to cut out the salt is to skip on the processed foods; when you prepare your own food, you know just what goes into it. Start cooking!


Don't add salt to your foods! If that's an issue for you, start cutting back gradually. Believe it or not, your palate will adjust.

, These three nutrients have been linked to low levels of blood pressure in multiple studies.While calcium and magnesium aren't linked to technically lowering high blood pressure (like potassium is), they are linked to low blood pressure in general.


Potassium (the most potent of the three) is found in fruits, veggies, dairy, and fish.
Calcium is found in dairy products (go for the low-fat kind) and magnesium is found in whole grains, green leafy vegetables, nuts, and dry peas and beans.

For all three of these, if you have a healthy diet, you don't need to take a supplement. Having extra isn't beneficial to your system.



, There are a few foods on this planet that are practically miracle workers. For high blood pressure, those are garlic, dark chocolate, and fish oil. Not all at once, of course!


Fatty fish, like mackerel and salmon, contain those magical omega-3 fatty acids. However, taking a supplement is not recommended as having too much in your system may lead to unfortunate side effects. Just grill up some salmon a few times a week (with a bit of olive oil to keep it healthy)!Garlic can be used for everything from lowering blood pressure to eliminating ear aches. It's been linked to combating cancer and cholesterol, too! Just make sure what you're adding it to isn't pizza, creamy sauces, or fatty oils!Dark chocolate that's at least 70% cocoa can lower blood pressure, according to a recent study. Have just half an ounce daily to reap the benefits.Yum!

, We'll get to the caffeine argument in a bit, but for right now let's cover coffee's morning (and noon and night for some) counterpart, tea. Not only is there less caffeine in tea (which constricts blood vessels), but it can lower blood pressure on a permanent basis! What more reason do you need?


A recent study at Tufts University worked with Hibiscus tea. It lowered patients' levels by 7 points -- just like a medication! A lot of herbal teas have hibiscus in them, but look for ones that have it toward the top of the ingredient list for a more potent mix."

Consider other dietary changes if you have low blood pressure.",How to Check Blood Pressure with No Cuff," The first step in estimating your systolic blood pressure is to locate your pulse. Your pulse will give you basic information you need to estimate if your systolic blood pressure is relatively normal. Keep in mind this is a very rough estimate and really only tells you if your systolic blood pressure is not low — it doesn't indicate high blood pressure.


Take two fingers, preferably your index and middle fingers, and place them just below the wrist creases on the thumb side of your hand.
Don't use your thumb, as your thumb has a strong enough pulse to interfere with this process.;
, Once you’ve got your two fingers in the general area, see if you can feel your radial pulse – the shockwave generated by the beating of your heart. If you feel your pulse, this indicates that your systolic measurement is at least 80 mmHg, which is normal. This does not, however, give you any information as to whether or not your blood pressure is high. If you don’t feel your pulse, your systolic is likely below 80 mmHg, which is still normal.


The reason this indicates your blood pressure is at least 80 mmHg is because your radial artery (the artery in your wrist) is small and your blood pressure has to be at least 80 mmHg for a pulse to reach it.Not feeling your pulse does not indicate health problems.
Estimating your blood pressure without a cuff will give you no information about your diastolic pressure.
Some studies have questioned the efficacy of estimating systolic pressure using your pulse., You should recheck your pulse later in the day to get an idea of how your pulse increases after some activity. This will give you more information to determine whether your blood pressure is low, high, or normal.


If you don’t have a detectable pulse after moderate activity, there is a chance you could have low blood pressured.
Consult your doctor if you suspect any irregularities., While these apps are a great idea, the unfortunate news is that they do not work.It is considered a ""recreational"" medical device and is not a legitimate medical instrument that records your blood pressure. Do not use one of these apps and assume that the information provided is accurate or valid.


Researchers are currently pioneering new technology that will allow physicians to take your blood pressure without a cuff. However, this technology is still in development., Make sure to visit the appropriate app store for your phone and operating system. At the app store, you’ll find a wide range of mobile health-monitoring applications that offer many functions.


Type in “blood pressure monitor”
View the different results.
Pick a few, select them, and read user reviews. When reading reviews, focus on ease of use and people’s general happiness with the app. If users have rated the app with 3 stars or below, look for another., After you’ve read some reviews about a couple of apps, you need to select one and download it. In order to download the app:


Press the “download” button on your smartphone. This button may vary based on your operating system.
Be patient while the program downloads.
Download speeds may vary based on your internet connection speed. To increase the speed, make sure to connect your phone to a wireless network. This will also help you save potential fees associated with data usage., Now that you’ve downloaded the app, you need to click on the icon that represents it. That will open the app. You’ll then want to use the app to measure your blood pressure.


If the app offers more diagnostics than blood pressure, select the blood pressure diagnostic option.
Read the directions.
Make sure your index finger is covering the camera on the back of the phone. The application will use photoelectric pulse wave signal stability information to calculate your blood pressure. This technology essentially analyzes your pulse, heart rate, and other information to arrive at health statistics.
Hold your finger on the camera until the app tells you that its measurement is complete.
Record the results., Perhaps the most important thing you need to know when measuring your blood pressure are key target levels. Without knowing your target levels, blood pressure results won’t tell you anything.


120/80 and below are normal blood pressures for most people.
Between 120 – 139/80 – 89 indicates prehypertension. If you fall here, you should put more effort into adopting a healthy lifestyle.
Between 140 – 159/90 – 99 indicates stage 1 hypertension. If you fall here, you and your doctor need to consider a plan to lower your blood pressure. That plan may include medication.
160/100 or higher indicates stage 2 hypertension. If you fall here, you will almost certainly need to take blood pressure medication., Since cuffless technology is in its infancy, you should take a reading of your blood pressure with a cuff before you start taking readings at home without a cuff.


Have your blood pressure read at your annual or semi-annual physical.
Visit a drugstore or other location that has a blood pressure reading machine available for public use.
Compare any measurements you take at home with your baseline measurement.
Record your baseline measurements and home measurements so you have a record of your blood pressure over time., If you have any concerns about your blood pressure level, you should contact and consult your physician. Your physician will be able to make recommendations about how you can improve your blood pressure or treat high or low blood pressure.


If your blood pressure is high, your doctor will probably prescribe blood pressure lowering medication.
Your doctor may recommend a diet or exercise routine.

, One of the best ways to improve your blood pressure is to exercise regularly. By exercising regularly, you’ll improve your cardiovascular system and get your heart in better shape.


Focus on cardio activities like cycling, running, or power walking.
Make sure not to overexert yourself.
Consult your doctor before adopting any serious exercise regimen, especially if you have blood pressure problems., If you struggle with high blood pressure, you can make certain modifications to your diet to help.


Lower your sodium intake. Make sure to keep your sodium intake below 2,300 milligrams a day.
Eat six to eight servings a day of whole grains. Whole grains have a lot of fiber and can help lower your blood pressure.
Eat four to five servings of fruits and vegetables a day to lower your blood pressure.
Eliminate fatty meats and limit dairy consumption to lower your blood pressure.
For lower blood pressure, limit your sugar intake to five servings a week or less.

, Make a few adjustments to your diet to help raise your blood pressure into a healthy range.


Increase your sodium intake, if your blood pressure is low. Try to consume at least 2,000 milligrams of sodium per day.
Drink more water if your blood pressure is low."

Check your pulse at your radial artery.,
Take your pulse underneath your jaw.,
See a doctor if you detect any abnormalities in your resting heart rate.,
Calculate your maximum heart rate (HRMax).,
Use your pulse to determine when you are doing moderate exercise.,
Take your pulse to determine when you are doing vigorous exercise.,
Identify signs of elevated heart rate.,
Get serious about monitoring your heart rate with a heart rate monitor.",How to Calculate Your Heart Rate," This is one of the easiest places to measure your heartbeat because you have a large artery right below the skin. Each time your heartbeats, you will feel a pulse as the blood rushes through your artery.Hold out one arm, palm up. Gently press your index finger and middle fingers to the inside of your wrist between the bone and tendon near your radial artery.
This will be approximately one inch below your wrist on the same side as your thumb.
You should feel soft tissue beneath your fingers, not bone. You may need to move your fingers around or press slightly harder until you feel it.
Count the number of beats for 15 seconds and multiply by 4 to get the number of beats per minute. Use a clock to measure the 15 seconds rather than trying to simultaneously count your pulse and the seconds.;
, This is another location where you should be able to easily and quickly find a strong pulse.Put your index and middle finger to the left of your windpipe where your neck connects to the tissues underneath your jaw.
You should be able to feel your pulse on either side of your windpipe, but it might be easier to find on the left side. You may need to move your fingers around and press a little harder until you feel it.
Use a clock or stopwatch to keep track of 15 seconds, count the pulses you feel, and then multiply by four.
You should get about the same result when you measure your pulse at your wrist or your neck.

, Your resting heart rate is the number of beats per minute when you are inactive for at least five minutes; however, if you were exercising, it may take longer for your heart rate to slow down. A person’s resting heart rate naturally varies based on how active you are, how fit you are, how warm or cold it is, whether you are standing, sitting, or lying down, your emotional state, your body size and what medications you are on. Consult a doctor if:Your resting heart rate is usually over 100 beats per minute. This is called tachycardia.
Your resting heart rate is below 60 beats per minute, if you are not an athlete. This is bradycardia. Other symptoms that may accompany this condition include fainting, dizziness, or being out of breath. If you are an athlete, a low heartbeat may mean you are in good shape. However, it should not be below 40.Your heartbeat is irregular.

, HRMax is the theoretical maximum maximum speed at which your heart can beat. It varies with your age and is used to determine how fast your heart should be beating during exercise of differing levels of difficulty.Subtract your age from 220. For example, a 20 year old should have a maximum heart rate of about 200 beats per minute.
Some blood pressure medications may lower your maximum heart rate. If you are on blood pressure medications and using your heartbeat to monitor your exercise, contact your doctor to see how you should determine your maximum heart rate.
Consult with a doctor before starting any new exercise routine if you have a health condition, particularly high blood pressure, diabetes, or a heart condition.

, Moderate exercise for 2.5 hours per week should help your heart stay healthy. You are considered to be doing moderate exercise if:Your heart rate is 50-70% of your maximum heart rate. That means that a 20 year old with a maximum heart rate of 200 beats per minute should have a target heart rate of 100–140 beats per minute during moderate exercise.
You are dancing, hiking on the flat, biking slower than 10 miles per hour (mph) (16 km/hr), walking at about 3.5 mph (5.6 km/hr), downhill skiing, swimming, gardening, playing doubles in tennis, or playing golf. These activities should produce a heart rate that is 50–70% of your maximum heart rate. If they do not, you may need to push yourself a little harder.

, Doing vigorous exercise for 75 minutes per week or more will improve your heart’s health. You are considered to be doing vigorous exercise when:Your heart rate is 70–85% of your maximum heart rate. For a 20 year old, this would be 140–170 beats per minute during vigorous exercise.
You are walking at 4.5 mph (7.2 km/hr) or faster, biking at 10 mph (16km/hr), hiking uphill, walking up stairs, cross-country skiing, playing soccer, running, jumping rope, playing singles in tennis, playing basketball, or doing heavy yard work.

, If you don't have a monitor or want to stop and take measurements, familiarize yourself with the signs of an elevated heart rate. These include breathlessness or heavy rapid breathing, perspiration, and the inability to carry on a conversation.

, If you do not like calculating your pulse in your head while exercising, you can purchase a heart rate monitor or a fingertip pulse oximeter, which is a little more affordable.Wearable, strap on heart rate monitors are widely available on the internet or at sports stores. You can purchase them and wear them like wrist watches.
Most have an electrode that you put on your chest which sends information on your pulse to the monitor on your wrist. Look for one that is easy for you to use while you are exercising. Reading reviews online or talking to experts in sports stores will help you decide what is most practical for your particular sport.

Take your blood pressure.,
Take note of the diastolic number and the systolic number.,
Subtract your diastolic number from your systolic number to get your pulse pressure.,
Determine if your pulse pressure is at a safe range.,
Call a doctor if your pulse pressure is over 60 mmHg.,
Contact your physician if your pulse pressure is lower than 40 mmHg.",How to Calculate Pulse Pressure," Taking a traditional blood pressure measurement with a blood pressure cuff, stethoscope, and analog sphygmomanometer can take some practice and requires instruction and experience. Some people visit automated machines at their local pharmacy in order to get their blood pressure taken.


It can be quite difficult to take your own blood pressure if you are using the traditional method. If possible, get a someone to help and take your blood pressure for you.
When purchasing an at-home blood pressure monitor, make sure that the cuff (the part that goes around your arm) fits you appropriately, that you can read the monitor easily, and that it is affordable. Many insurance plans will help pay for blood pressure monitoring machines. Most of these machines are automated. You simply put on the cuff, hit start and wait for your results.Avoid sugars, caffeine, and excessive stress before taking your blood pressure. These three triggers will elevate your blood pressure and give you a false reading.
If you insist on taking your own blood pressure at home, do so three times in order to make sure that you are doing it right. Make sure that you are comfortably seated, relaxed, and have your arm at or near your heart level.If you notice that each reading is higher than the last, allow a little more time between readings.
It is important to note that most machines need to be calibrated. In order to know if a device is accurate, it should be checked at the doctor's office once per year and compared to their blood pressure monitor for accuracy.;
, Say 110/68 is your blood pressure reading. It is a good idea to record these numbers somewhere so you can keep track of your blood pressure fluctuations.


Since your blood pressure can fluctuate throughout the day, you'll want to take multiple readings at different times throughout the day (over the course of two to three weeks for the most accuracy) and average these readings.

, In this example, you’d subtract 68 from 110. Your pulse pressure would be 42., While people of different ages and sexes will have slightly different pulse pressures, the medical world has settled on a base scale.


40 mmHg- A pulse pressure of 40 is considered normal, but 40 to 60 is a relatively healthy range., A pulse pressure above 60 is considered to be a risk factor for cardiovascular events, such as stroke, and general cardiovascular issues like hypertension. A higher pulse pressure may mean your heart valves are not functioning properly to prevent backflow of blood and your heart may not be effectively pumping blood forward (valve regurgitation).It's important not to try to self-diagnose, however. Call your doctor to discuss your results and what they might mean.


A one-time reading over 60 mmHg may be to worry about. If this is a trend you notice over a few weeks, however, it's important to contact your doctor and set up an appointment.
Oftentimes emotional and physical stress, as well as pain, can cause significant increases in pulse pressure as well. Stress can cause significant increases in pulse pressure. , A pulse pressure below 40 may indicate poor functioning of your heart. Several conditions can cause this problem, including aortic regurgitation, heart failure, renal failure, diabetes mellitus and low levels of plasma sodium.You must speak with your physician to diagnose the cause, so call and set up an appointment to discuss your results.


Again, you want to make sure this is a trend and not an isolated, one-time reading under 40 mmHg.
Do not try to interpret or diagnose the results on your own. If you have a trend of blood pressure readings under 40 mmHg, then your physician must be consulted for further interpretation.

Wear a fitness tracker.,
Wear another kind of heart rate monitoring device.,
Make an appointment with your doctor.",How to Check Your Heart Rate2," An electronic fitness tracker (usually in the form of a watch that you wear on your wrist) can be an excellent way to track your heart rate. In addition to keeping track of your daily steps taken and activity levels, most of these trackers also keep record of your sleeping patterns, heart rate, and even allow you to log in your calories consumed.Each model of fitness tracker comes with a variety of features. Make sure the one you purchase has a heart rate feature before you buy it.
Some of the most popular fitness trackers with heart rate monitoring include the Fitbit Charge 2, the Garmin Vivosmart HR+, the TomTom Spark 3, and the Garmin Forerunner 35.

, There are a variety of heart rate monitors on the market. While the fitness trackers may be the most popular, they aren’t necessarily the most accurate. You can try a band that goes around your chest to monitor your heart rate for the highest levels of reliability.You can even consider arm band monitors, earphone monitors, and headband monitors.

, If you are concerned about your heart rate, the most accurate way to measure it is by letting a medical professional handle it. Make an appointment to see your doctor and tell them what symptoms you are experiencing that are causing you concern.Your doctor may check your heart rate with a stethoscope in your chest, using their fingers on your wrist, or by placing a finger sensor on the tip of your finger.

Watch for warning signs.,
Notice any irregularities.,
Monitor your heart rate over time.,
Get a diagnosis from your doctor.",How to Check Your Heart Rate3," Cardiac disease can be quite serious and alarming, which is why it is important to monitor your symptoms closely. If you notice any of these symptoms, contact your doctor or emergency medical services immediately (depending on the severity):Chest pain
Shortness of breath (for no apparent reason)
Back pain
Neck pain
Fluttering in your chest
Lightheadedness
Racing or unusually slow heartbeat
Fainting

, Any kind of irregularity in your heart rate or pulse is called an arrhythmia. If your heart rate speeds up for no reason, seems to skip a beat, or beats irregularly, you should contact your doctor to discuss the issue.Even if your heart beats quite fast – for example, at 100 beats per minute on average – this is still fine as long as this is normal for you. What you should be concerned about is any change or irregularity in your heart rate.
Stress, caffeine, alcohol and some medications such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors and others can affect your heart rate.

, Continue to monitor your heart rate over a long period of time so that you can begin to understand what is normal for you. Check your heart rate after exercising, while sleeping (with a fitness tracker), and while you are sitting/resting. Understanding how your own pulse typically functions in a variety of circumstances will help you notice anything out of the ordinary in the future.

You may want to consider keeping a heart rate journal so that you can document your heart rate at various times and refer back to it later.

, Your doctor will be able to tell you if there is any problem with your heart. If your doctor is concerned, they may ask you to monitor your heart rate over a period of time and report back to them.Your doctor may also investigate your heart health with a variety of tests like an electrocardiogram (EKG), echocardiogram (echo), or a cardiac computerized tomography (CT) scan.
A doctor may ever prescribe an electronic heart monitor (Holter monitor) for you if they are concerned about your heart rate or some possible irregularities. Usually this is a portable monitor that attaches to your chest with electrodes that you will need to wear for two weeks or so, while your doctor monitors your results.

Wear a wrist monitor.,
Use a blood pressure machine at a local store.,
Go to the doctor.",How to Check Your Blood Pressure2," Purchase a wrist blood pressure cuff and read the instructions carefully. Strap the cuff onto your wrist and turn the machine on. Press the button that initiates the reading and wait for it to inflate. Keep your arm level on a table in front of you while the wrist monitor is working.When the process is over, the cuff will automatically deflate and the reading will flash on the screen.
You should be able to purchase a wrist monitor relatively inexpensively at your local pharmacy store.

, Find a blood pressure machine and follow the instructions on it. These types of machines typically require you to insert your arm, remain motionless while the machine inflates, and then wait for the reading. The cuff will automatically deflate when the reading is complete and you can remove your arm.Most pharmacies have these types of machines, including pharmacies inside grocery stores.
Make sure you take a minute or two to calm down and rest before you take your blood pressure reading.

, The most accurate way to check your blood pressure is to have it checked by a medical professional. Make an appointment with your regular doctor and tell the nurse (or the doctor) that you are interested in finding out more about your blood pressure reading.Some of the other machine methods may have a wider degree of variance than getting your blood pressure checked by a medical professional.

Monitor your blood pressure if you have risk factors.,
Check your pressure at home if you have anxiety.,
Check your blood pressure in both arms.,
Get a diagnosis from your doctor.",How to Check Your Blood Pressure3," Some factors contribute to the risk of higher blood pressure, which can require closer monitoring. If you have a family history of high blood pressure, you may want to consider monitoring your blood pressure at home.Some additional risk factors include pregnancy, smoking, age (older people tend to be at higher risk for high blood pressure), gender (men seem to have more problems with HBP), and race (African-Americans tend to develop HBP more often than other races).

, Many people who suffer from anxiety get nervous at the doctor’s office. This can lead to artificially high blood pressure readings, whereas if you monitored from home your readings would be much lower.This is often called “white coat” hypertension.

, Alternate arms when checking your blood pressure, rather than always checking it on one side. A normal difference of 5-10 mm Hg exists between the arms, but anything greater than that can suggest circulatory problems., The best way to determine whether or not you need to monitor your blood pressure is to get a diagnosis for high or low blood pressure from your doctor. Your doctor will be able to determine a course of action with you.Your doctor may prescribe you medication and will tell you often you need to check your own blood pressure.

Check your blood pressure regularly.,
Watch your weight.,
Exercise 30-60 minutes almost every day of the week.,
Limit your alcohol intake.,
Avoid tobacco products.,
Cut back on caffeine.,
Keep a food diary.,
Read food labels.",How to Control High Blood Pressure2," Get cholesterol and other readings (possibly at public health clinics or health fairs) and see your medical professional regularly to assess any cardiovascular and other health issues discovered. The more proactive you are, the better grip you'll have on the issue.


If you are taking your blood pressure at home, make sure you're doing it correctly! If you have any questions at all, ask your doctor. You should be getting higher readings when you wake up and while at work. It will lower at home and when you're relaxing., As your weight increases, chances are your blood pressure and related heart-stresses are increasing too. Just a loss of ten pounds can show you a decrease in your blood pressure levels. Consult your doctor on a healthy target weight.


In addition to the number on the scale, your waistline measurement matters, too. Men with a waistline of 40 inches (101.6 cm) or more and women with a waist of 35 inches (88.9 cm) or more at an increased risk of hypertension. Asian men and women run on a scale of about 3 inches (7.6 cm) smaller (for both sexes)., Apart from losing that excess weight, regular cardio exercise can significantly lower your blood pressure within weeks. Weeks! That's about as close to instant gratification as you're gonna get.Even making small efforts helps. Squeezing in a 15 minute walk before work is definitely better than nothing. You don't have to get your workout in all in one go! Having an active lifestyle is all about finding small ways to get moving. It doesn't necessarily mean going to the gym!

, In small amounts, alcohol can lower your blood pressure slightly. However, drinking in moderate amounts can exacerbate your hypertension. Men younger than 65 can get away with 2 drinks a day, but everyone else should stick to 1. And that doesn't mean you get 7 in one day if you've skipped a week!


Know what ""one drink"" really means. That's five ounces of wine, 12 ounces of beer, or 1.5 ounces of 80-proof hard liquor.And if you don't drink, definitely don't start to reap the one-drink benefits!

, Smoking throughout the day can raise your blood pressure virtually permanently. Apart from all the other absolutely terrible side effects of smoking, it can raise your blood pressure by 10 mm Hg for up to an hour after you puff away. Though it's only a temporary effect, if you do it constantly, your blood pressure doesn't know the difference.


Secondhand smoke isn't much better. If you can avoid it, do. There are negative consequences in just being around it, too., Drinking beverages containing caffeine will boost your heart rate and can spike your blood pressure temporarily, in addition to being potentially quite harmful to the health of persons developing hypertension and promoting sleep disorders. It's best to keep it down as much as possible.


Do a test yourself, if you can. Certain people are more caffeine-sensitive. Drink a cup of coffee or a can of soda and check your blood pressure within 30 minutes. If your levels raise near 5 or 10 points, you may be extra caffeine-sensitive.

, Controlling (and lowering) your blood pressure isn't incredibly difficult -- it just takes diligence and and attention to detail. Monitoring your diet will be a bit tedious, sure, but it's doable. It'll sure be a lot easier with a food journal!


Not only will you see what you should (and shouldn't) eat, you'll notice eating patterns that you may not have noticed before. In addition to tracking what you're eating, also write down when and why. It's probably not always due to hunger!

, It's absolutely imperative that you know what's going into your system. While you should cut out processed goods as much as possible, there will inevitably be a few that slip through. When you go to the store and are contemplating your purchases, read the label first.


If it's high in sodium, preservatives, or words that end in -ose, put it back on the shelf. And if you have to take a second to think about how to pronounce the majority of the ingredients, that's a red flag, too.

Reduce your stress.,
Make regular doctor appointments and monitor your blood pressure at home.,
Take a supplement or other blood pressure medication.,
Get support.",How to Control High Blood Pressure3," Stress and anxiety is one of the major causes of high blood pressure. Take time to think about what is stressing you and how you can solve the problem to alleviate your hypertension. Is there an area of your life that may be exacerbating the problem?


If stressors can't be done away with, how can you change your coping behaviors? Consider taking up yoga or taking time out of your day to meditate or work on deep breathing.

, Depending on how high your blood pressure is and its consistency, your appointment frequency will vary from those of another person. It's always better to err on the side of caution!


Find a doctor and stick with him/her. When your doctor knows you well, he/she can better treat you. The more they're familiar with your history, the easier it will be to get you on a path to lower numbers!

, This is something that should only be done upon the advice of your doctor. Diuretics and beta-blockers are two of the most common that your doctor may recommend. Diuretics dispel excess salt and toxins from your body and beta blockers slow your heart rate down. But there's over half a dozen other varieties, too!As for supplements, though they can be taken with the best of intentions, they're not always good ideas. Talk to your doctor beforehand before taking anything.

, Friends and family can help you lower your blood pressure if you let them. They can back up your exercise plans or make appointments for you at the doctor's office. And they can keep junk out of the cupboards!


Blood pressure is such a common thing nowadays, it's a safe bet you know other people going through the same issues (especially since it's hereditary). If you can, find a workout or cooking buddy to make the good habits come a bit easier.

, Spend time spreading the mixture evenly from your roots to the end of your hair. Do this for about 10 minutes. This opens up the pores on your head and promotes blood circulation. Plus, it just plain feels great.

, Try sitting under a steamer as you allow your rub to set. Or, if you don't have have a steamer, let the rub set while you take a hot bath. If you don't have a bathtub, no worries - just allow the rub to set for a little longer (30-45 minutes).

, Hop in the shower and wash your hair. Usually, you'll need to shampoo and rinse twice to get all of the rub out of your hair. Don't overdo it - this can strip the scalp of the moisture provided by the rub. Use your daily conditioner for the ends of your hair only.

, Dry heat, such as that from a hair dryer, can contribute to a flaky, dandruff-y scalp. If you typically style your hair using a blow dryer, blow dry your hair delicately, making sure not to apply too much heat directly to your scalp. Optionally, use a hair straightener to style as you normally would.

, Take four to five drops of coconut oil in the palm of your hand and rub both hands together - this will warm the oil. Run both palms through your hair, transferring the oil onto your hair and scalp. Repeat as needed to cover all of your scalp.

Take your blood pressure.,
Use the formula MAP = (2(DBP) + SBP)/3.,
Alternatively, use the formula MAP = 1/3(SBP – DBP) + DBP.,
For estimation purposes, use the formula MAP approx = CO × SVR.,
Consider using a calculator for convenience.,
Know the “normal” MAP range.,
Consult a doctor if you have dangerous MAP or blood pressure values.,
Know how certain medical conditions can affect MAP.,
Find your pulse.,
Inflate the cuff on your upper arm.,
Allow the cuff to deflate while you watch the pressure gauge.,
Listen for the first beat.,
Listen and feel for the beats to disappear.,
Know what can affect your blood pressure.",How to Calculate Mean Arterial Pressure," To be able to calculate your mean arterial pressure, you'll need to know both your diastolic and systolic blood pressures. If you don't already know these, take your blood pressure to find them. Though there are a variety of fancy methods for taking your own blood pressure, all you'll need for reasonably accurate results is a blood pressure cuff and a stethoscope. As a reminder, your blood pressure when you hear the first beat in the stethoscope is your systolic pressure and your blood pressure when you stop hearing beats is your diastolic.If you're not sure of how to take your own blood pressure, consult the section below for step-by-step instructions or see our article on the subject.
Another option is to use the automatic blood pressure machines that are available for free at many pharmacies and grocery stores.;
, Once you know your diastolic and systolic blood pressures, finding your MAP is easy. Simply multiply your diastolic by two, add it to your systolic, and divide the total by three. This is essentially the same as the basic equation for finding the average (mean) of a range of numbers. MAP is measured in mm Hg (or ""millimeters of mercury""), a standard pressure measurement.


Note that the diastolic pressure is multiplied by two because the cardiac system spends about two-thirds of its time in the ""resting"" diastole phase.For example, let's say that we take our blood pressure and find that we have a diastolic pressure of about 87 and a systolic pressure of about 120. In this case, we'd plug our values into our equation and solve as follows: MAP = (2(87) + 120)/3 = (294)/3 = 98 mm Hg.

, Another way to find your MAP is with this simple alternate equation. Subtract your diastolic from your systolic, divide by three, and add your diastolic. The result you get should be exactly the same as you'd get from the equation above.


Using the same blood pressure values as above, we can solve this equation as follows: MAP = 1/3(120 – 87) + 87 = 1/3(33) + 87 = 11 + 87 = 98 mm Hg.

, In medical situations, this alternate equation, which uses the variables of cardiac output (CO; measured in L/min) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR; measured in mm HG × min/L) is sometimes used to find a quick estimate for a person's MAP. Though the results from this equation sometimes aren't 100% accurate, they are usually suitable as approximate estimates. Note that CO and SVR are usually measured in medical settings with special equipment (though it is possible to find them with simpler methods).


For the average female, normal cardiac output is about 5 L/min. If we assume an SVR of 20 mm HG × min/L (on the high end of normal levels), the female's MAP will be about 5 × 20 = 100 mm Hg.

, It's important to note that MAP calculations don't have to be carried out manually. If you're in a hurry, a wide variety of online calculators (such as this one) can allow you to find your MAP value instantaneously by simply inputting your blood pressure values.

, As with systolic and diastolic blood pressure, certain ranges for MAP are generally considered to be ""normal"" or ""healthy"". Though some healthy people may have MAP scores outside this range, this can sometimes signify the potential for dangerous cardiovascular conditions. In general, an MAP value of between 70-110 mm Hg is considered normal., If you have a resting MAP that is outside of the ""normal"" range above, you may not necessarily be in any danger, but you should still consult a doctor for a thorough examination and analysis. The same is true if you have abnormal values for your resting systolic or diastolic blood pressures (which should be below 120 and 80 mm Hg respectively). Don't put off talking your doctor — many cardiovascular conditions are easily treated if they're addressed before they develop into a serious problem.


Note that an MAP of below 60 is generally considered dangerous. As noted above, MAP is used to determine how well blood is reaching the organs — an MAP value of greater than 60 is usually required for adequate perfusion., It's important to understand that certain types of medical conditions and medications can alter what is considered a ""normal"" or ""healthy"" MAP score. In these cases, a doctor may need to carefully monitor your MAP to ensure that it does not fall outside of the new acceptable range to prevent serious harm. Below are just a few types of patients whose MAP may need to be tightly-controlled. If you're not sure whether a condition you have or a medicine you're taking is altering your acceptable MAP range, talk to your doctor immediately:Patients with head injuries
Patients with certain types of aneurysm
Patients suffering from septic shock who are on vasopressors
Patients on vasodilator (GTN) infusion

, If you're unsure of what your resting systolic and diastolic blood pressures are, performing a manual blood pressure test is relatively easy. All you'll need is a blood pressure cuff and a stethoscope — both should be available at a local pharmacy. Wait until you're completely relaxed, then sit down and feel the underside of your forearm or wrist until you find a pulse. Put your stethoscope in your ears in preparation for the next step.


If you're having a hard time, try using your stethoscope to listen for your pulse. When you hear a light, regular ""bump"", you've found the right spot.

, Take your blood pressure cuff and fasten it around your bicep on the same arm you found the pulse on. Most modern cuffs have a velcro strap to make them easy to fasten. When the cuff is snug (but not tight), use the attached hand bulb to inflate it. Watch the pressure gauge — you want to inflate the cuff to a pressure that's about 30 mm Hg higher than you expect your systolic pressure to be.As you do this, hold the head of your stethoscope to the spot where you found your pulse (or, if you couldn't find it, in the crook of your elbow). Listen — if you've inflated your cuff to a high enough pressure, you shouldn't be able to hear your pulse at this point.

, If air isn't already flowing out of the cuff, turn the release valve (the small screw on the inflation bulb) counterclockwise until air is flowing at a slow, steady rate. Keep your eyes on the pressure gauge while air flows out of the cuff — it should be steadily decreasing.

, As soon as you hear the first heartbeat in your stethoscope, write down the pressure displayed on the gauge. This is your systolic pressure. In other words, it's the pressure when the arteries are tightest just after a heart beat.


As soon as the pressure in the cuff is the same as your systolic pressure, blood can flow underneath the cuff during each of the heart's ""pumps"". This is why we use the pressure on the gauge during the first audible beat as the value for systolic pressure.

, Keep listening. As soon as you can't hear any more pulse beats in your stethoscope, write down the pressure on the gauge. This is your diastolic pressure. In other words, it's the pressure when the arteries are ""resting"" between beats.


As soon as the pressure in the cuff is the same as your diastolic pressure, blood can flow underneath the cuff even when the heart isn't pumping. This is why you can no longer hear pulses at this point and why we use the pressure on the gauge after the final heart beat as the value for diastolic pressure.

, ""Normal"" blood pressure values are generally considered to be under 80 mm Hg for diastolic pressure and under 120 mm Hg for systolic pressure. If either of your blood pressure values is greater than these normal values, you may not have need for concern. A variety of conditions both serious and insignificant can affect a person's blood pressure. If one of the following conditions is true for you, try waiting until the condition subsides, then try again.Being nervous or stressed out
Having eaten recently
Having exercised recently
Tobacco, alcohol, or drug use
Note that if you have a consistently high blood pressure, you should contact your doctor (even if you feel fine). This can be a sign of hypertension (high blood pressure) or prehypertension, which can eventually develop into harmful conditions.

Be aware of how a normal ""wave form"" looks on an ECG trace.This will allow you to determine what area of the ECG represents one heart beat.,
Identify the QRS complex.The QRS complex is normally the tallest part of the pattern that repeats on the ECG.,
Count the space between QRS complexes.The next step is to determine the number of large squares on the ECG trace separating one QRS complex from the next QRS complex.,
Divide the number 300 by your answer above.Once you have calculated the number of big squares separating QRS complexes (let's use 3.2 as an example), perform the following calculation to determine heart rate: 300/3.2 = 93.75.",How to Calculate Heart Rate from ECG1," From the length of a heart beat on the ECG trace, you will be able to calculate the heart rate. A normal heart beat contains a P wave, a QRS complex, and an ST segment. The one you will want to pay particular attention to is the QRS complex, as this is the easiest one to use to calculate heart rate.


The P wave is a small semi-circular shape located right before the tall QRS complex. It represents the electrical activity of the atria (""atrial depolarization""), which are the two small chambers located at the top of the heart.
The QRS complex is the tallest most visible aspect of the ECG trace. It is usually pointy, like a tall, thin triangle and very easy to recognize. It represents the electrical activity of the ventricles (""ventricular depolarization""), which are the two large chambers located at the bottom of the heart that forcefully pump blood throughout the body.
The ST segment directly follows the tall QRS complex. It is actually the flat area prior to the next semi-circular shape on the ECG (which is the T wave). The importance of this flat segment (the ST segment), located right after the QRS complex, is that it provides important information to physicians about things such as potential heart attacks.;
, It is a tall and skinny spike (for a person with normal heart function) that occurs repeatedly at the same rate across the ECG trace. Every time one QRS complex occurs, it is an indication that one heart beat has taken place. Therefore, you can use the space between QRS complexes on the ECG to calculate the heart rate.

, The ECG normally has both small squares and large squares. Be sure you are using the large squares as your reference point. Go from the peak of one QRS complex to the peak of the following QRS complex. Note the number of large squares separating the two points.


Often, it will be a fractionated number as the complexes will not land exactly on the squares; for instance, 2.4 squares or 3.6 squares may separate adjacent QRS complexes.
There are normally 5 little squares embedded in each large square, allowing you to approximate the distance between QRS complexes to the nearest 0.2 units (because 1 big square divided into 5 small squares gives you markings every 0.2 units).

, Round your answer to the nearest whole number. In this case, the heart rate would be 94 beats per minute.


Note that a normal heart rate is between 60 to 100 beats per minute.Knowing this can help to guide whether you are on course with your heart rate calculations.
However, 60 to 100 beats per minute is only a loose guideline. Many athletes who are in excellent physical shape have lower resting heart rates.
There are also disease states that can provoke unhealthy slower heart rates (called pathological bradycardias), and diseases that can lead to an unnaturally accelerated heart rate (called pathological tachycardias).
Speak to a physician if the person you are calculating heart rate for appears to have an abnormal value.

In this formula, “r” is the gender constant: r = 0.55 for females and 0.68 for males., In order to calculate BAC using the Widmark formula, you will need to count how many drinks have been consumed in a given period. To be as precise as possible, the number of drinks counted should be based on a standard drink size and alcohol content, rather than the number of glasses, bottles, etc. consumed. This is because the volume and content of drinks vary widely. The standard drink size varies from country to country and from drink to drink. In the United States:


The standard drink size of an 80-proof version of a liqueur such as gin or whiskey is approximately 1.5 ounces.This is about forty percent alcohol.
The standard drink size of a beer with a five percent volume of alcohol is twelve ounces.
The standard drink size of a wine with a twelve percent volume of alcohol is five ounces.
In the United States, a standard drink contains approximately fourteen grams of alcohol.

, Once you have the number of standard drinks consumed, multiply that number by 14 to derive the alcohol dose in grams. This will give you the alcohol dose—the amount of alcohol consumed.


You can also find the alcohol dose using the formula: (Volume of drinks) x (AC of drinks) x 0.789 = grams of alcohol consumedIf your area has a different alcohol content in a standard drink, you will need to multiply the number of standard drinks consumed by that alcohol content in grams.

, The gender constant is 0.55 for females and 0.68 for males.If you know your body weight in pounds but not in grams, use one of the following formulas:


Body weight in pounds / 0.0022046 = body weight in gramsBody weight in pounds x 454 = body weight in gramsA quick internet search will reveal numerous online calculators for converting pounds to grams.

, This step will give you a raw number based on the alcohol content in your body.

, Taking the raw number in the step above and multiplying it by 100 will give you your BAC as a percentage.

, If you have been drinking over a period of time, you will need to account for the elapsed time and the amount of alcohol that your body has already metabolized by the time you calculate your BAC. To do this, use the following formula:BAC as a percentage – (elapsed time in hours x 0. 015)

, Imagine that a 120 pound woman consumed four 1.5 ounce drinks of an 80 proof liqueur over a five-hour period.

, Four 1.5 ounce drinks of an 80 proof liqueur is equivalent to four standard drinks in the United States.

, Multiply the number of standard drinks in this example (4) by 14 (the number of grams of alcohol in a standard drink in the United States) to find the alcohol dose, 56 grams of alcohol.

, 120 pounds is equivalent to 54480 grams (120 pounds x 454 grams per pound). Multiplying this by the gender constant (in this example, 0.55) = 29964

, In this example, this equals approximately 0.0018689093579 (56 / 29964). For a less exact calculation, you can round this number to 0.00186.

, In this example, this gives the number 0.186 (0.00186 x 100). This number reflects the approximate BAC as a percentage, before accounting for elapsed time.

, In this example, you should first multiply the number of elapsed time in hours (5) by 0.015 = 0.075. Then, subtract this number from the approximate BAC as a percentage: 0.186 – 0.075 = 0.111. This means that the approximate BAC in this example at the end of the five hour period is 0.111.

Get ongoing care.,
Consult your doctor at the earliest sign of an arthritic flareup or relapse.,
Stick to your medication.,
Switch to an alternate RA medication.,
Get surgery.",How to Avoid Rheumatoid Arthritis Remission Relapses1," Each time you report to the doctor for a checkup regarding your RA, schedule a followup appointment. Getting ongoing, regular medical care is the key to ensuring that you can reduce inflammation and improve your symptoms. It will also help prevent you from developing complications like joint or organ damage or osteoporosis, a condition in which the bones grow weak and fragile.To better understand the state of your RA, your doctor might issue you a questionnaire or survey to catalog and track your objective experience.
Provide as much data as possible to your doctor so that they can make the most informed choice and provide you with the best care.
Be specific when describing your RA. For instance, if you have a flareup, don’t just say, “I had some pain recently.” Instead, provide specifics about where you were and what you were doing when you experienced the flareup. You might say, for instance, “When I woke up last Wednesday, I had intense pain in my left knee, but as the day went on, it dissipated.”;
, Only your doctor will be able to determine if you need to change medications, increase your dosage, or take other corrective action to avoid relapse. The faster you and your doctor react to any potential relapse, the faster you’ll be able to get your condition back under control., Medication for RA is often your first line of defense against it. If you stop taking your rheumatoid arthritis medication, your symptoms could return.Always follow your doctor’s prescription when using medication to keep your rheumatoid arthritis at bay.If you have side effects from your medication that discourages you from taking it, talk to your doctor before quitting your medication outright. Your doctor might be able to adjust your dosage or provide an alternative medicine. Doing otherwise could put you at risk for relapse.
Don’t assume that just because your symptoms are gone you can quit your medication.

, Certain RA medications known as biologic drugs (or biologics) lose their efficacy over a long period of time. This occurs when your body develops antibodies against the compounds in the biologic drugs that help you fight RA. If you begin to relapse, your doctor will check for antibodies against the biologics and change your medication if necessary.If your relapse is due to antibody development, you might need to supplement your biologic with a different biologic, or with a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) like methotrexate or azathioprine. Doing so could reduce your risk of developing antibodies.

, In some cases, surgery might relieve your pain and increase your joint’s function. The surgery you get depends on the location and severity of your RA. Your doctor will determine if surgery is possible given your overall health and medical history.Surgery should be seen as a last resort to manage your RA. It may be necessary for those who have progressive conditions, which means that their condition is consistently worsening over time.
Discuss potential complications and outcomes from surgery with your doctor before getting any procedure.

Draw two lines on the ECG trace.,
Count the number of QRS complexes between the two lines.As a reminder, the QRS complex is the tallest peak of each wave form that represents one heart beat.,
Multiply your answer by 10.Because 6 seconds x 10 = 60 seconds, multiplying your answer by 10 will give you the number of heart beats that have occurred in one minute (in other words, the ""beats per minute,"" which is the standard measurement of heart rate).,
Understand that this method is particularly effective for irregular heart rhythms.If the heart rate is regular, the first method of simply determining the distance between one QRS and the next can be very effective, because the distance between all the QRS complexes is presumably the same with a regular heart rate.",How to Calculate Heart Rate from ECG2," The first line should be near the left-hand side of the paper containing the ECG trace; the second line should be exactly 30 large squares subsequent to the first line. 30 large squares on an ECG trace represents exactly 6 seconds., Tally up the total number of QRS complexes between your two lines and write down this number.

, For example, if you count 8 beats in the 6 second period, then your heart rate calculation gives you 8 x 10 = 80 beats per minute.

, On the other hand, with an irregular heart rate (where the QRS complexes are not at regular distances from one another), the 6 second method works better because it averages the distance between heart beats, giving a more accurate overall number.

Join a support group.,
Cope with your pain.,
Use a hot or cold pack on joints and areas affected by RA.",How to Avoid Rheumatoid Arthritis Remission Relapses2," Research suggests that changing the bacteria in your gut could limit your likelihood of relapsing. There are several foods that you should avoid if you have RA, and others you should consume more often.An anti-inflammatory diet may be able to help.Foods you should get more of include fish, whole grains, soy, healthy oils (like safflower oil, avocado oil, and walnut oil), fruits containing anthocyanins (especially cherries, raspberries, and blueberries), broccoli, green tea, citrus fruits (like oranges, limes, and lemons), beans, and garlic.
Food ingredients you should limit or avoid include sugar, saturated fats, trans fats, omega-6 fatty acids, refined carbohydrates (like white bread and refined pastas), MSG, gluten (wheat protein), and casein (dairy protein)., If you are overweight, you will be putting an extra strain on your joints, especially your knees. To prevent this, stay active. Doctors recommend at least 2.5 hours of exercise per week. If you can’t meet that benchmark, there are other ways to stay active.At the same time, avoid overdoing exercise. If you are feeling pain two hours after your workout, reduce your exercise next time.


Exercises you might enjoy to keep your RA at bay include yoga, walking, and bike riding.
If you are not in the habit of moving your body, start small and work your way up. For instance, start by walking 10 minutes each day. After a week or so, increase your daily walk to 15 minutes. A week after that increase your walk by another five minutes. Continue in this way until you’ve devoted as much time as possible to walking each week.
Ideally, you’ll be able to exercise regularly. But if you can’t try to incorporate physical activity into your day-to-day schedule. For instance, take the stairs instead of taking the escalator. Walk to the store instead of taking the bus. Use your push mower instead of your riding mower when cutting the grass.
Exercise can also help you sleep better and improve your mood.
Too much exercise can cause flares. If you are just beginning exercise, do smaller but more frequent sessions to help build up your strength. For example, do three ten minute walks instead of one thirty minute walk.

, If you smoke, you might be at greater risk of experiencing relapse.To quit smoking, set a date about two to four weeks away after which you will not smoke. Develop a plan to wean yourself off cigarettes slowly but steadily up to the day you plan on quitting.For instance, if you decide to quit smoking in 20 days, you should cut your cigarette consumption by 25% after five days, the cut it in half after 10 days. Five days before your quit date, you should reduce your cigarette consumption to just 25% of what it originally was. Then, after your last day of smoking, stop smoking entirely.
Use nicotine gum and patches to help you fight cravings if necessary.

, Periods of exercise must be balanced with periods of rest.If you begin to notice signs that your RA is relapsing, spend less time exercising and more time resting. This will take pressure and stress off your joints and reduce the odds that you will experience inflammation or damage your joints.The amount of time you should spend resting and the amount of time you should spend exercising depend on your particular health and energy level.
Generally, you should have short periods of rest interspersed with activity, rather than long periods of activity followed by long periods of rest.

, There are several tools that could help ease pressure on your joints. For instance, you might use splints on hands and wrists that ache, or use tools like zipper pullers and long-handled shoe horns. You might also benefit from using devices to help you out of bed or on/off toilet seats. Talk to your doctor or physical therapist about using such devices or enacting other changes to your habits of movement that might benefit your joints.If you choose to use splints, consult your physical therapist or doctor so they can show you how to wear it and ensure it fits properly.

, While there is no evidence that stress causes flareups or relapses of RA, stress can make living with RA even more difficult than it already is. In addition to exercise and other forms of physical activity, there are several things you can do to reduce your stress levels. Avoid situations that lead to anger, fear, or frustration, and connect with friends and family. Find time each day to engage in something you enjoy.For instance, you might enjoy reading a book, playing a game, or taking a walk with your friend.
Relaxation techniques, such as meditation, deep breathing, and progressive muscle relaxation, can help as well.

, Talking to your friends and family about your RA might make you feel better about it. But even if they are worried, they might not want to bring it up. Kickstart a conversation about your condition with them by saying, “My rheumatoid arthritis is in remission. I sincerely hope I don’t have a relapse.”, Support groups can help you connect with others who also have RA. Talking to others who are going through the same thing you are can help you feel less stressed, anxious, and alone. Check out http://www.arthritisintrospective.org/arthritis-support-networks for a list of arthritis support networks in the U.S., Since relapse is defined in part by the presence of swelling and pain, you should supplement drugs that reduce inflammation and combat your RA directly with drugs to help you manage your pain (analgesics). You might be able to manage your pain with over-the-counter meds like Tylenol, or you might need more heavy-duty prescription medications. Get a recommendation for pain relief medicine from your doctor.Your remission might not be entirely pain-free. Many doctors define remission as one or fewer tender or swollen joints.Let your doctor know if you’re having trouble managing your pain so that they can recommend something more substantial and/or provide prescription medication.

, Cold can numb certain painful areas and reduce muscle spasms. Hot packs can help painful joints and muscles relax.Additionally, you could benefit from the effects of heat by taking a warm shower or soaking in a warm whirlpool or hot tub at a spa.
Instead of buying a hot pack, you could wet a wash cloth or hand towel, place it in a freezer bag, and microwave it for 10 seconds or so. Wrap the bag in a towel and apply it to sore areas for 15 to 20 minutes.Instead of buying a cold pack, you could fill a resealable bag with ice cubes and wrap it in a towel, then hold it to affected areas for 15 minutes.

Use Nadler’s equation.,
Estimate your total blood volume.,
Make adjustments using Gilcher’s Rule of Five if needed.",How to Calculate Blood Volume1," This method calculates your total blood volume in milliliters. To perform the calculation, you will need your height in inches and your weight in pounds. The formula is: (0.006012 x Height3{\displaystyle ^{3}})+(14.6 x Weight)+604.If you have your height in centimeters and your weight in kilograms, you will first need to convert them to inches and pounds, respectively. 1 centimeter is 0.39 inches. 1 kilogram is 2.2 pounds.

 Calculate the height function of the formula. Cube your height in inches and then multiply it by 0.006012.

 Calculate the weight function. Multiply your weight in pounds by 14.6.

 Add the height function to the weight function. Add 604.
;
, This method uses the average number of milliliters of blood per kilogram of body weight that a man has. This method is also called the reference book method.Your weight should be in kilograms. If you need to convert pounds to kilograms, 1 pound is 0.45 kilograms.

 Multiply your body weight in kilograms times the average for men: 75 milliliters of blood per kilogram.This will give you your estimated blood volume in milliliters.


, Not all types of tissue have the same amount of blood in them. This means that if a person is obese or very thin, it will influence the accuracy of the calculations. Gilcher’s Rule of Fives makes adjustments for this in the estimated amount of blood per kilogram of body weight. If you know your weight in pounds, convert it to kilograms by multiplying by 0.45. Then multiply your body weight in kilograms by one of these values to get your estimated total blood volume in milliliters:Muscular men have 75 mL of blood per kilogram of body weight.

 Normal men have 70.

 Thin men have 65.

 Obese men have 60.

Consult your doctor before starting an exercise regimen.,
Set goals.,
Keep a Healthy Heart journal.,
Make it a team effort.",How to Build Up Your Cardiovascular System1," Any time you are going to change your physical activity level, talk to your doctor first. They will discuss health topics with you like your blood pressure, cholesterol, medications you take, or other health factors that might affect the safety of your activity level. You can work together to make a workout and diet plan.


They will probably discuss your family history with you so they’re aware of your risk factors for heart disease, so know if anyone in your immediate family (parents and siblings) have had a heart attack, stroke, or diabetes.
Say something like, “I want to build up my cardiovascular system. Are there any activities I should avoid?” or, “Can you help me plan a heart-healthy diet?”;
, Goals help you measure your progress and work for attainable change. Be specific, such as, “I will eat five servings of vegetables a day,” or, “I will ride my bike for 30 minutes every day this week.” Specific goals are more easier to measure than vague ones.Avoid overwhelming yourself – set one goal for activity and one goal for diet this week, then adjust those goals once you reach them.


Be practical in your goals. If you currently never exercise, don’t expect to suddenly start hitting the gym five days a week. Small improvements are a great start. Even going from being totally inactive to being physically active only one hour a week has benefits for your heart.Don’t feel bad if you slip up or backtrack. This isn’t a “failure.” Changing habits is difficult and takes time, and the important thing is that you recognize what went wrong and keep on trying!

, As you find your cardiovascular system getting stronger, keep track of your progress. This is extremely motivating, and you’ll be amazed at how much can change in a short time. Make charts on your computer or in a notebook, or write in a casual “diary” format.It helps to keep track of details: exactly what exercise you did and for how long (e.g. “ran 1.5 miles in 30 minutes”), what foods you ate (include nutritional information from the label) and in what portions, and other health-goals you have. Maybe you’re trying to quit smoking — record how many cigarettes you had that day. Weigh yourself weekly and write down your weight. Note if your clothing size decreases.

, Having support while you work to get healthier will make your challenge easier and more fun. Enlist a friend to be your gym-buddy, and motivate each other to get there 5 days a week. Make healthy meal plans with your family so that they feel included in your goals, and can help with the shopping and cooking. Seek support from your doctor or an online community if you feel your enthusiasm waning — a little encouragement can help get you back on track.You can say something like, “My goal is to work out three days a week, and I would love it if you would go to the gym with me,” or, “Let’s find a recipe for a healthy meal that we all like, and cook it together.”

That invisible gas exhaust and smokestack fumes in the sunlight or hot weather -- can kill cardio cells, throw off your heartbeat, and increase the odds for a heart attack, even if you have a normal heart..


Exercise indoors on high-ozone days to avoid exhaust-choked city streets.
Get out from behind diesel buses and trucks; their tailpipes spew chemicals, tiny particles -- that can inflame lungs and arteries, cause or rupture plaque buildups, thus encouraging blood clots, and also boost blood pressure.;
, Are you taking low-dose aspirin (like 1/4 of a regular aspirin) for any reason -- then check your supply and get more, if it's low.Caution: Stopping aspirin suddenly could triple your odds for dangerous clots within the next week or two. If you've got surgery scheduled, have a careful talk with your doc now about the way and reasons for and against stopping your little aspirin tablets. Taper off as instructed.

, Anything in your health history (and relatives') showing problems of high blood pressure, diabetes and kidney function is a sign of heart trouble to ask your doctor -- about ""trouble in your family tree"":


Kidneys are a waste-disposal system, but in many adults -- about 1 in 9 (more than 10%) -- these hidden little filters aren't working very well. In time, that triples your chances for heart problems because low kidney function stiffens/hardens your arteries and fires up lots of inflammation.
Get checked for high blood pressure, diabetes (which may have only small symptoms), and inherited genes are ""hidden"", and will all weaken your kidneys, without your noticing (find free screenings at http://www.kidney.org). Keep all those under control, urgently.
Check delicious foods, vegetables, low fat, lean meats and such that can lower your blood pressure, blood sugar and avoid ""bad"" genes being triggered by habits (over eating, sugars, carbs and risky fats).

, Having parents with early heart problems will up your chances. But did you know that a brother or sister with heart disease ""before age 60 doubles your own odds of heart trouble triggers""? Tell your health profession about this part of your family-tree.


Stay healthy (eat whole grains, green veggies, walk, exercise -- and don't smoke. Set a new goal for healthy habits today -- and do it! Get serious about maintaining normal blood pressure, lowering LDL (bad) cholesterol and inflammation levels.

, A bad marriage can lead to emotional and physical troubles. Also, if your ""friends"" are described as: ""with friends like these, who needs enemies"" -- they raise heart risk 25%. Break out of your irritating life. Find real friends. Work on improving your marriage (everyone may have to do so at any point). Your blood pressure will drop, your arteries will be cleaner, and, hey-hey-hey, you'll be happier! (Friendships, and long term relationships, ""can"" help you live longer in better mental shape.)

, Can't swing a getaway right now? Do a ""staycation"": Fill up the tub or wading pool, turn off the phone, get off the computer, rent your favorite movies, take long walks, do or don't cook, relax, then unwind. Get that laid-back blissful vacation, and easy-feeling. Your heart will love you.

Using this number can help guide you on whether or not you're working too hard when you're exercising.If you need to avoid stressing your heart, it's typically recommended to aim for 60% of your maximum heart rate.
To determine your maximum heart rate, subtract your age from 220. You can also use heart rate charts found online to determine the recommended maximum heart rate for your age.Multiplying your maximum heart rate by 60% or 0.60 will give you an estimated heart rate that you can aim for while exercising.
Make sure you clear this level of exertion with your physician before attempting this during an exercise session.;
, If you're concerned about stressing your heart during exercise consider purchasing and wearing a heart rate monitor. These little gadgets can tell you what your heart rate is while you exercise. This may be able to help give you additional control while you exercise.


Heart rate monitors are devices you wear that will tell you your heart rate continuously. These are great if you need to strictly monitor and avoid raising your heart rate too high.
One of the best and most accurate types of heart rate monitors are chest straps. You wear a thin plastic strap around your chest, with the actual monitor sitting directly over your heart. A corresponding watch or phone app is where you see the calculated heart rate.
Another option is to wear a heart rate monitor wrist watch, also known as a fitness monitor. Many of the pedometer watches and other fitness watches measure heart rate. Though these are fairly accurate they are not as accurate as the chest strap.

, If you're trying to avoid over stressing your heart during exercise, you need to be familiar with the signs and symptoms of ""over-doing it."" Make sure you pay attention to your body so you can prevent further issues.If you over stress your heart by doing too much exercise, you will probably notice some side effects. Keep an eye out for these and if you experience them, stop exercising immediately.
Some side effects to take note of are: chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, heart palpitations or feeling faint.
If you notice any of these signs while you're exercising, discontinue immediately. Sit down and relax until you are able to lower your heart rate. Talk to your doctor as well to let them know about this incident.

, Whenever you're trying to avoid stressing your heart during exercise, it's essential that you include a warm-up and a cool-down to your exercise routine. This helps get your heart ready for exercise and allows it to slow down afterwards.Your warm-up should be at least 5 minutes long. This is essential to avoid stressing out your heart. The purpose of a warm-up is to help slowly bring your heart rate higher instead of a rapid and uncontrolled rise.
The best type of warm-up should include light stretching, range of motion exercises and a lower intensity of your planned exercise (like walking).
A cool-down is equally important. This should also last about 5 minutes as well. It helps your heart rate and blood pressure slowly return to normal. Do not just stop activity, as this can cause lightheadedness and heart palpitations.
A cool-down is very similar to a warm-up. You want to slow down the intensity of whatever exercise you're doing. You may also include some light stretching if you'd like.

, Whenever you're trying to exercise and avoid exacerbating a current health condition, it's important to speak frequently with your doctor. Your physician will tell you exactly what you can and cannot do as far as physical activity.


Ask your doctor for specifics. You want to make sure you're 100% clear on what types of exercise you can do and for how long.
Questions you can ask include: How much exercise can I do each day? How often can I exercise each week? What type of exercise should I do? What type of exercises should I avoid? Do I have to take my heart rate while exercising?
You may want to consider having your doctor help design a workout or exercise plan with you.

, If you've experienced a heart attack or have a serious cardiac condition, it might be wise to start exercising in a cardiac rehab program. These are safe and medically supervised programs which is a great alternative to doing it alone.


Cardiac rehab programs are designed for those with cardiac related health problems or those who have experienced a cardiac event. They provide education and one-on-one counseling for exercise.Talk to your doctor about possibly joining a cardiac rehab program. Ask if there is somewhere local you can go to start.

, Going for a walk is a great form of low intensity exercise. It's one of the oldest forms of exercise and is one of the best activities if you cannot stress your heart during exercise.

Studies have shown that low intensity walking not only is easy on your heart, but also has many health benefits. You may notice improved insulin resistance and lower blood lipid levels.
Depending on your fitness level, aim to start with about 20 to 30 minutes of walking per session. You can do a more leisurely walk or pump your arms for a more brisk and fast paced walk.
If you're unable to walk far or do brisk walking, that's OK. Even a short, slowly paced walk still has great benefits. Over time, you'll be able to work up to longer times.

, Another type of exercise that you can incorporate into your weekly routine is using the elliptical machine. These machines may take a little coordination to get the hang of, but they're great for low intensity exercise.


The elliptical machine allows for a variety of fitness levels. You can increase your pace or the resistance on the machine as you get more physically fit or are cleared for more intense activity.
The other great benefit to the elliptical machine is that it's also low impact. This is great for those that also need to go easy on their knees or other joints.
Start with a 20 to 30 minute session on the elliptical. Choose a resistance that keeps you within your target heart rate range. Go for lower resistance levels until you figure out your heart rate.

, Recumbent bikes are popular in cardiac rehab programs because they're great for low intensity exercise needs. In addition, like the elliptical, recumbent bikes are really easy on the knees.


Recumbent bikes are great for low intensity exercise because you'll be in a reclined and seated position. It's especially great for those with significant exercise restrictions or are just getting back into exercise.
Recumbent bikes do allow you to control the resistance. The higher the resistance, the more difficult it is to pedal. This will elevate your heart rate if desired.
Aim for a 20 to 30 minute session at an appropriate resistance level. Again, make sure to start with a low resistance until you get used to this exercise.

, Swimming or water aerobics can raise your heart rate significantly. However, if you take it easy, these water exercises are great for those with exercise restrictions.Whether you are doing water aerobics, water walking or even water yoga, these exercises keep your heart rate on the low side and do not cause spikes in your heart rate either.
Any type of water exercise is low impact and low weight bearing. It's perfect for those that have joint issues and have pain when doing more traditional forms of exercise.
Start with water walking for about 20 to 30 minutes. If you enjoy this, look into taking a water aerobics class.

, An exercise journal is a great way to monitor progress and how well your body is responding to some of those lower intensity exercises. You can share this with your doctor and use it to track your exercise.Your exercise journal can be kept in a paper and pen journal or even through a smart phone app.
Ideally, you should track what type of activity you're doing, for how long and at what intensity. If you have a heart rate monitor, also track what you average and maximum heart rate is during your exercise sessions.
This is also a great place to track any symptoms you experience during exercise. For example, you get short of breath and slightly dizzy after 20 minutes of low intensity exercise.
An exercise journal is as great way to keep you motivated as you can see your progress over time.

, Even with chronic heart problems or in cardiac recovery, you can still do aerobic activities a few times a week. Health professionals consider appropriate aerobic activities to be safe and beneficial.In general, health professionals want you to aim for about 150 minutes of aerobic activity a week. Low intensity activities like walking count towards this goal.
If you are not physically fit enough to reach 150 minutes per week, set another goal that is more appropriate for your fitness level. Keep track of your progress in your exercise journal.Make sure to stick to lower intensity exercises like walking, light swimming, using the elliptical machine without resistance and the recumbent bike. You can do some moderate intensity activities (like brisk walking or jogging) only if you've been cleared by your physician.
Your doctor should give you specific instructions for total time per week and per exercise session.

, Strength training is another important component of your overall health. It doesn't have the same health benefits as aerobic activity, but can be incorporated safely into a restricted exercise routine.


Strength training activities help your body build and maintain lean muscle mass. In addition, it helps protect your bones and makes them more resistant to breaks and fractures.Include 1 or 2 days of strength training each week. To make sure you do not stress your heart during strength training exercises, make sure to use a low weight or little resistance and do more reps.
Include strength training exercises like light weight lifting, using weight machines, yoga or pilates.

, When you need to avoid stressing your heart during exercise, it's important that you take adequate breaks from activity during the week. They give your body a rest and time to recover.Most health and fitness professionals recommend including about one or two days of rest during the week. Try to schedule them at different times during the week to avoid having two days of rest in a row.
Rest days shouldn't be completely inactive (like watching TV all day), however you want to avoid your typical activities or do less of them.
Days of rest are important for your body's overall health. It's during rest that you see the gains in muscle mass or aerobic fitness levels.

Applying Nadler’s equation.,
Estimate your total blood volume.,
Make corrections using Gilcher’s Rule of Five.",How to Calculate Blood Volume2," The result will be your total blood volume in milliliters. In order to accurately do the calculation, you need to put your height in inches and your weight in pounds into the following formula: (0.005835 x Height3{\displaystyle ^{3}})+(15 x Weight) +183.You can convert your height in centimeters and your weight in pounds to inches and kilograms. 1 centimeter is 0.39 inches. 1 kilogram is 2.2 pounds. If you already have your information in inches and kilograms, then you can skip this step.

 Calculate the height function. Cube your height in inches and then multiply it by 0.005835. 

 Calculate the weight function. Multiply your weight in pounds by 15.

 Add the height function to the weight function. Add 183.


, This method is based on the average value of milliliters of blood per kilogram of body weight that women have.Your weight should be expressed in kilograms. If you need to convert pounds to kilograms, 1 pound is 0.45 kilograms.

 Multiply your body weight in kilograms times the average for women: 65 milliliters of blood per kilogram.This will give you your estimated blood volume in milliliters.


, The amount of blood in fat and muscle is differs. This means that your fitness level can cause you to deviate from the averages. Gilcher’s Rule of Fives corrects this by adjusting the estimated amount of blood per kilogram of body weight. If you know your weight in pounds, convert it to kilograms by multiplying by 0.45. Then multiply your body weight by these averages according to your body condition:Muscular women have 70 mL of blood per kilogram of body weight.

 Normal women have 65.

 Thin women have 60.

 Obese women have 55.

Weigh the child.,
Determine the average blood volume per weight.,
Calculate the blood volume.",How to Calculate Blood Volume3," Use a scale that will give you the value in kilograms. Because children’s weights change rapidly, especially right after birth, it is important to have an up-to-date weight.If your scale gives the weight in pounds, then you will need to covert the values to kilograms. Otherwise the answer will not be accurate. 1 pound equals 0.45 kilograms.


, If you know the child’s age, you can use these values:A newborn that is only 15 to 30 minutes old will have an average blood volume of 76.5 milliliters of blood per kilogram.

 A newborn that is 24 hours old has 83.3 milliliters per kilogram.

 A three month old has 87 milliliters per kilogram.

 A six month old has 86 milliliters per kilogram.

 A child one to six years old has 80 milliliters per kilogram.

 A ten year old has 75 milliliters per kilogram.

 A fifteen year old has 71 milliliters per kilogram. As teens reach adult sizes and proportions, their blood volume will be the same as that of adults.


, Multiply your child’s weight times the average value for his or her age group. The result will be your child’s estimated blood volume.The values may differ slightly when you use a different method of calculation.

 The accuracy of the calculations may also vary slightly based on whether these averages were calculated from a population that is similar in body side and growth patterns to your child.

Increase your activity gradually.,
Do aerobic workouts.,
Be consistent in your exercise.,
Start with a warm-up.,
End with a cool-down.",How to Build Up Your Cardiovascular System2," One way to get moving is to add 10 minutes of moderately intense activity to your daily routine, starting today. This shouldn’t be overwhelming, and can get you on the right track. Even an hour to an hour-and-a-half of exercise weekly can cut your risk of heart disease by 50%.Do this for two weeks, then add 10 more minutes a day of activity. Keep building up until you hit your target goal.


If you’re new to working out, for example, you can spend the first two weeks taking a brisk 20 minute walk (quickly enough to get your heart pumping faster). Every two weeks increase how far you go or how fast you go.

, Aerobic exercise raises your heart rate, gets you breathing heavier, and uses big groups of muscles. Basically, aim to break a sweat. This is a different kind of exercise than weight lifting, which will tone muscles but do little for overall cardiovascular health.Swimming, cycling, and even brisk walking are good options. Play a sport like soccer, tennis, rugby, roller derby – anything that really gets your heart pumping (as long as it’s a safe choice for you). You can dance, do jazzercise or pilates, or anything you enjoy that’s aerobic. The American Heart Association suggests that even yoga can boost heart health!Talk to your doctor about your cardiovascular goals, and ask what your target heart rate should be. Ask, ""For my age, weight, and height, what's my target heart rate to improve my cardiovascular fitness?"" Consider getting a device that measures your heart rate while you exercise so you can aim for your target heart rate.
If you feel dizzy, lightheaded, or nauseated during your workout, stop and rest right away.
Stay hydrated while exercising by taking a short water break every 20 minutes.

, Exercising sporadically won’t do much for your heart; you need to do it regularly. Aim for 30 – 40 minutes of aerobic activity on most days of the week, with a goal of at least five days weekly — this is how you get conditioned to good cardiovascular health. You can do this all in one go, or if time is a factor try it 10 minutes at a time through the day.Use your journal to track your progress, or try using an app for that reason.

, When you start your workout, don’t jump into intense activity right away. Start with a five-minute warm-up to lessen the stress on your body. You’ll feel better, be less sore, and get more flexible. Try gentle stretching, some yoga or tai-chi, or starting your regular workout at a slow pace, such as five minutes of walking before your jog., Like the warm-up phase, your cool-down will help your body regulate blood pressure and heart rate so that you feel good and get maximum benefit from your workout without feeling dizzy. After your 30 – 40 minutes of conditioning exercise, gradually decrease your activity level. Slow down from running to walking, or return to your yoga or stretches from your warm-up. Spend at least five minutes cooling down.Do not immediately stop your workout at the end or just sit down. The goal is a gradual, not abrupt, decrease in activity.
Be sure to stretch the muscles you used during your workout to avoid excess soreness and cramping.

Decrease your dietary saturated and trans fats.,
Get as much of your daily fat intake from unsaturated fats as possible.,
Try the Mediterranean diet.,
Eat lots of fruits and vegetables.,
Base meals on whole grains.,
Get your protein from low-fat foods.,
Eat less salt.,
Treat yourself with dark chocolate.,
Limit your portion sizes.",How to Build Up Your Cardiovascular System3," The average adult needs about 2,000 calories per day. Less than 30% of that should come from fat. Of that 30%, less than 7% should come from saturated fats (200 calories, or 14 grams), which increases “bad” LDL cholesterol.Trans fats should account for as little fat as possible of that 30% — definitely fewer than 2 grams per day, or less than 1% of total fat intake. Fat types are listed in the nutrition facts on food labels, so pay careful attention to what you buy and eat.


Foods with high saturated fat content are dark meats (beef, pork, lamb, veal), chicken and turkey skin, processed meats like hot dogs and bologna, whole milk and dairy, butter, palm and coconut oil, and — due to the butter and oil content — pastries like cookies and pies.Choose low-fat dairy products, such as fat-free or low-fat yogurt and milk, which contain potassium (which can lower your blood pressure) and very little saturated fat.
Trans fats show up in margarine, shortening, powdered and liquid flavored coffee cream, and most processed or pre-packaged snacks and “junk food.”, Unsaturated fats are better for your health than saturated and trans fats, and in appropriate amounts are even good for your heart. These occur naturally in nuts like almonds, walnuts, pistachios and cashews, olives, olive and canola oil, avocado, and some seeds (sunflower, soy, safflower). Fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, and herring give you good omega-3 fatty acids, which are important for health in many ways.Use cholesterol-lowering margarine like Benecol, Smart Balance, or Promise Activ instead of butter., People of the Mediterranean have long life-expectancy and one of the lowest rates of heart disease in the world, and much of this is contributed to what they eat. The Mediterranean diet includes lots of vegetables, fruits, nuts, beans, seeds, and whole grains. Other elements of the diet are:Avoid fast food and processed food by skipping frozen or pre-packed meals and not eating as take-out restaurants.
Cook and dress foods with olive oil instead of butter or margarine.
Eat moderate amounts of dairy, and choose low- or non-fat options.
Eat fresh fruit for dessert, like strawberries or melon.
Have low to moderate amounts of fish and poultry. Aim for about 6 ounces of fish each week. Salmon and mackerel are great fish choices because they contain lots of omega 3 fatty acids, which are good for your heart.
Rarely eat red meat, and choose lean cuts when you do like top sirloin, top or round roast, or sirloin tip. Traditional Mediterranean diets involve eating red meat only a few times a month.
Limit whole eggs to four per week; try to just use egg whites.
Enjoy a glass of red wine with dinner, if you’d like.

, Fresh fruit and veggies are full of nutrients and fiber, and can improve the health of your cardiovascular system. Start your day with a fruit salad, snack on fresh veggies instead of cookies or potato chips, and include larger portions of vegetables and fruits in your meals than meat.Berries in particular are great for your heart health, as they contain antioxidants that remove free radicals from your body.Red grapes are another great fruit option, as they can help reduce blood clotting.
Fresh fruits and vegetables are better than canned or frozen, which can contain preservatives and added salt or sugar.
Aim to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables every day., Compared to refined grain like white bread, whole grains are a lot more nutritious and contain more fiber, which is good for your heart. Eat whole-wheat and whole-grain breads and pastas, brown rice, barley, buckwheat, steel cut oatmeal, quinoa, and farro.Create healthy meals by using these grains with vegetables as the main portion, with only small amounts of meat and starches.


Oatmeal and barley contain beta-glucan, a fiber that can lower your LDL cholesterol., You need protein in your diet to stay strong and healthy. Get protein from meat by choosing lean meat, skinless poultry, and fish like salmon, mackerel and herring. Walnuts, flaxseed, soybeans, canola oil, beans, peas, and lentils are also good protein sources.Try a black bean or soy burger instead of your usual hamburger to get protein without the high fat content of ground beef.

, Having a high-salt diet can increase your blood pressure, which is bad news for cardiovascular health. Limit the salt in your diet by avoiding canned and processed foods like soup, canned vegetables, and frozen meals. Season your food with herbs and spices instead of table salt.


If you like pre-prepared or frozen meals, choose “low-sodium” options.
The Department of Health and Human Services suggests a limit of 2,300 mg (about a teaspoon) of salt daily for adults. If you’re older than 51 or have high blood pressure, diabetes, or kidney problems, you shouldn’t have more than 1,500 mg of salt a day., Studies have shown that the right chocolate, in moderation, can be good for your heart. Chocolate contains flavonoids, antioxidants, and flavanols that are good for your cardiovascular system.Dark chocolate is the best, and should be enjoyed in its unadulterated form — avoid candy bar aisle confections that are filled with extra ingredients and sugars. Look for raw, pure, or unprocessed chocolate.


An ounce of dark chocolate a few times weekly is a good amount to be heart-healthy., Eating health foods is important, but so is eating the appropriate amount of food. Avoid stuffing yourself by intentionally limiting the size of your portions. Use smaller bowls and plates so you can’t fit as much food on them. Create a ratio of lots of nutritious, low-fat fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and only very small amounts of fatty or salty food like red meat, or processed foods.Food is prepared in “serving size” amounts — whether it’s a piece, a cup, or an ounce. Nutrition facts on food labels are listed by serving size. Keep track of your servings so you know how much fat you’re really eating, and so you can limit your portions appropriately. A serving of meat is about the size of a deck of cards, less than you’d probably think.
Most restaurants give you a larger portion than you need. Try to eat half and take the rest home for a later meal.

Stop smoking.,
Avoid or limit alcohol.,
Get plenty of rest.,
Decrease your stress level.",How to Build Up Your Cardiovascular System4," Using tobacco can damage your heart and blood vessels and is a major risk factor for heart disease like stroke and heart attack.It also has a negative impact on your lungs and how well you can breathe during exercise. Quit smoking to greatly improve your cardiovascular and overall health.


Talk to your doctor if you need help to quit smoking. There are gums, patches, and medications that can make it easier.
Your risk of heart disease starts to decrease as soon as you quit smoking.

, Ideally, do not drink alcohol at all. Alcohol consumption can raise triglycerides in the blood, cause high blood pressure, heart failure, increase risk of stroke, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrhythmia, sudden cardiac death, and increase calorie intake (which can lead to obesity and higher risk of diabetes).If you do drink, do not drink excessively. Drinking “in moderation” involves having no more than one serving daily for women, and two servings daily for men., Good sleep is good for your cardiovascular health. Research shows that most adults need seven to nine hours of sleep per night. Try sleeping in a quiet, dark room with a cool temperature. If necessary, you can use a sleep mask or earplugs.A white noise machine (or app) or a fan is useful for a lot of people.
Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time each day and night--even on weekends.
Avoid technology for at least an hour before bedtime. Try reading a book instead of checking Instagram.

, Stress releases a hormone called cortisol in your body, which can cause weight gain, poor sleep, and damage to your circulatory system.Do relaxation techniques to help you to feel calmer and reduce those stress hormones. Try meditation, deep breathing exercises, mindfulness, journaling, listening to music — whatever helps you relax.

Incorporate vegetables, fruits, whole grains and low-fat dairy products into your daily diet.,
Decrease the amount of salt you consume.,
Reduce your alcohol intake.,
Limit your caffeine intake.",How to Avoid High Blood Pressure1," Certain nutrients have been found to help prevent high blood pressure: potassium, calcium, magnesium, and omega-3s. There is no need to take supplements of these nutrients if you have a well-balanced diet.Potassium: Good sources of potassium include winter squash, sweet potatoes, and yogurt.Calcium: Surprising sources of calcium include white beans, canned salmon and dried figs.Magnesium: Almonds, cashew, and tofu are all great sources of magnesium.Omega-3s: Excellent sources of omega-3s include tuna, walnuts, and broccoli.;
, To reduce salt consumption, read food labels closely and cut back on processed and restaurant foods. Also, use spices and herbs as seasoning instead of salt. More than 75% of the salt consumed is in restaurant and processed foods. Dietary guidelines state that everyone over the age of 2 should consume less than 2,300 mg of salt daily. Some groups of people should reduce their intake to 1,500 mg a day, including those who are 51 years of age or older, of African American descent, or have high blood pressure, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease., Experts recommend that two drinks per day for men (one drink for men who are 65 and older) and one drink per day for women of any age are acceptable alcohol consumption levels. While having more than three drinks in one sitting can raise your blood pressure temporarily, long-term increases occur with continued binge drinking.Scale back your alcohol consumption or substitute an alcoholic beverage for a non-alcoholic one.


One drink is considered to be 12 ounces (355 ml) of beer, 5 ounces (148 ml) of wine or 1.5 ounces (44 ml) of 80-proof distilled spirits., Studies show that caffeine can cause instant blood pressure spikes.It’s recommended to drink no more than two cups (200 ml) of coffee per day. Other significant sources of caffeine include chocolate, soda, and energy drinks. All should be consumed in smaller quantities as well."

Exercise regularly to maintain a healthy blood pressure.,
Keep your weight within a healthy range.,
Get enough sleep every night.,
Stop the use of all tobacco products and avoid secondhand smoke.,
Nip problems in the bud early.",How to Avoid High Blood Pressure2," Being physically active lowers your risk of high blood pressure by 20% to 50%.Doctors recommend 30 to 60 minutes of exercise each day, or a total of 150 minutes per week. It is important to be consistent.Your systolic blood pressure can be lowered by as much as 5 to 10 mm of mercury from exercise., You are 2 to 6 times more likely to develop high blood pressure if you are overweight or obese.By maintaining a healthy weight, your waist is trimmed down, too. Experts claim that a large waist circumference can be a predictor of high blood pressure and heart disease. Studies show that waist measurements of 40 inches (102 cm) or more for men, 35 inches (89 cm) or more for women are linked to high blood pressure. Waist measurements vary by ethnicity. For example, for Asian men, the linked waist measurement is 36 inches (90 cm) or more and 32 inches (81 cm) or more for Asian women.While the mechanism of its role is still unknown, one theory is that peripheral insulin resistance leads to impaired glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia. While a variety of mechanisms have been proposed to explain how hyperinsulinemia leads to increased hypertension, none have been proven definitively.

, Sleeping 7 to 8 hours every night may help prevent high blood pressure. Sleep helps to keep your nervous system healthy and to regulate stress hormones. Too little sleep, less than 6 hours, could hurt your body’s ability to regulate stress hormones over time., Blood pressure is temporarily increased for many minutes after a cigarette is smoked. Atherosclerosis (fatty buildups in arteries), cancer, and other lung problems can also be caused by smoking and secondhand smoke exposure., If your blood pressure is occasionally high, but not that way every time you go to the doctor, you may still have a problem. Studies indicate that occasional high blood pressure can be a sign of a chronic problem in the future or even a strong predictor of strokes. Discuss this with your doctor. By catching any problems now, you may be able to alleviate problems in the future."

When you’re in a stressful situation, your blood pressure is increased by a sudden increase in hormones.It is important to note what triggers stress for you so you can work on managing it. Some common stresses include job loss, death, marriage, and moving., Yoga, meditation, and deep relaxation techniques can all help lower your stress levels. Yoga and meditation also not only relax you and strengthen your body, but also may lower your systolic blood pressure by 5 mm Hg or more.Yoga: Yoga consists of a series of movements or postures that increase strength and flexibility. Another part of yoga is controlling your breathing, which helps to quiet your mind and control your body.Meditation: Meditation involves focusing your attention and eliminating thoughts that may be cluttering your mind, which may result in physical and emotional well-being improvements.Deep Relaxation: Deep relaxation includes controlling your breath as well as contracting and relaxing different muscle groups, leading to a more calm state of mind., We all handle stress in different ways; however, some ways like overeating work against lowering blood pressure. More helpful methods include positive reframing, seeking support, problem-solving, and adjusting expectations.


Positive reframing: Note the positive or upbeat aspects of the situation.
Seeking support: Ask for help or emotional support from friends, family members or medical professionals.
Problem-solving: Find the source of the problem and determine a solution.
Adjusting Expectations: Change your anticipated outcomes as different scenarios unfold. "

Perform warm up stretches before you play tennis or golf.,
Do squeeze and release exercises.,
Try wrist rolls and wrist flexes.,
Perform a standing stretch.,
Try side plank.",How to Avoid Tennis Elbow1," To prevent tennis elbow, you should get in the habit of doing 15 minutes of warm up stretches before you play tennis or golf. Warming up your arms with stretches will help to prevent injury and ensure your forearms stay strong. Strong forearms will lower your risk of developing tennis elbow, especially if you tend to do a lot of repetitive motions with your arm playing a sport.Doing warm up stretches before you do any other activities that are hard on your arms, such as gardening, lifting heavy boxes or items, or doing manual labor, can also help to prevent tennis elbow.;
, You can do this simple exercise with a fresh tennis ball or a hard stress ball. Grip the tennis ball in your hand and hold it out in front of you. Then, squeeze and release the tennis ball for two-three minutes, squeezing and releasing the ball in your grip.Do this on both arms as part of your warm up before playing tennis or golf.
You can also do these exercises on your days off from playing tennis or golf, one to two times a day for two-three minutes on each side.

, Doing wrist exercises can help to strengthen your forearm muscles and prevent tennis elbow. You can do these exercises when you are seated at your desk at work, on the court before a game, or at home.To do wrist rolls, make a fist with your elbow bent at your side. Then, make circles with your wrist, about five circles in each direction. Straighten your elbow and do five more circles with your wrist. Repeat this on the other side.
To do wrist flex stretches, hold your arm out, palm down. Use your other hand to gently bend back the hand of the extended arm. Press down so your fingers are facing the ground. You should feel a light stretch along your forearm, but no pain. Hold this for two to three minutes and then repeat it on the other hand.

, You can also integrate a simple standing stretch into your warm up routine. You can also do this stretch before or after you are gardening or lifting heavy objects to prevent tennis elbow.


Do standing shoulder blade squeezes against a wall or on the floor. Hold your arms over your head and interlace your fingers. Press your fingers up towards the ceiling, keeping your back pressed against the wall or the floor. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds to one minute.

, You can also strengthen and stretch your forearms by doing side plank on your elbow. Strong forearms will protect your tendons and prevent the development of tennis elbow.To do side planks, lay down on one side on an exercise mat. Place your forearm under your shoulder, with your elbow and forearm flat on the mat. Then, straighten your legs and raise them off the mat. Lift from your hip area so you are using your abdominal muscles and your arm muscles. You can make a fist with the hand on the mat to prevent falling into your shoulder joint.
Hold the side plank for 30 seconds to one minute. Then, repeat on the other side with the other forearm.

Use a lightweight racket with a flexible shaft.,
Make sure your racket strings are not too tight.,
Play with dry, light balls.",How to Avoid Tennis Elbow2," To avoid stress on your elbow and tendons, you should invest in a lightweight racket that is comfortable and has a flexible shaft. Look for a mid-size or oversize racket with flexibility, as the flexion will help to absorb some of the shock of the ball as you hit it and put less stress on your elbow., Your strings should be strung at a tension of less than 55 lbs. Tight strings can increase the stress on your arm as you hit the ball.If possible, you should also opt for thinner strings, rather than thicker strings, on your racket. Thinner strings are more elastic and will absorb more shock caused by hitting the ball.

, Avoid playing with old, wet balls as they can require more force and effort to hit, leading to higher stress placed on your arm. Go for new, pressurized tennis balls whenever possible."
"
Play with a two-handed backhand.,
Maintain a firm wrist when hitting the ball.,
Keep your grip loose between hits.,
Practice with a pro to avoid injury.",How to Avoid Tennis Elbow3," If your elbow starts to feel sore or tired during a long game, you may want to switch to playing with a two-handed backhand. This will give your muscles a chance to rest and recover. This grip will also reduce the pressure and stress on your hands, forearms, and elbows.If you do not usually use a two-handed backhand, you can use this as an opportunity to strengthen your swing and get better at this technique.

, You should avoid bending your wrist when you hit the ball as this can increase your risk of tennis elbow. Keep your wrist firm and straight as you hit the ball as this will allow the shock of the ball to disperse throughout your entire arm, rather than just your elbow.If you struggle with loose wrists when you play, you may want to try using a brace on your hitting arm. This can help to keep your wrist straight and disperse the pressure on your forearm.

, Many players have a tendency to tense up and maintain a tight grip on their racket between hits. Get in the habit of loosening your grip between hits, especially during a long game. This will give your muscles a chance to relax and your elbow to stretch and release. Try to loosening your grip slightly when you play as well as a grip that is too tight can put stress on your forearm.You should also make sure your grip is comfortable and correct on your racket to prevent injury. To achieve the correct grip, measure the distance from the long crease in your palm to the tip of your ring finger. This is how wide your grip should be on the racket., Sometimes, tennis elbow can be caused by poor positioning and footwork when you play. You may want to consider practicing with a professional trainer to make sure your footwork, swing, and grip are in order. This can then prevent the development of tennis elbow and improve your game."

Find the right shoes.,
Wear a brace.,
Use pads and a helmet for contact sports.",How to Avoid Joint Damage As a Young Athlete1," Having the correct footwear is essential to avoiding joint injuries, particularly in your legs and feet. As an athlete, you will want to make sure that you are wearing the correct shoes for the sport you are playing. Talk with the staff at your local sporting goods store to make sure that you find the right shoe for your activity.For example, if you wear running shoes while you play basketball, you are more likely to sprain your ankle. The low tops of a running shoe do not provide the same amount of joint support as the high tops of a basketball shoe.
If you suffer from chronic joint pain in your legs and feet, you may also want to visit a podiatrist or an orthopedist to determine if you need special inserts such as arch supports.;
, There is little evidence that a brace will help you avoid a joint injury. However, it can help you manage the pain of an existing injury. You can buy a brace for most joints, including your knees, ankles, shoulders, elbows, and wrists.You can also purchase compress sleeves that can help your joints warm, provide support, and reduce swelling.
Talk with your doctor or physical therapist about wearing a brace.

, If you are participating in any kind of contact sport, be sure to wear the appropriate padding. Most padding is intended to protect the bones, tendons, and muscles of your joints. By not wearing your pads, you make yourself more vulnerable to a joint injury.Although it may not look cool to wear knee, elbow, and wrist pads while you skateboard, they may protect you from a lifetime of chronic joint pain if you have a wreck.
If you are playing football, always wear your knee, thigh, and hip pads. Although many college and professional players do not wear them, these pads provide an important layer of protection for your sensitive joints.
While wearing a helmet will obviously protect you from concussions, it also helps reduce damage to the neck and its vertebrae."

Stand properly.Keep your pelvis in a neutral position, neither thrust forward nor pulled back.,
Support your back at the office.This is especially important if you work in an office environment where you do a lot of sitting.,
Ensure your back is supported properly when driving.Move your mirrors in such a way that you don’t need to crane your neck or twist around when driving.",How to Avoid Back Pain1," Avoid standing in one place for long periods. If you have to for work or some other reason, try to put one foot on a footstool and lean on it to reduce the load on your back. Change from your left to right foot after several minutes to avoid straining.;
, A chair with armrests and a swivel base is usually best for your back. If necessary, place a small pillow or a rolled-up towel at the small of your back to support its natural curve. Your knees and hips should be level, and your feet should stay on the ground.


Get up and walk about briefly every 30 minutes or so.
In addition to having a comfy chair, you should keep your forearms horizontal and your elbows at ninety-degree angles when working on a keyboard.Adjust your chair up or down as needed to achieve this position. Do not lean forward on your desk to reach your keyboard.
Use a footstool if your feet do not lie flat on the ground when your chair is set to an appropriate height relative to your desk.Your computer screen should be at eye-level about an arm’s length away to prevent uncomfortable bending of the neck.

, If necessary, put a small pillow or a rolled-up towel behind you in the small of your back.


The same applies when travelling by bus, plane, or train. Stand up and walk down the aisle once each hour.
Stop and pull over every hour or so to walk for a bit if you are on a long car ride.

Warm up properly.,
Use the right technique.,
Balance low and high-impact exercises.,
Do some weight training.,
Take a break.,
Cool down after exercising.",How to Avoid Joint Damage As a Young Athlete2," Before you participate in any activity, be sure to warm up all of your muscles properly. Warming up helps prevent against injuring your muscles, which can lead to increased wear on your joints. Begin your exercise at a slow pace and then gradually work up in intensity.Before practice or a competition, try to increase your heart rate and get your blood pumping. You should work up a little sweat but not be fatigued.
For example, if you are going to play basketball, run around briskly for ten minutes and then shoot hoops for another ten.

, Proper technique is essential for maintaining the joint health of young athletes. Using the right movements and motions ensures that you avoid damaging your muscles and joints. Although the correct technique may not be cool, it will help you avoid an injury and long-term pain.If you are unsure about the right technique, ask your coach, teacher or talk to a physical therapist.
This step is particularly important to remember when it comes to weightlifting and other strength training exercises. Poor technique can lead to irreparable joint and muscle damage.
For example, if you are playing football, make sure that you use the proper technique for tackling. Improperly tackling an opponent can lead to a bruised or dislocated shoulder joint.

, If you are designing your own workout routine, try to alternate between low-impact activities – walking, swimming and biking – and high-impact exercises – running or playing any team sports like basketball or volleyball. This will ensure that you properly strengthen certain muscle groups while avoiding excessive wear on your joints. If you are part of a team, your coach should design practices that strive for this balance.Try not to overdo it on the high-impact exercises. Too much can cause serious joint damage over time.

, Following a strength-training regimen will dramatically improve your joint health. Maintaining your muscle strength will stabilize your joints and keep excess pressure from building on them, which can lead to an injury. If you are a member of a team, your coach will likely put you on strength training regimen.Strength training can include simple things like lunges and squats or more complicated weight lifting and resistance routines.
You should practice weight resistance at least twice a week., If you notice any pain or soreness in your joints, make sure that you stop and allow yourself to recover. Besides being more susceptible to injury, young athletes can also suffer from joint issues, such as Osgood-Schlatter Disease.In fact, it is common for adolescent athletes to experience some joint pain.However, in order to avoid seriously damaging your joints, be sure to stop the activity and take some time off.If the joint pain persists or intensifies, be sure to visit your doctor.
Be sure to tell your coach and parents about any pain you experience.

, Once you are done with your activity, take some time and properly cool down. Walk or run briskly for about five to ten minutes. You may also want to take a few minutes and properly stretch out your muscles. This may allow your joints to increase their flexibility, which can lead to increased performance."
"
Understand that you are more susceptible to joint injuries.,
Avoid exercise when overly fatigued or in pain.,
Maintain a healthy weight.,
Eat foods that promote joint health.",How to Avoid Joint Damage As a Young Athlete3," As a young athlete, your bones, muscles, tendons, ligaments, and joints are all still in development, making you more susceptible to joint injuries. You need to be particularly vigilant about maintaining healthy joints and protecting them from injury. Always exercise properly and wear the correct equipment while participating in any activity.A young woman’s joints are typically still growing until about the age of 15. A young man’s joints are still developing until about the age of 17. Damage to developing parts of the body, including joints, can lead to a permanent injury, pain and even disability., When you are tired or in pain your technique is more likely to become sloppy, which can lead to an injury to your joints., Excess weight can place extra strain on your joints and lead to increased wear and tear. This can lead to permanent damage and arthritis later in life. To avoid excess weight gain, try to eat a balanced diet and exercise regularly.Try to eat fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats. Avoid saturated fats and processed foods.

, Certain foods, like apples, berries, papaya, spinach, and avocados are thought to help promote joint health. There is also some evidence that eating a diet high in omega-3 fatty acids, which are commonly found in fish, can limit the symptoms of joint damage, such as pain and inflammation.Besides being illegal for minors, you should avoid smoking tobacco or drinking alcohol, which can result in decreased joint health.Stay properly hydrated, as this is important for joint lubrication and health.
You may also want to consider supplements like glucosamine and hyaluronic acid, which have been shown to promote joint health.
You may also want to get more Vitamin C, which helps repair and maintain the cartilage in your joints."

Think about what you’re lifting.Before trying to pick something up, try to lift up one corner of it to get a feel for how much it weighs.,
Assume the proper lifting position.Spread your feet apart.,
Rise slowly with the object.",How to Avoid Back Pain2," Will you need help lifting it? If so, get the help you need. Is there a hand jack or other tool you might use to move it and save yourself from lifting it? If so, take advantage of it and avoid potential strain.


Know your limits and strength level before attempting to lift something that could be too heavy.
If you can push or pull a given object, push it. Pulling objects can strain your back.

, Place one leg slightly ahead of you. Lower yourself, bending at the knees, and keep your back straight up and down. Tighten your stomach muscles.

, Push off the ground with your feet and rise slowly, keeping your back straight.Keep the load close to your waist. If possible, keep the object lengthwise across your waist or in a vertical position rather than extending out from your waist. Try to keep the weight even.


Do not twist, lean, or turn your hips or back while holding a heavy object.

"
"
Sleep on your side.Bend your legs at the knee and bring them up slightly toward your body.,
Lie on your back when sleeping.If you sleep on your back, lay a pillow beneath your knees so that they are slightly elevated.,
Go to sleep on your stomach.If you do not like sleeping on your back or side, you can sleep on your stomach.",How to Avoid Back Pain3," Place a pillow between your knees. Lay your top arm across your side and thigh. Bring your bottom arm (the arm on which you are lying) straight out from your shoulder and wrap it around your pillow, with your palm facing you.


You can sleep on either your left or right side.

, This will help you keep your lower back curved properly. For additional support, roll a small towel and place it beneath your lower back. Rest your head and neck on a pillow.


Lying on your back and lying on your side when sleeping are equally good positions for avoiding back pain.

, Normally, you should avoid sleeping on your stomach, since it can be hard on your back; however, you can make it easier on your back by putting a pillow beneath your pelvis and lower part of your abdomen. If you can use a pillow without straining your back, do so. Otherwise, sleep without a pillow under your head.

Tighten your abdominal muscles (the muscles of your stomach) so that they push out and away from you. Hold the position for five seconds, then relax your muscles. Next, flatten your back against the ground. Try to bring your abdominal muscles down and keep your back flush with the ground. Repeat the cycle five times each day.


Try to add one or two reps each week as you grow more flexible. Aim for a maximum of thirty each day.
You should be able to feel a flexing in your lower back at each pushing out and pulling in of your abdominal muscles.

, Your core includes muscles in your torso and back (such as the rectus abdominis, obliques, and latissimus dorsi) that protect your spine.Strengthening these muscles may help you avoid back pain, especially pain caused by soft tissue injury or back muscle strain.Exercises to try include the pelvic tilt, sit-ups on an exercise ball, back extensions, cat curls, and more. Speak with a physical therapist or certified trainer to help you determine the best, safest way to strengthen your core and to ensure you are using the proper form while exercising., Try to make your elbows touch behind you. Hold the position for five seconds. Relax briefly, then repeat. Do this exercise twice each night and three times each morning.

, Lifting weights can strengthen your back, but you must always maintain proper form or risk hurting your back. When you lift something — even when you’re outside the gym — keep your back straight and use proper body mechanics. Squat to pick objects up and push off the ground with your knees.Do not bend over at the waist and attempt to pick objects up.


Get a partner to help you lift things that are too heavy.

, Try to walk at least 10,000 steps per day. If you swim, try to progressively lengthen the distance and number of laps you can perform to build back strength.


With any exercise, don't over-stretch or over-exercise. This can pull or strain your muscles and leave you in pain.

, Hold it there by placing both hands over the knee. Maintain the position for five seconds. Put that leg down and bring up the right leg. Hold it again for five seconds by placing both hands over the knee. Put that leg down, then bring up both legs to your chest. Place your right hand over your right knee and your left hand over your left knee. Hold both knees to your chest for five seconds. Repeat the cycle each day, once in the morning and once at night.

, Place your feet flat on the floor and bend your knees at a 45 degree angle. Lift your shoulders slightly off the ground. Roll both knees slowly to the right as far as you can. Your right knee should touch the ground. Hold the position for 10 seconds. Bring your knees back up to center and roll both legs over to the left as far as possible. Your left knee should touch the ground. Repeat the whole cycle daily once in the morning and once at night.

, Cross your left leg over your right leg and place the elbow of your right arm against your left knee. Twist your torso gently to the left and hold for 10 seconds when you’ve reached your maximum turn. Repeat on the opposite side by crossing your right leg over your left and placing your left elbow against your right knee. Repeat three times in the morning and twice each night.

, Tighten your abdominal and gluteal (butt) muscles. With your shoulders and head on the floor, raise your pelvis so that your trunk and thighs are parallel to each other.

Talk with a mental health professional.",How to Treat Upper Back Pain," Upper back pain is often caused by repetitive motions at work or minor injuries related to playing sports or vigorous exercise. As a first measure, take a break from the activity that may have resulted in the strain and rest for a few days. If your problem is work related, talk to your boss about switching to a different activity or improving the ergonomics of your work station. If the pain is exercise related, you may be working out too aggressively or with bad form. In this case, consult with a professional trainer or sports therapist.


Total bed rest is not a good idea for any type of back pain because some movement (even just leisurely walks) is needed to stimulate blood flow and healing.Practice better posture at work and at home. Sit up straight and don't slouch or lean to one side excessively.
Examine your sleeping conditions. Mattresses that are too soft or pillows that are too thick may contribute to upper back pain. Avoid sleeping on your stomach as it can cause the head and neck to twist in ways that aggravate back pain.;
, Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin can be short-term solutions to help you deal with pain or inflammation in your upper back. Keep in mind that these medications can be hard on your stomach, kidneys, and liver, so it's best not to use them for more than two weeks at a stretch.


Dosage for adults is usually 200 – 400 mg, by mouth, every four to six hours.Alternatively, you can try over-the-counter analgesics such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or muscle relaxants (such as cyclobenzaprine) for your upper back pain, but never take them when you are taking NSAIDs.
Be careful not to take any medications on an empty stomach, as they can irritate the lining of your stomach and increase the risk of ulcers.

, The application of ice is an effective treatment for essentially all minor musculoskeletal injuries, including upper back pain. Cold therapy is most effective for acute injuries (injuries that have occurred in the last 48 hours). Cold therapy should be applied to the tender part of your upper back in order to reduce the swelling and pain. Ice should be applied for 20 minutes every two to three hours for a couple of days, then reduce the frequency as the pain and swelling subside.Compressing the ice against your back with a wrap-around elastic support will also help control the inflammation.
Always wrap ice or frozen gel packs in a thin towel in order to prevent frostbite on your skin.

, Soaking your back in a warm Epsom salt bath can significantly reduce pain and swelling, especially if the pain is caused by muscle strain.The magnesium in the salt helps the muscles relax. Don't make the water too hot (to prevent scalding) and don't soak in the bath for much more than 30 minutes because the salty water will pull fluid from your body and start to dehydrate you.


If swelling is a particular problem in your upper back, then follow the warm salt bath with cold therapy until your back feels numb (about 15 minutes or so).

, Stretching the affected area of your back might reverse the condition, especially if you address the problem during its early stages. Use slow, steady movements and take deep breaths during your stretches. In general, hold stretches for about 30 seconds and repeat three to five times daily.


Kneel on a padded surface with your buttocks resting on the soles of your feet. Then bend forward at the waist, walking your fingers forward as far as you can go while trying to touch your nose to the floor.
While standing, place both hands behind your head and slowly push your head backwards while arching or extending your spine so that your stomach sticks out.
While standing with your feet shoulder width apart (for stability and balance), place your arms in front of you, bent at the elbows, and in a controlled fashion, rotate your upper body as far as you can in one direction, then switch and do the other way a few seconds later.

, Rolling on a piece of firm foam is a good way to massage your back and potentially relieve mild-to-moderate discomfort, especially in the mid back (thoracic) region. Foam rollers are commonly used in physiotherapy, yoga and pilates.Pick up a foam roller at a sporting goods or big-box store — they're very inexpensive and nearly indestructible.
Place the foam roller on the ground, perpendicular to where you're going to lay your body. Lie down on your back so that the foam roller is beneath your shoulders. Your body and the roller should form a ""t"" shape.
Put your feet flat on the floor, bend your knees, and lift up your lower back so it rolls over the foam in a back and forth manner.
Use your feet to move your body over the foam, so that your entire spine is massaged (at least 10 minutes). Repeat as many times as necessary, although your muscles might be a little sore after the first time you use a foam roller.

, Medical specialists such as an orthopedist, neurologist, or rheumatologist may be needed to rule out the most serious causes of your upper back pain, such as infection (osteomyelitis), cancer, osteoporosis, spinal fracture, herniated disc, or rheumatoid arthritis.These conditions are not common causes of upper back pain, but if home care and conservative therapies are not effective, then more serious problems need to be considered.


X-rays, bone scans, MRI, CT scan and ultrasound are modalities that specialists may use to help diagnose your upper back pain.
Your doctor may also send you for a blood test to rule out rheumatoid arthritis or a spinal infection.

, Your upper back pain may be caused by chronic joint inflammation. A facet joint injection involves real-time fluoroscopic (X-ray) guidance of a needle through the back muscles and into the inflamed or irritated spinal joint, followed by a release of an anesthetic and corticosteroid mixture, which quickly relieves both pain and inflammation at the site. Facet joint injections take 20 – 30 minutes to do and the results can last from a few weeks to a few months.Facet joint injections are limited to three within a six-month time frame.
The pain relief benefits from facet joint injections typically begin on the second or third day post-treatment. Until that time, your back pain may get a little worse.
Potential complications of facet joint injections include infection, bleeding, local muscle atrophy, and nerve irritation/damage.

, Scoliosis is a sideways curvature of the spine that usually occurs in young people before puberty.It can cause pain in the upper and middle back. You may not notice mild forms of scoliosis, but even mild scoliosis can cause pain or worsen over time, leading to more serious complications such as lung and heart damage or changes to the body's appearance, such as uneven shoulders and hips and a prominent rib cage.The doctor will check for scoliosis by asking the person to bend forward at the waist so he can see if one side of the ribs sticks out more than the other side.The doctor may also check for muscle weakness, numbness, and abnormal reflexes.Learn more about managing pain caused by scoliosis by reading this article: Relieve Back Pain from Scoliosis.

, Surgery for back pain is the last resort and should only be considered after all other conservative therapies are proven ineffective and if the cause warrants such invasive techniques.Reasons for upper back surgery may include to repair or stabilize a fracture (from trauma or osteoporosis), to remove a tumor, to repair a herniated disc, or to combat a deformity such as scoliosis.


Spinal surgery may involve the use of metal rods, pins or other devices for structural support.
Possible complications from back surgery include local infection, allergic reaction to anesthesia, nerve damage, paralysis, and chronic swelling and/or pain.

, A strained muscle occurs when individual muscle fibers are taken beyond their tensile limits and subsequently tear, which leads to pain, inflammation and some degree of guarding (muscle spasm in attempts to prevent further damage). A deep tissue massage is helpful for mild-to-moderate strains because it reduces muscle spasm, combats inflammation, and promotes relaxation.Start with a 30 minute massage, focusing on your upper back and lower neck areas. Allow the therapist to go as deep as you can tolerate without wincing.


Always drink lots of water immediately following a massage in order to flush out inflammatory by-products, lactic acid, and toxins from your body. Failure to do so might cause a headache or mild nausea.
As an alternative to professional massage therapy, position a tennis ball underneath your body and between your shoulder blades (or wherever your upper back pain is). Roll on the ball slowly for 10 – 15 minutes a few times daily until the pain subsides.

, Chiropractors and osteopaths are spinal specialists that focus on establishing normal motion and function of the small spinal joints that connect the vertebrae, called spinal facet joints.Manual joint manipulation, also called an adjustment, can be used to unjam or reposition facet joints that are slightly misaligned, which triggers inflammation and sharp pain, particularly with movement. You can often hear a ""popping"" sound with a spinal adjustment. Traction techniques or stretching of your spine may also help your upper back pain.


Although a single spinal adjustment can sometimes completely relieve your back issue, more than likely it will take three to five treatments to notice significant results.
Chiropractors and osteopaths also use a variety of therapies tailored more towards muscle strains, which may be more appropriate for your upper back issue.
A chiropractor or osteopath may help with improving mobility in the joints.

, If your upper back problem is recurring (chronic) and caused by weak spinal muscles, poor posture or degenerative conditions such as osteoarthritis, then you need to consider some form of rehabilitation. A physical therapist can show you specific and tailored stretches and strengthening exercises for your upper back.Physiotherapy is usually required two to three times per week for four to eight weeks to positively impact chronic back problems.


If need be, a physical therapist can treat your sore muscles with electrotherapy such as therapeutic ultrasound or electronic muscle stimulation.
Good strengthening exercises for your upper back include swimming, rowing, and back extensions, but make sure your injury is resolved first.

, Acupuncture involves sticking very thin needles into specific energy points within the skin in effort to reduce pain and inflammation.Acupuncture for back pain can be effective, especially if it's done when the symptoms first occur. Based on the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture works by releasing a variety of substances including endorphins and serotonin, which act to reduce pain.


It's also claimed that acupuncture stimulates the flow of energy, referred to as chi.
Acupuncture is practiced by a variety of health professionals including some physicians, chiropractors, naturopaths, physical therapists, and massage therapists.

, Though it may initially seem counter-intuitive to see a mental-health professional for physical pain, cognitive-behavioral therapy has shown to help reduce stress and back pain in many people.Keeping a pain diary can also help you deal with your pain and it can be useful information to bring to your doctor.
Stress-relieving practices like meditation, tai chi, and breathing exercises have been found to help alleviate chronic pain and help prevent future injury."

If new pain or tingling occurs during the wrapping process, remove the wrap immediately and see a healthcare professional.
Use caution when applying compression to areas where there is severe peripheral artery disease or a severe infection. Also be aware of any allergies to certain materials, such as latex.;
, You’ll need a roll of compression bandage, bandage clips or pins, and a cloth long enough to serve as a sling.


Wash your hands with an antibacterial soap and clean water before touching the injury or any of the medical supplies.
Alternatively, you can purchase premade shoulder compression wraps.Many of these include built-in pockets for heating or icing implements.Try on a few to ensure you find one that comfortably fits.

, Position the end of the compression bandage on top of the injured shoulder, wrapping backwards around the armpit twice. Unroll the bandage as needed, making sure to keep the end of the bandage in place on their shoulder blade.As you complete the second wrap go down and across the back, beneath the other arm, and around the chest.
Make sure the bandage is snug but not so tight that the person cannot breathe.

, Wrap around the shoulder through the armpit again, and continue wrapping onto the bicep for added support. Ensure the wrap is snug enough to provide sufficient compression to stimulate the flow of blood to the area., Finish wrapping the bandage by pinning the wrap in place where the pins will be safe and secure. At this point, you also need to ensure you have not compressed the muscle tissue too much, as this may detrimentally reduce blood flow (the opposite of what you hope the wrap will achieve).Any numbness indicates that you’ve the wrapped the shoulder too tightly and need to re-wrap the shoulder a bit more loosely.
To ensure the compression bandage is not too tight, check the circulation of the affected arm by pinching a fingertip (including the nail in the pinch) for about two seconds. After about two more seconds, the nail of the pinched finger should return to its normal pinkish color.
If it takes more than two seconds for the pinched nail to turn back, the blood flow may be ineffective because of a tight compression bandage. Remove and reapply the compression bandage until it is snug but not too tight.
If there is any pain, it should start to go down after you apply the bandage. If there is an increase in pain, then redo the wrapping.

Do some neck stretches.,
Do a goalpost stretch.,
Perform a T-stretch.,
Clasp your hands behind your back.,
Make angels on the floor or wall.,
Do a doorway stretch.",How to Work Out to Prevent Hunched Shoulders1," Before you start stretching, warm up your back muscles by rolling your shoulders. Start with a set of ten forward shoulder rolls followed by ten backwards shoulder rolls.You can also do arm circles. Stretch out your arms to either side at shoulder height, and make small circles for about ten seconds. Reverse the direction of the circle, and repeat for another ten seconds.;
, Stand or sit with your back straight and your shoulders squared. Gently stretch your neck muscles by doing the following stretches. All these movements should be performed slowly and carefully, to avoid overextending or straining your muscles:

Tilt your head forward to bring your chin to your chest. Don’t attempt to bring your chin all the way to your chest if it causes you pain; just get as close as you comfortably can.
Lean your head back, lifting your chin toward the ceiling.
Looking straight ahead, tilt your head toward one shoulder, and then the other. Try to touch each shoulder with your ear.
Turn your head to look to the right, and then to the left.
Hold each position for about 20 seconds, and return to the starting position before performing the next stretch.

, For this stretch, you will need a jump rope, yoga strap, belt, or other rope. Stand or sit up straight, and hold one end of the strap in each hand. Perform the stretch as follows:Stretch your arms out in front of your body, keeping them at shoulder height, with your palms facing down. Hold your hands a little more than shoulder-width apart.
As you inhale, lift your arms above your head with your elbows straight, still holding the strap. Keep your palms facing out and your hands a little more than shoulder-width apart.
As you exhale, bring your elbows down to shoulder height and lower the strap behind your head, with your palms still facing out. At this point, your arms should be in a “goalpost” position (upper arms straight out to the sides, forearms bent up at a 90° angle). This should push your shoulders back and open up your chest.
Inhale and stretch your arms up again.
Exhale and bring your arms back to the starting position, straight out in front of you at shoulder height.
This stretch can be repeated three to five times.

, Lie down with a foam roller propped along your spine; your head, shoulders, and upper back should all be touching the roller. Your knees should be bent with your feet flat on the ground. Stretch your arms out to the side to make a “T” shape. Your arms should form a straight line with your shoulders. Hold this pose for one minute., Hold your hands behind your back, keeping your arms straight. Pull back on your shoulders with your arms. You should feel your chest open and stretch as your shoulders squeeze., Lie down on the floor, and prop a rolled towel or foam roller under your spine. Place your arms on the ground above your arm, and gently sweep them down towards your side, as if you were making snow angels on the floor. Do this for two or three minutes.If the foam roller makes it too difficult for you, you can remove it for a simpler exercise.
You can also do this exercise against a wall. Stand with your spine flat against the wall. Hold your arms above your head but pressed against the wall. Bring your arms down slowly to your side and back up again.

, Stand in a doorway with your forearms resting against the door frame in a goalpost position (elbows bent at a 90° angle with the forearms facing straight up). Position your feet so that one is slightly in front of you and the other behind you, in a striding position. Then perform the stretch:

While standing in your starting position, tense your stomach muscles and straighten your back.
Push your upper torso forward while keeping your arms and legs in their original positions. Try to hold this pose for at least 30 seconds.
Relax for a few seconds, then switch the positions of your feet and repeat the stretch.
Do a total of three sets.

Make a temporary splint.,
See a doctor immediately.,
Pick a splint.,
Wear your splint properly.,
Wear your splint constantly until told otherwise.,
Follow up with your doctor.,
Undergo surgery.",How to Treat Mallet Finger with a Splint," First you should try to ascertain whether your injury is actually mallet finger. If you do have mallet finger, the last joint in your finger (the one closest to the nail) will be in pain. The joint will be bent downward and will be immobile, making it impossible to fully straighten.
, Ice will help reduce swelling and tenderness in the joint. However, you should not rub ice directly against the skin. Wrap ice in a towel or take a bag of frozen vegetables and place it on the joint., If you find that you are in severe pain, some readily available medications can help ease your discomfort. These include: Advil, Motrin, Aleve, Naprosyn, and Tylenol. Take these throughout the healing process if pain persists.These medications (except Tylenol) are also anti-inflammatories, which can reduce swelling in addition to pain.

, You should visit a doctor to purchase a professionally constructed splint, but until you can do so, you can try to create a splint that will straighten your finger. Take a popsicle stick and place it along the underside of your finger. Wrap adhesive tape around your finger and the object so that the tape holds your finger tightly against the stick and provides padding for your finger.The goal is to keep the fingertip straight.


If your finger bends at all, it can set back the healing process. Any straight, solid item will work as a splint so long as it is strong enough to hold the finger in place. It is also imperative that the tape is wrapped around tightly so that you do not have enough mobility to bend your finger, but not so tight that you cut off circulation or cause the finger to become numb or discolored.

, The sooner you can visit a doctor and receive a professionally constructed splint, the quicker your injury will heal. You should aim to visit a doctor within a few days, if not the same day of the injury. The doctor will take x-rays and determine whether the tendon was in fact ripped, and whether it took a piece of your bone with it. She will also prescribe treatment — usually a splint.In rare instances where wearing a splint would seriously impede your work — if you were a surgeon for example — it is possible to have a pin inserted into your finger to keep it straight.

, There are several types of splints available. Each will affect the way that you are able to use your finger in different ways. Discuss your habits and occupation with your doctor so that he can better understand what the best fit is for you. Options include the stack splint, aluminum splint, and the Oval-8 Finger split. The last of these covers the least of the finger and will typically be the least invasive.

, Make it tight enough to keep your finger completely straight. If the finger is bent you may develop painful pressure sores at the knuckle. Don't make the tape so tight that the tip of your finger feels uncomfortable or looks purple.

, Although it might be uncomfortable, it's imperative that you keep your finger straight at all times. If your finger does bend at all, the healing tendon might rupture. If that happens, you might need to restart the healing process from the beginning..It can be especially tempting to remove your splint while showering. One of the advantages of the Oval 8 splint is that it can get wet. If you are using a different splint, put your finger in a plastic bag or use a glove., After approximately six to eight weeks the doctor will likely modify your treatment. If you are making progress, he or she will begin to wean you off the stint, so that you might, for example, be instructed to only wear it only at night., Surgery is rarely necessary for mallet finger. However, if your x-ray suggests that your bone was also fractured during the injury, surgery might be required. Otherwise, surgery is not recommended. The outcomes from surgery are typically no better and sometimes worse than conservative treatment with a splint.Approximately ten days after surgery you will meet back up with your doctor to remove the sutures and monitor the progress of the healing.

Understand the connection between being overweight and back pain.,
Declare your commitment to lose weight.,
Eat a healthy diet.Eat primarily fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.,
Recognize and avoid trigger foods.Trigger foods are those that inspire overeating.,
Track the number of calories you ingest and burn.,
Get a workout buddy.,
When you’ve reached a healthy weight, start eating more.,
Don’t bother with diet pills or wonder cures.Many people believe that by raising their metabolism or trying fad diets, they will lose a significant amount of weight.",How to Avoid Back Pain5," If you’re overweight, your back muscles and spine will be working overtime and could easily be strained. Being overweight affects your posture, making it difficult to straighten your spine properly. It may also cause your pelvis to slant forward to accommodate the extra weight, which forces your lower back to curve unnaturally.Staying at a healthy weight can help you avoid back pain.


Your body type may also influence whether or not you experience back pain. Those who carry weight around their midsections put additional strain on their spines, which can lead to serious back pain.

, People find it easier to stay committed to their weight-loss goals and promises when they make a public declaration to do so.Tell a friend or family member you intend to lose weight when you begin your weight loss. If anyone asks why, tell them that you want to avoid back pain and live a healthier life.
Surround yourself with positive people who support your effort.

, Supplement your diet with lean protein like tofu, nuts, and seeds. Do not deprive yourself of a particular food, but avoid eating processed foods that are heavy in salt, sugar, and fat.


Your diet should consist of foods you enjoy and are comfortable with eating every day. Do not adopt extreme diets that you will be unable to maintain over the long term.

, When you are around trigger foods, you may feel powerless to stop eating. Keep a food journal detailing your daily consumption habits and look it over at the end of the day. If you notice patterns of overeating with one particular food, avoid buying it, buy it in smaller portions, or buy it less frequently.


For instance, if you habitually sit down and eat an entire bag of chips while watching TV, buy chips only once or twice each month as a treat.

, The easiest way to track the calories you’ve taken in and burned is through fitness tracking devices or software. For instance, FitBit is a great device to help you stay motivated and track exactly how many calories you’ve burned each day. There are many phone apps like Libra with similar capabilities. These devices allow you to visualize your progress and share your gains with social media.


If you want to go the low-tech route, use a food journal. On one page, write down the drinks and foods you consumed that day and their respective calorie counts. On the opposite page, write down the exercises you did and estimate the calories spent doing each. Tally the totals on each page at the end of each day. If the calories you burned exceeds the number of calories you took in, you’ll be on your way to losing weight.

, Working out can be fun, as well as healthy. Working out with a friend can make exercise even more enjoyable. Choose a friend who is equally committed to losing weight and encourages you to push yourself and meet your goals.


Even if you don’t want a workout buddy, surround yourself with positive people who support your weight loss effort.
Avoid workout buddies who only want to goof off and talk when you’re at the gym together. They will only hinder your progress.

, Continue your exercise regimen so as to continue developing your back muscles. Check your fitness tracking device or food journal to ensure you’re burning and taking in a roughly equal amount of calories each day. By keeping your calorie input and output even, you’ll remain at your current weight.

, While these things may help, their impact is small. The only proven way to lose weight and keep it off is by making lifestyle changes, exercising regularly and eating a healthy diet.

Make sure the injury isn't serious.,
Rest your finger and be patient.,
Apply ice to the jammed finger.,
Take anti-inflammatory medication short-term.,
Buddy tape the injured finger.,
Consult with your family physician.,
See an osteopath or chiropractor.,
Get a referral to an orthopedist.",How to Treat a Jammed Finger," The amount of pain felt from a musculoskeletal injury is not always positively correlated to the degree of seriousness. In other words, an injury may really hurt, but it's not always serious. A jammed finger can often be very painful initially, but it's not nearly as serious of an injury compared to dislocated and fractured fingers.The tell-tale sign of a dislocated or badly fractured finger is some degree of crookedness; a moderate amount of swelling or bruising can also be signs of a fracture. As such, if your finger is really hurting and it's bent at an unnatural angle or is very swollen or bruised, then seek medical attention as soon as you can. If not, then rest and home care is warranted instead.

However, if you have severe symptoms of pain, numbness, weakness, swelling, or bruising of your finger, see your doctor right away.
A jammed finger usually involves damage to the ligaments surrounding the finger joints and reduced movement in the affected joint due to compaction.
A mildly jammed finger is typically categorized as a Grade I sprain, which means that the ligaments are stretched a little too far, but not torn.;
, Mishandling the ball in sports such as basketball, volleyball and baseball is a frequent cause of jammed fingers. If such activity caused your finger injury, then you'll likely have to take a break from the sport — anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks, depending on severity. And depending on what your job is, you may also have miss some work or switch to an activity (short-term) that doesn't involve your hands or fingers to any great extent. In general, sprains, strains, bruises, and most causes of inflammation respond well to short-term rest.









In the mean time, your ability to grab and hold on to things will be hampered with a jammed finger. Typing and writing will also be difficult, especially if the injury is to your dominant hand.
In addition to certain sports, jammed fingers also commonly occur at home — getting caught between doors, particularly., The pain from a jammed finger is mostly due to inflammation, so applying cold therapy as soon as you can is smart because it slows down local circulation, reduces swelling, and numbs nerve fibers.Anything frozen will do, such as ice cubes, gel packs, or bags of vegetables (peas work great) from your freezer. Whatever you choose for cold therapy, apply it every hour for 10-15 minutes until the pain and inflammation subside. After a few days, you'll likely be able to discontinue the use of ice therapy.









While you're icing your jammed finger, elevate your hand/arm with some pillows in order to help combat the effects of gravity and further help with the inflammation.
Don't forget to wrap anything cold in a thin towel before applying it to your finger so you don't get ice burn or frostbite.

, Another effective way of combating inflammation and pain in your jammed finger is to take over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve).NSAIDs help control your body's inflammation cascade, which reduces swelling and pain. Keep in mind that NSAIDs and other pain relievers are usually intended for short-term use only (less than 2 weeks) due to harmful side effects on the stomach, liver and kidneys. To reduce the risk of stomach irritation and/or ulcers, it's best not to take NSAIDs on an empty stomach.









Aspirin should not be given to children under 18, due to the risk of Reye's syndrome, whereas ibuprofen is not appropriate for infants under six months.
If you don't have access to any NSAIDs, then taking painkillers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) can be helpful for a jammed finger also, but painkillers don't reduce inflammation.
As an alternative to taking any pills, consider applying an anti-inflammatory or pain-relieving cream or gel to your jammed finger joint. The cream or gel will absorb locally and eliminate the risk of any stomach problems.

, While your jammed finger is healing, consider taping it to an adjacent finger (commonly referred to as ""buddy taping"") for more stability and protection from further injury.Choose some medical-grade tape and bind your injured finger to the finger beside it that's most similar in size. Be careful not to tape too firmly, otherwise you'll create additional swelling and may even cut off blood circulation to the injured finger. Consider placing some cotton gauze between the fingers to prevent skin blisters.









If you don't have any medical tape, then masking tape, self-adherent wrap, electricians tape, a small Velcro wrap or rubber bandage may also suffice.
To provide a little more support for your jammed finger, you can use a wooden or aluminum splint along with the tape. Aluminum splints can be custom fit and bent to accommodate most finger injuries.

, If rest, immobilization and other home remedies aren't effective for reducing the pain, swelling, or stiffness in your injured finger after a week, then make an appointment with your doctor. Instead of a jammed finger, you might have a small hairline or stress fracture in the long bones of your finger, or an avulsion fracture closer to the joint. Avulsion fractures occur when a sprained ligament tears a piece of bone from its attachment site.If your finger is broken, then your doctor will usually fasten a metal splint to it with instructions to keep it on for a few weeks.









You doctor can take x-rays of your hand and check for evidence of fractures and other disease conditions that can cause pain, such as osteoarthritis (the wear and tear type), osteoporosis (brittle bones), or bone infection.
Keep in mind that small hairline fractures don't usually show up on x-rays until the swelling goes away.
An MRI may be needed to better see the condition of tendons, ligaments, and cartilage in and around your inured finger.

, Osteopaths and chiropractors are joint specialists who focus on restoring normal motion and function to spinal and peripheral joints, including those of the hands and fingers. If your finger joint is truly jammed or even slightly dislocated, then an osteopath or chiropractor can use a technique called manual joint manipulation (or an adjustment) to unjam or reposition the affected joint. You can often hear a ""popping"" or ""cracking"" sound with an adjustment, which often provides immediate relief and improved joint mobility.









Although a single joint adjustment can sometimes completely relieve your finger pain and restore full range of motion to the jammed joint, more than likely it will take a few treatments to notice significant improvement.
Manual joint manipulation is not advised if fractures, infections, or inflammatory (rheumatoid) arthritis is involved.

, If symptoms persist or worsen, or if full mobility does not return to your jammed finger within one to two weeks, then get a referral to an orthopedic surgeon.Orthopedists are also joint specialists, but they use injections and surgery to treat problematic joint injuries that are stubborn to heal. If it turns out that your finger is broken and doesn't heal normally, you may require minor surgery. Alternatively, an injection of steroid medication near or into injured ligaments and








The most common types of steroids used are prednisolone, dexamethasone, and triamcinolone.
Potential complications associated with corticosteroid injections of the hand include infection, tendon weakening, local muscle atrophy, and nerve irritation or damage.

Place the arm in a sling.,
Adjust the sling as needed.It is important to make sure that the sling feels comfortable, so you may need to make some adjustments.,
Ice the injured shoulder if recently injured.,
Shift to a hot compress after 48 hours.",How to Apply Shoulder Injury Compression Wraps2," Using a sling reduces movement of the arm and the injured shoulder while it heals.Aside from purchasing an appropriately-sized sling, you can also make one with a meter-length cloth. Fold the cloth diagonally, arranging it into an elongated triangle that can be wrapped beneath the forearm of the injured arm and secured around the opposite shoulder.
Secure the injured arm at a comfortable angle across the person’s chest (roughly horizontal), with the sling’s strap over the opposite shoulder.
Perform this maneuver as gently as possible to avoid straining the injured arm.

, The entire forearm up to the hand should be supported by the sling. The sling should not be too tight or placed too high up either. If the sling is too high, then you may experience discomfort and tension in your shoulder.

, The cold temperature will actually reduce blood flow to the injured shoulder, which can help reduce any pain and swelling following an injury. Icing with compression is more effective in reducing tissue temperature than icing alone.Wrap the ice pack in a towel or other cloth before wrapping it to your shoulder as directed previously, though with slightly less compression.
Apply the cold pack for no more than 20 minutes. For the best results, remove the cold pack after 20 minutes, let the injured area rest for 20 minutes and then reapply the cold pack for another 20 minutes.
If the injured shoulder becomes numb at any point, remove the cold pack and repeat the compression wrap process before re-applying the cold compress.
Do not apply ice directly to the surface of the skin. This can lead to an increased risk of frostbite. Always wrap the ice pack in a towel first.

, A hot compress will stimulate blood flow to the injured shoulder, which is vital to the recovery process. This will also relax the muscles and reduce any muscle pain. A hot compress can also improve the flexibility of the tendons and ligaments in the injured shoulder.Do not use a hot compress if the injured shoulder is swollen. It may cause more swelling.
Hot compresses are available in multiple forms. Some create warmth via electric power, while others need to be microwaved or simply shaken.
A rubber hot water bottle is best. Whatever you use, be careful that it does not become dangerously hot.
As with a cold press, wrap or hold the hot compress in some sort of cloth before bandaging it to the shoulder as previously directed, though again, with less compression than you had used without an icing or heating element.
Only apply a hot compress to the injured area for 20 minutes at a time.

Seek medical attention for discoloration, numbness, or tingling.,
Get medical attention for open wounds on or near your shoulder.,
See an orthopedic specialist to help identify a persistent shoulder injury.",How to Apply Shoulder Injury Compression Wraps3," These symptoms may indicate a serious injury that cannot be wrapped at home and must be looked at by a doctor, who may suggest other treatment options, such as surgery.


Bluish discoloration, numbness, tingling, prickling, stinging or any odd sensations felt in the injured shoulder likely indicate insufficient blood and oxygen supply to the area.See a doctor if you experience any of these sensations.

, An open wound indicates significant force placed on the shoulder during a fall or accident, and you may not have recognized the internal damage to your shoulder.The skin may even have been punctured by a broken bone, which definitely necessitates professional medical attention.

, An orthopedic specialist can help identify the type and severity of your injury. They will also be able to provide you the best advice in terms of treatment options, including specific ways to wrap and compress a shoulder."

Stand in a downward facing dog pose.,
Lift dumbbells in a Y-raise.,
Row with a resistance band.,
Perform lat pull downs.",How to Work Out to Prevent Hunched Shoulders2," Start by standing, and lean forward until your hands are on the ground and your hips in the air. Imagine your body is a straight line from your hips to your hands; this will help you lengthen your spine. Hold this pose for up to a minute., Lie face down on a stability ball while holding a dumbbell in each hand. Your legs should extend straight behind you, and your feet should be spaced slightly wider than your shoulders. When you start, your arms should be stretched out below your shoulders. Lift the dumbbells up to shoulder height, keeping your arms straight, before lowering them down again.Do two to three sets of ten reps.

, Set up a resistance band on a door or sturdy piece of furniture. Holding onto the ends of the band, move back a few feet. With your legs slightly bent and spine straight, start “rowing” with the band by pulling your elbows back behind your waist. Squeeze your shoulder blades, and return to starting position.Do two or three sets of 10-20 reps each, or two or three sets lasting 30-60 seconds.
You should continue until you begin to feel a burning sensation in the back of your shoulders and arms.
If this exercise is too difficult, you might try sitting on a chair while doing it.
The resistance band should be about waist height.

, At the gym, find a pull-down machine with a wide bar. Hold the bar with your chest slightly puffed out. As you exhale, pull the bar down until it almost touches your chest. After holding the pose for a second, slowly raise the bar back to starting position, inhaling as you do so.Start out doing one or two sets of 10-15 reps each. As you build strength and get more comfortable with the exercise, you can start gradually increasing your number of sets and/or reps, and adding more weight.

This should be similar to the beginning of a push-up, but instead of lowering yourself, you will hold this position for at least 30 seconds.Keep your abdominal muscles pulled in to help stability.
This exercise will build strength throughout your body, including your shoulders and back.
If this move is too easy for you, try doing it while resting on your forearms.

, Sit with your legs extended straight in front of you and your feet together. Put your hands behind your back, fingers pointing forward. Lift your body up, straightening out your back and spine as you do so. Keep your shoulders square as you do this. Do not allow them to pull forward or up towards your ears. Your body should form a straight line leading down between your head and your toes.Hold this pose for up to ten seconds, before slowly returning to the starting position.
Your feet should be pointed as you raise your body.

, Start with your back against the ground. Hold an exercise ball between your knees and elbows. Stretch out your right leg and your left arm while the left leg and right arm hold the exercise ball. Bring the arm and leg back in so that they are holding the exercise ball, and stretch out the other leg and arm.Do eight to ten reps on each leg.

, Lie down with a foam roller under your shoulders. The roller should be placed perpendicular to your spine, i.e., widthwise from shoulder to shoulder. Bend your legs with both feet flat on the ground. With your hands behind your head, pull in your elbows towards one another, and lean your head back against the floor. Push through your legs to move your back, causing the foam roller to roll up or down your spine. Roll the foam up or down until you reach a sensitive, tense, or sore spot. Slowly lift your head ten times before returning to the starting position.Once you have done one set, roll the foam to a new position, and repeat until you have worked your entire spine.

Then move your head down and your spine up while rounding out your back and stretching out your spine.








If you have a neck injury, speak to your doctor about whether or not this pose is appropriate. If your neck is simply sore, just be sure to keep your neck in line with your torso instead of tucking your chin toward your chest.
Also, if you have difficulty rounding your upper back, have a friend place a hand in the middle of your shoulder blades while you push your vertebrae against it.;
, Start from the cat pose (on your hands and knees with a rounded spine, hands flat with fingers pointing away from you). Slowly straighten your back and then keep going until your spine is concave and you are looking up. Hold for five seconds, then transition back to cat pose.








The gentle tension and release in the spine helps to increase flexibility and to ease lower back pain.
The dog exercise is also known as the cow exercise in yoga.

, To do this pose, you should lie flat on your stomach and then bend your elbows and place your palms under your armpits. Then gently push up your chest and upper body until your chest is a few feet up from the ground.









The crocodile pose, particularly if you practice yogic breathing as you perform the exercise, will help to decrease feelings of anxiety in addition to stretching the back., Sit down with your legs bent at the knees and your calves and feet at your sides, with the soles of your feet facing up. The big toe of each foot should be touching or just an inch or two away from your sides. Place your hands on your lap.

Give it time.,
Schedule an appointment with your doctor.,
Get a referral to a specialist.,
Understand the cause of your backache.",How to Treat a Backache1," Most achy backs caused by overwork or minor accidents (such as slip and falls) resolve on their own with a few days or so. As such, if the pain isn't severe, have some patience and the likelihood of your backache going away is actually pretty good with or without any kind of treatment.Severe pain combined with numbness or tingling in the legs is often a sign of a serious back injury.
It's important to seek professional help if your back pain also involves trouble urinating, fever or unintentional weight loss.;
, If you develop back pain that won't go away after a few days of taking it easy, then schedule an appointment with your family physician. Your doctor will examine your back (spine) and ask questions about your family history, diet and lifestyle, and maybe even take X-rays or send you for a blood test (to rule out rheumatoid arthritis or a spinal infection). However, your family doctor is not a musculoskeletal or spinal specialist, so you may need a referral to another doctor with more specialized training.


Your family doctor may recommend over-the-counter anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen, or analgesics (pain killers) such as acetaminophen to help you cope with your backache.

, Consider seeing a specialist if your backache is not relieved by rest and medications. Mechanical low back pain is not considered a serious medical condition, although it can be very painful and debilitating, causing you to miss work or athletic activities. Typical causes include muscle strains, spinal joint sprains, spinal nerve irritation and spinal disc degeneration.However, medical specialists such as an orthopedist, neurologist or rheumatologist may be needed to rule out the most serious causes such as infection (osteomyelitis), cancer, osteoporosis, spinal fracture, herniated disc, kidney disease or rheumatoid arthritis.


X-rays, bone scans, MRI, CT scan and ultrasound are modalities that specialists may use to help diagnose your backache.
The low back, or lumbar region, is more susceptible to injury and pain because it supports the weight of the upper body.

, Make sure you get the doctor to clearly explain the diagnosis, especially the cause (if possible), and provide you with various treatment options for your condition. Only the most serious causes of back pain require surgical intervention, which is quite rare. Sometimes mild backaches resolve on their own within a few days, but for more debilitating back pain, treatment is recommended because it will likely reduce the duration of the pain and lower the risk of a recurrent (chronic) problem.


Pain from mechanical back pain can be severe, but it doesn't involve high fevers, rapid weight loss, bladder / bowel problems or loss of leg function, which are all signs of something more serious.
Common causes of backache include poor posture, improper lifting technique, obesity, sedentary lifestyle and mild trauma from athletic activities.

As you twist your body from side to side, make sure to use a slow and fluid motion to avoid injury. Keep your abdominal muscles contracted to support your back muscles.
Hold for 10 seconds and then release. Do the same for your other leg.

, With this exercise, you will drape your body over an exercise ball before stretching to extend your back. Drape yourself over the ball so your stomach and pelvis are comfortably resting. Then place your hands behind your head, as if you were doing a sit-up, and stretch your body upward, making your back concave. The stability ball provides extra support and helps the spine to curve naturally, as you stretch your back.








Engage your glutes and your hamstrings so that you don’t overarch your back and so that you have a stable base for the exercise., This stretch helps you to relax both your back and your hamstrings. First, lie flat on your back and place your legs together. Then, lift your knees up so that your thighs are perpendicular to the ground while your shins are parallel to the ground. Keep your arms at your sides as you feel the stretch in your back.









From the 90/90 position, you can gently pull your knees into your chest to stretch the back even further.
You can also tilt your legs to the right and left sides, keeping the small of your back pressed into the floor.

, This exercise requires you to sit on the floor and to twist your upper body to either side at the waist, stretching the back. First, sit down with your legs stretched out. Then, tuck in your left knee until it faces up and then move it over your right thigh. Keep your right leg extended while your left knee is facing upwards, and twist to your left side. Place your right elbow to the side of your left knee to intensify the stretch. Hold the stretch for at least 20 seconds and repeat it on your other side.








Focus on stretching your body upward as well as to the left or right.
If you're stretching to the left, try looking over your left shoulder for a bonus. Follow the same process on your right side.

, Performing this stretch will help you to increase the flexibility of your upper back. Breathe deeply during the exercise, expanding the lower kidney area of the back as the lower rib cage opens up.







, The seal pose requires good flexibility and should be avoided if you have a back injury. However, for those in good condition, the seal pose will round out the lower back while strengthening the abdominal muscles. First, sit down on the ground, then bend your knees. Lift your legs until your thighs are almost vertical to the ground with your shins pointed outward. Place your feet together but create a space between your shins and thighs.









Then, move your forearms through the space between your thighs, tuck them under your calves, and reach out to wrap them around your ankles.
Hold this pose for at least 20 seconds if you feel comfortable with it.

Do a seated twist.,
Roll your shoulders.,
Give yourself a hug.,
Do the ""leg hug."",
Stand and touch your toes.,
Do the forearm shoulder stretch.,
Stretch your upper back.",How to Stretch Your Back3," This is a good stretch for your back without getting up from your chair. To do a seated twist, simply sit upright with your back erect, and slowly twist to one side from the waist, moving your waist, stomach, back, and shoulders all in one direction. Once you have twisted to one side for 15-20 seconds, you can revert to the middle position and then twist to the other side. 








Make sure to do this slowly and carefully. If you twist too quickly or too far to one side, you can strain your neck or back. Try to avoid twisting to the point of causing a ""pop,"" as this can cause misalignment.
To deepen the twist, you can place one hand on your opposite knee, and gently push back against it. If you are twisting to the left, place your right hand on the outside edge of your left knee.
Look over your left shoulder if you are twisting to the left. If you are twisting to the right, look over your right shoulder.
You can also place your arms on the side of the chair that you're stretching towards. If you are stretching toward the left, then place both arms on the left side of your chair.

, You can do this stretch, not only at your office, but while you are walking around town, sitting in your car, or even in the shower. To complete this stretch, sit upright with your back erect. Roll your shoulders back in a circular motion 10 – 15 times, and then pause, and roll them forward for the same amount of times. Repeat at least five sets of the backward and forward motion.









Look straight ahead while you are rolling your shoulders so that you don't strain your neck muscles while you perform this technique.

, This simple move stretches your shoulders and upper back. Place your right arm over your left shoulder and your left arm over your right shoulder, as if you were giving yourself a hug. Hold this position for at least ten seconds, breathing in and out to relieve the tension from your body.







, This move will stretch your back, neck, and shoulders. First, sit on the edge of a stationary chair. If the chair has wheels, wedge it against a desk or a wall. Place your feet together flat on the floor. Then lean over toward your feet, so your chest rests on or near your knees. Let your arms fall to the floor as if you are a rag doll. Then place your hands around your legs, with your right or dominant hand grabbing the opposite wrist, forearm, or even elbow.








Hold this position for at least 10 seconds and then release it. Repeat it at least two times.

, This stretch is simple but effective and stretches your upper and lower back. This stretch should push your hamstrings more than your actual back. Your spine extends all the way to your tailbone. So keep your back and butt on an even place. Touch your toes and then gradually try to straighten your legs. 








Hold the stretch for at least ten seconds, come up, and repeat the stretch at least five times.

, This technique is effective not only for stretching your shoulders but for stretching your upper back. You can do this stretch without getting up from your chair. Simply take your right arm and move it to the left side of your body, so your upper arm moves across your chest and your forearm is placed over the inside of your left elbow. Stretch up your left forearm so your right forearm is ""trapped"" between your left bicep and elbow, and move it closer toward your body as you feel the deep stretch in your right shoulder.








Hold the stretch for at least 10 – 15 seconds.
Repeat this process with your left side.

, Simply sit down with a straight spine and reach your hands straight in front of you, making them parallel to the ground. Then, press your palms gently into each other. Round your back slightly and lean forward for 20 – 30 seconds, pretending like you're stretching over a large round ball. Let your head and neck relax as you try this move. Return to the sitting position with your hands at your sides and repeat this process at least five times.

Take an Epsom salt bath.,
See a massage therapist.,
Talk to your doctor or a physical therapist about exercise.,
Take muscle relaxants.",How to Treat a Backache2," Muscle strains (or pulls) are the most common cause of backaches. The para-spinal muscles of the lower back are thick and powerful, but they become susceptible to injury when they get chilled, dehydrated or overworked. Soaking your entire back and legs in a warm Epsom salt bath can significantly reduce pain, swelling and muscle tension.The magnesium in the salt helps the muscle fibers relax and heal, which sometimes provides surprisingly quick pain relief.


Make sure the salt bath isn't too hot because otherwise it will pull water from your body, dehydrate your muscles and increase the risk of further damage.
Backaches from muscle strains are usually described as dull and achy in nature and are not particularly debilitating. Some range of motion is restricted, but walking, sitting and sleeping are not usually impaired.

, A strained muscle occurs when individual muscle fibers are taken beyond their tensile limits and subsequently tear, which leads to pain, inflammation and some degree of guarding (muscle spasm in attempts to prevent further damage). A deep tissue massage is helpful for mild-to-moderate strains because it reduces muscle spasm, combats inflammation and promotes relaxation.Start with a 30 minute massage, focusing on your low back and hips. Allow the therapist to go as deep as you can tolerate without wincing.


Always drink lots of water immediately following a massage in order to flush inflammatory by-products, lactic acid and toxins from your body. Failure to do so might cause a headache or mild nausea.
As an alternative to massage therapy, position a tennis ball underneath your body, near your backache. Roll on the ball slowly until the pain subsides.

, A muscle strain will improve faster if you begin gentle stretching and strengthening exercises as early as possible. Make sure you always perform exercises within a pain-free range of motion. If you have an acute muscle strain (an injury that occurred recently), beginning a gentle aerobic exercise program such as walking will be beneficial. If you feel pain at any time during your exercise, stop and consult your physician.

, Muscle relaxant medication (such as cyclobenzaprine) can certainly ease the discomfort of mild-to-moderate backache that's caused by injured muscles, but they tend to be hard on the stomach, kidneys and liver, so they should be viewed as short-term help at best. Keep in mind that muscle relaxants can make other muscles in your body feel strange because they circulate everywhere through the bloodstream, not just the back.


Side effects of muscle relaxant use include drowsiness, dry mouth, constipation and confusion.An alternative to muscles relaxants are anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen.

Reduce your activity level.,
Apply ice.,
See a chiropractor or osteopath.,
Get a facet joint injection.",How to Treat a Backache3," The first step is rest — stop all exacerbating activity in order to address your injury, at least for a few days or so. More rest (a few weeks) may be needed depending on the severity of your back injury. For a backache, laying on your back with your knees bent and legs slightly elevated is a good idea because it can take the pressure off the low back joints and provide some pain relief.


Laying on your back for hours at a time is not a good idea, either. Get up at least once an hour to move around even a little bit, and try going for a leisurely walk every day.
Avoid excessive sitting (more than 30 minutes at a time) because it puts more pressure on the low back joints and may further irritate them.

, Cold therapy (ice wrapped in a thin towel or frozen gel packs) should be applied to the injury as soon as possible in order to stop reduce inflammation. Ice should be applied for 10 – 15 minutes every hour, then reduce the frequency as the pain and swelling subside.Compressing the ice against your back will help to further combat the inflammation.


Backaches from joint sprains are usually described as sharp and shooting in nature and they tend to be fairly debilitating. Most range of motion in the affected area is lost, and walking, sitting and sleeping are noticeably impaired.
People with spinal joint sprains usually walk hunched over and to the side because the muscles surrounding the affected joints quickly spasm to ""guard"" the injury.

, Chiropractors and osteopaths are spinal specialists that focus on establishing normal motion and function of the small spinal joints that connect the vertebrae, called spinal facet joints. Manual joint manipulation, also called an adjustment, can be used to unjam or reposition facet joints that are slightly misaligned, which triggers inflammation and sharp pain, particularly with movement. You can often hear a ""popping"" sound with a spinal adjustment, similar in concept to when you extend your knuckles. Traction techniques or stretching of your spine may also help.


Although a single spinal adjustment can sometimes completely relieve your back sprain, more than likely it will take three to five treatments to notice significant results.
If uneven leg lengths or flat feet is deemed to be the primary cause of your backache, then your doctor or chiropractor may recommend orthotics, which are custom made shoe inserts that support the arches, promote better biomechanics when running or walking, and help alleviate back pain.

, A facet joint injection involves real-time fluoroscopic (X-ray) guidance of a needle through the back muscles and into the inflamed or irritated spinal joint, followed by a release of an anesthetic and corticosteroid mixture, which quickly relieves both pain and inflammation at the site. Facet joint injections take 20 – 30 minutes to do and the results can last from a few weeks to a few months.Facet joint injections are limited to three within a six-month time frame.
The pain relief benefits from facet joint injections typically begin on the second or third day post treatment. Until that time frame, your backache may get a little worse.

Seek out physiotherapy.,
Try acupuncture.,
Try yoga and meditation.",How to Treat a Backache4," If your backache is recurring (chronic) and caused by weak spinal muscles, poor posture or degenerative conditions such as osteoarthritis, then you need to consider some form of rehabilitation. A physical therapist can show you specific and tailored stretches and strengthening exercises for your back, hips and abdominals (which can all be implicated with chronic low back pain).Physiotherapy is usually required 2-3x per week for 4-8 weeks to positively impact chronic back problems.


If need be, a physical therapist can treat your sore muscles with electrotherapy such as therapeutic ultrasound, electronic muscle stimulation or microcurrent.
Good strengthening exercises for your back include swimming, rowing and back extensions, but make sure your injury is resolved first.

, Acupuncture involves sticking very thin needles into specific energy points within the skin / muscle in efforts to reduce pain and inflammation.Acupuncture can be effective for many different causes of backache, especially if it's done when the symptoms first occur. Based on the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture works by releasing a variety of substances including endorphins and serotonin, which act to reduce pain.


It's also claimed that acupuncture stimulates the flow of energy, referred to as chi.
Acupuncture is practiced by a variety of health professionals including some physicians, chiropractors, naturopaths, physical therapists and massage therapists.

, Yoga and meditation are other aspects of traditional Chinese medicine.Yoga may be an effective strategy for alleviating back pain by making people more aware of how they move their bodies. It also helps to stretch (elongate) muscles, improves flexibility and often has a calming or relaxing effect on people.Meditation often goes hand-in-hand with yoga and acts to reduce emotional and physical stress, which are contributors to chronic back pain.


Mindful meditation has been shown to be effective in reducing pain. One study found that 3 sessions over 3 days for 20 minutes each was able to significantly reduce pain. In addition, pain was reduced after meditation, meaning the results lasted long after meditation was finished. People that are depressed or suffer severe trauma are more likely to experience chronic aches and pains.

Take an antihistamine.,
Visit a doctor.,
Clean out your nose.,
Use a Neti pot.,
Drink lots of water.,
Try herbal remedies.,
Humidify your air.",How to Get Your Nose to Stop Running With Allergies1," As the name suggests, antihistamines prevent the body from producing histamines, which cause your nose to run. Antihistamines dry out the mucus membranes in your nasal passages . You can try over-the-counter antihistamines that contain agents such as loratadine or diphenhydramine. Common antihistamines are Allegra, Claritin, Zyrtec, Benadryl, Phenergan, and Clarinex.Benadryl is likely to cause some sedation, while Claritin tends to cause the least. Take the necessary precautions when using a medication that may cause drowsiness.;
, Your doctor will be able to prescribe an allergy medicine. He or she will prescribe either an antihistamine, a corticosteroid (nasal spray), various decongestants, a leukotriene inhibitors, or allergy shots. These shots are sometimes recommended if you cannot avoid pollen or other allergens. The goal is to acclimate your body to the presence of certain allergens.Remember that prescription-strength antihistamines are indeed stronger, and they also come with stronger side effects such as anxiety, diarrhea, increased blood pressure, and even insomnia.Studies show that daily use of corticosteroid nasal sprays can be very effective in reducing nasal symptoms caused by allergies. Some sprays, such as Flonase and Nasacort, are also available without a prescription.
Don't overuse decongestant nasal sprays. rebound congestion of the nasal mucosa when you try to stop using them, and this may cause a dependency on nasal sprays.Visit your doctor if you have severe allergy symptoms, increased wheezing or coughing, or if your symptoms do not respond to treatment.

, Use a saline nasal spray. Saline nasal sprays can help keep the mucus membranes moist. They are available over the counter without a prescription, and they work both to keep the mucus membranes moist and flush irritants out of your nasal passages.


Some people prefer to make their own saline cure. Sprinkle some salt in a cooking pan with 1 cup of water, 1/2 tsp of salt, and a pinch of baking soda. Then bring your concoction to a boil. Once it has begun boiling, pour it into a bowl. Place a towel over your head and put your face over the bowl, but not too close or you may burn yourself on the steam. Breathe in the steam. Adding some eucalyptus oil/salve can help soothe your raw sinuses., Fill the pot with 240 milliliters (8.1  fl oz) (8 fl oz) of lukewarm distilled, filtered, or previously boiled water. Try to avoid using tap water unless it has been properly boiled and cooled down. Distilled water is recommended. You can add your own mixture of saline solution or use over the counter products.


Tilt your head to one side while standing near a sink. Position the spout of the pot in one of your nasal passages and then pour half of the solution, allowing the solution to come out of the other nasal passage.Repeat with your other nasal passage. Clean and disinfect the Neti pot after each use.

, Although your nose probably won’t stop running the second you put down the empty water glass, it’s important to stay hydrated when you are experiencing allergy symptoms. Blowing your nose over and over and taking medication with dehydrating side-effects will dry out your mucus membranes. Drinking a 16 ounce glass of water every couple of hours can help to reestablish your system’s equilibrium., Several at-home herbal remedies exist that act as antihistamines.


Mustard oil. It has antihistamine properties. Take a dollop of mustard and heat it up in a kitchen pan with a little water. When the solution is thin enough to be sucked into an eye dropper, transfer a small amount into one of your nostrils. Breathe it in deep. Because mustard has such a strong scent, it can take a few seconds to recover from the initial blast.
Turmeric. This herb has long been valued by Indian culture for both its culinary and medicinal properties. Soak a small amount of Turmeric powder in pure linseed oil, which can be purchased at most health food stores. Hold the linseed-oil-laced Turmeric over a heat source until it begins smoldering. Gently inhale some of the smoke.

, Buy an air humidifier or two. There are several kinds to choose from.Although it seems counter-intuitive, allergies tend to inhibit the body processes that keep the nasal passages moist. When you first come into contact with your allergic trigger, the body produces chemicals called histamines that cause the mucus membranes to swell and dry up. And then, when more air-born particles enter this dry environment—often the same particles such as pollen that triggered the allergic reaction in the first place—the body starts up the runny nose in an effort to expel them and reestablish the system’s equilibrium. Humidifiers distribute moisture into the air which helps keep nasal passages moist.


The ideal humidity in your house should be between 30 and 50 percent. Any lower and it will be too dry for your nose. Any higher and your room will seem stuffy. It could also breed mold and bacteria.Most humidifiers are not powerful enough to treat your entire house. Place them in the room or rooms where you spend the most time in order to have the greatest effect. When you exit the humidified environment, however, your mucus membranes will start to dry up again.

Tilt your pelvis.,
Make a hip bridge.,
Swim on the floor.,
Try the bird dog exercise.,
Add in some lunges.,
Engage your core with planks.,
Use a stability ball to increase difficulty.",How to Strengthen Your Lower Back1," The pelvis tilt helps strengthen the muscles at the base of your abdomen as well as the muscles around your lower back. Become familiar with contracting this muscle to help strengthen it so you have fewer lower back problems.To do this exercise, lay on your back with your knees bent so that your feet are flat on the floor. Your legs should be about hip-width apart.
Press the curve of your lower back into the floor and hold it for 5 to 10 seconds, breathing deeply, then release. Do 10 repetitions of this exercise.;
, The hip bridge also works to strengthen the muscles in your lower back and core that support your spine, putting you at less risk for lower back pain. Lay on your back for this exercise with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor, as you did for pelvis tilts.Lift your hips toward the ceiling, keeping your knees bent and engaging your core. Stop when your hips are even with your knees, such that you could draw a straight line (or a bridge) from your knees to your shoulders.
Hold the position for 5 to 10 seconds, breathing deeply, then lower to the ground. Perform 10 repetitions of this exercise.

, For this exercise, also known as the Superman exercise, you want to lay facedown on the floor with your legs extended behind you and your arms extended straight overhead.If you're already laying on your back, flip over onto your stomach. Reach your hands over your head and extend your legs behind you.
Raise your legs a few inches and kick them, alternating sides. You also can lift your left leg and right arm together, then lower and lift your right leg and left arm.
Complete 10 to 20 repetitions of this exercise.

, The bird dog exercise can help stretch and strengthen your lower back, as well as improving your balance. Start the bird dog exercise by getting on all fours with your knees directly under your hips and your wrists directly under your shoulders.Reach your left arm forward and your right leg backward, creating a straight line from your fingertips to your heel. Keep your back flat, hold for two or three seconds, then return to all fours and repeat with the other side.
Do 10 to 20 repetitions of this exercise on each side. Keep your back flat and motionless, and don't lift your hand or heel higher than your back.

, Lunges, if done correctly, are a good exercise to strengthen your lower back. Start by standing with your legs about hip-width apart. Make sure there are several feet of space in front of you.Step forward with your right leg, lowering and bending your left knee. There should be a straight line from the top of your head to your left knee – don't lean forward over your right leg. Bend your right knee to a right angle with your knee directly over your ankle and your thigh parallel to the floor.
Hold the lunge for a couple seconds, then step back to your original position and repeat with the left leg forward. Do 5 to 10 repetitions on each side.

, Since the muscles in your lower back are part of your core abdominal muscles, you can't strengthen your lower back without strengthening your core.Start on your stomach with your legs extended behind you. Raise up so that you are on your hands and toes, with your body creating a straight line from the crown of your head to your heels.
If you don't have much experience with planks, you can modify the exercise by coming to your knees and elbows, or to your toes and elbows so that your upper body is supported by your forearms rather than just your wrists.
Side planks work the core muscles along your sides. Come up on one forearm, stacking your ankles one over top of the other. Make sure your elbow is directly under your shoulder.

, Once you've done these back-strengthening exercises for awhile, they'll become less challenging. A stability ball adds a balance element to push your muscles to work harder.For example, if you put your feet on a stability ball to do a bridge, you'll find the bridge is much more difficult to do as well as to maintain.

By learning about the most common hidden allergens, you’ll be better equipped to avoid them. The eight most common allergens are:Soy
Shellfish
Fish
Milk
Peanuts
Tree nuts
Wheat
Eggs;
, Without knowing the names of different allergens and allergen-derived products, you won't be able to avoid the things you are allergic to. Be sure to read food labels and ingredient lists on all products before consuming them. Depending on your allergy, you'll want to keep an eye out for certain ingredients or products.


Ingredients commonly derived from eggs include: albumin (or albumen), lysozyme, ovalbumin, and surimi. (Find more here: http://www.kidswithfoodallergies.org/media/Egg-Allergy-Avoidance-List-Hidden-Names.pdf)
Products that include peanuts are: artificial nuts, beer nuts, ground nuts, nut meat, nougat, and marzipan. (Find more here: http://www.kidswithfoodallergies.org/media/Peanut-Allergy-Avoidance-List-Hidden-Names.pdf)
Ingredients derived from milk include: casein, diacetyl, ghee, lactalbumin, lactoferrin, and tagatose. (Find more here: http://www.kidswithfoodallergies.org/media/Milk-Allergy-Avoidance-List-Hidden-Names.pdf)
Some products that are made from soy include: miso, natto, shoyu, soya, tamari, tempeh, and textured vegetable protein. (Find more here: http://www.kidswithfoodallergies.org/media/Soy-Allergy-Avoidance-List-Hidden-Names.pdf)
Wheat, too, is present in a variety of products. Watch for the following ingredients or products: bread, flour, bulgur, spelt, cereal extract, tabbouleh, triticale, triticum, and many more. (Find more here: http://www.kidswithfoodallergies.org/media/Wheat-Allergy-Avoidance-List-Hidden-Names.pdf)
Fish is also hidden in many products, including: worcestershire sauce, imitation fish, barbecue sauce, and Caesar salad dressing. (Find more here: https://www.foodallergy.org/file/tips-avoid-allergen.pdf), This is especially important since many companies use the same equipment to produce a wide variety of products. As a result, show caution when consuming products that might be manufactured on equipment contaminated with allergens you are allergic to. Shared equipment is often used to produce the following products:Ice cream, milk, peanuts, and tree nuts
Pasta and eggs
Tree nuts, peanuts, and baked goods
Tree nuts and cereal

, Sometimes companies will either accidentally add allergens to products or switch components without changing labeling or alerting consumers. By learning about these potentialities, you’ll be able to safeguard yourself and your family.Show caution when purchasing brands that have previously mislabeled food.
Understand that “may contain” labels indicate that hidden allergens may be present in food.
Some recent cases of mislabeling include M&Ms in 2014and Winco salad dressing in 2016., Make sure to pick a restaurant with a solid reputation of being conscientious about food allergens. By picking the right restaurant, you'll drastically reduce the chances of your server getting your order wrong or your meal being contaminated with hidden allergens. You can even look for restaurants that advertise themselves as gluten-free (if you have a wheat allergy) or vegan (if you have a fish or milk allergy), which can help you avoid your allergens with confidence.Ask friends and others you know. Your friends, family, and even your allergist may be able to make recommendations about safe places to eat.
Avoid restaurants with a one-size-fits-all approach. The more time the server spends taking your order and the cook spends preparing it, the less likely it will contain hidden allergens. For example, avoid buffets or establishments where the food is prepared before you order.
Stay away from establishments that are likely to cross-contaminate food. For example, avoid bakeries or even Asian restaurants that might favor ingredients like peanuts.
Favor national chains where ingredients are the same or places you've eaten successfully before.

, Before you arrive for your meal, call the restaurant and talk to them about your allergies. By contacting them before hand, you'll get a lot of information about whether or not they can accommodate you.Try to call at slow time, like before the lunch rush (10am to 11am) or in the middle of the afternoon (like 2pm to 4pm).
Ask them explicitly whether they can accommodate you. For instance, say ""Hello, I'm interested in eating at your establishment. Has your staff been trained or educated about food allergies?""
Let them know what you are allergic to.

, The busier the restaurant, the higher the chance that a server or someone preparing your food will overlook your needs.If you are not familiar with the restaurant, call and ask when they are most busy — avoid these times and days.
Many restaurants are typically slower Monday through Thursday.
If you're going for breakfast, try to arrive after the rush, around 9am. If you are going for lunch, arrive early (around 11am) or late (after 1pm). If you are eating out for dinner, arrive early (5pm) or late (after 8pm).

, Chef cards are small pieces of paper, sometimes laminated, that list your allergies and provide specific instructions about how your food should be prepared. They are increasingly popular among people who have serious allergies.List all relevant information about your allergy on the chef card. For example, if you are allergic to shellfish or peanuts, list that.
Include relevant medical information as well. For example, if you have an allergy to certain medicines like sulfa drugs, list them. If you may need an epipen injection after consuming peanuts, include that information.

, By explaining your allergy to restaurant staff or whoever is preparing your food, you’ll make sure that they have all the information they need to make sure that your food does not contain anything to which you are allergic.Tell them that even minor contamination may be a trigger for your allergy.
List all ingredients you are allergic to. For instance, if you are allergic to peanuts and shellfish, tell them.
Make sure they understand the severity of your allergy. Let them know if peanuts cause you to go into anaphylactic shock.
If you have a severe allergy, explain that even the simplest contamination (such as baking your dish in an oven next to another dish that contains the allergen) could set off a serious allergic reaction.

, While explaining your allergy is a necessity, you also need to be proactive when it comes to discerning the ingredients in whatever you order. Ultimately, asking about ingredients is the only way you’ll be able to verify the absence of food allergens in your food.See if the server or manager can tell you what is in a specific dish. For instance, if you are allergic to dairy, ask “Does this dish contain any dairy products?”
If you want, ask the server for a list of ingredients. This way, you can feel more confident about what you are eating.
Ask whether the entire dish is made in-house. If part of the dish is made by a third party, the restaurant or person may not have enough information to answer your question.
If possible, see if you can talk to the chef about ingredients.

, Although it is critical to determine the ingredients of any dish, you should also inquire about the preparation of your food. Ultimately, the preparation process makes contamination and the introduction of food allergens possible.While you may spend most of your time communicating with your server, see if it is possible to briefly speak with the chef and/or manager.
Ask if they use separate equipment for certain ingredients. For instance, do they prepare and bake oatmeal cookies on separate equipment than peanut butter cookies?
Find out if they take steps to separate potential allergens from other foods. For instance, do they store peanuts and tree nuts in a separate pantry or part of the kitchen from other foods?

, In some cases, you may not be able to eat at certain establishments. Ultimately, if the person preparing the food can’t explain what is in their food or their preparation methods, then you are best off not eating the food. Don’t eat out if:Waiters, cooks, or others who prepare the food can’t confidently answer your questions.
A certain food establishment is unwilling to provide you with information about their ingredients or how they prepare the food.
The restaurant or person in question uses preparation methods that are likely to introduce allergens into your food. For instance, if they don’t clean their equipment properly or store potential allergens nearby other foods.
You have had an allergic reaction at the location already.

, There are specific brands that have a reputation as companies that are sensitive to individual dietary needs. Try to identify these brands and the foods they make if you have specific allergies.Brands that manufacture food in facilities free from the eight most common allergens include: Gerbs, Amanda’s Own Confections, and No Whey Foods.
Brands that manufacture food in facilities from free peanuts, tree nuts, and eggs include: Herr’s, UTZ Quality Foods, and Wise.
Look for labeling that indicates a food was manufactured in an allergen-free environment.
Consult the list at www.snacksafely.com for more foods that are manufactured in allergen free environments.

, By knowing common labelling terms, you’ll be able to discern products that are safe from products that may contain hidden allergens.Gluten-free. This term is used to identify foods free from wheat, barley, rye, and triticale.
Vegan. Items labeled vegan are free from all animal products. Thus, people who are allergic to dairy or allergic to fish or shellfish can rely on vegan products.
Kosher. This label can give you a lot of information about potential allergens like dairy and fish. For instance, foods marked ""OU"" lack dairy and meat, foods marked ""OU-D"" include dairy products, foods marked OU-M have meat but no dairy, and foods marked ""OU-F"" include fish as an ingredient.
”May contain.” This term indicates that the manufacturer cannot guarantee the product is free from hidden allergens.

, Your smartphone is one of the best tools to verify if a product might be free of hidden allergens. Use your smartphone whenever you have a question about a brand or a specific product.

Have surgery as a last resort.",How to Test for Gout," Medical conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure (if left untreated), and problems with your heart or kidneys can leave you more susceptible to gout.Similarly, treatments for certain cancers can cause gout, such as leukemia and lymphoma.Also, make sure you note any severe illnesses, infections, or trauma you've had, especially if they occurred recently.;
, If so, you may be genetically predisposed to the condition. Ask your parents if they know if anyone in the family has had gout., Sometimes medications can cause side effects that you aren't aware of or they can actually lead to a medical condition. They may be causing the problem you're visiting the doctor for. Also, your doctor needs to know if a medication she prescribes will interact with another medication you are on.For example, loop or thiazide diuretics and low-dose aspirin can both contribute to your risk for gout., Jot down when you are having pain, such as twice daily or only in the evenings. Also, write down where you are having pain, such as your knees or your big toe. Note any other symptoms you may be having, such as redness, swelling, and limited range of motion or tenderness in certain joints., A food diary is a list of the foods you eat in a day and an approximation of how much of them you eat. For instance, you could write down that you ate 6 ounces of steak for dinner, along with 1/2 a cup of broccoli, and 1/2 cup of mashed potatoes with 1/2 a tablespoon of butter.A food diary could be important when diagnosing gout because you can be at a higher risk for gout if you consume large amounts of meat, alcohol, or high fructose foods., For instance, maybe you want to know if the pain could be caused by another type of arthritis. Similarly, you may have a question about a medication causing joint pain. Write those questions down so you don't forget them when you talk to your doctor., One of the main ways your doctor will diagnose you is through questions. Use the notes you made of your symptoms to provide answers to the doctor's questions.For instance, gout is a more likely diagnosis if you had it first in your big toe and then it moved to other joints, so your doctor may ask you about where your pain is., This is the most common type of test used. In this test, your doctor uses a needle to extract synovial fluid from your joint. He then looks at it under a microscope to check it for sodium urate crystals, a sign of gout., Blood samples are another common way to test for gout. You will be tested for the level of uric acid in your blood. However, this test has some problems, as you can have high levels of uric acid without having gout.You can also have gout without your levels of uric acid being high.In fact, some times your doctor will not test your blood until about a month after your suspected gout attack, as the serum uric acids may not be elevated until that point.A urine test is sometimes used for this same purpose. Essentially, you will be asked to urinate in a clean cup at the doctor's office. A technician will check your urine for its uric acid levels., Your doctor can use an ultrasound to detect urate crystals in your joints and skin. An ultrasound may be used when you are experiencing acute intermittent pain and if one or more joints are affected. If you are adverse to needles, you may want to ask for an ultrasound instead of a joint needle aspirate test with a needle., If you think your joint pain is not caused by gout, you can ask your doctor to check for other causes. She will likely use X-rays to see if your joints are inflamed, which indicates another problem., Your doctor will likely recommend pain medications, from over-the-counter pills you probably already have to prescription pain medications.For severe gout, you may be prescribed pegloticase (Krystexxa).NSAIDs are commonly used to treat gout, from prescription celecoxib to over-the-counter ibuprofen.Your doctor might also prescribe the pain medication colchicine, though the side effects are so severe for some people that it may not be the best option for you., These steroid medications can also provide relief for gout, especially if you can't take NSAIDs. You can either have the medication injected into the joint, or you can take it orally if the pain is more widespread., If you are having repeated attacks, your doctor is likely to prescribe you a drug for preventing gout. These drugs fall into two categories, ones that block uric acid from being produced and ones that help remove more uric acid from your system than your body is able to do on its own.Common medications are allopurinol, febuxostat, and probenecid., Alcohol and drinks with fructose in them can make gout worse. Try to replace these drinks with water as often as possible, Certain meats can increase uric acid in your body. Uric acid is created when your body processes the chemical purine, and some meats and seafood are high in purine.Try to avoid beef, pork, and lamb, especially. You should also avoid seafood such as anchovies, herring, and shrimp and other types of shellfish. Organ meats, such as liver, heart, and kidney, are also high in purine., Exercise can help lower your body weight and keep you healthier overall. Since obesity is a risk factor for gout, lowering your body weight will decrease your risk.Choose a low-impact exercise, as gout can make it painful to exercise. Try swimming or walking. Aim to exercise regularly, at least 30 minutes 5 times a week., Tophi are large deposits of urate crystals that form on various parts of your body, creating lumps below the skin. They are usually found around joints and bones. If you let gout go untreated, you can develop large enough tophi that you need to have surgery to remove the tophi, as they can restrict your joints' range of motion.Kidney stones are another complication because they can block a ureter and lead to hydronephrosis."

Ask open-join surgery.",How to Alleviate Temporomandibular Joint Disorder (TMD)," Harder foods that require intense chewing can exacerbate TMJ symptoms and even cause injury if your jaw joint is already weakened. While this is not a permanent solution, eating softer foods will prevent acute pain and soreness.

Eggs, yogurt, fruit smoothies, cooked beans, fish, soft chicken, ground meat, cooked rice and soup are good examples of soft foods that will prevent pain.;
, Overuse of the jaw muscles and joints can cause acute pain associated with TMJ. Try to keep yawning and hard chewing to a minimum. Try to avoid yelling, singing, or doing anything that forces you to open your mouth wide.Try to avoid resting your chin on your hand.
Don’t hold the phone between your shoulder and ear.
Practice good posture to reduce neck and facial pain.

, Clenching or gnawing your teeth can exacerbate TMJ symptoms. Try to keep your teeth from touching as often as possible.Put your tongue between your teeth to control clenching or grinding during the day.

, General stress can manifest as muscle and joint pain. Stress reduction will prevent painful flare-ups and reduce tension that can exacerbate TMJ symptoms.Try some deep breathing exercises. Slow take in air until your lungs are full and then slowly exhale. Try to clear your mind and focus solely on your breathing.Yoga is a great way to relieve stress. Try some basic stretching poses that will relieve tension in your back, where nerve endings are concentrated, like downward-facing dog and child’s pose.Get a therapeutic massage that relieves tension in your shoulder and neck muscles.

, Analgesics, also known as pain killers, are the most common way of treating acute pain. Some are available over-the-counter and some will require a prescription from a doctor. Analgesics will provide only temporary relief and will need to be taken consistently until you seek a more permanent solution.If you don’t want to see a doctor, buy some Acetaminophen, sold under various brand names including Tylenol and Panadol. They will be available at all major drug stores. Overuse can cause liver and stomach problems so be sure to follow the directions for appropriate dosage and frequency.

, There are several drugs available that will reduce inflammation and limit inflammation-related soreness. They will be available over-the-counter at all major drug stores. These drugs provide temporary relief and will need to be taken consistently until you seek a more permanent solution. Overuse can cause gastrointestinal problems so take as directed. See a doctor before taking them if you have a history of gastrointestinal problems.One option is Ibuprofen, sold under various brand names including Advil and Motrin.
Another option is Naproxen, sold under various brand names including Midol and Aleve. Naproxen is longer lasting than Ibuprofen.

, TMJ involves damage to nerve endings in your jaw. As such, you may want to ask your doctor about medications designed specifically for nerve pain. These medications will require a prescription and include Amitriptyline, Desipramine, Nortriptyline and Doxepin.These medications all treat depression and sleep disorders. If you already take a medication for these conditions, be sure to talk to your doctor first as they may interact negatively.

, TMJ can cause strain and inflammation in your facial muscles. As such, you may want to ask your doctor about muscle relaxants. Mild muscle strain should heal itself over time so relaxant medications only need to be taken for a temporary period. These medications will require a prescription. Cyclobenzaprine, sold under the brand names Amrix and Fexmid, will treat pain, stiffness and spasms in your muscles.
Metaxalone, sold under the brand name Skelaxin, will relieve the pain and inflammation from muscle strain. This is better for more serious muscle pain.

, Try to soften your jaw muscles by gently massaging them. Focus on the area around your jaw joint, just in front your ears.

Rub your fingers in a circular motion until you start to feel the pain subside. Start gently and add pressure as comfort allows., Start with ice to numb the muscles. You can use an ice pack or even a bag of frozen peas. Hold it gently against the jaw and keep it there for 5 to 10 minutes., Then use heat to relax the jaw muscles. You can use a heating pad or a hot-water bottle. Hold it gently against the jaw and keep it there for about 20 minutes.

Make sure the temperature is warm but not scalding hot.

, Alternate between hot and cold until your pain starts to subside. Give a few minutes between each repetition to see how your jaw feels. You can do this as many times as it takes until you start feeling relief., Get a plastic mouthpiece that fits over your teeth so they won’t touch. They will prevent harmful clenching and grinding commonly associated with TMJ. They will also improve your bite by placing your teeth in the proper position.You should wear your night guards while you sleep and you wear a splint at all times. Your dentist will determine which one you need.

, TMJ can sometimes be exacerbated by old dental work or poor tooth alignment. Your dentist might need replace missing teeth or use crowns, bridges, or braces to adjust your bite surface., This therapy uses low-level electrical currents to provide pain relief by relaxing your jaw joint and facial muscles. It can be done at the dentist's office or at home. A TENS unit includes electrodes that can placed on areas with muscle pain. For TMJ, place the electrodes on your jaw joint just in front of your ears.Home TENS kits are available at most major retailers and drug stores. They typically cost between $40 and $150.
Use rubbing alcohol to clean the area first. The machine will have a nob for increasing the strength and one for increasing frequency.
Start low on each nob and first slowly increase the strength until you start to feel relief and then adjust the frequency until the relief is sustained., Trigger points are areas where the muscle tenses into a knot. Pain medication is injected into the facial muscles near the jaw joint, undoing the knots.Trigger point injections can cost up to $400 if you’re paying out of pocket. Talk to your health insurance provider to see if the procedure is covered.
Other than some temporary soreness at the injection site, this procedure shouldn’t have any substantive side-effects. This should provide several weeks of temporary relief for your TMJ symptoms.

, TMJ is sometimes exacerbated by a lack of circulation. Radio wave therapy will increase the flow of blood by warming your facial muscle fibers with low levels of electrical waves.The cost of radio wave therapy varies but generally costs around $250 out of pocket. Talk to your health insurance provider to see if the procedure is covered.
The procedure only takes a few moments and shouldn’t cause any substantive side-effects or soreness. This should provide several weeks of temporary relief for your TMJ symptoms.

, Arthrocentesis is a clinical procedure where a syringe is used to collect fluid from a joint capsule. It is also known as joint aspiration. The doctor will insert a needle into the joint and wash it out. They may use a special tool to get rid of damaged tissue or dislodge a disc stuck in the joint or to unstick the joint itself. This procedure is minor and can be done in your dentist’s office with a local anesthetic like Procaine.The Procaine injection and procedure may leave you with a numb sensation and soreness for up to 24 hours.
The cost of this procedure varies widely but will be covered by most health insurance providers if your doctor deems it necessary.

, An Arthroscopy is a surgery done with an arthroscope. This special tool has a lens and a light on it. It lets your doctor see inside your joint. You’ll get local anesthesia, then the doctor will make a small cut in front of your ear and insert the tool. The scope will be hooked up to a video screen, so the doctor can examine your joint and the area around it. They may remove inflamed tissue or realign the disc or joint.This type of surgery, known as minimally invasive, leaves a smaller scar, has fewer complications, and requires a shorter recovery time than a major operation.
The cost of this procedure varies widely but will be covered by most health insurance providers if your doctor deems it necessary.

, Depending on the cause and severity of your TMJ, arthroscopy may not be possible. Open-joint surgery is a fairly serious procedure but should provide the most permanent and guaranteed solution to your TMJ symptoms. You may need this procedure if the bones in your jaw are wearing down, if you have tumors around the jaw joint or if your joint is scarred and full of bone chips.This procedure is sometimes performed with a local anesthetic like Procaine but can sometimes require a general anesthetic that knocks you unconscious.
This procedure may require recovery time of several days or even a few weeks.
The cost of this procedure varies widely but will be covered by most health insurance providers if your doctor deems it necessary.

Find out what you are allergic to.,
Avoid triggers.,
Cover your face.,
Wash your hands frequently.,
Wash your face after coming into contact with allergens.",How to Get Your Nose to Stop Running With Allergies2," A doctor can run an allergy test, which will help narrow down and even pinpoint exactly what allergen you are suffering from. Sometimes, they come back inconclusive or will indicate several allergies. The more information you can gather about your allergy, the better. Once you have a general idea of what causes your runny nose, you can start avoiding exposure to those allergens., Environmental irritants and allergens like pollen, pet dander and hair, dust, and cigarette smoke can all dry out nasal passages and start the runny nose cycle. Use an air purifier in your home to remove these irritants from the air, but recognize that it is virtually impossible to avoid all triggers unless you seal yourself inside an air-tight container.


One of the most common airborne allergens in the United States is ragweed pollen, and there are over 17 varieties. Although it is almost impossible to avoid exposure to ragweed completely, you can learn where high concentrations are likely to be located in your local environment. Avoid these locations as best you can.Avoid going outside during peak times, such as early morning, and close your windows when pollen counts are high.
Reduce dust mites in your home by minimizing the presence carpeting, blankets, and stuffed animals. Use dust mite covers for mattresses and pillows.

, This is probably the most extreme way to protect yourself from the allergens that produce a runny nose. If the particles can’t get into your body, they can’t cause a runny nose. If you go outside during allergy season, wear a scarf over your nose and mouth. A protective face mask can do an even a better job.

, This will prevent allergens from spreading. Use soap and water. Any soap will work because you are only trying to remove allergens, not kill bacteria. Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Rinse and dry your hands on a clean towel., If you are allergic to pet dander, wash your face after petting a dog. If you are allergic to pollen, then wash your face when you come indoors after being outdoors for a while. This will help reduce your exposure to allergens."

Be aware of your risk for tendinitis.,
Identify potential symptoms.,
Observe pain and mobility problems.,
Distinguish tendinitis from other injuries.",How to Alleviate Tendonitis1," Any person can benefit from knowing ""risk factors"" that can increase your chance of having problems with this condition. Being aware of your risk can help you recognize and treat it effectively.The older you are the more likely you are to suffer from tendinitis.Occupational factors such as repetitive motions, awkward positions, frequent overhead reaching, vibration, and forceful exertion can increase your risk. Factory and construction workers may be particularly at risk.Playing sports such as baseball, basketball, bowling, golf, running, swimming, or tennis can increase your risk.If you have previously injured the area (sprain, strain, fracture etc.), you are more likely to get tendonitis.;
, Tendinitis has many different symptoms that can range from mild to severe. Identifying potential symptoms that you have can help you get effective treatment as soon as possible.You may experience pain and stiffness along your tendon or joint, especially in the morning.You may experience pain along the tendon or joint that becomes more severe with activity.You may experience severe pain the day following exercise or strenuous activity.You may experience mild swelling.Your tendons may feel noticeably thicker.

, Pay attention to your body for any pain that is present along your tendon or joints or if you are experiencing problems moving any region of your body. These symptoms can indicate tendinitis and should be treated to prevent further pain.You can have pain that is mild to severe. Some points may be more tender than others depending on the exact location of the tendinitis.You may have a limited range of motion in the affected area, including a decreased mobility., Tendinitis can occur on parts of your body that often have other injuries, such as the knee or elbow. Learning how to distinguish other pain from tendinitis in these parts of your body can help narrow the scope of treatment.Tendinitis may present similar symptoms to arthritis.Like arthritis it is often present in joints such as the shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, knee, and ankle and can have a rapid onset of pain with movement.
Unlike arthritis, you may have pain from tendinitis far away from the actual joint."

, The vaccine is offered in a variety of places. The government has handy search tool to determine where you may be able to get the vaccine: http://www.flu.gov/stay-connected/vaccinelocator_2011.html

, Your family doctor’s office is a great spot, but you can also go to urgent care clinics or health departments. Try to schedule your appointment to minimize the time required, and the likelihood of running into less sick people.

, Most pharmacies offer a quick flu vaccine, which works well when a doctor’s appointment is difficult to schedule. Convenience is sometimes an issue, and the availability at pharmacies has shown a significant increase in people who get vaccinated., Sometimes the local county or state DPH offers the flu vaccine. If you’re up to date on local websites, they may offer a quick drive-through option.

, Employers lose countless man-days per year due to flu illnesses.There are a variety of resources available to businesses wanting to offer the service., While many college students don't get a flu shot, the vaccine is almost universally available on campus.Go to university health centers or medical facilities nationwide to avoid the high-risk college environment.

, There are several flu vaccine options. Sifting through all the information can be daunting, but there are currently two kinds of flu vaccines: trivalent and quadrivalent, both of which are similarly effective.The vaccine you get depends on your age.


Flu viruses are constantly changing and the vaccine composition is reviewed each year and updated as needed., The trivalent vaccine protects against two types of A-strains of flu (the type that causes epidemics), and one type of B-strain, which is less severe. The A-strains covered are the H1N1 and H3N2, and the B-strain is either a derivative of Victoria or Yamagata lineage.Typically, the first B-strain included in the trivalent vaccine is the one predicted to be most prevalent in the annual flu season. There are four possible options for the trivalent vaccine.


Standard dosage shots use a virus grown in eggs. They are delivered via needle or jet injector. Under certain circumstances, the needle injection can be given to someone as young as six months old. The jet injector, however, is for ages 18 to 64 years old.
Because immune systems weaken with age, a higher dose shot is available for those over 65 years old. The higher dosage has four times the antibody creating substance antigen, and helps older people with their immune response.A cell-based shot is also available for anyone over 18 as an alternative to the typical shot. Instead of an egg, animal cells are used to create the vaccine. The vaccine itself isn’t different, but the flexibility of this type of creation is beneficial because it doesn’t rely on egg supply.This is a good option if you have an egg allergy.
One other method using Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV), also called Flublok, is produced quicker, without the influenza virus or eggs. The production is much faster, potentially better able to react to pandemics, but has a shorter shelf-life. This vaccination is also available for those 18 years and older., The quadrivalent vaccine includes both A-strains of the flu, the B-strain contained in the trivalent vaccine, and one more B-strain, hence the quad (meaning ""four"") prefix.Currently there are three options available.


The standard quadrivalent shots are grown inside eggs and manufactured into multiple varieties. The age group for these shots may start from six months old in certain cases, and as young as three years old in others.
An intradermal vaccine is available as an alternative to the traditional shot. While the traditional shot is delivered into the muscle, the intradermal shot uses a smaller needle and is injected under the skin. This shot requires less antigen, and is specifically for people 18-64 years old.A nasal spray, also called the Live, Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV), is approved for people two to 49 years old. An attenuated vaccine is created using a lessened pathogen that removes the danger from the vaccine — 1 in 100 quintillion chances it reverts to actual influenza — but nonetheless keeps it partially live.This version of the vaccine should not be taken by anyone outside the age range, those with previous allergic history of reactions to vaccines or eggs, children two to 17 who are undergoing aspirin therapy, anyone with asthma, pregnant women, and those with weakened immune systems.

, Aside from the nasal spray, flu shots — including jet injection — are given intramuscularly in the deltoid (upper arm and shoulder) region. While the intradermal applied at 45 degrees just under the skin, the intramuscular injections are 90 degrees straight into the muscle., The viruses in the flu shot are killed (inactivated) or attenuated (weakened to ineffectiveness), so you will not get the flu from a flu shot.There are some minor side effects, however. If these problems occur, they begin soon after the shot and usually last one to two days:


Soreness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given
Hoarseness or wheezing
Sore, red or itchy eyes
cough
Low-grade fever, chills
Muscle aches and headaches
Runny nose/nasal congestion
Abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea
Fatigue, Look for any unusual condition, such as a high fever or behavior changes. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include difficulty breathing, hoarseness or wheezing, hives, paleness, weakness, a fast heartbeat or dizziness. Tell the doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given.

, If in the US, ask your provider to report the reaction by filing a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) form. Or you can file this report through the VAERS website at www.vaers.hhs.gov, or by calling 1-800-822-7967. As of July 1, 2005, people who think that they have been injured by the flu shot can file a claim for compensation from the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP).

, While it is recommended that nearly everyone receive the flu vaccine in some fashion, certain people are more susceptible to flu-related complications. If you or someone you know falls into one of the following conditions, it may be best if they consult with a physician should they have concerns about taking the flu vaccine.


Children younger than five years old — particularly those younger than two — are particularly vulnerable to complications. Approximately 20,000 children each year have difficulties with the flu vaccine, resulting in potential dehydration, pneumonia, or sometimes worse conditions..People older than 65 should be cautious because their immune system gets weaker with age.It’s estimated that over half the flu-related hospitalizations each year are people over the age of 65. Even worse, 80 – 90% of all seasonal flu deaths are from the same age group.Pregnant women, including two weeks postpartum, may not want to get the flu shot. During pregnancy, there are a myriad of changes in a woman’s immune system, as well as her cardiovascular system. As such, pregnant women are more likely to face flu related illnesses, hospitalizations, and potentially death.Residents of nursing homes or long-term care facilities are highly susceptible to outbreaks and illnesses. In fact, in late 2005 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) began a program that not only offered, but tracked compliance with, the flu vaccine. Because of the aging residents, and the potential for virus introduction from new members, many facilities make the flu vaccine a mandatory part of admission and retention.American Indians and native Alaskans may have elevated risks associated with the flu vaccine., There are a variety of conditions that may exacerbate the potential for flu related problems. If you have a condition listed below, check with a healthcare professional regarding the flu vaccine.


Asthma is a naturally vicious pairing with the flu. While those with asthma may not be more likely to actually contract the flu, they are more prone to complications. Swollen airways already affected by asthma can be further aggravated by the flu. What’s more, asthma attacks may be caused, and worse conditions like pneumonia can be the result.Lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)and cystic fibrosis are at greater risk to flu complications. Complications with asthma and flu can eventually lead to such a worsened condition.
Congestive heart failure symptoms can be exacerbated by flu.
Anything neurological or neurodevelopmental (e.g. epilepsy, stroke, muscular dystrophy) is at high risk.
Heart, blood, endocrine (such as diabetes), kidney, or liver conditions likely make a person more susceptible to flu complications.
Refrain if you have Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS). In 1976 there was a connection between an influenza vaccine and GBS. People who have GBS naturally have flawed immune systems, are therefore susceptible to flu vaccine complications, and should check with a physician before getting treated., If you are taking long-term medication for diseases like HIV, AIDS, or cancer, your immune system may be weakened. This also applies if you have been on steroids for a long time, or if you are under 19 years old and have been on aspirin therapy.

, If you are morbidly obese — categorized by a Body Mass Index (BMI) of greater than 40 — you are more likely to have various heart ailments, metabolic issues, and even certain cancers.As such, there is a greater risk with the flu vaccine.

, There is an annual window to receive the vaccine before peak flu season, and it’s only a few months. Vaccines are typically produced earlier in the year, with shipments arriving in stores a few months later — around July or August.

, Influenza can occur at any time, but most activity ranges from October to May. The zenith of the problems in the United States is from December to February. The earlier people get vaccinated the better, because that creates a large group of vaccinated people. If you miss the window, don’t fret; it’s never too late to receive the vaccination.


In addition, the body needs time to build immunity, so getting the vaccine before the flu season gives the body a chance to do this.

, There are two doses for children aged six months to eight years old, and ensuring an early delivery of the first dose allows plenty of time for the second dose. The second dose must be given at least four weeks after the first, and should be administered prior to flu season for maximum efficacy.


Wait if you are moderately or severely ill. You should wait until you recover before getting flu vaccine. If you are ill, talk to your doctor or nurse about whether to reschedule the vaccination. People with a mild illness can usually get the vaccine.

Warm up with the cat-cow exercise.,
Increase circulation with the sphinx pose.,
Stretch your hamstrings with downward facing dog.,
Do a two-knee twist.,
Rest in child's pose.",How to Strengthen Your Lower Back2," The cat-cow exercise is taken from yoga, and involves moving between the cat pose and the cow pose while synchronizing your movement to your breath. If you perform cat-cow regularly, it will increase flexibility in your spine.Start on all fours with your back flat. Your wrists should be directly under your shoulders, your knees directly under your hips.
On an inhale, drop your belly towards the ground and lift your chest and pelvis towards the ceiling to arch your back into cow position.
As you exhale, round your back towards the ceiling, tucking in your tailbone and dropping your chin to your chest. Repeat the movements for 10 to 20 breath cycles. Breathe slowly and deeply in through your nose and out through your mouth.

, The sphinx pose helps increase blood flow to your lower back, which can help heal lower back problems as well as build muscle. To start, lay on your stomach with your legs extended behind you.Raise up onto your forearms, keeping your elbows directly under your shoulders. Press down into the floor with your feet and your palms, pushing your pubic bone forward until you feel your lower back engage.
Hold the position for 1 to 3 minutes, breathing deeply in through your nose and out through your mouth.

, Downward facing dog is a classic yoga pose that provides a good whole body stretch as well as mental calm and focus. By stretching your hamstrings in particular, you help strengthen your lower back.Get on all fours on your mat with your knees directly below your hips. Your wrists can be directly below your shoulders or a little in front of your shoulders. Connect to your breathing, inhaling slowly and deeply through your nose and exhaling out your mouth.
On an exhale, lift your hips towards the ceiling, straightening your arms out in front of you until you form an inverted ""V."" Keep your shoulders rolled back and your neck loose.
As you inhale, think of lifting your hips up even higher towards the ceiling, drawing weight up your arms and way from your wrists. On the next exhale, focus on your legs, drawing down through your heels to stretch your hamstrings. Stay in the pose for 10 to 20 breath cycles, then release back down to all fours.

, The two-knee twist effectively stretches and strengthens your entire core and lower back, while the twisting motion opens and invigorates your spine. Start by laying on your back on your mat with your legs extended.Stretch your arms out to your sides directly from your shoulders, so you are making a ""T"" shape on the floor. Then bend your knees up to your chest.
On an exhale, lower your knees to the ground on the right, taking care to keep both shoulders pressed firmly on the mat so that you twist only from your lower back.
Inhale your legs back to center, then on your next exhale, drop your knees to the left side. Repeat 5 to 10 times on each side.

, Child's pose is a classic pose to end a yoga session, and also provides a good stable stretch for your lower back. You can get into child's pose from all fours – simply lower your hips back and fold your torso over your thighs, extending your arms out in front of you.If you're flexible enough, you can rest your forehead on your mat. Don't fold any further than you can comfortably, though.
Spreading your knees slightly further apart will make child's pose easier and may be more comfortable for you.
Since child's pose is a resting pose, you can stay in it as long as you like, breathing deeply.

Go for walks regularly.,
Take up cycling.,
Exercise in intervals.,
Try swimming.,
Buy a pedometer.,
Maintain an active lifestyle.",How to Strengthen Your Lower Back3," Walking is a simple and inexpensive way to start becoming more active. Taking a brief walk of just 15 to 20 minutes most days of the week will help strengthen your lower back as well as the rest of your body.Try walking with a buddy to help motivate you and make your walks more fun. If you're walking by yourself, you may want to listen to music, a podcast, or an audio book.

, If you have lower back pain to the point that you feel more comfortable sitting than standing, cycling is a good option for cardiovascular exercise. A stationary bike inside typically will be better for you than the bumpy, uneven road terrain.Cycling is low-impact and easy on your joints, and will strengthen your legs, hips, and lower back while also giving you a good cardiovascular workout.

, Mixing your cardio and strength training together creates an effective workout that will strengthen your lower back without increasing any lower back pain you may have. You can find beginner interval training workouts, including a lot of videos, online for free.Doing 3-5 minute intervals of high-intensity cardio between strength-training intervals will help you get and keep your heart rate up without putting too much strain on your lower back.

, If you have convenient access to a pool, swimming for just 20 to 30 minutes two or three days a week is a good way to strengthen your entire back. To avoid making any back problems worse, join a class or hire a coach to perfect your technique.Swimming is a low-impact exercise and the water helps support you, making it great exercise if you have joint problems or are overweight.
If you're new to swimming, start slow with 10-minute swims. Every week or so, increase your time in the water by five minutes until you're swimming for a half hour or longer each session.
If you're not up for swimming, walking or jogging in water provide some resistance to help strengthen your legs and lower back, without you having to worry about your breath.

, Over the course of your day, you should aim to walk at least 10,000 steps. A pedometer secured to your waist can keep track of those steps for you. Some models also connect to the internet and have apps that allow you to keep track of your progress over time.Choose a pedometer that you can use easily and that will help you achieve your goals. You can get a very basic model, or one with a lot of extra features.
If you're new to a more active lifestyle, set smaller goals to start and work your way up to 10,000 steps. Introduce walk breaks into your day by doing things such as parking further away when you go shopping, or taking the stairs instead of the elevator.

, Sitting for long periods of time can cause your lower back muscles to atrophy. Prevent this by getting up and walking around every 30 minutes or so if possible, and try to reduce the number of hours you sit overall.For example, if you spend most of your work day sitting, try to remain standing when you go home, rather than sitting down on the couch to watch television.
You also can invest (or ask your boss to invest) in a standing desk, so that you can stand for periods as you work throughout the day.

Use the RICE principle.,
Rest the affected area.,
Apply ice to the affected area.,
Compress the affected tendon.,
Elevate the affected area above your heart.,
Take pain medication.",How to Alleviate Tendonitis2," If you have a recurrent case of tendinitis or suspect you may have it, you can try treating it at home before seeing a doctor. By initially applying RICE—rest, ice, compression, and elevation—you may help alleviate tendinitis and prevent further issues. Change to very warm heat treatments after 48 hours and thereafter.Be aware that even with early treatment for pain, tendinitis may last for more than three months. If you wait for more than 1 to 1½ months before seeing a doctor, it might take longer for you to alleviate the condition., Give your body a chance to heal by taking a break from stressful activities. Do lower-impact ones such as swimming and biking to help heal your tendonitis.If you do high-impact activities such as running or tennis, switch to lower-impact options. You can try biking, walking, or swimming to stay active while giving your affected tendon a rest.You may also want to rest the area completely for a while.Begin gently moving the affected area if you take a few days of full rest to help prevent stiffness., Use an ice pack on the painful area of your tendon. This can help reduce swelling and relieve pain (do not apply ice directly to skin; so use a cloth to protect against ice burns/frostbite).You can use an ice pack as often as necessary for 20 minutes at a time for the first 2 days (then change to very warm heat treatments from 3rd day and going forward). Wait 40 minutes for the iced area to warm up between applications of ice. You can take a slush bath by mixing ice and water in a bathtub. Soak the area or your entire body for up to 20 minutes.You can freeze a plastic foam cup full of water to massage the affected area gently.If you feel too cold, or your skin gets numb, remove the pack. Warm up for 40 minutes. Use a towel between the ice pack and your skin to help prevent frostbite/skin burns., Use a wrap or compressive elastic bandage to compress the area with tendinitis. This can help relieve swelling and help preserve mobility in your joint.Swelling can cause loss of mobility in the injured joint or area, so compressing it will help.
Use compression until the affected area is no longer swelling.You can get compressive wraps and bandages at any pharmacy and many large department retailers.

, Raise your affected tendon or joint above the level of your heart. This can help reduce swelling and may also help preserve mobility in your joint.Elevation is especially useful for tendinitis of the knee., Consume pain relievers for severe discomfort and/or as necessary. These medications may help alleviate pain and possible swelling.Take over the counter pain relievers such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen sodium or acetaminophen.Ibuprofen and naproxen sodium may also help alleviate some of the swelling."

See your doctor.,
Examine the symptoms with your doctor.,
Get tests and a diagnosis.,
Be X-rayed or have an MRI.,
Have medical treatments.,
Attend physical therapy.,
Consider cortisone injections in the affected area.,
Ask about a FAST operation on the affected area.",How to Alleviate Tendonitis3," If home treatment isn’t working or the tendinitis is adversely affecting your daily life, see your doctor. Tendinitis is common and very treatable, and getting a medical diagnosis early can help you get proper treatment.You can see your regular doctor or visit an orthopedist, who specializes in treating disorders such as tendinitis.Your doctor will conduct a physical exam to check for signs of tendinitis and will also likely ask for a health history, including factors such as what type of activities you do., Your doctor will check for signs or signs of tendinitis once you’ve described your symptoms. Your doctor may be able to diagnose tendinitis with a simple examination instead of ordering more in-depth tests.One common way of diagnosing tendinitis is palpation, where your doctor uses her hands and fingers to feel the affected areas carefully.Your doctor may check for swelling along the tendon or in the corresponding area.She may check for thickening or increase in the size of your tendon.Your doctor may look or feel for bony spurs along your elbow, shoulder, knee or heel.Your doctor may feel along your tendon and ask you what the point of maximum tenderness is.Your doctor may also test the range of motion. In particular, she’ll see if you have a decreased ability to flex your joint., If your doctor suspects that you have tendinitis, she may order tests after conducting your physical exam. These tests can help confirm a diagnosis and help your doctor formulate a treatment plan., Your doctor may not be able to diagnose tendinitis through a simple examination with her hands. She may order that you get an X-ray or MRI to ensure your symptoms are a result of tendinitis.An MRI is more expensive than an X-ray, but may be more effective for diagnosing soft-tissue injuries such as tendinitis.X-rays and MRIs make images of the inside of your joint and tendon areas and can make it easier for your doctor to identify not only if you have tendinitis, but also exactly where the affected area is. This can help her better formulate a treatment plan.Your doctor may order an X-ray, which will require you to sit still while a technician makes images of the affected area. This can help better see the bones and may show bone spurs, or any thickening or calcification of your tendon.Your doctor may order an MRI, which will require you to lie inside of a large scanner for a few minutes. An MRI can show how severe the damage is to your tendon and help assess the type of treatment needed.Be aware that an MRI is not necessary to diagnose tendinitis and may only be used for severe cases., If your tendinitis is severe, your doctor may prescribe additional, more involved treatments such as injections, surgery, or physical therapy. These can provide some pain relief and heal the condition.In some cases, your doctor may recommend treatments such as extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT).This uses pressure waves to create a force on your tissues, relieving pain in areas affected by tendinitis.Ultrasound therapy may also be recommended in some cases. Both of these treatments have inconsistent research support.Some studies support the use of acupuncture for tendinitis.A holistic approach that uses medication and physical therapy is likely to be most effective.

, Seeing a physical therapist can help strengthen and stretch (improve flexibility) your affected area. It may help alleviate your tendinitis.Studies have shown that eccentric strengthening, which contracts a muscle while it’s lengthening, is especially effective for tendinitis., If your tendinitis is especially severe, your doctor may consider cortisone injections. Be aware this isn’t a common treatment and could rupture your tendon.Corticosteroids may decrease inflammation and help alleviate pain.Doctors do not recommend cortisone injections for chronic tendinitis, which is a case of tendinitis that last over three months., If your tendinitis doesn’t heal after six months of nonsurgical treatment, you and your doctor should consider surgery. The minimally invasive FAST procedure may help completely treat the condition.FAST, or focused aspiration of scar tissue, that uses ultrasound and small instruments to remove tendon scar tissue.FAST has the same effect as an open surgery but doesn’t require hospitalization.The recovery time for FAST is generally 1-2 months."

Know when oxygen therapy is useful.,
Understand how oxygen therapy is given.,
Consider the possible side effects.",How to Prevent Dry Nose and Throat Due to Oxygen Therapy1," Whenever your lungs are not taking in sufficient oxygen for your body, your doctor may prescribe oxygen therapy. Conditions that impair lung function and necessitate oxygen therapy include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (typically due to smoking), chronic asthma, interstitial lung disease, bronchiectasis, pulmonary hypertension, lung cancer, and heart failure.


To determine whether you need oxygen therapy, your doctor may measure the partial pressure of oxygen in your blood (your PaO2). A PaO2 below 7.3kPa (55 mmHg) indicates that oxygen therapy is necessary. A PaO2 between 7.3 and 7.8 kPa (55 to 59 mmHg) and additional symptoms of inadequate oxygenation (leg swelling, increased red blood cells, pulmonary hypertension, or an altered mental state, for example) also indicates that oxygen therapy should be prescribed.;
, Depending on your circumstances, you may either receive oxygen therapy in a hospital setting or, if you have a chronic condition, at home. There are three basic methods of oxygen delivery:


By face mask. In this kind of oxygen therapy, you wear a face mask that covers your nose and mouth, and oxygen is administered through it.
By nasal cannula. In this kind of oxygen therapy, small tubes are placed in your nostrils, and the oxygen is administered through them.
By a trans-tracheal tube. In this kind of oxygen therapy, an incision is made in your skin, and a tube is placed directly into your trachea to deliver oxygen.

, If you have oxygen therapy, you are likely to develop dryness in your nose, mouth, and throat. You may also experience nosebleeds, headaches, fatigue, infections, and skin irritation. Don’t let these side effects keep you from getting the oxygen therapy that you need. Many of them – including dryness in your nose and throat – are preventable.

Use a built-in humidifier.,
Add humidity to the room.,
Keep your equipment in good condition.,
Try lubricating jelly.,
Apply sesame seed oil.,
Spray saline into your nose and throat.,
Talk to your doctor about medications.",How to Prevent Dry Nose and Throat Due to Oxygen Therapy2," The primary cause of a dry nose and throat is a lack of moisture. Using a humidifier may solve the problem. Humidifiers are available as attachments to your oxygen system; in fact, your system may come with one included. They moisten the oxygen, preventing dryness.


Using the humidifier is most important if you are using a trans-tracheal tube. If you are using other methods, the humidifier won’t hurt, but you may not need it; you can use a nasal saline spray instead.
Always use sterile or distilled water with your humidifier. Tap water can cause blockages or mineral sedimentation inside the tube.
Change the water in the bottle every one or two days. Once a week, clean the entire humidifier (as well as the cannula, if applicable, and rubber tube) with distilled water and soap. Doing so will prevent microorganisms from building up and infecting your respiratory tract.

, In addition to the built-in humidifier, you can try using a room humidifier to add moisture to your environment. Room humidifiers are especially useful at night, when people tend to breathe through their mouths.


Clean your room humidifier regularly – at least once a week – to prevent the build up of microorganisms.
If you don’t have access to a room humidifier, you can use a kettle. Fill it with water, and heat it on the stove until it boils; water vapor will come out of the nozzle, humidifying the air. Repeat as often as necessary.

, Tubes and nasal cannula need to be kept in good condition to minimize side effects. In addition to the regular cleaning, you should use a mild detergent and water to periodically clean these items. You should also replace tubes and cannula every six months.

, Jellies and other similar products can provide instant relief for a dry, irritated nose, soothing and moisturizing the nasal mucosa. Aloe Vera gels work well, as do many water-soluble products. Your doctor or oxygen cylinder provider may have a specific recommendation about the best jelly, lotion, or balm to use. Whichever you decide on, apply a thin layer to your upper lip and inside your nostrils, using a clean cotton swab. Repeat two or three times a day.


Be careful not to apply too much and not to get any in the cannula, if that’s the method of oxygen delivery you are using. You don’t want to interrupt oxygen flow, as this will reduce the effectiveness of your treatment.
Do not use petroleum-based products, such as petroleum jelly. These products are a fire hazard when used with oxygen tanks.

, Sesame seed oil has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-viral properties, and it can soothe your mucous membranes. Apply a thin coating of the oil inside your nostrils and above your upper lip, using a clean cotton swab. Repeat two or three times a day.


Sesame seed oil is found at most natural food stores.

, Saline spray, which is available at most pharmacies, contains a 0.9% sodium chloride solution, which is equal to that of your body fluids and secretions. The spray will rehydrate the mucous surface of your nose and throat. Spray one puff into each nostril every one or two areas (or as needed – the spray is safe to use as often as you want). Wipe the nozzle with sterile gauze or tissue after each use.


If the salty taste doesn’t bother you, you can also spray saline into the back of your throat.

, If nothing seems to be working adequately to prevent a dry nose and throat, talk to your physician. He or she may recommend a nasal decongestant (such as Oxymetazoline or Xylometazoline), which can be used every four to six hours.


Your doctor may also prescribe an antihistamine or steroid medication to deal with itching and irritation in your nose and throat. The particular drug and dose will depend on your specific circumstances.

Take your treatments properly if you already have TB.,
Try your best to avoid anyone with XDR-TB.,
Take a Tuberculin Skin Test.,
Acknowledge how XDR-TB is spread.,
Take note that TB is not spread by the following:


shaking someone's hand
sharing food or drink, touching bed linens or toilet seats
sharing toothbrushes (not a great idea in any case but not likely to spread TB)
kissing, smoking, or sharing cigarettes

,
Prevent a recurrence.,
Know the symptoms of ""normal"" TB.,
Understand who is most susceptible to TB.",How to Prevent Drug Resistant Tuberculosis," This is absolutely essential. The main reason that TB turns drug-resistant is that it can slowly turn into a completely different species of bacteria, one not treatable by the current generation of antibiotics. So take your medicine in the prescribed dosage and on the specified schedule. Following your doctor's advice is crucial in preventing XDR-TB. It's no joke. This isn't like a vitamin; your life can depend on this.;
, This may seem obvious, but TB can spread like wild-fire. Imagine a chain: if someone infects you, you can infect a loved one, that loved one infects his/her friend, that friend infects her family, the family's children infect their classmates, etc., in a potentially endless chain. TB is not something to be casual about. Some TB/XDR-TB patients are quarantined: they are allowed no (or minimal) contact with the outside world. This can be hard on everyone involved, but it's for the sake of the community.

, If you have been in close contact with someone who has (or recently had) TB or XDR-TB, take a skin test. It is always recommended that you (and your loved ones)consult with your doctor and take the skin test when you know you have been around a TB case. Here is the basic process in a tuberculin test:




A specialist will give you a shot under your skin. The shot is a protein that the immune system reacts to.
The skin area is watched for 48 to 72 hours.


If the area becomes a red, raised ""bump,"" that's an indication of TB. You would then be given a chest X-ray and a sputum smear (a saliva test). Note that the skin bump is not a rash, acne, or any skin problem. It is simply a reaction of the immune system to the presence of TB.
If no red bump appears, that indicates the absence of TB. However, be ready to take a second skin test should any TB symptoms arise later.

, You can get TB by talking with another, laughing, coughing, sneezing, or basically inhaling another's breath. Once TB gets into the air, it dies in several hours, but people can inhale it in seconds.

,, Those who have contracted TB in the past are more susceptible to a drug-resistant strain in the future. That makes it crucial to avoid others with TB. Be aware of any TB outbreaks in your area or in locations you're considering visiting. Be aware that prisons can sometimes be repositories of TB bacteria.

, These include generalized weakness, night sweats, and weight loss. In more advanced cases there may be chest pain, coughing up bloody mucus, a persistent dry cough, or shortness of breath. the symptoms of XDR-TB are very similar to those of TB. If you have these symptoms, ask your doctor about getting a skin test immediately.

, People with HIV/AIDS are especially at risk because of their weakened immune system. Others at risk include:


people who live with individuals who have an active TB infection
poor or homeless people
people from countries that have a high incidence of TB
nursing-home residents and prison inmates
alcoholics and intravenous drug users
people with diabetes and certain cancers
health-care workers.
Knowing the risks of TB will most certainly help prevent an XDR-TB infection! The above conditions are debilitating and will suppress your natural immune system, in effect predisposing you to XDR-TB.

Keep the inhaled air moist.",How to Perform Tracheostomy Care," Suctioning the tracheostomy tube is important because it helps to keep the airway free of secretions (mucus), which enables the patient to breathe better and reduces the risk of lung infection.Lack of proper suctioning is a major cause of infection in people who have a tracheostomy tube. The materials needed include:


A suction machine
Catheters (tubes) for suctioning (size 14 and 16 are used for adults)
Sterile latex gloves
Normal saline solution
Normal saline lavage that is already prepared or a 5ml syringe
A clean bowl filled with tap water;
, Caregivers (either at the hospital or at home) must wash their hands before and after tracheostomy care.This primarily protects the patient from getting a bacterial infection through his neck hole. Wash your hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds and don't forget to scrub between your fingers and underneath your fingernails.


Dry your hands using paper towels or a clean cloth.
Turn off the tap using the paper towel or cloth as a barrier to avoid contaminating your hands again.
As an alternative, lather your hands with an alcohol-based sanitizer and then let them air dry.

, Place gloves on hands. The suction machine package should be opened carefully, while taking care not to touch the tip of the catheter.However, the thumb control vent that is located at the end of the catheter can be touched, so don't worry about that. If you wind the catheter around one hand, it will keep it managed, freeing up your other hand for other tasks. The catheter is usually attached to suction tubing that is connected to the suction machine.


Turn the suction machine on and test through the catheter tip whether it's able to suction. Test for suction by placing your thumb over the port of the catheter and releasing.
A tracheal tube may have a single or double opening, and it may be cuffed or uncuffed, fenestrated (allowing for speech) or unfenestrated., Make sure the patient’s shoulders and head are slightly elevated. She should be comfortable during this procedure. Have her take approximately three to four deep breaths to calm down. Once the patient is situated, put 3–5 milliliters (0.10–0.17  fl oz) of saline solution into the tracheal tube. This will help stimulate coughing up of mucus and add moisture to the mucus membranes.Saline solution should be used regularly while suctioning to prevent the formation of thick mucus plugs within the trachea, which can block the passage of air.


The number of times saline should be instilled varies from one person to another depending on how thick or how much mucus she produces in her trachea.
Caregivers should observe the color, odor, and thickness of the mucus secretions in case there's an infection — the mucus turns a grayish green and smells bad.

, Guide the catheter gently into the tracheal tube until the patient begins to cough or until it stops and cannot go any further. This should be approximately 4 to 5 inches (10.2 to 12.7 cm) deep into the tracheostomy tube in most cases. The natural curve of the catheter should follow the curve of the tracheal tube. Think of the catheter as a vacuuming device for cleaning the tracheal tube.The catheter should be pulled back a little before suction is applied, which should make the patient more comfortable.


Apply suction by covering the thumb control vent while withdrawing the catheter from the tracheal tube in a slow and circular motion. Suction should not be applied for longer than about 10 seconds, during which the catheter should be rotating and pulling out consistently. There should always be suction on the way out.
Tracheostomy tubes come in several sizes and materials such as semi-flexible plastic, rigid plastic, and metal. Some tubes are disposable, while others are reusable., Have the patient take three to four slow and deep breaths in between suctioning sessions because while the suctioning machine is working very little air can get to his lungs.The patient should be given oxygen after every suctioning is done or given time to breath depending on the patient's condition.


With the catheter removed, suction tap water through the tube to get rid of any thick secretions, then wash the catheter with hydrogen peroxide.
Repeat the process as needed if the patient is producing more secretions that have to be sucked out of the tracheal tube.
Suctioning is repeated until the airway is clear of mucus/secretions.
After suctioning, the oxygen is returned at the flow rate level that it was before the procedure.

, It is important to keep the tracheal tubes clean and free of mucus and foreign debris, so it's advisable to clean them at least twice a day — once in the morning and once in the evening is ideal.However, the more frequent, the better. Here's what you need:


Sterile saline
Half-diluted Hydrogen Peroxide (½ portion water mixed with ½ portion hydrogen peroxide)
Small, clean bowls
Small, fine brush

, It is essential that you wash your hands and remove all germs and dirt. This will help prevent any infection due to unhygienic care.


The proper procedure for washing your hands is discussed above. The most important things to remember are to use a mild soap, lather your hands well, rinse them, and dry them with a clean, dry towel.

, In one bowl, place the ½ strength hydrogen peroxide solution, and in another bowl the sterile saline solution. Remove the inner tracheal tube carefully whilst holding the neck plate still, which should be taught by your doctor or nurse while in the hospital.Place the tracheal tube in the bowl containing hydrogen peroxide solution and let it soak completely until the crusts and particles on the tube are softened, dissolved and removed.
Some tracheal tubes are disposable and don't need to be cleaned if you have replacements.

, Using a fine brush, clean the inside and outside of the tracheal tube carefully ensuring it is clear of mucus and any other debris.Take care not to be too firm and avoid using rough/coarse brushes for cleaning as this may damage the tube. After you're done, place it in saline water for at least another five to 10 minutes to soak and become sterile.


If you don't have any more saline water, soaking the tube in white vinegar diluted with some water will work also.
If you're using disposable plastic tracheal tubes, then skip this step and throw out the tube.

, Once you've got a cleaned and sterile (or new) tracheal tube in hand, carefully insert it back into the tracheostomy hole whilst holding the neck plate still.Turn the inner tube until it locks back into position securely. You can gently pull the tube forward to make sure that the inner tube has locked into place.


This successfully completes your cleaning procedure. Performing this at least two times per day can prevent infections, clogging and other complications.

, The stoma is the hole in the neck/trachea where the tubes are inserted so the patient can breathe. The stoma should be assessed each time after suctioning for skin breakdown and signs of infection.If any symptoms of infection are present (or if anything at all seems questionable), consult a doctor immediately.


Symptoms of a stoma infection can include redness, swelling, pain, and the secretion of foul-smelling pus.
If a stoma is infected and inflamed, the tracheal tubes will be more difficult to insert.
If a stoma is pale or bluish, this may indicate an issue with blood flow to the tissue, and you should contact a doctor right away.

, Each time you remove a tracheal tube, clean and disinfect the stoma. Use an antiseptic solution such as betadine solution or something similar. The stoma should be cleaned in a circular motion (with a sterile gauze) starting at the 12 o’clock position and wiping downward to the three o’clock position.Then use a new gauze dipped in antiseptic and wipe towards the nine o’clock position.


To clean the lower half of the stoma, wipe with a new gauze from the three o’clock position towards the six o’clock position. Then wipe again from the nine o’clock position moving towards the six o’clock position.

, The dressing around the tracheostomy should be changed at least twice a day.This helps to prevent infection at the stoma site and within the respiratory system (lungs). Changing it also helps to promote the skin's integrity. A new dressing helps to insulate the skin and absorb the secretions that might leak around the stoma.


A wet dressing should be changed immediately. This breeds bacteria and can lead to health complications.
Don't forget to change the ribbons (ties) that keep the tracheal tube in place if they get soiled or wet. Make sure to hold the tracheal tube in place while changing the ribbons.

, The reason why doctors and healthcare professionals are so insistent on covering your tracheal tube is that foreign particles and debris can enter an uncovered tube and enter your windpipe.These foreign particles can include dust, sand, and other general pollutants in the atmosphere. This can lead to irritation and even infection, which must be avoided.


Entry of debris into your tube leads to excessive mucus production in your windpipe, which can clog up your tube and cause breathing difficulties and infection.
Make sure to clean your tracheal tube more often if you spend lots of time outdoors, particularly if it is windy and/or dusty.

, Swimming can be very dangerous for any tracheostomy patient. Whilst swimming, the tracheostomy hole is not completely watertight, nor is the cap on the tube. As a result, water entry directly into the tracheostomy hole/tube is quite likely while swimming, which can lead to a condition called “aspiration pneumonia” — water in the lungs that triggers choking.Aspiration pneumonia, even after small amounts of water, can lead to death from choking.
The entry of even small amounts of water into the lungs can also increase the risk of a bacterial infection.
Cover the tube and also be cautious when taking a bath or shower.

, When people breathe in through their nose (and sinuses) the air tends to hold more moisture, which is better for the lungs. However, people with a tracheostomy no longer have this ability, so the air they breathe in is the same humidity as the outside air.In dry climates, this can cause problems, so it's important to try and keep inhaled air as moist as you can.


Put a damp cloth over the tracheal tube and keep it moist.
Use a humidifier to help moisten the air during dry conditions at home.

Realize that residual lung volume is not your tidal volume.,
Know that residual lung volume is not the same as functional residual capacity.,
Remember that residual lung volume is not easy to measure.,
Get a referral to a medical specialist who can conduct a helium dilution test.,
Consider the nitrogen washout technique.,
Have a body plethysmography done for best accuracy.",How to Measure Residual Lung Volume," Respiratory rate is how many breaths you take in a minute. At birth, the average human respiratory rate ranges from 30 – 60 breaths per minute, whereas its much lower at 12 – 20 breaths per minute in adults.Tidal volume is the amount of air inhaled or exhaled during normal respiration (breathing), which amounts to about 0.5 L in both men and women.


Tidal volumes increase during deep sleep and with relaxation, but decrease with stress, nervousness and panic attacks.
In contrast, residual lung volume does not fluctuate with states of consciousness or mood.
Men have slightly higher residual lung volumes because they tend to have larger bodies and lungs.;
, When you exhale while breathing normally, the volume of air left in your lungs is called the functional residual capacity, which is NOT your residual volume.Instead, the residual volume is the air left in your lungs after a forced exhalation, which indirectly measures the strength of your respiratory muscles (diaphragm, intercostal muscles, etc.) as well as the health of your lung tissues.


Shallow breathing (due to asthma, for example) results in a larger functional residual capacity, whereas a larger residual lung volume is a sign of good fitness and healthy lung tissue.
Average functional residual capacity is about 2.3 L of air in men and 1.8 L in women.
In contrast, residual lung volume is always lower than functional residual capacity — 1.2 L for men and 1.1 L for women.

, Although residual lung volume is the amount of air left in your lungs after you completely breathe out, the reality is that it's practically impossible to do so on your own. As such, residual lung volume isn't measured like tidal volume is, for example; instead its calculation has to be done via indirect methods such as closed circuit dilution (including helium dilution), nitrogen washout and body plethysmography.In absence of special testing, residual lung volume can be estimated based on a proportion of body mass or vital capacity, as well as a person's height, weight and age; however, these estimates are not particularly accurate and not as helpful for determining lung diseases.
Residual lung volume is reduced with restrictive lung disease, but it also changes somewhat in response to pregnancy, significant weight gain and muscle weakness due to aging.

, If your family doctor thinks you have a restrictive lung disease, they will refer you to a respiratory (lung) specialist, also known as a pulmonologist, for further testing. The pulmonologist may conduct a helium dilution test. This inert gas dilution method uses helium to directly identify your residual lung volume. To start the test, you'll exhale normally and then be connected to a closed system containing known volumes of helium and oxygen.Once connected, you breathe in the helium and the amount exhaled is measured. The difference between the two volumes of helium is a pretty accurate estimate of your residual lung volume.


Helium is an inert, colorless, odorless, tasteless gas and is non-toxic to your lungs, so there are no health concerns related to this exam.
This technique may underestimate residual lung volume because it measures only the lung volume that communicates with the airways. This can be problematic for patients with severe airflow limitation.

, You will also need a referral to a pulmonologist to have this test done, which measures the air remaining in your conducting airways. To start the test, you'll exhale normally and then be connected to a spirometer that contains 100% oxygen. You'll then breath in deeply and exhale as strongly as you can, and the spirometer will measure the amount of exhaled nitrogen compared to the entire volume of exhaled air.The halfway point of the percentage of exhaled nitrogen allows the doctor to figure out the amount of gas you expelled, which is equal to the residual lung volume.


Recall that the air we normally breathe in is about 21% oxygen and 78% nitrogen.This test forces you to breathe 100% oxygen and then measures the amount of nitrogen exhaled, a predetermined percentage of which represents residual lung volume.
Like the helium dilution technique, nitrogen washout can also underestimate residual lung volume in patients with severely restricted airflow.

, This very accurate method for measuring residual lung volume uses a plethysmograph, which is an enclosed instrument (a small chamber you sit in) used for recording an organ’s volume change. Once inside an airtight plethysmograph — it sort of looks like a small phone booth — you'll be asked to normally exhale, then inhale against a closed mouthpiece. As your chest wall expands, the pressure within the plethysmograph rises, which is calculated.Then you'll exhale as hard as you can out through the mouthpiece. The difference in pressures represent your residual lung volume.


Body plethysmography uses Boyle's gas law (pressure and volume of a gas have an inverse relationship when temperature is constant) to determine residual lung volume and other lung volumes.
Body plethysmography is considered more accurate than gas dilution methods for calculating lung volumes, particularly if the lung is obstructed."

Manage your emotions.,
Join a support group.,
Exercise regularly.,
Go to pulmonary rehabilitation.,
Eat fewer carbohydrates.,
Eat smaller meals.,
Drink plenty of water.",How to Live With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease1," You may experience many emotions such as depression, sadness, and anger when you live with COPD. Handling your emotions is just as important as taking care of your physical health. Take whatever steps you need to get some support.Talk to a friend or family member about how you are feeling.
Ask for help when you need it.
Let your doctor know how you feel.
See a mental health professional such as a counselor or psychologist.
Keep a journal.;
, Having COPD changes all aspects of your life. Joining a support group can help find other people who are going through the same thing. You will feel supported and learn how other people manage their COPD.You can call 1-866-316-2673 to find support group near you.
Also ask your doctor if they know of any support groups.

, Even though you get short of breath, exercising strengthens your respiratory muscles and helps oxygen circulate through your body. Before you begin an exercise program, talk to your doctor. In general, stretching, walking, biking, swimming, and strength training are safe.Do not exercise if you have a fever or infection, feel nauseated, have chest pain, or are out of oxygen.

, Pulmonary rehab will help you live with and manage your COPD. Your rehab may include an exercise program, disease management and education, mental health counseling, and nutritional counseling. The goal of rehab is to help you continue your daily activities and have a good quality of life.Pulmonary rehab is done by a team of professionals such as nurses, doctors, physical therapists, social workers, psychologists, and respiratory therapists.
Talk to your doctor or call 1-800-586-4872 to find a pulmonary rehab program in your area., When you breathe, you inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide. Carbohydrates produce more carbon dioxide than fats. You may breathe better if you decrease the amount of carbohydrates in your diet and eat more fats. Consult with a doctor or a registered dietitian nutritionist before you make changes to your diet.You can find a dietitian that specializes in COPD by visiting the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics website.

, Try to eat four to six small meals a day. Large meals take up space and make it more difficult for your diaphragm to move. It is also easier for your lungs to fill and empty air when you are not super full.If possible, rest before you eat.

, Water helps keep your mucus thin so it is easy to remove. Try to drink six to eight 8-oz glasses of water a day. To avoid feeling too full, you can avoid drinking liquids when you eat. Try to drink an hour after you get done eating.You may need to adjust your water intake based on your specific situation. Talk to your doctor about your water consumption.

Avoid getting too close to people when you are sick.,
Cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze.,
Wash your hands often and thoroughly.,
Go to the doctor if there are signs of a serious infection or complications.",How to Know if You're Too Sick to Go to Work or School," If you have a fever over 100F you should stay home from work or school and not go back until your body temperature has been normal (usually 98.6F) for 24 hours. If you need to take medication to get your temperature to be normal, that doesn’t count. You are still sick and likely infectious.A baby with a temperature of 100F or more should be taken immediately to the emergency room.
A high fever is likely to also be accompanied by periods of sweating and chills.;
, Coughing that feels like it comes from deep within your lungs could be a sign of a serious infection. Don’t go to work or school. Contact your doctor to see if you should get your cough checked out.Mild coughing frequently occurs due to a cold or allergies. You may also have a stuffy, drippy nose and sneezing. If you feel up to it and no other symptoms are present, you can still go about your daily routine.
Cover your mouth when you cough and wash your hands frequently. This will help prevent you from spreading germs.
If you have trouble breathing during coughing fits, go to the emergency room to get medical attention.

, Stay away from others until you are no longer vomiting and the doctor says that you are not contagious.Persistent vomiting will cause dehydration and weakness.


Take care of yourself by drinking plenty of liquids. If you can’t keep a glass of water down, you might try sucking on ice cubes. It will enable you to take the water in more slowly and may be easier to keep down.
If you are unable to keep any liquid down and are at risk of becoming severely dehydrated, you may need to go to an emergency room. If necessary, they will rehydrate you with intravenous fluids. Symptoms of dehydration include weakness, headaches, infrequent urination, passing dark or cloudy urine, and crying without tears .

, A very loose or watery stool can often be a sign of infection. Remain near the bathroom and do not try to go to work or school until you are better.If the diarrhea is caused by food or medication, then it is not contagious. In this case if you are well enough to be able to go about your daily routine, you do not need to stay home.
During all cases of diarrhea, you are likely to be losing a lot of water. This means that it is important to replenish your liquids by drinking lots of water. Drink water even if you do not feel thirsty.

, If you have a rash that has open wounds with fluid leaking out or is rapidly spreading, you should call your doctor. Do not go into work or school until your doctor determines that it is not contagious.Rashes due to allergies are not contagious. If you have the symptoms under control enough that you can think and concentrate, then you can go to work or school.
For mild rashes, you may be able to go to work or school if the rashes are covered. Check with your school nurse or doctor to be sure.

, You probably don't need to stay home if you just have a cold. If you are not so sick that you need to stay home, there are still some simple precautions that you can take to protect others. You can:Wash your hands frequently
Not hug or shake hands
Avoid sharing drinks or food with others
Turn away from others when you sneeze or cough and do so into your elbow
Use tissues if you have a drippy nose

, If your child comes in contact with other children that are unvaccinated or have weakened immune systems, he may put them at risk. Wait until your doctor declares your child healthy enough to return to school. These diseases include:Measles. This disease has cold-like symptoms and red spots. The infected person is contagious for four days before the rash starts and the first four days of the rash’s presence. Wait until your doctor gives the ok before sending your child back to school.Mumps. It is characterized by flu-like symptoms and swollen salivary glands.Follow the instructions from your doctor and school officials to determine how long to keep your child home.
Rubella. This disease has flu-like symptoms and a pink rash. It can cause birth defects in unborn babies if the mother catches it.Ask your doctor and the school nurse when your child can return to school.
Pertussis (whooping cough). This illness has flu- and cold-like symptoms and severe coughing which can make it difficult to breathe. Ask your doctor and the school nurse how long your child will be infectious.Chicken pox. This disease has flu-like symptoms and a rash of fluid-filled red bumps. An infected person is contagious for two days before the rash starts and then until all the spots have scabbed over. Ask your doctor when it’s ok to send your child back to school., Pink eye, also called conjunctivitis, is an infection where the eye becomes red and leaks sticky yellowish-greenish goo.Because the eye maybe itchy, children often rub their eyes, and then touch other children or shared toys, making it easily contagious.
Once your child has begun treatment, he may be able to go back to school once your doctor says he is unlikely to be infectious.

, However, once your child is receiving treatment under a doctor’s supervision, it should be ok for your child to return to school, unless your doctor advises against it.Impetigo is an infection in which pustules form. The pustules may seep fluid and crust over. These spots must be covered when your child goes to school.
Impetigo can be caused by streptococci, staphylococcus, and MRSA infections.

, This infection is characterized by a sore throat. Bring your child to the doctor because he may need antibiotics.Your child may feel well enough to go back to school after being on antibiotics for 24 hours.
Check with your doctor to see what he or she recommends.

, This is a very contagious liver infection which causes nausea, vomiting, pain near the liver, joint pain, dark urine, clay-colored stool, and yellow skin and eyes. If you think your child has hepatitis A, bring him to the doctor immediately.If it takes longer than a week for your child to feel well enough to go back, you may need to keep him home for longer., If the pain comes from an infection, your child may need antibiotics.Chances are your child will not be able to concentrate or learn well until his ears no longer hurt. Let him stay home until he feels better.
Ear pain can be caused by bacterial or viral infections. If left untreated, ear infections can lead to hearing loss., Consult with your child’s doctor and school nurse. It may be possible for your child to attend school or daycare, if your child has one of the following common infections:Scabies. This is a caused by a mite that burrows in the skin and lays eggs. It causes red bumps and tracks under the skin and is intensely itchy and contagious. See your doctor for prescription medications which will get rid of the infection.Lice. Lice are insects that live on human hair and lay their eggs in it. They cause itching, but do not carry dangerous diseases. The sticky eggs must be carefully removed with a fine-tooth comb. If you need to, you can keep your child home for a day or two to give you time to provide treatment. Medicated shampoos are also available over-the-counter and by prescription.Ringworm. Ringworm is a fungal infection that causes a rash with a characteristic red ring. Take your child to the doctor to see if he needs anti-fungal medications. The infected area must remain covered when he goes to school.Fifth’s Disease. This illness causes flu-like symptoms and at towards the end, a red rash that frequently occurs on the face and elsewhere on the body. Because of the red rash that appears on the cheeks, this disease is also called slapped-cheek disease. Once the rash develops, your child is not likely to be contagious. Your child should see a doctor if he has sickle cell anemia or a weakened immune system. It is also dangerous for unborn babies when they are exposed.Hand, foot, and mouth disease. This disease has painful blisters in the mouth and a red rash on the hands and feet. It may also have a fever and sore throat. If the child is drooling and has mouth sores, then he should stay home., If you must go to work or school when you are sick, you can still minimize the chances that you will infect others by keeping a distance. You can:Avoid giving hugs. If necessary, you can explain to people that you feel a little unwell and don’t want to infect them. Chances are they will agree that it is best if you stay away.
Don’t lean into people when talking or looking over their shoulder at a computer screen.
Wear a face mask, to prevent accidentally breathing on others.Minimize the amount of handshaking you do.

, This will prevent you from spraying little droplets with germs on others and on common surfaces that people touch.Cover your mouth with a tissue and throw it away afterwards. Even though it may look clean, you have just sprayed germs all over it.
If you do not have a tissue, sneeze or cough into your elbow, not your hands. While you are spreading germs to your clothes, your elbow is much less likely to come in contact with other people and communal surfaces than your hands.
If you cough or sneeze uncontrollably, wear a face mask.
Wipe down communal surfaces that you have touched with disinfectant wipes. This includes tables, desks, computer keyboards, and doorknobs.

, Do this before preparing food, after using the bathroom, after blowing your nose, after sneezing, after coughing, and before caring for or touching others. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend following these steps:Rinse your hands under running water. Turn off the facet to conserve water.
Lather your hands with soap. You should have a soapy film on everywhere on your hands including the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your fingernails.
Rub your hands together vigorously for at least 20 seconds.
Rinse off all the soap and germs with clean water.
Air dry or use a clean towel to dry your hands. Using a dirty towel defeats the purpose of washing your hands!

, If you or your child have any of these symptoms, see a doctor:Difficulty breathing
Fast breathing
A bluish tinge to the skin
Dehydration
Unresponsiveness or unable to wake up
Extreme irritability
Fever. For infants and young children, check with your doctor even for low fevers of 100 F, or for a newborn that has a lower than normal temperature.Fever for more than 3 daysFever with a rash
Flu-like symptoms that go away, then come back with a fever and bad cough
Pain in the abdomen or chest
Pressure in the abdomen or chest
Dizziness
Confusion
Severe vomiting
Listlessness
Severe head or throat pain

Do pursed-lip breathing.,
Breathe from your diaphragm.,
Rest when you are short of breath.",How to Live With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease2," Breathe in through your nose for two seconds and purse your lips like you are about to blow out a candle. Breathe out slowly through your pursed lips. You should exhale for two or three times longer than you inhaled.This technique slows down your breathing and keeps your airways open for longer.

, Relax your shoulders and place one hand on your chest and one hand on your belly. Breathe in through your nose for two seconds. You should feel your belly rising as you inhale. Gently press your belly as you exhale. Pushing puts pressure on your diaphragm and helps you get air out.Your diaphragm does not work as well when you have COPD.
This technique is more difficult than pursed-lip breathing. Get help from a respiratory therapist or physical therapist when using this technique.

, Any time you feel short of breath, stop what you are doing. Sit down, relax your shoulders, and start doing pursed-lip breathing until you can catch your breath. You can resume your activity once you catch your breath.Continue doing pursed-lip breathing when you resume your activities.

See your doctor regularly.,
Use a controller medication.,
Have a rescue medication.,
Try oxygen therapy.",How to Live With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease3," A health care professional will help you manage your COPD and develop a treatment plan that works for you. Everyone with COPD does not take the same medications. Speak openly with your doctor about your symptoms, emotions, and how COPD is affecting your life.Show your doctor how you use your medications to make sure that you are using them correctly.

, A controller mediation is a medicine that you take daily. Long-acting bronchodilators are used as controller medications. You typically use an inhaler to take this medication. They work to keep your lungs open and help prevent exacerbations. You will not feel any immediate effects from taking a controller medication.Take this medication no matter how you feel.
Ask your doctor how to take the medication and always follow the instructions. All inhalers do not work the same.

, Short-acting bronchodilators are used as rescue medication. Use your rescue medication when you need immediate relief. You should feel better in a minute or less. If your controller medication is working well, you should only need to use your rescue medication a couple times a week.The effects of your rescue medication only last four to six hours., If your COPD makes it difficult to get enough oxygen in your blood stream, your doctor can prescribe oxygen therapy. Your doctor will decide if you need oxygen for rest, exercise, and/ or sleeping, the type of oxygen system you need, and how often you must use your oxygen.Your doctor will take a blood sample to determine if you need oxygen therapy.They may also do a home evaluation to monitor oxygen during activity and while you sleep, as well as do an evaluation in the clinic which assesses oxygen levels at rest, with activity, and response to supplemental oxygen.
If your doctor thinks this is a good option for you, you will receive a certificate of medical necessity.
It's also important to use oxygen as prescribed to avoid complications such as hypercapnia (excessive carbon dioxide in the bloodstream).

Avoid irritants.,
Monitor air quality.,
Get vaccinated.,
Recognize warning signs.",How to Live With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease4," Lung irritants can cause your COPD to flare up. Common irritants include cigarette smoke, air pollution, dust, and chemical odors. The leading cause of COPD is smoking. If you have not done so already, quit smoking.Talk to your doctor about classes and programs to help you quit smoking.
You can also call 1-800-586-4872 or 1-800-QUIT-NOW to speak with a tobacco cessation counselor.

, Before you head out, check the air pollution and air quality index. If the weather is bad, try to stay indoors as much as you can. You can find the air quality reports on the radio, local news, or by visiting the Environmental Protection Agency website.If your house has been painted or sprayed for insects, have it done while you are gone for an extended period of time.

, Get the flu shot every year. You are more likely to have complications from the flu because of your COPD. The flu virus changes each year so you will need to get the shot yearly. You may also need to get a pneumonia vaccine.


There are now two pneumonia vaccines and, if given before age 65 due to high risk (like COPD), the boosters are given after age 65, when it is recommended for everyone., Your COPD may flare up. It is much easier to manage if you catch the warning signs early on. You may be able to manage your symptoms on your own or you may need to call your doctor. Talk to your doctor about the appropriate time to call or to seek medical attention. Early warning signs include:Wheezing, or more wheezing than usual
Coughing and/or shortness of breath that is worse than usual
Increased amount of mucus or a change in the color of your mucus (e.g. yellow, green, tan, or bloody)
Swelling in your feet or ankles
Confusion or feeling extremely sleepy

Stay away from people with contagious diseases.This might seem obvious, but you would be surprised by how challenging it can be.,
Maintain your personal hygiene.,
Use hand sanitizer if a sink is not available.Some work environments such as hospitals or doctors' offices have sinks readily available for easy and regular hand washing.",How to Prevent Bronchitis1," From a coworker with a cold to your child’s friend with the flu, you are constantly exposed to people who can get you sick. When you know someone is sick, try to avoid being near them. If you do have to be near them, wash your hands when they leave and avoid sharing anything.;
, This mostly involves washing your hands anytime you are exposed to something that could get your sick. When you wash your hands, make sure you wash them with warm water and soap. Occasions where you should wash your hands include:Going to the bathroom
Riding public transportation
Being around someone who is sick
Handling raw meat
Anytime you sneeze or cough

, However, if this is not the case at your job (or in your life), another option is to carry with you a small bottle of alcohol-based hand sanitizer. You can then use it anytime you are touching public surfaces, or anytime you are around someone with a cold or flu.


Also avoid touching your face, especially when your hands are not clean."

Quit smoking.Studies show that people who smoke cigarettes or are exposed to a lot of secondhand smoke are much more likely to develop chronic bronchitis.Because of this, it is important that you quit smoking or avoid second-hand smoke if you are concerned about getting bronchitis.,
Limit your exposure to things that can irritate your lungs.,
Follow a diet that focuses on boosting your immune system.,
Be extra cautious if you have an immune disorder.When you have a weakened immune system, your body is much more likely to let bacteria or a virus get into you and make you sick (as your immune system is less able to fight it off).,
Get your flu shot each flu season.Flu season, which happens in the fall and winter months, is the time when you are most likely to get bronchitis.,
Ensure that your child has all of his or her recommended immunizations.In addition to getting your annual flu vaccine, it is especially important to make sure that all of your children (if you have any) are also up to date on their vaccinations.",How to Prevent Bronchitis2," Substances in the cigarettes cause your respiratory tract to become inflamed, which makes you much more prone to getting a bacterial or viral infection.


Smoking leads to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which can make you more prone to infections like bronchitis.

, Dust and other particles, like bleach, asbestos, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide, floating around in the air can really irritate the lining of your throat and respiratory tract.When your respiratory tract becomes irritated, it will also become inflamed which greatly increases your chances of developing bronchitis. If you work at a job where you are exposed to airborne particles a lot, you should wear a face mask that covers your mouth and nose so you aren’t breathing those particles in all day.You should also always shower after work so that you wash off any extra particles that may have landed on you during the day so that your house and bed don't get filled with the particles that you bring home from work.
Prolonged exposure to irritants can lead to serious health conditions, such as silicosis asbestosis.

, In particular, vitamin C and zinc have been shown to enhance the effectiveness of your immune system. If you feel like your immune system is weak, and you’re afraid that you will develop bronchitis because of this, increase your intake of foods that contain a lot of vitamin C and zinc..


Foods that are rich in vitamin C include: lemons, grapefruits, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, kiwi fruit, oranges, lime, pineapple, Brussels sprout, spinach, onion, garlic and radishes.
Foods that are rich in zinc include: spinach, mushrooms, beef, lamb and pork meat.

, If you have an immune system disorder, you should take every precaution to avoid getting bronchitis, since it will be harder for you to get rid of.


Immune disorders include intense allergies, asthma, lupus, type 1 diabetes, and multiple sclerosis.
Ways to boost your immune system include taking multivitamins, reducing the amount of stress you experience, getting enough sleep, exercising at least four days a week, and getting your immunizations.For more information on how to strengthen your immune system, click here.

, Because of this, it's a good idea to get the flu shot so that you reduce your chances of getting the flu, which can lead to developing bronchitis.


The flu shot is recommended for those six months of age or older.
Par of the shot is manufactured in eggs. If you have an egg allergy, talk to your doctor before getting a flu shot.

, There is a routine immunization schedule for infants and children, which provides long-term immunity against a number of potentially serious infections, some of which could lead to bronchitis.


Speak to your local public health nurse or to your family doctor if you have questions regarding the status of your child's immunizations.

Watch out for symptoms of acute bronchitis.This form of bronchitis generally develops when you also have an upper-respiratory infection such as a cold or the flu.,
Be aware that there are two main forms of bronchitis: acute and chronic.,
Know when to seek professional medical care.If you display any of the following signs or symptoms, it is time to schedule an appointment with your family doctor immediately.",How to Prevent Bronchitis3," You will generally have a fever (100.2–102.4°F or 37.9–39.1°C) and feel like all of your muscles are aching.


In the first two or three days of being sick, you might have a dry cough (one where you don’t cough up phlegm) accompanied by a slight burning sensation in your chest that feels like heartburn.
Five or six days after that, you will have a productive cough (which means you will be coughing up phlegm) and then your symptoms will generally clear up., Acute bronchitis is more common and it is less worrisome. It is normally brought on by a viral or bacterial infection that runs its course and then goes away. You can get rid of it by managing the cough that develops or, in more intense instances, with an antimicrobial treatment.


Chronic bronchitis, on the other hand, is persistent and harder to get rid of. Chronic bronchitis is generally recognized as a wet cough that lasts longer than three months that is paired with a lot of mucus production that you will cough up and have to spit out. This sort of bronchitis can lead to other, worse respiratory diseases so it is important to manage it early on.
Speak to your doctor if you have a persistent cough or a worry of chronic bronchitis.
Patients with cystic fibrosis are prone to recurrent bronchial infections leading to a condition called bronchiectasis.

, (Note that if you cannot get a same-day appointment with your family doctor, go to the emergency room; the more quickly you can be diagnosed and treated, the better.)


A cough with thick or bloody mucus
Shortness of breath leading to difficulty breathing
A fever greater than 100.4 °F
Also schedule an appointment with your family doctor if you have repeated episodes of bronchitis or a cough that has persisted for over three weeks.

Stop smoking.,
Protect yourself against pollution.,
Allow yourself to cough.",How to Heal the Lungs Naturally1," Prevention is always better than treatment. With this is mind, you should try not to expose your lungs to extra stress, particles, carcinogens, and smoke. With this in mind, you should not smoke, or quit smoking if you do. It is debilitating to your lungs, puts harmful chemicals such as nicotine into your body, and wrecks your lungs through the constant exposure to smoke. Smoking also causes tar to coat your lungs, which is extremely harmful to your lung health.


Nicotine withdrawal can be quite severe if you quit smoking. Common symptoms include mood problems, dizziness, weight gain, anxiety, depression, increased coughing and insomnia. You don't have to quit without help. You can use support groups, nicotine gum and patches, or prescription medicines, such as Chantix.
For support in this sometimes difficult process, try help site such as The American Cancer Society, Smoke Free and the American Lung Association.;
, If you live in an area with high levels of air pollution, or if you have asthma, you can take a number of approaches to protect yourself. You can wear a mask when you go outside. You may also consider getting a home air filter system. This can protect you in your home against pollution.There are special masks you need to buy for lung health. Try masks that have active carbon or charcoal in the filter to prevent you from breathing in most allergens, pollutants, smoke, and chemicals. You can also buy more specialized masks with a stronger P100 filter, those made for specifically for the effects of cold weather, or ones that help with respiration.You can also sign up for an alert system, such as EnviroFlash, which sends email alerts regarding the air quality in your area. With a bit of advance notice, you can either stay at home when the air quality is bad or be aware of the problem and wear a protective mask when you go outside., One of the best natural methods to support your lungs is to allow yourself to cough. Many people tend to use cough suppressants, but in most circumstances, you should not do this. Coughing is how your lungs get rid of the mucus in your lungs that has allergens or infection in it. Suppressing the cough allows the infected mucus and allergens to remain in your lungs.


Consider using a cough suppressant only if the coughing causes significant discomfort or if you cough so much that you can’t catch your breath.

Stop smoking, or don't start in the first place.,
Get plenty of rest.,
Drink plenty of fluids.,
Follow any directions.",How to Heal Your Lungs After a Bacterial Virus Infection," This should be a no-brainer, but it is surprising the amount of people who continue to smoke. They wonder why they are experiencing a persistent cough or having relapses after 6 months. Stop smoking long enough for your lungs to get a start at healing.;
, Whether you feel the need to get extra rest or not, your lungs and your body will need it. The respiratory illness you have recently endured has taxed every system in your body. It is your entire physiological well-being, which is dependent upon you getting extra rest, to help promote healing (not only in the lungs, but in other systems as well).

, During a bacterial or viral respiratory illness, a thick, almost gelatin-like substance accumulates within the lungs. This is referred to as sputum, and can become so copious that it can make the healthy exchange of oxygen, O2, and carbon dioxide, CO2, almost impossible to attain.


Your treatment, which you have now completed, helped to prevent this from occurring. In order to continue expelling the remaining sputum, your lungs must have adequate fluid available through oral intake in order to make the sputum more fluid like and easy to cough up. This will allow the proper O2 to CO2 exchange occur.

, Take all of your medications prescribed to You by Your doctor. It is important to follow your physician's orders. If you feel you are not getting better, or your symptoms return, contact your doctor right away. Sometimes a, relapse can be harder to treat than the original condition.

Switch to organic foods.,
Limit processed and pre-packaged food.,
Increase your intake of vegetables and fruits.,
Limit meats.,
Eat fatty fish.,
Incorporate beans.,
Take supplements.,
Do not take beta-carotene supplements.,
Drink lots of water.",How to Heal the Lungs Naturally2," Diet can help you protect and heal your lungs through the vitamins and minerals found in certain foods. Switch to organic foods as much as possible. Studies show that a number of different preservatives and additives found on in non-organic foods may be associated with asthma attacks, lung cancer, and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), which includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis.


These additives include sulfites, aspartame, parabens, tartrazine, nitrates and nitrites, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and benzoates. If you can't switch over to a full organic diet, try to avoid any foods that have these additives in them. Check the labels of foods to ensure you avoid these products as much as possible.

, When trying to heal and support your lungs, you should limit the amount of pre-packaged and processed foods you eat. This will help you limit your intake of additives and preservatives, which can cause breathing problems and increased lung sensitivity. You should try to make most of your food from scratch, though it may take some extra practice and planning.


You will be healthier if you cook more from scratch and use foods that have not been processed. This is because they retain most of the vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients inherent in the foods.
A way to tell if a food is too processed is to see if it is too white, such as white bread, white rice, or white pasta. Instead, eat whole grain breads, brown rice, and whole grain pasta.
This means that you should include only unprocessed complex carbohydrates. If you avoid white bread and other processed foods, you have essentially excluded any other carbohydrates. When complex carbs are processed, they are broken down into the simple carbohydrates that are used by the body., In your daily food routine, you should try to increase your portions of vegetables and fruit. Reduced amounts of fresh fruit and vegetables are associated with lung diseases, particularly with asthma and COPD. Fruits and vegetables contain high levels of antioxidants, which have been shown to protect against asthma and COPD and may protect against cancer.For the highest level of antioxidants, choose brightly colored fruits and vegetables, such as blueberries, raspberries, apples, plums, oranges and citrus fruits, leafy green vegetables, winter and summer squash, and bell peppers., When promoting lung health, you should limit your meat intake, especially red meat. If you do want to eat meat, make sure the beef is lean, preferably grass fed and hormone and antibiotic free. Eat poultry that's raised without hormones or antibiotics. You should also remove the skin.Poultry, such as chicken and turkey, are rich sources of vitamin A. People with vitamin A deficiencies are susceptible to bacterial infection in the lungs. Increasing your intake of vitamin A helps to kill harmful micro-organisms from the lining of lungs., You should incorporate more fish into your diet. You will gain more lung-healing benefits from fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel, trout, herring and sardines. Fatty fish contain omega-3 fatty acids, which promote lung health.


The anti-inflammatory property of omega-3 fatty acids helps increase the capacity to exercise, which improves lung health., As part of your healthy diet, try to include more beans and legumes in each meal. Navy beans, black beans, and kidney beans are good sources of protein. These beans, as well as legumes such as lentils, contain many of the vitamins and minerals needed to help maintain lung function.

, Consider supplementing your diet with extra minerals such as magnesium, zinc, and selenium. These minerals are necessary for proper lung function and improved health. Also, consider supplementing your diet with Vitamin D3 every day. Poor respiratory function is correlated with low Vitamin D levels.Always speak to a knowledgeable health care professional before taking any supplements and follow manufacturers' instructions when taking supplements.

, Beta-carotenes are found in natural foods and provide the building blocks for Vitamin A. The supplements, however, should not be taken if you smoke or are at risk for lung cancer. Some research indicates that beta-carotene supplementation may be associated with an increased risk of lung cancer in people who smoke.


There is no evidence, however, that ingesting beta-carotenes in everyday foods can increase the risk for cancer., Drinking lots of water keeps the lungs hydrated and free of mucus. It also allows for easy blood flow. Aim to drink 64 oz of water per day. Drinking enough water is also necessary to keep your mucus thin, which helps to prevent too much mucus from building up in your lungs and airways.


You can also increase your body's hydration levels by drinking herbal teas and juice. Any fluid that is non-caffeinated is considered part of your daily fluid intake.
You can also increase your fluids by eating fruit and vegetables with a high water content, such as watermelon, tomatoes and cucumbers."

Increase cardiovascular workouts.,
Start breathing exercises.,
Try pursed-lips breathing.,
Use diaphragmatic breathing.,
Perform a deep breathing exercise.,
Use humming breath.,
Try the Chinese breathing exercise.",How to Heal the Lungs Naturally3," Exercise is important in maintaining cardiovascular health, but it is important for lung health as well. Exercise increases blood flow to the lungs and allows all the necessary nutrients to reach them. You should take it slowly at first and proceed with caution so you do not overdo it. Find the right pace for you and increase the level of exercise as you are comfortable.


When you first start, go for a long or brisk walk or use an elliptical machine. These exercises are not too strenuous but will get the blood and air moving through your lungs and body.
If you have lung or breathing problems, consult your doctor before doing any new exercises. She may have examples of safe exercises that will help increase your lung capacity and help you gain lung strength.

, Breathing exercises are done to help increase the amount of oxygen you take in and your ability to release the carbon dioxide. At first, any of these exercises might make you a bit dizzy. This is why most healthcare professionals advise a slow and steady approach. Once you get used to the method of breathing that works best for you, you will find that you are using that method more and more, often without actively or consciously thinking about it.


You can find a personal trainer or physical therapist who can guide you in increasing that capacity. Ask your health care professional for a referral.
Always speak to your physician or health care professional before starting any program of exercise. If you are working toward greater lung health, she may refer you to a pulmonary rehabilitation specialist.

, In general, most physicians will recommend one of two methods to ease any difficulty in breathing and increase lung capacity. The first method is pursed-lips breathing. Start this method by breathing in through your nose for about two or three seconds. Next, pucker your lips and breathe out slowly through your pursed or puckered lips for four to nine seconds. Repeat as often as you are comfortable.


If you get uncomfortable, wait an hour and try again. It will take practice and dedication, but if you do, you will soon find it easier to breathe and find that you feel better., You should teach yourself to do diaphragmatic breathing, which is breathing through your belly instead of your chest. Although most people don’t breathe this way, this is considered normal breathing. It uses the diaphragm, which is the strip of muscle below your lungs that is the main muscle of breathing. First, relax your shoulders, back and neck. Place one hand on your belly and one on your back. Inhale through the nose for two seconds. As you inhale, move your belly outward. Then, breathe out through pursed lips to help control the rate of exhalation while gently pressing on your belly. This pushes up on the diaphragm, strengthening the muscle.


This will take some practice to master. It is not easy to retrain yourself to use the diaphragm, but if you watch babies, this is the way they breathe. They don’t use what are called the “accessory muscles of breathing,” which is the muscles of the neck, shoulders, back, and rib cage. Once you get it, use the method for as long and as often as you are comfortable., There is a variation on the pursed-lips and diaphragmatic breathing methods adapted from the University of Missouri at Kansas City. For the deep breathing method, lie flat on your back. Use pillows under your knees and neck to make sure you are comfortable. Put your hands palm down on your stomach, right below the rib cage. Place the fingers of your hands together so you can feel them separate and know you are doing the exercise correctly. Take a long, slow deep breath by expanding your belly. Your fingers should separate as they lie on your belly.


This exercise ensures that you are using your diaphragm to breathe rather than your rib cage. The diaphragm creates suction that pulls more air into your lungs than can be achieved by expanding the rib cage.
Do this whenever you are short of breath or as often as you can. At first, you may feel a bit dizzy because you are pulling more oxygen into your lungs than you are used to. If you feel uncomfortable at any time, stop. However, you can repeat this as often as you want., You can increase your lung capacity by strengthening your diaphragm. To do this method, first start with the deep breathing exercise. As you exhale, make a humming sound. This noise moves your diaphragm and helps strengthen the muscle. Do this whenever you are short of breath or as often as you can. At first you may feel a bit dizzy. Don't be alarmed. This is because you are getting more oxygen than you are used to getting at one time.


If at anytime you feel uncomfortable, stop. However, you can repeat this as often as you are comfortable., For this exercise, you need to sit down comfortably. Take three short inhalations through the nose. On your first inhale of breath, lift your arms, reaching in front of you and keeping the arms at shoulder level. On the second intake of air, move your arms to the side, keeping your arms at shoulder level. On the third intake, lift your arms over your head.


Repeat 10 to 12 times.
If this exercise causes any dizziness, stop. Once you do, the lungs natural rhythm will take over immediately."

See your doctor if you have signs of an infection.,
Watch for changes in the mucus.,
Take antibiotics as prescribed.,
Seek medical help for persistent problems.,
Ask about structural abnormalities.",How to Get Rid of Mucus1," If you have ongoing problems with nasal mucus and sinus congestion, then it is possible that bacteria can become lodged in your sinuses and develop into a sinus infection.Symptoms of a sinus infections include prolonged sinus pressure, congestion, pain, or a headache for more than seven days.
If you develop a fever, you may have a sinus infection.;
, If the mucus changes to a greenish or yellowish color instead of clear or develops an odor, then you may have bacteria growing in your sinus passages leading to a sinus infection.


When your sinuses get blocked with congestion, the mucus, and bacteria that is normally produced gets trapped. If the congestion and pressure are not relieved, the trapped bacteria can lead to a sinus infection.
You may also get a viral sinus infection if the congestion and pressure were caused by a cold or the flu.
Antibiotics are ineffective if the infection is due to a virus. If you have a cold or flu virus, treat with zinc, vitamin C, and/or pseudoephedrine.

, If your doctor determines that you have developed a bacterial sinus infection, antibiotics may be prescribed for you. Be sure you take them exactly as prescribed and for the full duration of the prescription.Even if you start to feel better quickly, finish the prescription as prescribed. Not doing so may result in resistive strains of bacteria.It is also beneficial as the bacteria can still be lingering in your sinus passages.
Be aware that some doctors may prescribe antibiotics before receiving test results that identify the actual cause of infection.You may ask for a culture to be taken to be sure the correct antibiotic is prescribed.
If the symptoms persist even after you have finished the course of antibiotics, let your doctor know. You may need another course or a different antibiotic.
Talk to your doctor about allergy testing or other preventive measures if this happens to you frequently.

, Some situations of excessive mucus production seem to go on and on, no matter what treatments you try.If you have persistent problems with rhinitis, or continued and excessive mucus production, talk to your doctor.
You may need to undergo a series of tests to determine if you are allergic to things you come into contact with in your home or workplace.
Plus, you may have developed a nasal polyp or other structural change in your sinuses that is contributing to your lingering problem.

, The most common structural abnormality that causes excessive mucus is the development of nasal polyps.Nasal polyps can develop over time. Small polyps most often go unnoticed and cause no problems.
Larger polyps can block the airflow through your sinus passages, and cause irritation that leads to excessive mucus production.
Other structural abnormalities are possible, such as deviated septum, and enlarged adenoids, but they do not usually cause excessive production of mucus.
Injury to the nose or surrounding area can also result in structural abnormalities, and can sometimes have related symptoms like mucus production. Talk to your doctor if you have had a recent injury to your facial area or nose.

Drink a carbonated beverage.,
Eat airy foods.,
Force the air out by changing positions.,
Take antacids.,
Trigger your gag reflex.",How to Force a Burp1," Soda, beer, sparkling water, champagne, or other carbonated beverages contain gases. This is what makes them bubbly. If you drink this sort of beverage, then, the gases will build up in your stomach and more than likely trigger a burp, which might help to relieve your abdominal discomfort. Try it!Don’t just drink the beverage – chug it. Drinking quickly will make you swallow even more air, increasing the probability of a big belch. Drinking through a straw does the same.
For even more effect, try to drink your soda rapidly through a straw.
Another trick is to drink water from the opposite side of the glass. To do this, hold a glass of water and fold your body in half, as if you’re stooping over a water fountain. Place your mouth on the opposite side of the cup and slowly tilt the water into your mouth. Take small sips, swallow, and then stand up straight.;
, As with airy drinks, so with airy foods. Have you ever wondered why eating an apple often ends with an enormous belch? This is mostly because apples contain a good deal of air, which is released when you chew and start to digest them. Why else would people “bob for apples”? Try this to make yourself burp.


Apples certainly aren’t the only food to contain air. Try other fruit like pears and peaches, or a souffle.
You might also try chewing gum or hard candy. While neither of these foods contain much air, chewing them will force you swallow it – leading to, ideally, a burp.

, If bloating is making you uncomfortable, changing positions can put pressure on the air inside of you and force it upward. Stand up if you are sitting down or sit down if you are standing.


Try exercise to force a burp. Walking, jogging, or light aerobics may jostle the gas out of your stomach. For example, you might walk around and jump short distances up and down, on the balls of your feet.
Alternately, lie on your stomach and then curl your knees toward your chest. Stretch your arms forward as far as they will go and arch your back. Repeat as needed, keeping your throat and head level.
Lying down and quickly sitting up is another option.

, Some types of antacid create excess gas, which will increase your urge to burp. Others, however, containing the drug simethicone, break up the gas bubbles in the stomach and eliminate the need to burp.Either way, you should resolve your discomfort by taking an antacid.


Antacids will also help to control acid reflux or “heartburn,” which is a common cause of abdominal discomfort and belching.

, Triggering your gag reflex should be a last resort, as it causes an unpleasant sensation and possibly vomiting, you can try to trigger your gag reflex. If nothing else works, however, consider getting rid of your gassy discomfort by forcing a burp this way.


Most people have gag sensitivity. In order to trigger yours, touch the soft palate at the back of your mouth with a clean finger or tooth brush.
The aim here is to make you burp, not vomit. Be light on the touch and only engage the reflex enough to release the air in your stomach.

Try eating just a bit.,
Drink something.,
Go for the BRAT diet.,
Go to the bathroom.,
Vomit.,
Rest.,
Visit your doctor.",How to Fix an Upset Stomach," Something light and simple might settle your stomach. Try eating yogurt, bland crackers, or high fiber foods. Avoid spicy foods, dairy (yogurt being the lone exception -- it's full of probiotics), or anything with a strong scent.


If the thought of food just grosses you out, don't force it. You may just make things worse.;
, Your stomachache may be a result of dehydration. If you want, try an herbal tea as an alternative to water. Also try Gatorade; it has many more minerals that help calm your stomach.


If you're puking or have diarrhea, it's especially important that you stay hydrated. Your body is losing fluid at an alarming rate and it should be replaced as soon as possible.
If neither of these are an option, try ginger ale or flat soda. Flat! Not the fresh kind., BRAT stands for Bananas, Rice, Applesauce and Toast. You can add other bland foods to the BRAT diet, too. For example, you can try saltine crackers, boiled potatoes, or clear soups. Don’t start eating dairy products and sugary or fatty foods right away. These foods may trigger nausea even more.This may not be so good for children, however. Because BRAT diet foods are low in fiber, protein, and fat, the diet lacks enough nutrition to help a child's gastrointestinal tract recover. The American Academy of Pediatrics now recommends that kids resume eating a normal, well-balanced diet appropriate for their age within 24 hours of getting sick. That diet should include a mix of fruits, vegetables, meat, yogurt, and complex carbohydrates., Take a book or something to take your mind off the pain. Unfortunately, you may just have to wait.

, Sometimes, the pain is not going to go away until you throw up. Be ready as soon as your stomach cramps begin, but only induce vomiting if the pain has not stopped within 2-3 hours.


Though it won't be your most fashionable accessory, keep a bucket or other container nearby. You'll be grateful you don't need to run to the bathroom.
If you still have pain in 5-6 hours after vomiting a few times and eating something, call your doctor. Take your temperature and monitor your other symptoms, too.

, Though motion sickness is a very specific thing, once you're already sick, motion does you absolutely zero favors. Lie down and get comfortable. If that's not an option, stay as motionless as possible.


This goes for babies and children, too. All ages will benefit from outside stability when the same can't be said for the insides.

, If the problem persists, your upset stomach is just a symptom of a grander issue. If you experience nausea for an extended period of time in addition to other symptoms like pain, trouble walking, and rashes, call a doctor immediately.


Most upset stomachs resolve themselves within a few hours. If yours persists, look for other symptoms. If they are present, you may want to consider a doctor visit.

Ease into activities.,
Increase your lifestyle activity.,
Always do a warm-up.,
Add in low-intensity cardio exercises.,
Do light strength training.,
Try pilates and yoga for breathing exercises.",How to Live an Active Life with COPD1," With a serious lung disease like COPD, you have to be exceptionally careful when you start physical activity. Although exercise can help improve your COPD, you still need to ease into activities slowly.If you haven't been overly active, it's best to start very slowly with exercise. Don't feel like you need to be exercising for significant amounts of time.
Many physicians will recommend starting with just five or 10 minutes of activity.
Incorporating more activity into your daily life and being active for longer periods of time will help you build confidence in yourself and also strengthen your body.;
, Increasing your lifestyle activity is a great way to stay active without overdoing it. These are not cardio activities, but they also help keep your body moving and your lungs working.


Lifestyle activities are those exercises that are a part of your normal daily routine. They can include chores or yard work, walking up and down stairs and walking to and from your destinations.If you have COPD, some of these activities may be difficult for you initially. This is what makes lifestyle activities a great place to start improving and measuring progress.
For example, if you have trouble walking for long distances, make one of your first goals walking to get the mail everyday. Or if you have trouble with stairs, ask a family member to help you take the stairs more often during the day.

, When you're ready to progress to more structured exercise, you need to plan to include a warm-up. This is an essential component of safe exercise for those with COPD.The purpose of any warm-up is to slowly get your body primed for more intense exercises.
Warm-ups are especially important for those with COPD because your body needs extra time to get your breathing rate, heart rate and body temperature elevated.
A warm-up can also help prevent muscle soreness and improve flexibility.
Start by doing some simple stretches or walk very slowly for at least five to 10 minutes.

, Unless cleared by your physician, you should only participate in aerobic activities that are low in intensity. This level is the most safe for patients with COPD.Try using the perceived exertion scale to help you stay at a lower intensity. It's a one to 10 scale, with one being completely sedentary and 10 being your maximum level of exertion.
Those with COPD should aim for a three to four level on this scale. You can be slightly out of breath, but it shouldn't be difficult to breathe. You should be able to talk and get out short sentences without having to take a breath.
Activities you can try include: walking, water walking, biking or using the elliptical.

, Aerobic exercises are great to help improve the condition of your lungs and improve your cardiovascular system; however, strength training is an essential form of exercise as well.


Strength training, especially in your core and upper body, can help strengthen the muscles around your chest cavity. These help aid your body in breathing by strengthening the muscles that help with inhalation and exhalation.Only include one to two days of strength training each week. Also, there is no need to do more than about 20 minutes of these exercises.
Use light weights or weight machines to help build strength and muscle tone.

, Both pilates and yoga are great exercises to help strengthen your muscles. They are often specifically recommended for patients with COPD.


Both yoga and pilates are low-intensity exercises that have a significant focus on breathing.They help keep your heart rate and breathing pace low while having you practice deep breathing exercises.
This can help improve your coordination and improve your breathing function if done regularly.
Try including a yoga or pilates class one to two times a week. These may be used as your strength training exercises as well.

When you take herbal supplements, always follow your doctor's dosing instructions as well as the manufacturer's instructions about dosing.;
, Ginger supplements and tea can help with your heartburn. Ginger is an anti-inflammatory and a soothing agent for your stomach. Look for ginger supplements to take. You can also drink ginger tea. To make ginger tea, grate or cut 1 teaspoon of fresh ginger and add it to eight ounces of boiling water. Let the ginger steep for about five minutes, and then let it cool.


Drink ginger tea at any point during the day. You can also drink it about 20 to 30 minutes before meals to help prevent heartburn.
If you don't have fresh ginger, you can buy ginger tea bags.
Ginger can also help with nausea and vomiting, which are symptoms of severe heartburn.
Ginger tea is safe for pregnant women. , Fennel helps settle your stomach and decreases its acid levels. You can take a fennel supplement each day to help your heartburn. You can also make fennel seed tea to help with the heartburn. Drink two to three cups a day about 20 minutes before your meals.


To make the tea, crush about a teaspoon of fennel seeds and add it to one cup of boiled water.
You can add honey to help with the taste., Mustard seed is an anti-inflammatory agent as well as an acid neutralizer. You can take it as a supplement, a powder, or as prepared mustard. Take the supplement to help reduce your heartburn. You can also drink mustard seed tea to help with it as well.


To make mustard tea, either dissolve a teaspoon of mustard powder or prepared mustard in boiled water to make a tea.
If you have the stomach for it, you can also eat one teaspoon of prepared mustard by mouth., Chamomile is can help calm your stomach and acts as an anti-inflammatory agent. You can take this as a supplement daily to ease heartburn. You can also drink chamomile tea to help calm your stomach if you have heartburn.To make this tea, you can use loose leaf chamomile tea or buy premade bags of tea.

, Deglycyrrhizinated licorice root (DGL) helps heal your stomach and control your heartburn. DGL comes in chewable tablets that are safe to take every four to six hours. These chewable tablets have a strange, unappealing taste, but they are effective for heartburn.


You can take two to three tablets per dose.

It is available as a supplement in tablet and liquid form that can help with your heartburn. Look on the label to see how much to take of each form of the supplement.


Slippery elm is typically considered safe during pregnancy., Aloe vera acts to neutralize the stomach acidand helps decreases inflammation. To help ease heartburn, drink ½ cup of organic aloe vera juice. You can drink this all at one time or sip this throughout the day.


Since aloe vera can act as a laxative, you may want to limit how much aloe vera juice you drink to one to two cups a day., Although drinking an acidic substance may seem strange, it works with your stomach acid to treat heartburn. Mix one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar to eight ounces of water. Drink this when you have heartburn.


Don't use any other vinegar than apple cider. These do not work as well as to help the heartburn. The additional pectin from the apples act as a natural antacid.
You can also eat more apples to increase your pectin intake to reduce stomach acid., Herbal tinctures are herbal mixture suspended in alcohol or glycerite. These, sometimes called bitters, can be used to help reduce heartburn and improve digestion.Try common brands of tinctures, including Nature Works Swedish Bitters, Flora’s Swedish Bitters and Herb Pharm Digestive Bitters.


Always read and follow manufacturer’s instructions for these tinctures.

Use herbs.,
Try oregano.,
Use peppermint.,
Try eucalyptus.,
Take additional supplements.",How to Heal the Lungs Naturally4," There are many herbs that can help with breathing and lung health. There is not one correct way to take any of these herbs. You can drink them by making them as teas. You can also take them as supplements. If you don't want to ingest them, you can use these herbs as aromatherapy by heating them in water and letting the scent permeate the room.


To make a tea, use one teaspoon of dried herb per cup of boiled water. If you use as a supplement, follow the manufacturer’s instructions.

, The Italian herb oregano is a natural decongestant, anti-microbial and anti-histamine. The active agents appear to be volatile oils called carvacrol and rosmarinic acid. You can add this herb, either fresh or dried, to recipes for tomato sauces and to rubs on meats.


You can also take oregano as a supplement in its oil form., Peppermint's active ingredient is menthol. Menthol relaxes the respiratory tract muscles and acts as an anti-histamine. You can use peppermint as a fresh or dried herb in recipes for fish or desserts. You can also get it as an oil, which you put in food, take it as a dietary supplement, or apply it as a topical cream. There are also some versions of the oil that you can burn to permeate through the air.


Don’t apply peppermint or menthol oil directly to the skin of children. It has been associated with a decrease in the respiratory rate in children.Many people use menthol-based chest balms and throat sprays to help break up congestion.

, The leaves of a eucalyptus tree have been used for centuries. It's a natural decongestant, which loosens mucus, making it easier to cough out. The agents responsible for these properties are cineole, eucalyptol and myrtol. Clinical research suggests that eucalyptus can effectively treat chronic and acute bronchitis. You can take eucalyptus oil by mouth or as a topical rub, but it must be diluted.


Eucalyptus oil vapor acts as a decongestant when it is inhaled, making it effective in the treatment of bronchitis. Try placing a couple of drops of the oil into a bowl of hot water and inhaling the steam.
The diluted form of eucalyptus oil helps with coughing, swelling of the respiratory tract, bronchitis and numerous other respiratory problems.
It can be applied to the skin to help the swelling of respiratory tract mucus membranes., A few additional supplements might also be useful for lung health. You can take white horehound. It has been used in many traditions, including ancient Egyptian medicine, Ayurvedic medicine, Australian aboriginal and Native American medicines to treat different respiratory conditions. Cough lozenges such as Ricola drops contain horehound. Take 1-2 lozenges every 1-2 hours as needed.


Lungwort has been used for centuries as a treatment for lung disorders. It is a potent antioxidant and acts as an expectorant, which allows you to cough.
Elecampane contains inulin, which helps support mucus production and relaxes bronchial passages. It also has anti-bacterial properties.Do not use horehound if you have diabetes or high blood pressure.

Control your asthma triggers.,
Avoid certain foods when you have asthma.,
Avoid sugar and sugar substitutes.",How to Heal the Lungs Naturally5," Problems relating to asthma can cause serious damage to your lungs. A way to avoid this is to prevent attacks based on triggers, such as air quality and environmental issues. If you have asthma, you may consider wearing a mask to help protect you from some of the common triggers, including pollen, mold, pet dander, pollution and, to some degree, strong odors.You can also use air filtration systems to remove and prevent many asthma triggers from entering your home., People with asthma may have certain food triggers that are typically unique to each person. In general, individuals with asthma should avoid the common triggers such as eggs, fish, peanuts, soy, yeast, cheese, wheat and rice. Foods with a variety of preservatives, such as Monosodium glutamate (MSG), nitrates or nitrites, also can be triggers for asthma. These substances also decrease the efficacy of rescue inhalers.


These common allergies are the basis for the suggestion of an organic, whole food diet for asthma sufferers., Sugars and sugar substitutes can be detrimental to your lung health. A study has shown that asthma can be associated with high sugar intakes. Avoid candy, sugary beverages, snack cakes and other sugary snacks.If you need a sweetener for tea or coffee, try using the herb stevia as a sugar substitute.

Use a neti pot.,
Make your own saline solution.,
Apply warm compresses to your face.,
Sleep with your head elevated.,
Humidify your living space.,
Use steam.,
Avoid irritants.,
Protect your sinuses from sudden temperature changes.,
Blow your nose.",How to Get Rid of Mucus2," A neti pot is a device that resembles a small teapot. Used correctly, a neti pot flushes out mucus and trapped irritants, and moisturizes your sinus passages.The device works by putting saline or distilled water in one nostril and allowing it to drain out the other, removing unwanted irritants and germs.
Fill the neti pot with about 4 ounces of saline solution, then lean over a sink, turning your head sideways and hold the spout up to the upper nostril.
Tip the pot to fill the nostril and let it run out the other nostril. Repeat the procedure using the other nostril.
This process is called irrigation since you are flushing out the passages with a liquid to get rid of unwanted mucus and irritants that are causing the mucus. Use your neti pot once or twice daily.
Neti pots provide a moisturizing and soothing effect to the sinuses. A neti pot can be purchased inexpensively over-the-counter. Be sure to clean your neti pot thoroughly after each use.

, If you choose to make your own saline solution, use distilled or sterile water.You can also use water that has been boiled then set aside to cool. Do not use water straight from the tap since it can contain contaminants and irritants.


Using 8 ounces of water, add ¼ teaspoon of kosher salt and ¼ teaspoon of baking soda. Do not use regular table salt. Mix thoroughly then use the solution in your neti pot.
You can store the solution for up to five days in a sealed container, preferably refrigerated. Let the solution reach room temperature before using.

, The warm compresses can help relieve any pain from sinus pressure and help to loosen the mucus and allow it to drain to get it out of your sinuses.Wet a small towel or cloth with very warm water. Place the towel on your face where you feel the most pressure.
In general, cover your eyes, the area just above your eyebrows, nose, and your cheeks just below your eyes.
Warm the cloth again every few minutes and reapply to continue to relieve the pain and pressure.

, This can help your sinuses to drain through the night and prevent mucus buildup in the nasal passages.Get enough rest to help keep your body strong and help to fight off a pending sinus infection from the excessive mucus in your sinuses.

, Dry air can act as an irritant and cause sinus problems that include runny nose and congestion.Humidifiers are available in two primary types, cool mist, and warm mist styles, but there are many variations for each type. If dry sinus passages that lead to discomfort, irritation, and resulting mucus drainage is an ongoing problem for you, consider adding a humidifier to the appliances in your home.Houseplants also do a good job of releasing moisture into the air. This may be the option instead of, or in addition to, the use of a humidifier.
Other simple ways to provide short-term humidification include safely boiling water on the stove, leave the bathroom door open when showering or running a hot bath, or even drying your clothes indoors.

, Steam helps to break up mucus in your chest, nose, and throat, allowing you to expel it from your body easier.Boil a pot of water and hold your face over the bowl and breathe in the steam for several minutes.
Cover your head with a towel to concentrate your exposure to the steam.
Additionally, you can take a hot shower to help break up the mucus.

, Exposure to irritants like the smoke of any kind, a sudden change in temperature, or strong chemical odors, can cause your sinuses to create even more mucus. Sometimes the mucus will run down the back of your throat, known as postnasal drip, and sometimes the irritants can cause your lungs to produce mucus, called phlegm. You may feel the need to cough to remove the buildup of the phlegm.Quit smoking if you do smoke. Try to avoid being exposed to second-hand cigarette or cigar smoke.
If you know this is a trigger for you, also take care to avoid situations outside that may involve burning yard debris, or stay upwind of the smoke from a bonfire.
Other pollutants that we breathe in can cause sinus problems as well. Watch for dust, pet dander, yeast, and molds, in your home and workplace. Be sure to change your air filters regularly to limit your exposure to irritants in the air of your home.
Exhaust fumes, chemicals used in your work, and even smog, can trigger an episode of mucus production caused by something other than an allergen. This is termed nonallergic rhinitis.

, If your work requires that you are outside in colder temperatures, it can often contribute to mucus buildup and release when you enter a warmer environment.Take steps to keep your face and nasal area warm during the time you are outside in the colder temperatures.
Use a toque for head protection, and consider wearing one that has facial protection, similar to a ski mask.

, Blow your nose gently and correctly. Some experts suggest that blowing your nose may cause more problems than it helps.Blow your nose gently. Clear only one nostril at a time.
Blowing too hard can cause small openings to develop in your sinus areas. If you have any bacteria or unwanted irritants in your nose, then you may be forcing them further back into your sinuses as you blow your nose.
Always use clean materials to blow your nose and wash your hands thoroughly afterward to prevent the spread of bacteria or germs.

Take an antihistamine product.,
Use decongestants.,
Use a medicated nasal spray.,
Consider using a nasal corticosteroid.,
Use a saline nasal spray.",How to Get Rid of Mucus3," Over-the-counter antihistamines are very helpful with minimizing the sinus problems associated with allergen exposure, or allergic rhinitis.Antihistamines work by blocking the reaction caused by exposure to an allergen. The reaction causes the release of histamine, and antihistamines help to minimize the body’s response to exposure to an allergen or irritant.
Antihistamines are most useful in people that have known allergies. Some are seasonal, and some are year-round risks.
Seasonal allergic problems are caused by the release of substances from the plants in our environment as they begin to bloom and blossom in the spring and fall. Fall allergies are often caused by ragweed.
People with year-round allergy problems are allergic to other things that are difficult to avoid in the environment. This can include everything from dust and pet dander to cockroaches and other insects that live in and around our homes.
Antihistamines help, but for people that have severe seasonal allergies or year-round problems, more intense allergy therapy may be warranted. Talk to your doctor about other options.

, Decongestant products are available as oral doses and nasal sprays. Oral decongestants contain the active ingredients phenylephrine and pseudoephedrine. The more common side effects cause by these products include nervousness, dizziness, feeling that your heart rate is increased, slight elevations in blood pressure, and sleep problems.Oral decongestants work by narrowing blood vessels in the nasal passages, helping the swollen tissues to shrink. These products cause more mucus to drain in the short term, but relieve the pressure and improve air flow so you can breathe easier.
Products that contain pseudoephedrine, originally marketed as Sudafed, can be purchased without a prescription but are kept behind the pharmacy counter due to concerns about inappropriate use.
You will be asked to provide identification, like a driver’s license, and your purchase will be recorded. This is only done for your safety to control the illegal use of pseudoephedrine.
Talk to your doctor about using oral decongestants if you have a heart condition or hypertension.

, Decongestant nasal sprays or drops are also available over-the-counter but should be used with caution. While these products can help to clear sinus passages and relieve the pressure quickly, using them for more than three days results in a rebound effect.A rebound effect means that your body adjusts to the medications being used, and the congestion and pressure returns, or is possibly worse than before when you try to stop using them. Limiting their use to no more than three days prevents that rebound effect.

, Nasal corticosteroids are available are nasal sprays and help to reduce inflammation in your sinus passages, stopping the runny nose and excessive mucus caused by irritants or allergens.They are used in the chronic treatment of nasal and sinus problems.


Some are available over-the-counter, and several still require a prescription to obtain. Fluticasone and triamcinolone are available in products that you can purchase without a prescription.
People that use nasal corticosteroids often experience relief from their sinus problems and excessive mucus within a few days of starting treatment. Be sure to follow the directions on the package.

, A saline nasal spray helps to clear your nasal passages of mucus and to moisturize your nasal passages. Use the spray as directed, and be patient. The first couple of uses may be helpful, but it will likely take repeated uses to get the full benefit.Saline nasal sprays work in a similar manner to that of a neti pot. They provide moisture to damaged and irritated sinus tissues and help to get rid of unwanted allergens and irritants.
Saline sprays are effective for relieving a runny nose and excessive mucus that is causing nasal congestion and postnasal drip.

Drink plenty of fluids.,
Have a hot toddy.,
Drink herbal teas.,
Get relief from other herbal products.,
Consider taking ginseng.,
Take elderberry, eucalyptus, and licorice.,
Review the facts on Echinacea.",How to Get Rid of Mucus4," Drinking water or other fluids helps to keep the mucus loose. While you may want to stop the runny or stuffy nose immediately, drinking fluids makes the mucus loose and runny. The fluids can help your body to get rid of the mucus you have so you can get back to normal.Drinking warm fluids helps in two ways. You are providing the recommended extra fluid intake, and, also, you will breathe in more moisture since the beverage you are drinking is warm or hot.
Anything that is warm works fine, such as coffee, hot tea, or even a cup of broth or soup.

, Recipes to make a hot toddy include using hot water, a shot of whiskey or other alcohol, fresh lemon, and an added spoonful of honey.Scientific evidence suggests that a hot toddy may be of some benefit in treating nasal congestion, mucous buildup, sinus pressure, sore throats, and sinus symptoms associated with a cold.
Limit your alcohol intake since excessive alcohol can cause your sinus passages to become more swollen, causing the stuffy feeling to worsen and increase the buildup of mucus. Consuming alcohol in large quantities, or repeatedly, is not good for your overall health and should be avoided.
Make a non-alcoholic hot toddy by using your favorite tea instead of the water and alcohol. Still add the fresh lemon and honey.

, Along with the benefit of breathing in extra moisture from a cup of hot tea, adding some herbs may help to provide additional relief from your sinus problems.Try adding peppermint to a cup of warm tea. Peppermint contains menthol and works well to help relieve sinus pressure, congestion, and mucus when it is inhaled and by drinking a cup of tea that contains peppermint.
Peppermint is commonly used to help treat the excessive mucus and sinus conditions. Peppermint and menthol can also help to treat coughs and chest congestion.
Do not consume peppermint oil by mouth. Do not use peppermint or menthol on infants.Green tea and green tea-derived supplements have been shown to contain ingredients that are overall helpful in maintaining good health and can help to treat some of the sinus symptoms that are most commonly associated with a cold. Increase the amount of green tea you drink gradually to avoid any unwanted effects such as stomach upset or constipation.Green tea contains caffeine among other active compounds. People that have any medical conditions, and women that are pregnant, should consult their physician before starting a regular regimen of green tea.
Green tea can interact with common medications. Examples include antibiotics, birth control pills, cancer medications, asthma medications, and stimulants. Always check with your doctor before making changes to your regimen or diet, especially when the changes involve herbal supplements.

, Use caution if you choose to use herbal products and always check with your doctor before starting a treatment regimen that includes herbal supplements.Some evidence suggests that a combination of herbs may be helpful in treating sinus problems. Available over-the-counter herbal sinus products contain a mixture of herbal ingredients.
Look for products that contain cowslip, gentian root, elderflower, verbena, and sorrel. Stomach upset and diarrhea may be a side effect of this combination of herbal ingredients.

, The North American variety of ginseng root is being studied to learn more about its properties to treat medical conditions. The research includes promising evidence in the treatment of sinus and nasal symptoms most often associated with the common cold.Ginseng root is categorized as “possibly effective” in adults in reducing the frequency, severity, and duration of symptoms experienced with the common cold, including sinus symptoms. No results are known involving the use of ginseng root in children.
Side effects reported with the use of ginseng root include blood pressure changes, hypoglycemia or low blood sugar, GI problems such as diarrhea, itching, and skin rashes, sleep difficulty, headaches, feeling nervous, and vaginal bleeding.
Drug interactions are common with ginseng and include medications used to treat schizophrenia, diabetes, depression, and blood thinners such as warfarin. People preparing for surgery and receiving some types of chemotherapy should not use ginseng or ginseng root products., These herbal remedies are commonly used to treat excessive mucus and sinus problems. Interactions are possible with existing prescribed medications so check with your doctor before you begin.People with medical conditions should not take some herbal remedies listed. Talk to your doctor first if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, have diabetes, high blood pressure, autoimmune diseases, kidney disease, liver disease, low potassium levels, hormone sensitive cancers or related illnesses, heart disease, or conditions that require regular use of aspirin or blood thinner drugs such as warfarin.Elderberry can be helpful with excessive mucus and sinus problems. Standardized Elderberry extract products that contain vitamin C and other herbs are used to help clear congestion.
Eucalyptus oil is a more concentrated form of eucalyptus and is poisonous if consumed by mouth. However, eucalyptus is contained in many manufactured products, particularly those that are designed to help control coughs. Products containing eucalyptus are either applied topically, such as a chest rub or is used in very small amounts in some throat lozenges. You can also use them in a humidifier as the vapor helps relieve congestion.
Licorice root is commonly used. However, there is little scientific evidence to support the use of licorice in treating sinus congestion and excessive mucus.

, Many people use echinacea, an herbal supplement, to treat nasal congestion, stuffiness and mucus buildup, and to treat the symptoms associated with a cold.Scientific research has not shown any significant benefit for the use of echinacea is treating sinus congestion or mucus drainage, or the nasal symptoms associated with colds.Echinacea is available in a wide variety of products made from different parts of the plant itself. The manufacturing of the products is not regulated or standardized. It is not always clear which part of the plant was used, and the resulting potency of the product may not be known."

Assume the position.,
Force air into your throat.,
Try to exhale with your throat closed.,
Swallow air.,
Burp the air out.",How to Force a Burp2," You can also learn techniques for forcing a burp, or what you might call a burp on demand. First of all, sit up straight in order to maximize your lung capacity.


Relax your lungs. Then, exhale in a normal breathing pattern, until your lungs feel neither full or empty.

, Expand your throat and jaws and then suck air in your mouth. Pull until you feel an air bubble enter your throat. When you have done this, block the front of your mouth with your tongue.


To do this, take your tongue and touch it to the top of your mouth.
Forcing air into the air into your throat can take a little practice. You don't want to inhale so forcefully that you swallow the air, otherwise you will feel more bloated. Try to keep it in your throat.
Release the air slowly by lowering your tongue and parting your lips, letting it escape.

, This is another way to force a burp that some people find easier. Close the airway at the back of your throat, but push out as though you were exhaling. This can put enough extra pressure on your stomach to push an air pocket up your esophagus.

, If the above technique is unsuccessful, try repeating the first steps but swallowing the air in your throat. First, exhale as much air as you can to empty your lungs. Take a deep breath and hold it as long as you can. Exhale, inhale another deep breath, and try to swallow the air.


This may not come naturally. One way trick that might work is to drink a glass of water while holding your breath. Pinch your nose, too, to ensure that you do not exhale any of the air.

, Once you have swallowed enough air, you should feel more pressure building up in your abdomen and esophagus. Open your mouth and allow a resounding belch to escape.


Tighten your abdominal muscles when you feel the burp rising. This should maximize both its force and volume.
Practice your burp on demand. Over time, the procedure will become easier and less uncomfortable.

Watch your diet.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Take herbal remedies.,
Look for other causes.",How to Force a Burp3," Gas is commonly produced by the digestion of food, and some foods are worse than others. Beans, onions, cabbage and other cruciferous vegetables, and whole grains are all notorious for producing gas. Avoid these foods or eat them with digestive aids if you are having issues with chronic bloating.Other foods that cause gas include fibrous fruits like apples, peaches, raisins, and apricots, vegetables like garlic, cucumbers, brussel sprouts, and legumes. Foods that don’t tend to produce gas include meat, fish, eggs, poultry, and carbohydrates like rice.Eat probiotic yogurt. Yogurts with active bacterial cultures can ease digestion and reduce the amount of gas you produce. Taking a digestive enzyme like Beano can work similar results.
Eat smaller bites or portion sizes, and avoid sucking on hard candies, drinking through straws, or chewing gum. These activities all lead you swallow air and will increase bloating., Water and other non-carbonated drinks can help to reduce gas and bloating, flushing out the system.Many people find that warm water particularly relieves their symptoms.


Drink slowly to avoid swallowing more air. Also, make sure that your choice of beverage is non-carbonated. Otherwise, you may end up more bloated.

, There are many home remedies that purport to relieve gas and bloating, called “carminatives.” These herbs work by soothing the lining of the digestive system, regulating and coordinating its functions – in other words, helping you to expel gas.Try some of these carminatives to see whether they work for you. For instance, teas made from peppermint, anise, and ginger – all carminatives – are thought to relieve bloating.Foods that contain carminative herbs and spices allspice, clove, juniper, bergamot, sage, thyme, basil, cinnamon, and nutmeg may also relieve symptoms.
You can purchase carminatives at natural health stores or many grocery stores.

, Occasional gas and bloating is natural. However, if you find that your symptoms are persistent, there may be an underlying issue like stress, food intolerances, gastrointestinal disorders, or poorly fitting dentures.Take note of any correlation between your diet and gas. For example, lactose intolerance, the inability to digest milk products, can cause flatulence, bloating, and abdominal cramps.Talk to a doctor if you are frequently uncomfortable and cannot determine the cause.

Carry emergency medications with you.,
Know your symptoms.,
Exercise with a friend.,
Avoid lung irritants.,
Find ways to be active with an oxygen tank.",How to Live an Active Life with COPD2," Whenever you plan to be active, it's important to be prepared and to be safe. An essential part of this is making sure you carry your medications with you.


Everyone with COPD will have some sort of emergency medication provided to them. Whether it's an inhaler or an oral medication, these can help relieve symptoms almost immediately.Have your emergency medications and an action plan with you at all times. Keep some in your car, at home, in your purse or briefcase and gym bag.
You should be able to have access to these at all times. Don't leave home without them and definitely do not engage in any sort of activity without having them handy.

, Your action plan should detail what you should do in a variety of situations. Knowing exactly what your symptoms are is an essential part of your action plan.Although you may know other people with COPD, everyone's disease plays out differently.
Be certain you know exactly what your symptoms are and what you should do when you experience them.
Symptoms to be aware of include: wheezing, difficulty breathing, chest tightness, coughing.
If you experience these symptoms while being active, stop all activity and treat symptoms as directed by your physician.

, Exercising with a friend is not only a fun way to be active, but can also help you feel a little safer and more comfortable while you exercise.


Those with COPD may feel nervous, scared or anxious about being active — even with daily or lifestyle activities. A flare up could cause symptoms which can be scary.
To help reduce your anxiety and stress about this, consider asking a friend, family member or co-worker to exercise with you.
Inform them of your condition and give them your action plan so they can help assist you if you experience a flare up of symptoms.

, Since COPD affects your lungs, if you breathe in certain irritants, they can cause a flare up of your symptoms and make breathing very difficult.


When you're exercising, the increase in your heart rate and breathing pace can make you more susceptible to certain lung irritants.
Irritants can include: dust, chemicals, pollution, fumes or cigarette smoke.Do not exercise or be active if you know there are any of these irritants near you. Stay indoors or choose another location to stay active.

, Many times, people with COPD end up needing oxygen to help them breathe more easily. You will need to work closely with your doctor to discuss which oxygen tank fits your needs and how to be active when using it.


Although oxygen tanks can be cumbersome, that doesn't mean you cannot be active. Some are large and will make exercise or activity difficult; however, other tanks are just about 5 pounds, which makes them much more convenient.Consider choosing a larger tank to have when you're at home and also a smaller portable one for when you want to exercise or go out for the day.
Make your oxygen more portable for you as well. Even if you have a larger tank, get a rolling cart, backpack or purse-like case for your oxygen. This makes it much easier to take along with you.
Also be mindful of the tubing. Use a shorter tube when you're going to be out and about. Those longer tubes can get in the way and get caught on objects.

Educate yourself about COPD.",How to Live an Active Life with COPD3," Smoking cessation is the single most important intervention especially in early stage of disease. Your lung function will improve, and the decline of your lung capacity will be slowed as soon as you stop smoking.

, Yearly preventative vaccination against influenza is recommended. Seek medical care as soon as you know you have been exposed to someone with influenza.

, If you live in industrialized cities where there is a lot of pollution, limit or avoid outdoor activities when the air quality is poor. Your local weather report may make note of days when air quality is especially poor, or you can check online on a site like AirNow in the US.

, Antihistamines, cough suppressants, sedatives, tranquilizers, beta-blockers and narcotics may have a negative effect on your breathing and ability of clearing airways. This may worsen your COPD symptoms. Talk to your doctor about which medications to avoid and if there are any alternative medications or treatments you can try.

, Since COPD is a progressive disease, it's important to talk to and visit your doctor regularly. They will be able to help you manage your condition and give you guidance on staying active.


COPD is usually treated with one or more medications. Talk to your doctor about your medications and how to use them correctly.
In addition, talk to your doctor about what medications to take and how to take them if you get tight or have trouble breathing.
If you want to stay active or become more active, ask your doctor for guidance. Ask what types of activities are safe for you, what intensity is appropriate and how long you can be active for.

, When you have a chronic disease like COPD, it's essential that you not only take your medications, but that you are consistent with them day-to-day. It is important to use your inhaler before exercise as a preventative measure.


COPD patients may require both oral medications and inhalers. They help decrease inflammation in the lungs, which helps you be able to breathe more easily.Many COPD medications are only active in the short-term (like four to eight hours). This means that you need to take them at least once, but even up to two to three times per day.
On days that you're feeling well, with no wheezing or difficulty breathing, it's still important that you take your medications. They are there to help prevent the onset of symptoms and keep inflammation down.

, Many physicians recommend that COPD patients have an action plan in place. Work with your doctor to help create your own personalized plan.


A COPD action plan is designed by you and your doctor and will give you instructions on what to do or what not do if you feel any symptoms.Your action plan should review day-to-day medications and scheduling.
In addition, it should list out your symptoms and what medications to take and how often.
For example, if you begin wheezing and coughing, what medication should you take?
Also take into account the severity of your symptoms. When should you call 911? Should you call with moderate symptoms or only severe symptoms?

, If you live with COPD, having quality nutrition is essential for managing symptoms and for prevention of exacerbations caused by infections. Eat in an upright position and eat slowly. If you get short of breath, use pursed-lip breathing. Include high protein and high fiber foods. Avoid simple carbohydrates and empty calorie foods (potato chips, candy, sodas) which often cause gas and bloating that leads to shortness of breath.Eat small, frequent meals instead of large ones. It is recommended to eat five to six small meals instead of three large ones. Making your stomach too full will make breathing work more difficult.
Avoid drinking before or with meals because it can make you feel bloated. Limit caffeine and salt intake, which may also make you feel bloated.
Choose foods that are easy to chew.

, Maintain healthy body weight. Consult with your healthcare practitioner about what should be your ideal weight and how many calories you should consume a day. If you need to lose weight, reduce your daily intake by about 500 calories, which can result in a 1 – 2 lb loss per week.


However, one in three of COPD sufferers are underweight and gaining weight can be a challenge., COPD doesn't only affect your lungs. Many COPD patients deal with depression and anxiety as well. The fear of getting too out of breath, having uncontrollable symptoms and not being able to be as active or social can affect your emotional health.If you're noticing that you're feeling more down or depressed since being diagnosed with COPD, consider seeking help from a support group.
Talking about your issues and how COPD is affecting your life is helpful. This is especially true if others have been in your shoes.
In addition, other patients can provide you with tips, tricks and ideas for how to cope better.

, If you're struggling continually with depression or anxiety related to your COPD, you might benefit from seeing a therapist on a more regular basis.


Work with your physician and get in touch with a behavioral therapist. They can help build your confidence in yourself, work on your action plan and help you learn to cope through this disease.
If you're feeling overly anxious about the possibility of a flare up, talk to your doctor about the best ways to manage your symptoms.
Having your action plan in place, your emergency medications readily available and support a system can help relieve some of this anxiety.

, When you're first diagnosed with COPD, it can be overwhelming and confusing. Educating yourself as much as you can will help you stay safe, manage your disease and may ease your anxiety.When you are prescribed medication, ask your doctor questions. Ask how the medication works, about potential side effects, how long it takes to work, and any other questions you may have.
Spend additional time learning about COPD, how it affects your body, different triggers and how to manage your COPD through lifestyle changes.

Avoid food and beverage triggers.,
Change the way you eat.,
Wear loose clothing.,
Stop smoking.",How to Fight Heartburn with Herbal Supplements2," If you have problems with heartburn, food may be the cause. If this is the cause, you should figure out what your triggers are.Start by keeping track of what you eat and writing down any heartburn you experience. After a week or two, cross list the foods you eat with a triggers list, look for common ingredients that caused you heartburn, and then pinpoint the trigger.


This can take a little guess work and testing of ingredients.But the sooner you figure out the reasons for your heartburn, the sooner you will lessen your heartburn.

, Differing food habits can cause you to experience heartburn. Overeating can cause heartburn, so avoid eating too much food at one time.This will reduce the amount of pressure on your stomach, which will help your avoid getting heartburn.


Also avoid eating late at night. Leave at least three hours between the time you last eat and the time you go to bed. This will reduce the amount of food in your stomach when you go to bed, which will lessen the pressure on your stomach.
You should also not lay down too soon after you eat. This will also cause you too much pressure on your stomach, which can cause heartburn., Tight clothing can cause unneeded pressure on your stomach. This means you should wear clothing that is less constrictive on your stomach or abdomen.For example, make sure your pants fit and you don't have a constricting belt on.

, One of the causes of heartburn is smoking. This increases the production of stomach acid, which causes heartburn. You can use medicines, over the counter aids, support groups, or personal strength to stop smoking.

Look for natural sources of acidophilus.,
Look for acidophilus-fortified foods.,
Consider taking an acidophilus supplement.",How to Find Acidophilus," Lactobacillus acidophilus and other probiotic members of the Lactobacillus family can be found naturally in fermented dairy products such as yogurt and kefir. Acidophilus is also found in fermented soy products, such as tempeh and miso, which are options for vegans and other vegetarians who don't consume dairy products, or for those who may be lactose intolerant.


Because commercially sold yogurt may sit in the dairy case for days before being bought, its acidophilus content will not be as high as that of homemade yogurt.;
, Lactobacillus acidophilus and its related probiotics are added to milk, which provides a medium for the beneficial bacteria to replicate in. Such milk is sold as ""acidophilus milk,"" ""sweet acidophilus milk,"" or ""probiotic milk.""


Acidophilus milk is often thicker than regular milk, about the consistency of buttermilk. Some acidophilus milk has a pronounced tangy taste to it, while other brands of acidophilus milk have a flavor closer to that of regular milk.

, Although acidophilus probiotics can be found naturally or added to foods, they are more commonly taken as supplements. Acidophilus supplements are available from nutrition supply stores in capsule, tablet, or powder form and may feature either freeze-dried or heat-killed bacteria.


Generally, acidophilus supplements in capsule or tablet form are preferable to supplements in powder form, as it may be harder to measure the correct dosage precisely with a powder, and the measuring spoon may contaminate the powder.
Acidophilus supplements typically contain a higher acidophilus content than either commercially sold or homemade yogurt. The most common acidophilus dosage is 1 or 2 capsules or tablets or 1/4 teaspoon (1.25 milliliters) of powder containing 1 to 2 billion colony-forming units (CFU), more if the supplement is being used to treat a yeast infection.
The genus name ""Lactobacillus"" for Lactobacillus acidophilus and some of its fellow probiotics means that the bacterium are found in and derived from milk. Even though these bacteria produce the enzyme lactase that aids in digesting the lactose protein in milk, if you're lactose-intolerant, you should choose an acidophilus supplement derived from a non-dairy source.

If you decide to use turmeric, mix 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of honey with 1 tsp (5 ml) of turmeric and consume the combination once a day.
To skip the turmeric yet still get the benefits of curcumin, take a 300 mg curcumin supplement, instead., The acidic properties of apple cider vinegar provide quick relief for gallbladder pain and may even significantly ease the pain within 15 minutes.


If you have a hard time with the taste of apple cider vinegar, mix 1 tsp (5 ml) into one 8 oz (250 ml) glass of apple juice and drink that. If you have a higher tolerance for the taste, though, you could try drinking 1/4 cup (60 ml) apple cider vinegar followed by 8 oz (250 ml) of apple juice for more immediate relief., Mix coarse salt into a glass of warm water and drink the water before going to sleep to help loosen painful buildup in your gallbladder.


For best results, use Epsom or sea salt. Do not use table salt.
Mix 1 tsp (5 ml) of salt into 8 oz (250 ml) warm water until dissolved. Drink.

, Placing a rag soaked in pure castor oil on your stomach, directly over your gallbladder, is said to help reduce pain associated with the gallbladder quickly and dramatically.


Castor oil is supposed to help neutralize inflammation and bring relief when applied topically.
Soak a clean rag in cold pressed castor oil, ringing out the excess before use. Place that rag on your bare skin over the pained gallbladder.
For even more effective results, place plastic over the rag, followed by a hot water bottle.
Keep this castor oil compress on for 30 minutes to maximize relief.

, Water can help keep bile in your gallbladder and make it easier for your body to break down fat that could otherwise build up and cause or worsen gallstones.


Get the maximum amount of benefit by drinking six to eight 8-oz (250-ml) glasses of water daily.

,


Note that omega-3 fatty acids, like those found in salmon and other types of fish, might actually help your body defend your gallbladder against stones.
In particular, you should cut unnatural fats like hydrogenated oils, soy, and canola from your diet. When you need to use a fat in your food, stick with something more natural, like butter.
Your fat intake should only make up 25 percent of your daily calories.
Dietary cholesterol should take up no more than 300 mg each day.

, Fiber helps your body eliminate problematic cholesterol from your body. As a result, there is less cholesterol in your body that could build up in your gallbladder.


Whole grains, lentils, and raw fruits and vegetables are typically good sources of fiber. Among vegetables, dark green leafy vegetables tend to have the highest fiber content.

, It makes cholesterol more water soluble, which allows the body to flush it out of your system instead of allowing it to continue building in the gallbladder.


Try to get at least 60 mg of vitamin C each day, if not more.
Vitamin C can be found naturally in many fruits, like oranges, as well as several vegetables, like red bell peppers.
Consider taking 200 mg of supplemental vitamin C daily if you are prone to gallbladder attacks.

, Soy products can throw off the hormones in your body, increasing your risk of gallstones and increasing any gallbladder pain you already feel.


Phytoestrogens in soy attack the thyroid, causing hormonal imbalance. Some preliminary research suggests that gallstones and gallbladder pain have some form of relationship with hormonal imbalance.

, Calcium can bind the acids present in gallbladder bile. As a result, new stones are less likely to form and stones you currently have are unlikely to worsen.


Women should get between 1000 and 2000 mg of calcium from all sources, and if necessary, they should consider taking 500 to 700 mg of calcium in supplement form. Men should limit calcium consumption to 500 to 600 mg from all sources.

, When you feel pain in your gallbladder, you should schedule an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible, especially if you believe the pain to be a result of gallstones or if more severe symptoms also accompany the pain.


No matter what is causing your gallbladder pain, you should talk to your doctor before taking anything for it, just to make sure that what you take will help instead of causing further damage. This is especially true of home cures you ingest.
See the doctor immediately if your gallbladder pain is moderate to severe, or if it is accompanied by fever, chills, a yellowing of the skin or eyes, or stomach pain in new areas other than the gallbladder., While home treatments can temporarily ease gallbladder pain, the only way to ease and get rid of that pain in the long run is to treat the condition responsible for it. Gallstones are usually the primary culprit, but gallbladder cancer could also be a risk.


Gallbladder pain caused by cancer is either treated by surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy.In early stages of the disease, surgery is an option. Your gallbladder will be removed and part of your liver may be removed, as well.
In late stages, chemotherapy and radiation therapy might be used.
If blockages in your bile ducts form, causing further pain and infection, a surgeon may insert a hollow metal tube into the duct to hold it open or surgically reroute the duct around the blockage.


Gallbladder pain caused by gallstones is usually remedied via nonsurgical removal of the stones or surgical removal of the gallbladder.You might go through a cholecystectomy, during which your gallbladder is surgically removed, if you have frequent or severe gallbladder attacks.
A stone breaking technique called ""lithotripsy"" might be used, instead, or drugs that are able to break up the stones can also be prescribed.



, If your pain is bad enough, a doctor may prescribe a stronger painkiller and an antibiotic to help stop infection from setting in or getting worse. Many of these prescription medications can be taken orally and at home, but in extremely severe cases, the doctor may give you painkillers through an IV. Depending on how serious your overall condition is, that doctor may also give you fluids and antibiotics intravenously, as well.


Intravenous painkillers include meperidine and ketorolac, but the latter should be avoided if the patient may need surgery. Morphine and other opioids are not recommended for use with gallbladder disease or pain.
Intravenous antibiotics will only be issued if the patient has a fever, elevated white blood cell count, or other signs of infection.

Stay hydrated.,
Drink some broth.,
Drink an oral rehydration solution.To help replace electrolytes (e.g.,
Choose a sports beverage.,
Sip a soda.,
Keep your liquids down.",How to Eat With a Stomach Virus1," It seems obvious, but having a stomach virus causes considerable fluid loss through not only vomiting and diarrhea, but also sweat. Sometimes keeping anything down without subsequent regurgitation is difficult; so, drinking water or chewing small ice chips, serves as a great fluid replacement., Hyponatremia — low sodium levels in the blood — is a potentially fatal condition, that can be caused by a loss of salt-rich body fluid. Salt and other electrolytes are lost via both vomit and diarrhea. The positive aspect of broth is that it not only provides a liquid, but it also provides sodium., sodium, potassium, magnesium), look for an oral rehydration solution. These often end with ""lyte,"" such as Pedialyte or Hydralyte. They are easily found at your local drugstore or grocery store and are appropriate for rehydrating children who are sick.

, Sports drinks contain electrolytes important for fighting dehydration. An added benefit to sports drinks is the ingredient sodium citrate, a form of sodium that is easily digested and also helps minimize qualmish stomachs.Calm your stomach, replace electrolytes, and fill fluids all in one shot.

, You may call it a coke or a pop, but drinking cold sodas — especially carbonated drinks with ginger ale or peppermint — can aid with uneasiness and nausea. If you're feeling a bit sluggish, opt for the regular soda instead of diet; you may need the sugar to boost energy., It is important to start slowly by rehydrating in small steps. Try drinking or sipping something small in specific increments, perhaps every 15–10 minutes. If symptoms dissipate, try drinking more frequently until you feel normal again.


Sipping, not gulping or drinking large amounts of fluid is recommended in the case of oral rehydration therapy. Drinking large quantities in one sitting can increase chances of vomiting and having to start rehydration process again.

Reduce stress.An important lifestyle modification for people with Crohn's disease is to reduce stress as much as possible.",How to Eat Out with Crohn's Disease," It pays to do your homework and choose a restaurant before you even leave your house. This ensures that you’ll know exactly what you’re getting into and what sort of environment and food options you’ll be presented with. Also, if you need any accommodations, choosing your restaurant beforehand will allow you to call and make appropriate arrangements.


If you’re going out with a group, suggest three restaurants that you think will work well with your Crohn’s disease and let the group pick which restaurant everyone will go to.
If you don’t have input about which restaurant you’re going to, make sure to call the restaurant beforehand and ask any pertinent questions that you might need answered.;
, If you’ve chosen a particular restaurant, look up the menu online beforehand. Reviewing the menu before you go will give you plenty of time to look through all of your options. If the menu isn’t online, don’t hesitate to call the restaurant and ask them to email you a copy., After you’ve looked over the menu, decide what you’d like to eat and also if you will need to request any modifications or substitutions.Contact the restaurant beforehand to confirm that they will make substitutions and modifications.
Also ask if there is any fee or increased charge for substitutions.

, Your server is your liaison between you and the kitchen staff and they want to make sure that you, their guest, have the best experience possible. Don’t be shy — communicate your needs to your server and explain that you have dietary restrictions because of a medical condition. People eat out all the time with food allergies and medical conditions, so don’t be embarrassed about speaking up.You can say, “I have an autoimmune disorder and I have to be as careful about what I eat as someone with severe food allergies. I’d like to make a few substitutions, if that’s no problem.”
Similarly, you can print a small card and hand it to your servers that contains whatever information you’d like them to know, including your specific triggers. This is a great option because they can also show it to the chef, if necessary.

, Travelling with Crohn’s may be a bit intimidating, but with flexibility and a little preparation, it doesn’t have to be. Even if your stay away from home is unexpected, flexibility and preparation are still essential. Fortunately, much of what you’re doing already is exactly what you’d need to do when travelling, whether your travels are local, domestic, or international. Ensure that you’re always prepared medically, have the right documentation, and have a few snacks on hand.Always carry at least one day’s worth of your Crohn’s medications with you in a secured container and pocket.
Make sure that you’re properly immunized, especially if you’re travelling internationally.
If you have health insurance, verify that your policy and documentation is in order at least once per renewal period.
Pack a snack bag full of safe, trigger-free, emergency foods that you can eat to tide you over. Consider keeping this and your medications together as a sort of emergency “go” bag.
If you find yourself in a position without your medications or food, find the nearest grocery store or restaurant that can accommodate your dietary needs.

, If you experience cramps and diarrhea, you will need to limit the fiber content of the meals. If you have steatorrhea (the presence of excess fat in the stool resulting in pale bulky stools that float), you'll want to look for dishes that are low in fat. In general, milk products should especially be avoided.


Vitamin and mineral deficiencies are common and must be corrected for proper healing. Folic acid is very important as well as extra vitamin B12. Getting enough vitamin D if you have steatorrhea is crucial. An oral supplement of 4,000 IU should be sufficient.

, Every cuisine has its healthy and less healthy options, its spicy and bland options, and its sweet and savory options. Learn about different cuisines — the spices, the cooking methods, the base ingredients — and figure out which foods are potential triggers for you. This will help you avoid surprises if you’re called to eat out somewhere that you haven’t had a chance to research, such as with a lunch meeting.For example, you know that you should avoid fried foods because that’s a trigger for you. You decide that you’d like to try Japanese food, which is delicious and great for people with Crohn’s. Stay away from tempura and enjoy sushi or sashimi instead. Japanese cuisine is also loaded with vegetables, rice, and rice noodles, making this a great option.
Or, suppose you’d like to try Greek cuisine. Greek cuisine is fairly Crohn’s-friendly, overall, boasting a wide variety of seafood, vegetables, and low-fat cooking techniques. Consider starting with a Greek salad, enjoying a sautéed or baked seafood entrée with a side of steamed vegetables, and make sure to ask for any sauces on the side.
Remember to avoid foods with artificial additives or preservatives, fried and greasy foods, margarine, meat, pepper, spicy foods, tobacco, white flour and all animal products with the exception of white fish from clear waters. Mucus-forming foods such as processed refined foods and dairy products should also be avoided. Limit your intake of barley, rye and wheat., Everyone’s triggers are different and only you will know exactly what your triggers are. Err on the side of caution, though and choose a plant-based or vegetarian meal. Meat can irritate your intestinal tract, sending you to the restroom for a painful visit.Make sure that the vegetables are cooked as raw vegetables can also upset your intestinal tract.
Good options include non-acidic vegetables such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, carrots, celery, garlic, kale, spinach and turnips.

, Carbonated and caffeinated beverages are likely to trigger your Crohn’s symptoms and are best avoided. Play it safe, since you’re eating out, and drink water. This is the only beverage guaranteed not to aggravate your condition.If someone offers you a beverage, politely decline with a simple, “Thank you! That’s kind of you, but I’m happy with my water tonight.”
If someone offers you an alcoholic drink, you can say, “Thanks, but I have to decline – I’m driving!” Nobody needs to know exactly why you’re drinking water.

, Every person is different and what triggers symptoms in one Crohn’s patient may not trigger symptoms in another. Unfortunately, the only way to know what your triggers are is through trial and error. You will quickly learn what foods and food groups are off limits. When you go out, you’ll know to skip over your trigger foods on the menu and focus on the foods that you can happily eat.Eating larger portions can trigger Crohn’s symptoms. Eating before you go out will help you manage your portion sizes since you won’t be as hungry and will also ensure that no trigger foods sneak into your meal.The key is small portion sizes. Try to avoid eating full meals at any point; instead, eat two snack portions.

, Choose dining companions that will take your Crohn’s triggers and symptoms as seriously as they should. Your companions should be excited to try new restaurants that you’ve researched and found to be Crohn’s-friendly. They should also never try to get you to eat something that would make you ill.Your friends may just need to be educated a little more about what Crohn’s is and isn’t, the symptoms, and your triggers.
You can get into as much or little detail with your friends about what Crohn’s disease is and how it specifically impacts your body. You can say, “I have an autoimmune disorder called Crohn’s disease, which means my body is actually attacking its own GI tract. The symptoms can range from mild to very serious, depending on the progression of my chronic disease. Because of that, I have to be very careful about what I eat, just like someone who has a strong food allergy. This doesn’t mean I cannot go out and have a great time, but it does mean that I will need to be a bit more careful about where I eat and what I order. I’d love to tell you more about it sometime.”

, Instead of going out, offer to host meals at your home now and then. If you host the meal, you can plan a menu that everyone will love that will also meet all of your dietary needs. Additionally, a meal hosted at home offers a more casual, inviting, and relaxed environment and you can make the evening last as long as you’d like rather than eat and leave, as you would in a restaurant., Some symptoms of Crohn’s are immediate and more short-lived, whereas others develop and persist over periods of time. You’ll need to ask your doctor how to address both types of symptoms. If you’re out and experience Crohn’s symptoms, treat them as you normally would. And, if you’re able to return to the table, do so. If you’re not, send a message to one of your dining companions that discreetly explains you’re not feeling well and need to get home.You might experience diarrhea or abdominal pain and cramping, which are common for people with Crohn’s. Ask your doctor which medications will work best for you and make sure to have some on hand at all times.
You may develop a low-grade fever or find blood in your stool. Again, treat those as your doctor has advised.

, Emerging research suggests that our thoughts, nervous system, and bodily functions are deeply interconnected. Doing your research on restaurants ahead of time can help reduce any stress or anxiety you may feel about eating out.


If you find yourself becoming stressed out or overwhelmed, deep breathing is an effective way to deal with it in the moment. Take deep, slow breaths, making sure your belly and not your chest rises with each inhalation. Exhale slowly and repeat until you begin to feel calm.

Explain the scope of the problem.,
Explain why Crohn’s disease occurs.,
Explain the symptoms of Crohn’s disease.,
Explain potential complications.,
Teach others about treatments.",How to Explain Crohn's Disease to Others1," Put Crohn’s disease in perspective for your audience by sharing information about how many people suffer from Crohn’s. You might tell your audience, for instance, that in the U.K. alone there are over 115,000 people living with Crohn’s disease.In the U.S., some 780,000 people have Crohn’s. The disease affects as many men as it does women.To explain the scope, you could say, “In the U.K. alone there are over 115,000 people living with Crohn’s disease. More than three-quarters of a million people in the U.S. also have Crohn’s.”
There are no reliable numbers describing how many people around the world have Crohn’s but it is known that five million people worldwide have either Crohn’s or ulcerative colitis, both of which have similar symptoms and are classified medically as inflammatory bowel diseases.Explaining the scope of the problem is a good way to grab people’s attention and demonstrate that Crohn’s disease is a serious issue.;
, The exact causes of Crohn’s disease remain unknown, but medical scientists believe that it occurs due to a combination of factors. Some of the factors believed to contribute to Crohn’s disease that you might mention to interested parties include:Genetics - You should explain that if your parents or ancestors had Crohn’s disease, you’re at greater risk of developing it yourself. For instance, you might say, “Genetic factors – such as having a parent or ancestor with Crohn’s disease – puts you at greater risk of developing it yourself.”
The immune system – You can explain that the immune system sometimes gets confused and attack healthy bacteria in the gut, which leads to Crohn’s disease. For instance, you might explain, “Your immune system could get confused and attack healthy bacteria in the gut, causing Crohn’s disease.”
Previous infections – Remind your listeners that if they’ve had a previous infection, they may end up with Crohn’s disease. For instance, you might explain, “Prior infections could increase your risk of getting Crohn’s.”
Environmental factors – Share with your listeners that Crohn’s disease is more common in Western nations. For instance, you might explain, “If you live in a Western nation, you’re at a higher risk of developing Crohn’s disease.”
Smoking – Remind your listeners that Crohn’s disease is more severe in smokers than in nonsmokers. For instance, you might explain, “Smokers more commonly experience severe symptoms of Crohn’s disease.”

, Crohn’s disease has a suite of symptoms. Explain that most symptoms occur in the last section of the small intestine, or in the large intestine. Go on to explain that while Crohn’s disease is a lifelong condition without a cure, symptoms may go into remission for periods of time during which there are no symptoms.For instance, you might explain, “Common symptoms of Crohn’s include fatigue, weight loss, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and blood and/or mucus in your feces.”

, Crohn’s disease, your audience will be interested to know, could damage certain portions of the intestine. For instance, the intestine may be narrowed in width (known as stricture). Additionally, share with others that Crohn’s patients might develop a channel between the end of the bowel and the anus or vagina. This condition is known as a fistula and will require surgery to correct it.For instance, you might explain, “Crohn’s disease might lead to serious medical complications. Your intestine might actually be narrowed in width, which could lead to a life threatening bowel perforation.You could also develop a fistula, a channel between the end of the bowel and the anus or vagina which could become infected.”, Say, “Treatments focus on symptom management, since there is no cure for Crohn’s yet.” You could explain that anti-inflammatories are often the first line of defense against Crohn’s because they are good at reducing symptoms. Other treatments include corticosteroids, which are prescribed more sparingly since they have many unpleasant side effects and immunosuppressants, a class of drugs that suppresses immune system responses.Explain that in severe cases, Crohn’s patients might have surgery to remove inflamed portions of their bowels. For instance, you could explain, “Surgery could be required to remove inflamed portions of your gut.”

Be prepared with emergency medications if needed.",How to Eat when You Have EGID," EGID is a complicated disorder that varies greatly from person to person. If you've been diagnosed with EGID, it's important to stay in touch with your doctor regularly and follow up with a registered dietitian specializing in food allergies.


If you have EGID and need assistance figuring out what to eat and how eat, talk to your doctor. They will be able to give you a variety of resources to help you cope with this disorder.
Most physicians who treat EGID, will have a dietitian on staff or refer to a dietitian specializing in food allergies. Follow up with this dietitian on a regular basis to help you find appropriate foods for you.
There may be additional complications associated with EGID that you'll need to consider when trying to determine what to eat. For instance, you may have difficulty swallowing and/or suffer from eosinophilia gastritis (difficulty with absorption that causes diarrhea, nausea, vomiting). You will need to work with your doctor and dietitian to work around these complications. In severe cases, tube feeding may be required, which is a way to ensure food can get into your body if you are unable to eat or unable to eat enough.Ask your dietitian about your diet and how you can make sure that you are eating a balanced diet, including the right combination of foods to provide your body with the nutrients it needs to thrive.
If you've just been recently diagnosed, ask your dietitian to give you recipes and a meal plan to follow until you get the hang of doing this yourself.;
, If you've been diagnosed with EGID, you may have had to keep a food diary or food journal to help your physician figure out what foods cause a reaction. Continuing with a food journal can be helpful even after your diagnosis.To keep a food journal consider either downloading a food journal app on your smart phone, or just keep a paper and pencil version.
Your journal needs to be detailed — especially if you're still having occasional symptoms. The more detailed you are, the more helpful your doctor and dietitian can be at pinpointing additional trigger foods.
You need to write down everything you eat. Each breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack. You also need to note what types of beverages you drink (outside of plain water).
If you remember, write down the brands of foods you eat, restaurants you went to and what the serving size is of your foods.
Your journal should also contain a list of your trigger foods. This will be handy to refer to as you continue to adapt to your diagnosis.

, After being diagnosed with EGID, you might find it intimidating to go grocery shopping, prepare meals and eat those meals. This is especially true if you have a variety of trigger foods. Creating a meal plan can give you a safe blueprint of what you'll be eating.


Whenever you have some free time during the week, plan to take an hour or so to write up your meal plan. The first time you do this, it might take a little longer; however, the more you practice and become familiar with foods and recipes you can eat safely, the easier and quicker this will be.
To start your meal plan, tackle one week at a time. Write out every breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack and beverage you will have during the week.
When you're writing up your meal plan, review each day to make sure that throughout the day, you're eating a variety foods and food groups that are safe. For example, are you eating two to three servings of vegetables, a serving of fruit, and getting in enough protein? Use this time to make sure that your diet is nutritious and balanced.

, After you've come up with your meal plan or decided what recipes you want to try for the week, it's time to write up your grocery list and go shopping.


When you're at the store, plan to spend some extra time reviewing a variety of foods and the food labels. Like meal planning, the more often you do this, the better you'll get.
Unless it's a ""whole food"" (that's unprocessed and doesn't contain other ingredients — like an apple or broccoli), you'll need to read the label carefully.
You'll need to spend the most time reviewing the ingredient label. Look for any foods or ingredients that are or could be trigger foods. Avoid any foods you are unsure of or that contain a trigger food.Educate yourself on any alternate names for your trigger foods. For example, there at least 60 different names for sugar you might find on an ingredient list, including molasses, dextrose, and high-fructose corn syrup.

, If you have been diagnosed with EGID, you know that it can be difficult to find different recipes and meal ideas that are safe for you. Consider getting some help by purchasing extra resources or looking online at websites specifically for those with EGID, such as http://www.ausee.org/.


Some people with EGID have a large amount of foods they cannot eat. This can make eating and preparing foods difficult. Purchase or find free resources that can give you more ideas on recipes that are safe.
Start by asking your doctor or dietitian for resources from their office. Many practices have their own recipes and cooking materials for their patients.
Also consider purchasing speciality cookbooks that will fit your specific allergies. You can even find free recipes online from blogs or food allergy websites.

, One specific tip that can help you feel more confident when eating and preparing foods is by using whole, unprocessed foods.Whole foods are those that are minimally processed. If you have EGID, try to use as many foods and ingredients that are as minimally processed as possible. The fewer additives or ingredients in your foods, the less likely it is that you'll miss an ingredient that could cause a reaction.
Try to stick to foods like: raw fruits and vegetables, plain dairy products, eggs, raw or frozen poultry, beef and seafood and dry, plain grains.
Even be careful when choosing minimally processed foods. For example, pre-grilled chicken strips or tossed salads at a salad bar can have ingredients you're allergic to. Always read the food label even on these foods.
Also, consider making foods from scratch as often as you can. For example, instead of purchasing whole wheat bread, consider baking your own loaf at home. Or instead of store-bought hummus, whip up a batch of your own.

, One way that EGID can make eating and staying healthy difficult is that you might be overly restricting your diet and missing out on a variety of essential nutrients.


One of the side effects that can happen when you have EGID is malabsorption and nutrient deficiencies. This could be because your GI system is inflamed or your diet is so restricted you're not even consuming adequate nutrients.
If there are entire food groups you need to avoid or cannot have groups of foods that provide a specific nutrient, you'll need to replace those nutrients from alternate, safe foods.
For example, if dairy causes symptoms, you'll need to find alternate sources of calcium and vitamin D. Or if chicken, turkey and eggs cause a reaction, you'll need to make sure you eat alternate sources of protein in your diet.
Speaking your doctor and dietitian can help you eat a diet that's well balanced and nutrient dense. In addition, there are many online resources that can help you pinpoint what specific nutrients you need to replace or get from other safe foods.

, Everyone with EGID not only has different trigger foods, but different levels of reactions as well. If you have severe reactions, you'll need to make sure you prevent cross-contact of foods at home.


Cross-contact is when particles of a food allergen come into contact with normally safe foods. It could be very small and even microscopic amounts of an allergen that could cause a reaction in a normally safe food.Cooking foods does not prevent or reduce the chances of having a reaction if a food has been contaminated with an allergen. You'll need to come up with a system to prevent cross-contact.
If you can, do not purchase or bring trigger foods into the house to begin with. If that's not possible, consider purchasing separate utensils, plates, cutting boards and other cooking tools to be used only for you.
If you are unsure if something has come into contact with a food allergen, it will need to be cleaned with very hot, soapy water or run through the dishwasher in order to be safe.

, When you have EGID you may notice that you have difficulty swallowing when you're in a flare up or have eaten a trigger food. Changing the texture and temperature of foods can make eating easier and less irritating.


Difficulty swallowing and reflux-like symptoms are very common in those suffering with EGID. Certain textures of foods and certain temperatures can make eating more difficult and more uncomfortable.If you notice that harder, crunchy foods or foods that are dense are too hard to eat, consider preparing foods that are more moist, soft and tender. You can make something in the crockpot, make a stew, or overcook foods to make them soft.
For example, if grilled chicken is irritating, consider braising chicken thighs in the oven. Or if raw broccoli is irritating, steam it until it's falling apart and mushy.
The same thing goes with temperature. Hot foods may be irritating or cold foods may be irritating. Eat foods at a temperature that is most tolerable to you.

, If you have EGID, it can be difficult, frustrating and even scary to go out to eat or eat food away from home; however, just because you have EGID, doesn't mean you can't enjoy the occasional meal away from home.


If you don't want to rely solely on food provided by a restaurant or other people, consider having a small meal or snack before you go out.This can help curb your hunger and appetite. That way you can enjoy something small without feeling like you're starving or depriving yourself.
Eating a small snack beforehand can also help you stick to a balanced diet. You can get in some key nutrients at home so you're not relying on restaurant foods or friend's foods to give you everything you need.

, One of the most important steps to take before eating out is to look at the menu online before you go. This can help you plan appropriately.Find out what restaurant you're planning on going to. This will allow you to do a little research before you go and increase your confidence.
Most restaurants will have menus listed online; however, not all restaurants will provide ingredient or nutrition information on all of their meals.
Note that chain restaurants in particular will always have menu and nutrition information listed online, as they are legally required to do so.

, If there is any question about a certain food or meal, give the restaurant a call. Speaking to the manager or chef can help you feel more comfortable eating at a restaurant.


If the menu information online isn't clear or doesn't provide you with adequate ingredient information, call the restaurant.
It's best to ask to speak to a manager or chef. Hostesses and the wait staff may not be fully educated on dealing with patrons who have food allergies.
Avoid consuming foods that you're not 100% sure are safe for you at any restaurant. This could cause a serious reaction.

, If you have an overly restricted diet or just feel too unsafe eating foods outside of the home, consider bringing your own, homemade ""safe"" foods with you.


If you're going to a restaurant, bring a small meal with you. Make sure to bring something that doesn't need to be kept refrigerated or need to be reheated.
If you're going to a friend's or family's house, bring a safe dish with you. You can let the host know you will be doing this for health reasons and not to be offended.
If you feel uncomfortable bringing foods with you to a restaurant, call ahead to see if its ok. Mention that you have special needs and that you'd still like to enjoy the social time of being out.
Consider asking your GI doctor or allergist for a note that you can keep you in your wallet or purse to present to restaurant managers when you're making requests or eating foods from home.

, Even if you're 100% confident in your food and meal choice, it's essential that you always bring your emergency medications with you.


If your doctor has prescribed you some emergency medications — like an EpiPen — make sure to keep these with you at all times.
You should have multiple sets of emergency medications. Keep one set at home, one set at work or school and one ""travel"" set to keep with you when you go out.
Also make sure the people with you know where your emergency medications are and how to use them if you need assistance.

Speak to your doctor about medication for an IBD flare.",How to Eat After an IBD Flare," “Residue” refers to undigested food, like fiber, that makes up stool. Eating a low-residue diet will lead to fewer and smaller bowel movements. This helps ease stomach cramping, bloating, gas, and diarrhea. A low-residue diet limits high-fiber foods, like whole-grain breads and cereals, nuts, seeds, raw or dried fruits, and vegetables., Ease your stomach into food after an IBD flare by having liquids like water and diluted juices before you have any solid foods. You can also have soft solid foods like applesauce, oatmeal, cooked eggs, mashed potatoes, noodles, and rice. These foods are easy on your stomach.Other soft solid foods like canned fruit and plain bread are also good options.

, Go for plain chicken, turkey, or fish that is steamed or baked. Eating protein can be a good way for your body to recover after an IBD flare.Choose sauces such as margarine or butter, mayonnaise, ketchup, sour cream, soy sauce, clear jelly, honey, or syrup, and smooth salad dressing., Fruits and vegetables are high in fiber. It can be difficult for your body to digest fiber if you have IBD, especially after a flare. Avoid eating raw vegetables and any fruit or veggie with seeds. Limit your intake of fruits and veggies, and stop eating them if your symptoms worsen.Choose veggies like asparagus, beets, carrots, and green beans and fruit such as ripe bananas, cantaloupe, honeydew, or pears., Omega-3 fatty acids are anti-inflammatory and can help your body recover after an IBD flare. Go for foods high in omega-3 fatty acids, like salmon, mackerel, sardines, and herring., Dairy can aggravate the symptoms of IBD and make it harder for your stomach to recover from a flare. Avoid dairy products like milk, yogurt, cheese, and ice cream.If you do want to have dairy products, only do so after you have had liquids and soft solid foods. This way, your stomach has time to recover from the flare up and can digest the dairy properly.

, Candy, cake, cookies, and other sweets high in sugar can make your IBD symptoms worse. Skip the sugary treats as your body recovers from the IBD flare.You should also avoid salty snacks like nuts, popcorn, and chips. The sodium content in these foods can irritate your stomach more.

, Eating smaller portions throughout the day will make it easier for your body to digest your meals and recover after the IBD flare. Allow one to two hours between each small meal. Make a meal plan where you have five to six small meals, with snacks.Follow a regular eating schedule where you eat five to six meals at the same time every day. For example, you may start the day with a glass of diluted juice and applesauce. Then, you may eat cooked eggs and soft bread after one to two hours, followed by a mid day meal of cooked chicken and noodles.

, Dehydration is common after an IBD flare. Make sure you drink lots of water throughout the day. Have at least five to eight glasses of water per day. Carry a water bottle with you so you can sip from it.Avoid sugary drinks, caffeine, and alcohol as you recover from the IBD flare. These drinks will only dehydrate you more and also cause irritation in the digestive tract.

, Write down your meals for the day as you recover from the IBD flare. Notice if any foods trigger your symptoms or make you feel worse. Take these foods out of your diet so you can recover. Keep track of what you eat and try to follow the same diet.Do not eliminate entire food groups from your diet without consulting with your doctor. If you notice a food group is making you sicker based on the notes in your food journal, talk to your doctor.

, If you are unsure of what to eat after you have an IBD flare, speak to your doctor. If you have a care team that works with you to maintain your condition, speak to them about what to eat after a flare. They should be able to suggest foods you can try.Your doctor may also be able to work with you to create a meal plan of foods that will help you recover after an IBD flare.

, You are at risk for malnutrition when you have IBD. Be sure to discuss your nutritional needs with your doctor or nutritionist.If you have a hard time tolerating food after an IBD flare, ask your doctor about taking nutritional supplements.Your doctor may suggest liquid oral supplements you can take to help you maintain a healthy diet as you recover from the IBD flare.
Common liquid supplements prescribed for IBD include Peptamen, Modulen IBD, and Lipisorb.

, For severe flares of IBD, your doctor can prescribe medication to help with discomfort and pain. Medications like corticosteroids, cholestyramine, and 5-ASA compounds can help address the issue.Your doctor should outline the side effects of these medications, which include a decreased absorption of vitamins and minerals.
Your doctor may recommend taking nutritional supplements along with these medications.

, Press the zhongwan point for no more than two minutes. Use gentle downward pressure to a depth of less than one inch.


Do not eat before pressing the zhongwan point.
CV12 is also useful for treating other digestive problems, heartburn, and stress. When combined with breathing exercises, it can help treat depression, too., Simply squeezing the flesh of this area gently for about one minute while taking slow, deep breaths.


In translation, hegu means Joining Valley.
In addition to constipation, pressure on LI4 might relieve toothaches, strengthen the immune system, and reduce the severity of allergies.
Massaging the hegu point is not recommended for pregnant women.

, To find it, extend your arm in front of you with your palm up. With your opposite hand, lay your index finger across the crook of your elbow. The tip of your index finger should naturally lie on LI11. Push the point inward gently for about one minute while breathing deeply.


This point is also known as the crooked pond.
Massaging LI11 can help stiff joints in the arm, including elbow pain, and may regulate body temperature.

, Perineal massage is a specific type of acupressure that involves massaging the perineum (the area between the anus and genitals).Use repeated gentle, circular motions on the perineum. These motions should help you break up, pass, or soften your constipated stool."

Nibble on a starch.,
Bite a banana.,
Enjoy some yogurt.,
Eat delicately.",How to Eat With a Stomach Virus2," Since a bunch of food could re-aggravate an upset stomach, it's best to try simple foods that are easy to digest. A settling could be accomplished with some toast, potatoes, oats or rice. Added bonus: they do not activate acid reflux., While the BRAT (Bananas, Rice, Applesauce and Toast) diet is no longer the primary recommendationfor those with gastroenteritis, there are still three great banana benefits. First, the potassium they possess help fight dehydration. Second, sugars provide a surge of energy if you are feeling lethargic. Finally, they are easy to keep down and do not exacerbate nausea., While the BRAT diet has been de-emphasised, some have modified acronym to include ""Y"" at the end (i.e. BRATY). Not only does yogurt have active bacteria cultures that reduce diarrhea, but it also shortens the toilet time. Be sure to choose a yogurt without large amounts of sugar, which may upset your stomach somewhat.Yogurt cultures have probiotics which help replenish natural flora in gut to help normalize the balance between normal flora to help gut function more efficiently.

, After vomiting subsides for about 24 hours, it's best to eat bland, soft, easy-to-digest foods without red food coloring — to avoid mistaking the color for blood — in smaller bites for roughly three days. The gastrointestinal tract needs to settle, so do whatever is necessary to keep liquids and/or food down, even if that means washing down some food with your primarily liquid diet."

Push a pressure point.,
Talk to your doctor about appropriate medications.,
Take a nap.",How to Eat With a Stomach Virus3," Acupressure has been shown to help with nausea, and that may allow you to eat something. In addition, acupressure fights inflammation, which could be a supplementary issue to the stomach virus., A step towards eating is getting better. Some over-the-counter medications like bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol) and loperamide hydrochloride (Imodium) may help with nausea, but there are a variety of prescription medications that could help.Be aware that a stomach virus is not treatable with antibiotics (antibiotics work only for bacterial infections), so you will either need an antiviral like Theraflu, or to treat the symptoms of your virus while your body fights it off.

, It may seem like common sense, but one of the best things to help with any illness is rest. Getting adequate recovery time may get you over the hump just enough to start keeping down foods and liquids.

Know your audience.,
Avoid pronouns.,
Admit when you don’t know something.,
Work to avoid confusion.,
Invite questions.",How to Explain Crohn's Disease to Others2," If you explain Crohn’s disease to a room full of sixth-graders, you should use clear and simple language. If you explain Crohn’s disease to a room full of medical students, your explanation can be much more complex and detailed. Before explaining Crohn’s disease, identify your audience and determine the best way to reach them.For instance, you could explain Crohn’s to a room full of third-graders by asking, “Have you ever had a stomach ache? Can you imagine what it’s like to have 100 stomach aches at one time? That’s what it feels like to have Crohn’s disease.”
If you’re explaining Crohn’s to a room full of medical students, you might say, “Crohn’s disease is one of several inflammatory bowel diseases that affect the gastrointestinal tract.”
Generally, you should present ideas as simply as possible., When speaking about Crohn’s disease, use proper terms as much as possible. For instance, when talking about symptoms of the disease, avoid saying things like, “It causes diarrhea and abdominal pain.” Instead, say, “Crohn’s disease causes diarrhea and abdominal pain.” Otherwise, there’s a chance that the meaning of “it” will become lost or muddled., Your listeners may have additional questions about Crohn’s disease that you do not know the answer to. In this case, you should simply admit as much and offer to find the answer for the person. For instance, you might say, “Great question, but I don’t know the answer. Why don’t I get your email address and I can email you later with an answer to your questions?”, If there are certain terms or things that you anticipate might cause confusion for your audience, go an extra mile to describe and differentiate them as soon as you introduce them. For instance, if you anticipate that your listeners will confuse immunosuppressants and corticosteroids since both suppress the immune system, spend extra time during your explanation on how the two classes of drugs differ.In such a case, you might explain, “Immunosuppressants and corticosteroids both suppress the immune system, but corticosteroids have an added benefit of reducing inflammation.”

, Before beginning your explanation, say, “If you have any questions, please raise your hand and I will do my best to answer.” If you are speaking to only a single person or a small group, ask “Does that make sense?” or “Do you have any questions?” when you’ve concluded your explanation.Try to be direct and succinct when answering questions. Avoid jargon and technical details, unless it is appropriate relative to your audience. For instance, avoid saying, “I will now describe the pathophysiology of Crohn’s disease” unless speaking to a learned audience of medical professionals. Instead, explain, “These are the symptoms of Crohn’s disease.”

"
"
Deliver a presentation.,
Introduce firsthand testimony.,
Show a documentary.,
Offer books and literature.,
Use a board.,
Use diagrams.",How to Explain Crohn's Disease to Others3," A presentation is the most common way to explain a complex subject like Crohn’s to a medium or large-sized group. You might deliver a presentation about Crohn’s to a class as a teacher or student, to a medical conference, or to a public audience. You could include video clips or images in your presentation if you have access to a digital projector. Programs like PowerPoint are tremendously useful for incorporating textual and visual information into your presentation.Do not mumble or rush through your presentation. Speak in a steady conversational tone.
If you tend to get nervous when explaining things to a large audience, take some deep breaths before beginning. Close your eyes and breathe in through your nose for three seconds, then out through your mouth for five seconds. Repeat three to five times, or until you feel relaxed.
Prepare notes to help guide you through your presentation. If you have a poor memory, just type your presentation, then read it to your audience directly. In either case, look out at your audience for most of the presentation, rather than down at your notes or papers.
Smile at your audience.
Keep your body language alert yet relaxed., If, as part of your explanation, you can introduce a Crohn’s disease patient to your audience, your explanation will be significantly enhanced. This will enable your audience to put a human face on the disease, and allow them to hear a firsthand account about what it’s like to live with Crohn’s disease from day to day. Leave time at the end of your explanation to allow listeners to ask questions of your guest with Crohn’s disease.Before introducing your guest speaker, you could explain, ""This guest speaker is here to tell you more about what it's actually like to live with Crohn's. Please give them a warm round of applause.""

, One great way to explain Crohn’s to others (or to assist you in your explanation) is to show a documentary film. There are many documentaries about Crohn’s available online, and you may be able to find additional films at your local public library.For example, the documentary “Crohn’s End,” directed by Reid Kimball can help others hear what it’s like to live with the illness day-to-day and get ideas about how to receive treatment if they themselves suffer from Crohn’s.
You could explain to others, ""These films will give you an inside look at how Crohn's disease works and affects people.""

, Some people will be able to best understand Crohn’s disease by reading text. One way to explain Crohn’s disease to others is to provide them with books, articles, or pamphlets about Crohn’s disease. Reading these books, articles, and pamphlets will give them a better understanding of how the disease works.For instance, you could offer them a pamphlet like “Living With Crohn’s Disease,” published by the Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation of America You could download and print or email this and similar pamphlets directly from the foundation’s website.
You could also point them toward an article like Liam Lonergan’s 2015 piece “What It's Actually Like to Live with Crohn's Disease,” available online.
You might offer them a book like “The Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis Fact Book.” This and similar books may be available through your public library.
When offering literature to others to explain Crohn's disease, you might say, ""This literature can offer an in-depth look at Crohn's disease. Look it over for more information.""

, If you have a marker board, take advantage of it by writing key words and phrases on it, along with simple definitions if necessary. For instance, you might be able to write a heading like “Symptoms” on the board, then underline it. Beneath the heading, list the symptoms of Crohn’s.Make your words large and bold on the board. If you are in a large space, ensure that people in the back row can read your handwriting.
When you fill up the board with vocabulary or interesting facts that help people understand Crohn’s disease, erase the portion of the board that you wrote first to allow you to use more space.
Don’t write everything you say on the board. Instead, use the board to list important vocabulary and key points.
Stop talking when writing on the board. Otherwise, it will be harder for people to hear you.
People who learn best or primarily via textual inputs will benefit from your use of a board.

, When explaining the location of the large intestine, small intestine, and other body parts, it helps to have a visual. A diagram of the intestines will prove useful when explaining Crohn’s disease to others.You can get diagrams from medical supply stores or online.
If you’re incorporating a diagram into a digital slideshow, you can easily obtain an appropriate image online.
People who learn best or primarily from visual means will be well-served by your use of diagrams to explain Crohn’s.

Prepare to fast.,
Break your fast gradually.,
Return to your normal diet the second day after your fast, but avoid meat and dairy products for a few days.

,
Take a probiotic to restore the balance of bacteria in your colon.

",How to Do an Organic Colon Cleanse," Abstaining from food for a short period of time will speed the process of releasing fat-stored chemicals, drugs and other toxins from your body. A 2 day fast is sufficient.

Prepare for your fast by eating nothing but fresh, organic fruits and vegetables for 2 days. Avoid all dairy products; they produce excess mucous in the colon. During these 2 days before your fast, take 1 capsule of fiber (ground flaxseeds or psyllium seeds) 4 times daily. Fiber will help form bulk and sweep the colon through the large intestine. Do not take a fiber supplement during the 2 days of your fast.



 


Consume at least 8 glasses of water on each day of the fast.






Drink a variety of fresh, organic vegetable and fruit juices each day. Add the juice from 1 organic lemon to a glass of warm water and drink it as soon as you awaken. Throughout the day, drink fresh organic juices such as apple, beet, cabbage, carrot and celery. Cabbage juice is particularly good for colon problems.






Drink 2 cups of herbal tea each day. Pau d’arco and slippery elm are both beneficial in cleansing the colon.





;
, On the morning of the third day, eat very small amounts of organic watermelon, banana or natural, unsweetened applesauce. Continue to eat small amounts of these foods throughout the day.

Take notice of chronic diarrhea.,
Be alert to an increased urgency to defecate.,
Be aware of abdominal pain and cramping.,
Watch for progressive weight loss.,
Look out for chronic fatigue and tiredness.,
Be cautious of less common, albeit widespread symptoms.,
Distinguish between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.,
Don't confuse ulcerative colitis with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).,
Don't mistake ulcerative colitis with lactose intolerance.,
Learn the difference between ulcerative colitis and intestinal infections.,
Know when ulcerative colitis may put you at greater risk of colon cancer.,
See a gastroenterologist.,
Get a colonoscopy.,
Have other visual diagnostics taken.",How to Distinguish Ulcerative Colitis from Similar Conditions," One of the hallmark signs of ulcerative colitis is chronic diarrhea or having loose stools (poops) on a daily basis.The diarrhea often has pus and blood in it because of the formation of ulcers in the large intestine (colon).


Between bouts of diarrhea, some bright red blood may also leak from your anus if ulcers are in the rectum, which is the end (distal part) of the large intestine.
Ulcerative colitis symptoms vary quite a bit among sufferers, from mild to severe, depending on the degree of inflammation and where the ulcers form.;
, In addition to diarrhea, ulcerative colitis causes an increased urgency to defecate (poop), so sufferers often feel they can't get too far from a bathroom.The ulcers in the lining of the large intestine affect the ability of the rectum to contract and keep the stool in place longer so water can be absorbed from it.


As such, diarrhea with ulcerative colitis is loose and watery — dehydration can be a problem in people with severe symptoms. They may require intravenous (IV) fluids from time to time.
Ulcerative colitis is classified by how much of the large intestine is affected: when the ulcers are limited to the rectum the symptoms tend to be mild; when more of the colon is affected the symptoms tend to be more severe., Another common symptom of ulcerative colitis is lower abdominal pain and cramping, primarily caused by the ulcers, but also from poor digestion and a disruption in the ""good bacteria"" in the colon from so much diarrhea.Lower abdominal bloating (distension) and flatulence are also relatively common, depending on a person's diet.


Avoid spicy foods, high-fiber foods and dairy products because they tend to acerbate the abdominal pain and cramping of ulcerative colitis.
People who develop ulcerative colitis at a young age (adolescence) are much more likely to have severe symptoms.

, People with ulcerative colitis, even milder forms, tend to lose weight unintentionally because of a few different factors: chronic diarrhea, fear of eating and triggering symptoms, and malabsorption of nutrients from their dysfunctional colon.Consequently, weight loss is progressive, especially in adolescents and younger adults, and sometimes to the extent of being dangerous.


As the body goes into ""starvation mode"" it initially uses fat stores for energy, then it breaks down muscle and connective tissue into amino acids for energy.
Ask your doctor about vitamin and mineral supplements, as well as high-calorie foods that don't trigger ulcerative colitis symptoms.
Eating small meals (five to six daily) tends to promote better digestion instead of two to three larger ones.

, Due to chronic diarrhea, loss of appetite, weight loss and a lack of essential nutrients, a lack of energy (fatigue) and tiredness during the day are also common signs of ulcerative colitis.This chronic fatigue and tiredness is not helped by getting lots of sleep at night or taking naps during the day. Muscle weakness may also be seen.


Another factor in the chronic fatigue is anemia — a lack of iron due to blood loss from the ulcers. Iron is needed in the blood (by hemoglobin) to carry oxygen to all the cells in order to make energy.
Among younger children, ulcerative colitis may delay growth and development due to a lack of energy and nutrients.

, Less common symptoms of ulcerative colitis include widespread joint pain or soreness (especially in larger joints), red skin rashes around the body, eye irritation and a chronic low-grade fever.When these symptoms are present it's thought that the ulcerative colitis is caused more by an overactive or faulty immune system.


When a condition is caused by an overactive or faulty immune reaction it's called an autoimmune disease. In essence the body attacks itself and creates lots of inflammation.
It's not unusual for middle-aged adults with a long history of ulcerative colitis to develop inflammatory arthritis in joints, such as the knees, hands and spine.

, Although both are inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn’s can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract (both small and large intestines).Ulcerative colitis is limited to the mucosa and submucosa, the first two layers of the lining of the bowel. Crohn's disease, in addition to the first two layers also involves the next two, the muscular and the connective tissue layers underneath.


Crohn's disease tends to be more serious and symptomatic than ulcerative colitis because its ulcers are deeper and more destructive. Malabsorption of nutrients is more common with Crohn's.
Crohn's most often develops where the small intestine meets the colon (ileocecal region), so symptoms (pain and cramping) are usually felt higher in the abdomen nearer the stomach.
Crohn's also causes bloody diarrhea, although the blood is often darker in color because the ulcers are usually further away from the anus.
Differentiating features include different areas of the colon involved, significant involvement of the small intestine, and granulomas on biopsy. Diarrhea and abdominal pain (especially in the right lower quadrant) are hallmark symptoms.

, Irritable bowel syndrome is not an inflammatory disease that leads to ulceration in the intestines. Instead, it's a disorder that affects the muscle contractions of the large intestine — the contractions are more frequent and rapid, sort of like internal twitches.As such, diarrhea, an increased urge to defecate and lower abdominal cramping is common with IBS also, but there's no blood or pus in the stool.


Diagnosis of IBS is often made by the following criteria: Abdominal discomfort or pain that can be relieved with defecation, associated with change in frequency of stooling, and/or a change in consistency of stool present for at least 12 weeks.IBS tends to be less painful because there's no ulcers in the intestinal layers. The cramping pain from IBS is often relieved by a bout of diarrhea.
IBS tends to be triggered by food and stress mostly, and doesn't have an important genetic component like ulcerative colitis does.
IBS is far more common in women, whereas inflammatory bowel diseases don't show a gender preference.

, People with lactose intolerance are unable to properly digest milk sugar (lactose) due to a lack of lactase enzyme.The lactose is then fed upon by intestinal bacteria, which triggers gas production, bloating and diarrhea. The symptoms of lactose intolerance usually begin 30 minutes to two hours after eating or drinking dairy products.


In contrast, ulcerative colitis develops slowly over time and becomes chronic in most sufferers. It can go into remission, but doesn't go away by avoiding certain foods.
The diarrhea with lactose intolerance tends to be more explosive because of the gas production, but doesn't contain blood or pus.
Some nausea is common with lactose intolerance, but fatigue, tiredness and weight loss is not typically experienced.

, Intestinal infections (either from viruses or bacteria) come on quickly and tend to trigger abdominal pain, cramping and diarrhea, but they don't often last more than a week or so. Most bacterial infections are caused by food poisoning (Salmonella, E. coli and other species) and also involve forceful vomiting and high fevers, which are not characteristic of ulcerative colitis.Depending on the species, intestinal infections can lead to blood in the diarrhea if the mucosal lining gets severely irritated, but it doesn't last for much more than a week or so.
Intestinal infections can happen anywhere in the intestines or stomach, whereas ulcerative colitis is limited to the large intestine.
Most stomach ulcers are caused by a species of bacteria called H. pylori, which leads to upper abdominal pain, nausea and bleeding. There's no diarrhea and the blood in the feces looks more like coffee grounds.

, The symptoms of severe ulcerative colitis and colon cancer are very difficult to distinguish from one another. Both involve lots of pain, bloody diarrhea, fever, weight loss and fatigue; however, ulcerative colitis is more likely to develop into colon cancer when: the entire colon is affected, widespread chronic inflammation is present, and the condition has been active for at least eight years or more.Men with severe ulcerative colitis are more at risk than women, particularly if they have primary sclerosing cholangitis — a condition that affects the liver.
People with severe ulcerative colitis should get a colonoscopy exam every one to three years to make sure their condition isn't cancerous.
Surgery to remove the entire large intestine eliminates the risk of colon cancer.

, Although your family doctor can help rule out some other causes of abdominal pain and chronic diarrhea with blood tests and a stool sample, it's best to get a referral to an intestinal specialist called a gastroenterologist. These specialists will use diagnostic equipment to look directly at the lining of the colon to see if any ulceration is present.


A blood test can confirm anemia (reduced red blood cells), which infers some sort of internal bleeding due to ulcers of perforation.A blood test can also show elevated white blood cells, which indicates some sort of bacterial or viral infection instead.
A stool sample that shows blood and pus (dead white blood cells) indicates some sort of IBD, whereas lots of bacteria or parasites indicates an infection.

, A colonoscopy allows your gastroenterologist to look at your entire colon by using a thin, flexible tube with a camera attached to the end of it.The ""scope"" is inserted into the rectum and takes pictures of the lining of the entire large intestine, so any ulcers are visualized. During the procedure, a small tissue sample (biopsy) can be taken and looked at under a microscope.


As an alternative, a flexible sigmoidoscope can also be used to be visualize the last part of the colon called the sigmoid. Sigmoidoscopy is a better choice over colonoscopy if your large intestine is severely inflamed.
Scoping the colon can be somewhat uncomfortable, but usually not painful enough to warrant anesthesia or strong pain killers. Lubrication and muscle relaxants are usually enough.

, If your symptoms are severe, your gastroenterologist may take an abdominal x-ray after you've swallowed a thick ""barium shake"" in order to rule out a perforated colon.The doctor may also order an abdominal CT scan in order to see how much of the colon is ulcerated and how deep it is. A CT scan is great for distinguishing between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.


Magnetic resonance (MR) enterography is a more sensitive test for finding inflammation and ulceration in the colon and doesn't involve any radiation.
Chromoendoscopy is used by specialists to rule out colorectal cancer. It involves spraying the inside of the colon with a special dye that highlights cancerous tissue.

Consider oral dissolution therapy.,
Pursue shock wave therapy.,
Understand that gallstones often recur following non-surgical treatments.",How to Dissolve Gallstones1," Your doctor may prescribe a course of ursodiol to dissolve your gallstones without surgery. These treatments are essentially bile acids in pill form. Ursodiol, in particular, is a popular treatment because it is one of the safest common drugs available.

Oral dissolution therapy is most likely to be successful in treating small stones (less than 1.5 centimeters in diameter) with high cholesterol content. About 30 percent of gallbladder patients are candidates for this treatment.
If you are suffering from pigment stones, you will likely need to pursue other treatment.
This treatment tends to be less successful for obese patients.;
, This therapy is often used in combination with oral dissolution therapy, although laparoscopic surgery is now so readily available that shock wave therapy is rarely performed today. This therapy, also called lithotripsy, uses sound waves to break gallstones into more easily dissolvable pieces.This treatment works best on gallstones under 2 centimeters in diameter.This treatment is somewhat rare, as it is only available in a few locations.

, Gallstones return in a majority of patients who pursue dissolution treatments. As a result, these treatments are no longer common. Typically they are used for patients who are physically unable to tolerate surgery."

Have a plan for conquering cravings.,
Don't take it too far.",How to Do a Cleansing Fast for the Large Intestine," Your doctor can tell if you have conditions that may make the fast harmful. Another alternative is to make an appointment with a practitioner of alternative medicine to get a personalized detox and cleansing program. In any case, unless you've done this before and are an old pro at fasting, it's a good idea to talk things over with an expert before you begin.


If your doctor decides it's not a good idea for you to do an extreme fast, such as a liquid-only fast, you can still cleanse your body by taking a break from certain types of foods. For example, you could stop eating sugar for a certain amount of time. That way you'll be able to keep your energy up while still getting the benefits of giving your digestive system a break.
Don't plan to fast as a way to lose weight. Fasting may cause weight loss, but when you start eating regular meals again, you'll gain it back.""Yo-yoing"" in this way intentionally can a negative effect on your health.;
, There are a number of recommendations available online and in books. Some call for liquids and juice alone, while others allow for a dinner of brown rice, steamed vegetables or other light food. Many call for juice recipes that use specific ingredients and supplements.


If this is your first time fasting, consider doing a raw food cleanse. You'll essentially be abstaining from all cooked foods, leaving you free to consume raw fruits, vegetables and nuts, along with plenty of water.

Doing a juice fast is another good way to cleanse your system without giving it too much of a shock. You'll want to your juices to contain both fruit and vegetable juice, rather than pure fruit juice, which contains too much sugar to be a healthy option.
It's fine to completely abstain from eating for a limited period (no more than 24 - 36 hours) with your doctor's approval. However, doing a total fast or limiting your intake to just lemon and honey water, grapefruits, cabbage soup, and so on does not help your digestive system and could be potentially dangerous, since you're denying yourself essential nutrients.

, A juicer or blender will be essential if you're doing a juice fast. In addition to the proper equipment, select the food you'll be eating carefully. Since the point is to cleanse your digestive system, including your large intestine, you want to be sure not to take in unnecessary additives, preservatives and other chemicals.


Buy organic produce to use during the fast.
Buy food that's in season. It'll be more nutritious than out of season food.
Shop local if you can. Food grown nearby is fresher than food that has traveled from long distances to get to your grocery store. Check out a local farmer's market for good options.

, Remove tempting foods that are ""against the rules"" from your pantry and refrigerator, as well as other areas in your home. Fasting will certainly make you feel hungry, and if you have a box of cookies or a bag of chips within easy reach, the whole process will be more difficult. The following items are typically part of a fast, and should be removed from the premises:


Dairy products
Refined sugars
Wheat products (pasta, bread, etc.)
Canned goods
Packaged snack foods
Meat products
Soft drinks
Alcohol
Caffeinated drinks

, If you go straight from eating meat lovers' pizza, macaroni, ice cream and hot dogs to a strict juice or raw food cleanse, your system will likely revolt. You're going to experience a lot of cravings, all at the same time. Your body is going to want sugar, carbs, and meat like nobody's business, and you'll likely feel sick, maybe a headache and irritable. If you start a few weeks in advance and cut back on the heavy foods that you're most likely to crave, the detox won't leave you feeling wiped out and ill.


Sugar and caffeine are major culprits when it comes to withdrawal symptoms. Try cutting these two items out of your diet at least 2 weeks before the cleanse.
Cut back on your meat consumption, too. Try eating meat just a few times a week, then cut back to once a week before the fast begins.
Processed foods, fast food, and packaged snack foods will also be hard to give up all at once. Weaning yourself off of these products beforehand will increase your chances for succeeding with your fast.

, Some fasting diets start with light eating for a day or longer before starting the fast. Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables and light foods like brothy soups. This will help your body get acclimated to your new routine.

, Whether you're eating raw food or just doing a liquid fast, you'll need plenty of healthy fluids along the way. Be sure to drink 8 ounces of liquid at least 3 times a day throughout the cleanse. Here are a few drink ideas:


To kick things off, mix 1/4 cup warm water, 1/4 cup citrus juice and one tablespoon of Epsom salts. Drink two servings the first day of your fast.
Mix 1/2 cup organic apple juice with 1/3 cup of water. Add 1 tsp. each of bentonite, whey powder and psyllium. Mix well, and drink immediately.
Make green juice by juicing kale, spinach, carrots, and pears.

, In addition to the special drinks, make sure you take in some water every 90 minutes. You can also drink fresh fruit juice, herbal teas, and broth. Space out the drinks so they occur between consumption of cleansing drinks.

, Saunas, massage, deep breathing and light walks can help release toxins from your body. Be sure not to overdo it, though, since your energy will be a little lower during the fast.

, Fasting for longer than this can have adverse health effects. Break the fast with small portions of vegetables and fruit to start - you don't want to overwhelm your system. Eat raw or steamed vegetables on the first day. A regular diet can be resumed the second day after breaking the fast.

, Eat probiotics like those found in yogurt and miso. Exercise regularly, and drink water. Eat a balanced diet that includes dietary fiber.

, If this is your first time fasting, it's a good idea to do some research so you'll know what to expect. Knowing you aren't the first person to experience a certain side effect might help you endure when all you really want to do is have a slice of pizza. Here are a few effects you can expect:


Expect to feel cranky. Cutting out sugar and other foods on which your body is dependent is going to cause withdrawal symptoms, and irritability is a major one.
Expect to feel a little sick at first. You might have a headache or feel weak for the first few days.
Expect to get used to the hunger. You'll definitely have some hunger pangs, but many people report that these tend to go away after a few days.
Expect to feel lighter. After a few days of fasting, you should feel a mood boost and feel lighter on your feet.

, Having a plan in place for when cravings kick in can help keep you from indulging mid-fast. Here are a few things you can try to distract yourself from your lust for cheese and crackers:


Drink a big glass of water.
Go for a walk. Getting some fresh air can help.
Read a book or watch a movie that doesn't contain lengthy descriptions of meals.

, If you start to feel dizzy, weak, and fatigued, your fast might be doing more harm than good. Stop fasting immediately if bad symptoms persist. Be sure to see your doctor if eating normally again doesn't restore you to good health.

Learn about damage to teeth.,
Be aware of how fake retainers affect gums.,
Avoid Bisphenol-A (aka BPA).,
Think about schooling required for orthodontists.,
Select your wax.,
Fill a glass jar with boiling water.,
Mash your wax into a malleable shape.,
Press the wax against your upper teeth.,
Fold the wax over your teeth.",How to Make a Fake Retainer Out of Wax," A dental retainer works by applying pressure to your teeth. If this pressure is applied wrong, the result might be wearing away the enamel of the tooth's surface — and this is the least of the problems. If the pressure forces your tooth too much in one direction, bone resorption can occur and cause the tooth (or teeth) to become loose. You can also impact the blood flow to the tooth, which causes the tooth to die. If your tooth dies, it will eventually have to be removed.


If your teeth teeth become loose, it will be harder to chew food, and your tooth might eventually fall out.
Your tooth can become discolored. Its naturally ivory/white color will turn to dull gray or black. This is s sign that the pulp containing the nerve and blood vessels has died, leaving internal stains.;
, An improperly fitting retainer will irritate your gums. It may cause bleeding, infection, and inflammation. Because your gums are essential to maintaining your teeth's health, damage to your gums results in damage to the bone support and ligaments that hold your tooth in place.


If you notice any irritation to your gums, remove your retainer immediately.
Your gums can recede or pull away from your tooth. This exposes more of the tooth's surface to bacteria, and weakens the overall strength of the tooth. This can cause sensitivity and affect the look of your smile.

, If you purchase your retainers from an orthodontist, it will be made of substance approved by the FDA for safe oral use; however, making your own retainer may mean you use plastics contaminated by BPA, a common material in many commercial products that may cause serious health problems.Even low doses of BPA ingested over time may result in chronic health issues.
Making a retainer out of wax means that you are likely to be wearing BPA-rich material in your mouth.

, An orthodontist is a dental specialist. They must attend four to eight years of post-undergraduate education in order to practice. There are only 63 programs in orthodontics in the United States, and they are quite competitive to attend.If orthodontics weren't a challenging field, it wouldn't require so much education. You need to know physics, geometry and have a good spatial vision so you can predict the final result.
The practice of orthodontics and dentistry is a medical practice, affecting not only the mouth but the overall body health. An infection caused by improper use of retainer can result in infection carried to the bloodstream.

, You can use the red wax wrapping from popular cheese products, such as Babybel cheese, or you can use the clear wax wrapping of certain candies. For example, some stores sell miniature soda bottles made of wax. Consider, too, using orthodontic wax, which you may be able to find at the drugstore.


Your choice can be based on the color of wax, or on the most available product.
Dispose of the cheese or soda in whatever way you want to. All you really need is the waxy coating.

, If you don't have access to boiling water, very hot tap water will also work. Put the wax into the water and let it soak for short time. Being immersed in hot water will soften the wax.


You'll want to take the wax out while the water is still hot.
Putting wax into the microwave to heat it isn't recommended.

, Holding the waxy product between your thumbs and fingers, press repeatedly until the wax shapes itself into a flattish oval shape. You want the shape to eventually fit over your teeth.


Don't let the wax get larger than your mouth.
If the wax is too small, it won't fit over the width of your mouth.

, With your thumb and your first finger, press the wax between your upper lip and your upper teeth. Hold the wax gently against your teeth and gums as you spread it, until it cools down and gets harder.


Don't scrape your gums. You'll have to be gentle as you work.
It helps to use a mirror while you spread the wax.

, Working from left to right, pinch the wax with your thumb and index finger against your teeth until it's smooth and flat. Make sure that the wax doesn't rub against or dig into your upper gum.


Gently press the wax against the roof of your mouth with your thumb until it cools down and gets harder.
Your fake retainer can be as wide as you want it to be. Usually, it will cover all of your front upper teeth.
The retainer will harden as it cools.

Treat your gallstones with plant terpenes.,
Consider a gallbladder flush.,
Try acupuncture.,
Treat the symptoms of your gallbladder disease with herbs or homeopathic remedies.",How to Dissolve Gallstones2," Scientific testing of a proprietary blend of plant-based compounds called Rowachol has produced encouraging results. A six-month course of treatment produced complete or partial dissolution of gallstones in 29 percent of a 27-patient research population.


These plant terpenes appear to stimulate bile production by your liver and inhibit the formation of cholesterol crystals.
Rowachol also enhanced the effectiveness of other solvent drugs., Opinions differ regarding the efficacy of gallbladder cleanses and liver flushes. No scientific evidence exists that these treatments are effective, but there are some anecdotal reports of success. Bear in mind that most of the “evidence” produced in your stool following a flush is not actually gallstone, but rather a byproduct of the treatment itself. That said, you may try various options:


Fast 12 hours. Then, starting at 7 p.m., ingest 4 tablespoons of olive oil, followed by one tablespoon of lemon juice. Repeat every 15 minutes for a total of 8 treatment cycles.
Alternatively, consume only apple and vegetable juice during the day. Then, around 5 or 6 p.m., ingest 18 milliliters of olive oil, followed by 9 milliliters of fresh lemon juice. Repeat every 15 minutes until you’ve consumed 8 ounces of olive oil.
Gallbladder flushes often produce pain and diarrhea.
By the next morning, you’ll typically pass soft green or brown spheres. Again, these are not usually gallstones, but rather the byproducts of the treatment., This treatment may not eliminate existing gallstones, but it can ease spasms, increase your bile flow, and restore proper liver and gallbladder function., It’s important to note that these remedies will not eliminate your gallstones; rather, under the guidance of a trained professional they may mitigate your symptoms so you can better tolerate the stones already in your system.


Green tea, milk thistle, globe artichoke, and turmeric can all support liver and gallbladder function. Again, consult a trained medical professional before undertaking a herbal regimen. Used improperly, these herbs may trigger a gallbladder attack or produce other unwanted side effects.Homeopathic remedies for gallstones include colocynthis, chelidonium, and lycopodium prepared in specific concentrations.Note that there is no evidence that homeopathy is effective.

"
"
Follow dietary practices that have been demonstrated to prevent gallstones.,
Consume preventive nutritional supplements.,
Lose weight slowly and then maintain a healthy body weight.,
Pursue allergy testing and then eliminate allergenic foods from your diet.",How to Dissolve Gallstones3," A number of practices have been linked to lower incidence of gallbladder disease:


Consume polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats.
Eat plenty of fiber.
Ingest caffeine as part of your daily diet.
Follow a vegetarian diet.
Avoid excessive intake of refined sugars such as sucrose and fructose.
Some circumstantial evidence indicates eating large quantities of legumes can increase your incidence of contracting gallbladder disease.Consume a minimal quantities of alcohol.
Consider eating several one-ounce servings per week of peanuts or other nuts. This has proven useful in studies involving female subjects, in particular.Eat regularly; avoid skipping meals., Nutritional supplements containing vitamin C, soy lecithin, and iron have proven useful in preventing the development of gallstones., Rapid weight loss can increase the risk of developing gallstones. While obesity is a risk factor for gallbladder disease, you’ll want to eliminate this risk factor slowly through careful weight loss. Slow, steady weight loss of 1-2 pounds per week is best., Identifying and then avoiding foods that cause allergic reactions in your system can reduce your risk of developing gallstones. "

Watch for tooth sensitivity.,
Notice pressure when eating.,
Detect sharp or throbbing pain.,
Acknowledge a constant toothache.",How to Know if Your Dental Fillings Need Replacing1," If you have fillings that need replacement, you’ll likely feel it first. Paying attention to the physical symptoms of old or decaying fillings can let you know if it’s time to have your dentist replace them. One sign that your fillings may need replacing is if you have tooth sensitivity to temperature, sweets, or pressure.Pay attention when you bite into any cold, hot, or sweet foods. You may feel momentary sensitivity or pain after they contact your tooth, which could be a sign of a filling needing replaced.Be aware that your tooth may also be sensitive to touch either by your finger, toothbrush, or other dental tool.;
, In some cases, you may feel pressure when biting down on food.This sensation may last for a few seconds or longer. This can signal a damaged filling or damage to your dental pulp.Chew slowly if you detect any pressure when biting down on food. This may help you more easily identify which filling is potentially problematic.

, In addition to pressure you may feel in a tooth, there may also be a sharp and throbbing pain.It may come when you are eating or drinking or even when you’re not doing anything. Like pressure, the pain may go away quickly or linger for a few minutes. Noticing if you have any sharp or throbbing pain in a specific tooth or teeth can help you figure out if a filling needs replaced, especially if it happens with other symptoms.Winter and cold air can also make your tooth more sensitive than usual indicating the need for a new filling.

, Some people who have fillings that need replacing may experience a toothache.The pain may come and go or be constant. Toothaches are often caused by inflammation in the dental pulp, which can happen as a result of a filling needing replacement. If your toothache lasts longer than two days, see your dentist to prevent a complication with your dental health.If the pain lasts for too long, pulp can develop an irreversible pulpitis, which eventually leads to a necrosis where no pus is involved or an abscess.

Wash your hands well.,
Wiggle the tooth with your finger.,
Check if there is pain when you wiggle the tooth.,
Brush the tooth to loosen it.,
Rinse your mouth if the tooth falls out.",How to Loosen a Tooth1," Before you touch the tooth with your fingers, make sure you wash your hands really well. Use antibacterial soap and warm water to scrub your hands. Remove all dirt, bacteria, and germs on your hands. This will ensure they do not get into your mouth or onto the tooth when you touch it.You can also wash your hands with hand sanitizer if you do not have access to running water. The hand sanitizer should contain alcohol and be antibacterial.
If your child is trying to loosen their tooth, make sure they wash their hands well. You may wash their hands for them to make sure they are clean.;
, Use your pointer finger to gently wiggle the tooth in the socket. Do not twist the tooth or push it from side to side as this can cause pain and damage the gum area.Instruct your child on how to do this so they do not damage the tooth or their gums.
Baby teeth that are ready to come out should wiggle around fairly easily. Teeth that are not ready to come out may not move around much when you try to wiggle them.

, Notice if you feel pain when you wiggle the tooth around. If you feel any sharp pain when you move the tooth, it is likely not ready to come out.Let the tooth sit in your mouth until you can wiggle it without any pain. Only then should you try to loosen it more or remove it.

, Another way you can remove the tooth is to brush your tooth with a toothbrush. Use the wet toothbrush to gently wiggle at the tooth. Do not rub the tooth hard or scrape at it with the toothbrush.If the tooth feels loose when you brush it and you don’t feel any pain, it may be ready to come out. Otherwise, you may want to leave it alone until it falls out on its own.

, If the tooth falls out on its own, it should not bleed much. Rinse your mouth out with water to remove any blood in the socket.If the tooth is knocked out or wiggled out, it may bleed more. You may need to bite down on a piece of clean gauze or a towel to soak up the blood. It can take up to an hour for the bleeding to stop.

Do not ignore pain or tooth problems.,
Have regular dental evaluations.,
Ask about preventative measures.,
Know the basics of cavities and fillings.,
Ask about your dentist’s approach to cavities.,
Be aware of (without assuming) unnecessary dentistry.,
Determine if you can wait and see.,
Get a second opinion.",How to Know when Tooth Fillings Are Unnecessary," You may come across articles and posts describing an epidemic of unnecessary dental procedures and decide that no dentist can be trusted.However, regular dental care is essential to good oral and overall health, and signs of tooth pain or discomfort should never be ignored. Visit multiple dentists if you must, but make sure you visit a dentist when treatment is required.Only a trained dentist can properly diagnose and treat dental problems. In regards to tooth fillings, they are almost always a first-line treatment if you are experiencing: nerve (pulpal) pain; severe discomfort (like from a jagged tooth edge); functional problems (such as trouble chewing); or severe aesthetic issues.

How to Get Rid of Tooth Pain offers some good tips on temporary and at-home remedies, but note that none of these can replace a proper dental evaluation.;
, It is true that a small minority of experts believe the traditional notion of visiting the dentist every six months is overkill, and that a three to five year window is sufficient.Six months remains the common standard, however, and regular examinations will at very least provide you with up-to-date information regarding the status of your teeth. Your dentist might take x-rays to check for decay and other evolution of dental conditions such as root canals and dental implants. This information can help inform your decision-making in regards to any signs of tooth decay.Waiting until you have tooth pain before going to the dentist will almost always result in a tooth filling or other necessary procedure. Going before there is pain is more likely to give you treatment options in dealing with potential or emerging cavities.
There is also some debate regarding the value of professional tooth cleaning, but this is almost always a standard component of a dental examination. Talk to your dentist if you have questions or concerns about the value of regular scaling and polishing procedures.
Prevention is always less expensive and healthier than treatment; make regular dental appointments!

, The best way to avoid the question of whether you need a filling is to keep your teeth healthy and clean, through regular brushing, flossing, and making food choices that limit your intake of acids and sugars. If the dentist spots a sign of a potential or emerging cavity, though, you still may have preventative treatment options available that can allow you to avoid the “drill and fill.”When your dentist recommends a filling, never be afraid to ask if there are other, less drastic options that can be tried first.
While some dentists are quick to recommend filling cavities that are not yet fully-formed, others are more open to recommending risk-management approaches. These usually involve regular observation, proper cleaning, and treatments that focus on neutralizing acid, killing mouth bacteria, and strengthening tooth enamel.
Resin sealants can also sometimes be used to stop cavities on the biting surfaces of teeth from developing further., In basic terms, a cavity occurs when decay (from bacteria, acid, etc.) causes a hole to be bored through both the protective enamel and the dentin beneath, reaching the tooth’s interior components. “Incipient carious lesions,” also sometimes called “microcavities,” exist when the dentin has not yet been penetrated. Dental lesions are the first stage of tooth decay, when the damage is only beginning to affect the enamel.A tooth filling involves drilling out the dental caries (cavity) and often surrounding tooth material, in order to create a pocket that can be filled. Local anesthesia is often administered. The filling itself is meant to seal off the inner tooth material and replace the damaged and removed dentin and enamel. Fillings can be made of gold, metal alloys, ceramic, or various composite materials, and should last for several years at least., As in other medical fields, more sophisticated diagnostic equipment has made it possible for dentists to identify potential cavities far sooner and more easily than in years past. As a result, some dentists have become much more aggressive in taking preventative steps to halt incipient (or even just potential) cavities before they can develop into something more severe.Alongside this aggressive “drill and fill” approach, other dentists have taken things in the opposite direction, using increased information regarding the development of cavities to formulate a “watchful waiting” approach. It basically comes down to deciding whether it is best to nip a potential cavity in the bud or wait to see if it becomes an actual problem first. Some dentists now use lasers to treat cavities, as it is minimally invasive.

, The growth of the “drill and fill” approach to possible cavities has led some to question the motives of dentists. Dentists are, after all, typically paid by insurers for the work they actually do, with the determination of the necessity of that work left up to them. It can be claimed that dentists have a financial incentive to do unnecessary tooth filling, and there have been demonstrated instances of such activity.Many if not most “drill and fill” dentists genuinely believe in the health value of being proactive with fillings, however. If your dentist advocates an aggressive approach, you have every right to ask for a clear explanation as to why he or she believes this is the best way to go. In the end, you have to decide whether to trust his or her opinion.

, If your dentist recommends a filling but you are not experiencing pain or discomfort, you may want to consider asking whether it might make sense to wait and see if the cavity develops further. Tooth decay does not follow a universal pattern, and some potential cavities never develop into actual problems.Modern evidence indicates that cavities typically develop more slowly than often assumed, taking on average around four to eight years to fully form. Therefore, if you are visiting your dentist every six months, you should theoretically have ample time to catch a developing cavity before it becomes a serious problem that might lead to a root canal or tooth extraction.
You should also ask for an intra-oral camera check to make sure that the lesion has penetrated your enamel and can turn into a problem.
It is your mouth and your choice, of course. Don’t let a dentist scare you into taking action, but also accept that he or she has the expertise and experience in the field. Inform yourself, ask questions, and be ready to weigh the risks versus benefits of waiting.

, Getting a tooth filled is typically not an overly expensive, painful, or intrusive procedure, but that doesn’t mean you should submit to it without a second thought. As with any medical procedure, you should always be ready to seek out an alternative professional opinion if you have any doubts or concerns.If your dentist seems angry or offended that you want a second opinion, it is probably for the best that you seek out a new dentist anyway.

Brush for at least two minutes.,
Protect your teeth against decay by using a toothpaste with fluoride.,
Prevent tooth decay from occurring between your teeth by flossing.,
Use mouthwash.,
Scrape bacteria off your tongue with a scraper or by brushing it.,
Don’t smoke.",How to Keep Your Teeth Healthy and Strong1," Do this in the morning and at night before you go to sleep. The most important thing in maintaining a good oral hygiene is to adopt the correct brushing technique. Ask your dentist or hygienist to teach you how to correctly use the toothbrush and how to apply it to your gums and teeth.


Brush with a soft bristled brush or an electric toothbrush. Brush all the surfaces of each tooth, including the chewing surface, the back and the front.
Replace your toothbrush every three months. If you use an electric toothbrush, you should also replace the head every three months.
It also never hurts to brush your teeth in the middle of the day.
Wait about 30 minutes after eating before brushing your teeth. After you eat, the acid produced by the food in your mouth causes your enamel to soften. Immediately after eating you can rinse your mouth with water, then after 30 minutes, you can brush.Children should brush their baby teeth both to prevent cavities and to learn good oral hygiene habits.;
, Fluoride strengthens the enamel coating on your teeth, making it less vulnerable to decay. Ideally, the toothpaste should have 1,350–1,500 ppm of fluoride in it. This is safe for children as long as an adult supervises them to make sure they don’t eat it.If you use a lower strength toothpaste for a young child, make sure it has at least 1,000 ppm of fluoride. If it is lower, it won’t have enough to prevent tooth decay.
Use a pea-sized amount on the toothbrush. When you are finished brushing, spit it out. You can rinse your mouth with water, but only briefly. You don’t want to wash away all the fluoride!

, Flossing will remove food particles, plaque, and bacteria that might be hiding between your teeth where the bristles of your brush can’t reach them.Use about a foot-and-a-half of floss. Wind it around one finger of your dominant hand and one finger of your non-dominant hand. Then, with your dominant hand, insert the floss between your teeth and curve the floss around one of the teeth. Rub up and down, including going gently below the gum line. Then curve it around the other tooth and repeat. Use a mirror to help you see what you are doing.
Floss at least once per day. If you find the floss difficult to handle, you can use an interdental cleaner which has a small handle with a brush, pick, or stick that helps you get between your teeth.If you floss before brushing, this will help the fluoride in your toothpaste get between your teeth and provide antibacterial protection.

, You can reduce the amount of bacteria floating around your mouth by rinsing with an antibacterial mouthwash or or salt solution. If you use a mouthwash, look for one with fluoride in it.A good mouthwash should also have chlorhexidine in a small concentration, such as 0.02%. Avoid products that contain alcohol
To make a salt solution, dissolve salt into a cup of warm water. As you add salt, taste it to make sure it isn't so salty that you won't be able to stand it.If it's too salty, add more water.
Swish the mouthwash or salt solution in your mouth for about two minutes. Move it around as much as possible so that it will coat all areas of your teeth. Then tip your head back and gargle. Spit the mixture out afterwards. Don’t swallow it. Gargling might not be appropriate for children who are too young to safely do so without choking.

, The roughness of your tongue traps food particles and bacteria, which may contribute to tooth decay.Don't press so hard it hurts or bleeds. You should be able to see a film of saliva and debris on the scraper by just moving it gently. Go from back to front.
Some toothbrushes have tongue scrapers on the back of them. Look to see if yours has a rough little pad.

, Smoking will stain your teeth yellow, give you bad breath, and make you more likely to get gum disease and mouth cancers. If you already smoke, you can greatly increase your overall health and the health of your teeth by quitting.

This may include x-rays of your mouth and models made of your teeth and mouth. After evaluating your teeth, your dentist will help you determine whether dental implants are a good choice and how best to move forward.You should also consult with your doctor and discuss any medical conditions that might complicate oral surgery.
Ask things like “Am I healthy enough for implants?” and “How long will the process take?”
Regular dental checkups are an important part of maintaining proper oral hygiene. Visit your dentist every six months.;
, Talk with your dentist about the number of dental implants you want. This will determine what kind of implants you receive, as well as the length of the surgery and its cost.If you need multiple teeth replaced, you might want to consider having a bridge – a prosthesis with multiple false teeth attached – installed instead of individual dental implants.
Ask your dentists things like “Is my jaw healthy enough for implants?” and “Would bridges or individual implants be best?”

, Because implants tend to be more expensive than traditional bridge work, you will want to consider the cost and talk with your insurance provider. Dental implants are sometimes not covered by insurance because they are considered a cosmetic operation. Make sure that you have the financial resources to get dental implants.When you talk to your insurer, ask them things like “Are dental implants covered under my dental plan?” and “How much of this procedure will I pay out of pocket?”

, Depending on the health of your jawbone, there are different types of dental implants that you will need to consider. These implants can be surgically placed in the jaw and underneath the gums, or on top of the gums.An endosteal implant is the most common and requires the surgical placement of metal screws, cylinders or blades in the jaw. The gums are cut open, an implant is drilled into the jaw, and then the gums are closed around it. The implant can be used to hold one or more prosthetic teeth.
A subperiosteal implant is placed on top of the jaw with metal implants placed through the gums. This implant is less common and used mostly for those who lack the bone strength or height in their jaw for endosteal implants.

, Before you begin surgery, you will work with your health specialists to develop a treatment plan. This plan will detail things like your medical history, the health of your mouth and jawbone, the type of implants you are receiving, and the proposed timeline for the various procedures. You will likely work with multiple specialists over the course of getting your implants, including your personal doctor and dentist, a periodontist, and an oral surgeon., Before you go into surgery, talk with your oral surgeon about what to expect and how you should prepare for the operation. Depending on the number of teeth being replaced and the type of anesthesia used, you may need to rearrange your schedule and make some changes to your routine leading up to the surgery. You may also need to make arrangements for after the surgery.Ask your oral surgeon things like “What kind of anesthesia will be administered?” and “How long will the entire procedure last?”
Because the procedure can require multiple surgeries over many months, it is important to schedule your appointments and plan accordingly.

, You will likely need to take some time off to have your various surgeries. Depending on how many implants you are receiving and the type of anesthesia delivered, this could be from a few hours to multiple days. Talk with your dental specialists about the expected recovery time for your surgeries and how long you should rest after them.If you receive general anesthesia, be prepared to take the rest of the day off.
Depending on your level of discomfort, you may be able to return to work or school following local anesthesia.
Ask the dental health professional something like “How long should I plan to miss work?” or “Can I go back to work right away?”

, If your dental specialists intend to use local anesthesia, they will likely recommend that you do not eat or drink anything the night and morning before surgery. Having food in your stomach can cause complications when you are sedated with general anesthesia. Be sure to follow your specialist’s guidelines before surgery.This is typically not a concern with local anesthesia. However, be sure to consult your dental specialist.
Ask the dental specialist things like “What foods should I avoid after surgery?” and “What foods do you recommend that I eat?”

, If general anesthesia is used during your surgeries, you will want to have someone available to take you home afterwards. You can ask a friend or family member to drive you, or arrange for a taxi to pick you up. Because the general anesthesia will impair your ability to drive, it is important that you have someone to take you home in order to avoid an accident.Ask the dental specialist whether or not you will be able to drive yourself home.

, When tooth loss occurs, the bone beneath the gums can erode and soften, making it difficult to attach an implant. In this instance, the dental surgeon will remove a piece of bone, either from another part of your jaw or body – possibly your hip – and transplant it to your jawbone. Your surgeon may also choose to use artificial bone. After the graft, it may take several months before the transplanted bone has become strong enough to support a dental implant.If you only need minor grafting, it can sometimes be done at the time of the implant surgery.
Depending on the strength of the bone in your jaw and the teeth being replaced, you may also need a sinus lift surgery or a ridge modification, both of which will help promote bone growth in the jaw and mouth., During the initial surgery, the oral surgeon will make a cut in your gums and expose the bone. They will then drill a hole into the bone where a metal post will be placed. This post will serve as the implant's root and anchor it to your jaw.The wound is then closed with stitches and allowed to heal.


You will still have a gap in your mouth at this point, but you can receive a temporary denture to cover it., Over the course of the next two to six months, the bone and implant will bond together in a process known as osseointegration. This will ensure that your dental implant is firmly anchored to your jaw., Depending on the type of dental implant you receive, you may need to undergo a second surgery once osseointegration is complete. During this surgery, the oral surgeon reopens your gums, exposing the implant, and attaches an abutment – the piece where the crown will be attached. The surgeon then closes the gum tissue around the abutment with stitches.You may choose to have the abutment attached to the dental implant post when it is initially implanted. This means that you will not need a second surgery. However, you will also have the abutment jutting past your gum line for multiple months, which might be less visually appealing.

, After each surgery, your surgeon will close up your gums using stitches. Generally, they will use stitches that dissolve on their own. However, the dental specialist may choose to use stitches that are not self-dissolving and require removal. This will be done a few weeks after each surgery., Whether you have a single or multiple stage surgery, you will likely experience some discomfort afterwards. You may have some swelling and bruising of your skin and gums. You will also have pain at the implant site and some bleeding.If the pain or swelling persist for more than a few days or gets worse, you should talk to your oral surgeon. They may need to prescribe you pain medication or antibiotics.
Because of sensitivity from the surgery, you will likely only be able to eat soft foods, like puddings and soups, that require little chewing.

, Once the abutment is placed, your gums will need one to two weeks to heal. After they have healed, your dental specialist will make impressions of your teeth using a material to make a cast of your mouth. They will then create a crown – the artificial tooth – that will fit your mouth and the abutment, and will look attractive.The mold will likely be a mouthpiece filled with a molding material, typically made from a plastic compound. They will have you bite down on the mouthpiece and, after a few minutes, the gooey plastic compound will harden, resulting in a mold of your teeth and gums.
The crown will look like your other teeth and be largely indistinguishable from a natural tooth.

, Once your gums are fully healed and your jawbone is strong enough to support a new tooth, your dentist will attach the crown. Discuss with your dentist whether you want crowns that are removable, which can be easily removed for cleaning or repair, or fixed, which are permanently screwed into place and much stronger.If you need multiple teeth replaced, you can opt to have a combination of removable and fixed crowns. Talk with your dental specialist to determine which option works best.If you are replacing multiple teeth, a bridge is a more affordable option.Fixed crowns tend to be more expensive than removable ones.

, Once you have your new teeth, it is important to clean and care for them like you would your normal teeth. Brush them twice a day and use floss and mouth wash daily. You should also visit your dentist regularly.Your dentist will likely recommend regular checkups to ensure the health of your implants.

Observe holes or dark spots.,
Inspect floss for tears and food particles.,
Feel the tooth surface for roughness.,
Look for a broken, cracked, or lost filling.,
Identify chipped or fractured teeth.,
Determine what kind of dental filling you have.",How to Know if Your Dental Fillings Need Replacing2," In addition to any physical sensations you may feel, you may be able to see signs that your fillings need replacement. One sign that your fillings may need replaced is seeing holes or dark spots. You may notice these while brushing or flossing your teeth every day. Paying attention for these signs can ensure you get prompt treatment and may minimize the risk of infection in your oral cavity., If you floss your teeth daily, look at the floss in between each tooth. You may notice tears in the floss or pieces of food it may have removed. These can be signs of cracked teeth and/or a filling that needs replaced.Note which tooth either shreds the floss or always seems to have food stuck in it. This can help your dentist better identify which filling needs replacement, but in cases like this an x-ray is almost always a must.

, Most people love the feeling of clean and smooth teeth. You may notice that you have a tooth that never feels smooth even after brushing and flossing. This may be a sign that a filling needs replaced.Keep an eye on the tooth and notice if anything makes the roughness worse or better. If it doesn’t get any smoother, let you dentist know.

, In some cases, you may be able to see when a filling needs replaced. If you notice any physical symptoms, check inside your mouth to see if you have any fillings that are visibly broken, cracked, or missing. Contact your dentist for an appointment to confirm that you need the filling replaced.Wash your hands thoroughly with warm water and soap before putting them in or near your mouth. This can minimize your risk of introducing harmful bacteria into your mouth.

, Even if you can’t see a problematic filling, a chipped or fractured tooth may also indicate that you need a filling replaced. If you have physical symptoms but can’t see any cracked, broken, or missing fillings, check the surrounding teeth. They may have chips or fractures that need the attention of your dentist.Use your tongue to identify any sharp edges or missing structures. Food that gets stuck in daily is also a sign that your old filling needs replacement
Be aware that cracks and chips may be so small that you can’t detect them with your eye alone.Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before looking for chipped or fractured teeth. This can prevent an infection.

, There are different kinds of dental filling material. Each has a different life span. Knowing what kind of filling you have can help you know if it’s time to replace it. Recognize that the durability of the fillings also depends on how well you care for your oral health. If you take great care of your teeth and gums, then your fillings may last longer. The following are different types of fillings and their average life spans:Gold fillings, which can last for up to 15 years.
Amalgam fillings, which are silver in color, can also last up to 15 years.
Composite fillings, made of a material that matches your own tooth color, may need replacing after five years.
Ceramic fillings can last about 7 years."

Schedule an appointment with your dentist.,
Undergo an examination.,
Get additional testing.,
Discuss your replacement options.,
Get regular checkups.",How to Know if Your Dental Fillings Need Replacing3," The only way to know for sure if a filling needs replaced is to see your dentist. A dental professional is also the only person qualified to replace fillings. If you notice any signs or symptoms of a filling that may need replaced, schedule an appointment with your dentist at the earliest time possible. This can ensure you get prompt treatment and may minimize your risk of developing abscesses.Let the scheduling staff know why you need to see the dentist. They may be able to get you an appointment sooner rather than later.

, Your dentist will conduct a thorough exam of your fillings to see if any need replacing. Let your dentist know any signs or symptoms you’ve observed, which he’ll consider along with your medical records and the results of his examination.Be precise when explaining your symptoms of signs to the dentist. This can help your dentist better determine if the filling needs replaced. For example, “I get a sharp pain that hurts my entire tooth.”Allow your dentist to probe your mouth with a tool called an explorer. This will gently probe the tooth and filling to detect any worn spots., In some cases, a filling may be intact but still need replacement. This is because it has a small crack or is leaking. Both of these can lead to tooth decay. Your doctor may also want to check for problems between your teeth that are not visible with the naked eye. Your dentist suspects or determines that your fillings need replacing, they will likely have you undergo additional testing such as X-rays or transillumination. These can help your dentist better formulate a treatment and replacement plan for you.Recognize that your dentist may also order a periapical radiograph, another type of oral X-ray, to check that the root of your tooth is not damaged., Your dentist may determine that you have one or more fillings that need replaced. If this is the case, explore your different options with the dentist. It may be possible to repair the old filling or you may need to have it completely replaced. Talking to your dentist about your different options can ensure you get proper care without the burden of cost or worrying that you’ll need to replace a filling in the near future.Ask your dentist if a different filling material may suit you better if an entire filling needs replaced.

, Prevention is one of the best ways to keep your teeth and fillings healthy. Scheduling regular appointments with your dentist can help detect fillings that need replacement before they cause complications such as tooth or pulp decay.

Bite into an apple or a pear.,
Try corn on the cob.,
Have bread or a bagel.",How to Loosen a Tooth2," Apples and pears are crunchy and can help to loosen up a tooth. Have apple or pear slices. Try biting into an apple to make the tooth more loose.Do not try to drag the apple or pear against the tooth to help loosen it. This could damage the tooth and the gum area. Instead, bite and chew the apple or pear to loosen the tooth.

, Another good crunchy food for loosening a tooth is corn on the cob. Bite into corn on the cob to help loosen your tooth from the socket.

, Soft but crunchy foods like bread or a bagel are also a good option for loosening a tooth. Bagels in particular are just soft enough to loosen your tooth without damaging it. Toast the bread or the bagel so it is crunchy and can help to loosen the tooth.

See your dentist if you have a loose adult tooth or the tooth is infected.,
Speak to your dentist about your treatment options.,
Discuss removing the loose tooth, if necessary.",How to Loosen a Tooth3," Adults often develop a loose tooth due to grinding their teeth or gum disease. In some cases, the tooth can be knocked loose due to trauma to the mouth. If you have a loose adult tooth or you suspect the tooth is infected, see your dentist for treatment.A tooth is likely infected if it is sore or painful to the touch. The gum area around the tooth may also be painful, swollen, or red.
If you notice your child has a loose tooth that appears infected, bring them to the dentist right away.

, Your dentist will assess the tooth and determine if it is infected. They may provide extra support to the tooth, such as a small flexible splint, to keep the tooth anchored and stable. You will need to wear the splint for two weeks so the tooth can heal and go back into place.If you have a loose tooth due to grinding your teeth, known as bruxism, you may need to wear a special mouth guard at night when you sleep.
If you have a loose tooth due to gum disease, you may need to have deep cleaning done on the tooth.

, If the tooth is too loose to be saved and is very infected, the dentist may recommend removing it. They will do a tooth extraction, numbing the area so you do not feel any pain when it is removed. You may then need to wear a dental implant or a partial denture to replace the tooth.Having an implant will prevent your other teeth from pulling out of their sockets to try to fill the space.

Reduce your sugar intake.,
Avoid drinks that stain your teeth.,
Cut down your alcohol consumption.,
Eat extra crunchy, raw fruits and vegetables.,
Reduce the amounts of sticky foods you eat.,
Limit the amount of highly acidic foods and drinks you consume.,
Drink extra water.,
Chew sugar-free gum after eating.",How to Keep Your Teeth Healthy and Strong2," When the bacteria in your mouth break down sugars, it produces acids which dissolve the protective enamel coating on your teeth. This makes your teeth more vulnerable to decay.You can limit you sugar intake by:Not eating desserts like candy, chocolate, cakes, ice cream, pastries
Not adding sugar to your tea or coffee
Eating low sugar breakfast cereals
Avoiding sugary sodas and soft drinks
Drinking only one glass of fruit juice per day. Even unsweetened fruit juice is sugary.

, The following food are very common causes of yellow, unhealthy looking teeth:Wine
Tea
Coffee

, Alcohol wears away the protective enamel coating on your teeth. Prolonged consumption of high amounts can lead to cavities and tissue dehydration, making the the tissue in your mouth weaker and more vulnerable to bacterial aggression.People who both drink and smoke are at a higher risk of mouth cancers.

, These foods will help scrape your teeth clean as you eat them. And they are good for you! Options include:Apples
Celery
Carrots
Peppers
Cucumbers
Lettuce
Broccoli

, They are more likely to leave sugary films that will lead to tooth decay between your teeth. Examples include:Granola bars
Dried fruit like raisins
Gummy candies or taffies

, Acid can dissolve the enamel on your teeth and make the more vulnerable to decay. Highly acidic foods and drinks include:Orange juice
Grape fruit juice
Lemons
Pickles
Cola
Wine
Vinegar salad dressings

, Water will help prevent food from getting stuck in your teeth.If your mouth is dry, you are probably not drinking enough water. The quantity of water you need will vary daily based on the weather, your activity level, and the proper functioning of your salivary glands.
The first sign of dehydration is thirst. So if you are thirsty, help yourself to a tall glass of water.

, Gum will make the saliva flow, which will help breakdown any remaining pieces of food.It is important that the gum be sugar-free, otherwise you are coating your teeth in sugar and increasing the chances of tooth decay.
Sugar-free gums are widely available at local grocery stores and drug stores.

Removing any of the hard plaques that often develop in hard to clean places
Check to make sure you are not developing any cavities
Check the health of your gums
Show you the proper technique for brushing and flossing

, Two common and effective ones are fluoride varnish and fissure sealants. Both are suitable for adults and children.Fluoride varnish is a treatment where a strong fluoride is applied to the teeth to make the enamel stronger and less vulnerable to decay. This can be done every six months on both baby and permanent teeth.
A fissure sealant is a plastic or resin-based composite coating that is applied to the crevices of the teeth to protect them from bacteria and food that might get stuck in them. This is applied to permanent teeth and can last up to 10 years.

, Dental care can be expensive and many health insurance plans may not cover it. You can look for low cost dental care by:Contacting dentistry and dental hygiene schools to see if they offer low cost treatment to help students get experience. This will be supervised by an experienced dentist or hygienist. You can search online at the websites of organizations like the American Dental Association or the American Dental Hygienists Association.

Rinse and dry brush head.,
Clean the handle.,
Avoid washing in a dishwasher.,
Choose the optimal toothpaste.,
Rinse the head thoroughly.,
Disassemble the head and handle.,
Store the Sonicare properly.",How to Keep Your Philips Sonicare Clean of Black Gunk," Take apart your Phillips Sonicare by removing the brush head from the handle. This can make it easier to identify sources of gunk and clean them thoroughly.Unplug the charger before you separate the brush from the charger.Even if the wires are not connected to the toothbrush, it is best to be safe.
Align the brush head with the front of the handle and pull up to remove it.Unplug the charger before you inspect your toothbrush.Place each part on a towel or other cloth to prevent bacteria from spreading on other surfaces.;
, Generally, most mold or bacteria will develop on areas of your toothbrush not exposed to air, including brush heads stored in plastic.Figuring out which parts have gunk can help you more effectively remove it and keep it from returning.


Inspect the brush head and handle individually and thoroughly. You are most likely to find gunk on the (moist) surfaces that the brush head and charger connect. The handle is usually full of bacteria from holding the toothbrush, but also from the toothpaste that gathers during brushing.

, Make either a peroxide, vinegar, or bleach solution and submerge your brush head in it. This can not only remove and kill mold, but also any lingering bacteria that could infect your oral cavity.


Wipe the base of the head before soaking it to help the solution more effectively remove other gunk.Mix one part bleach to ten parts water and soak the brush head for an hour.Mix ½ cup/ 120ml of water and 2 tablespoons/ 30ml white vinegar in a cup. If desired, add 2 teaspoons/ 10mg baking soda if you like as well. Soak the brush head for 30 minutes.Place the brush head in a cup with 3.0% hydrogen peroxide for 20 minutes., Once you’ve soaked your brush head in the solution you chose for the allotted time, thoroughly rinse and dry it. Pay attention to the time to avoid fraying the bristles. This can ensure that you remove all of the solution and any residue and help keep more black gunk from forming.Rinse your brush head for at least 20 seconds under warm, running water.Dry your brush head with a cloth and then store it exposed to the air to prevent further gunk from developing., After you’ve removed the gunk and properly stored your brush head, you can move on to cleaning the handle. In most cases, you can simply clean off black gunk with a mild cleanser or bleach solution with a soft cloth.Avoid submerging the handle in water or a disinfectant solution, which can make it inoperable because it is an electronic device.You can use a mild soap or a mixture of one part bleach to ten parts water to clean the gunk off of your toothbrush handle.Dip a cotton swab or pad in the solution or soapy water and clean the area where the head attaches. Then clean the rest of the unit.You can also use disinfectant wipes that have been presoaked in alcohol. These wipes can easily clean the entire handle and the solution will evaporate quickly.
If black gunk is coming out of the handle, you may want to call Phillips Customer Service and request a new handle, as it is difficult to deconstruct the handle unit in order to effectively clean it.You can reach Phillips at 1(888) 744-5477.
Allow the unit to dry thoroughly before reattaching it to the brush head.

, Avoid removing gunk or cleaning any part of your Sonicare by placing it in a dishwasher. This can damage the unit and make it inoperable., Select a toothpaste that effectively kills oral bacteria. This may help keep your brush from developing gunk and other bacteria that could harm your health.Most toothpastes will help keep bacteria on your toothbrush at bay.Using an alkaline toothpaste will also help to reduce bacteria and prevent the new formation of colonies for a while.
Try a toothpaste with tricolsan/ copolymer, which may be more effective at keeping bacteria and gunk from forming., After each use of your Sonicare, rinse the brush head thoroughly. Consider detaching it from the handle to help minimize the risk of developing gunk.Hold the brush head under the water for at least 20 seconds.
Allow the head to air-dry completely.Wipe off the handle if necessary., When you’re not using your toothbrush, store the head and handle separately. This allows each part to dry thoroughly, which can help prevent gunk from developing on or in your Sonicare.


Wipe any surfaces that appear moist, especially around the head and handle seal.

, Store your Sonicare in an upright position, which can keep gunk from getting caught in the unit. Keep the unit in a cool and dry place away from direct sunlight, the toilet seat, or any other place where the toothbrush might fall off and break.You can store the unit on the charger if you like, though you shouldn’t need to charge it more than once a week.

Rule out temporary impairment due to illness.,
Take note of a loss of taste sensation.,
Be aware of distorted taste sensations.,
Identify potential causes of taste disorders.,
Visit a doctor for diagnosis.,
Talk to your doctor.,
Treat the underlying condition, if possible.,
Seek help from a counselor in coping with your taste disorder.,
Practice good oral hygiene.,
Season food to compensate for taste loss.",How to Know if You Are Taste Impaired," Your senses of smell and taste are closely related. Any common illness (cold, flu, seasonal allergy) which causes your nose to clog with mucus may also cause a temporary impairment of your senses of smell and taste. This may cause you to suspect that you have a taste disorder, when in fact you do not. Full functioning of smell and taste should return once you have recovered from the illness.Mucus creates a barrier that lowers or even blocks the functioning of the olfactory receptors, which detect odors.;
, You may have noticed that tastes are not as intense or vibrant as you remember them being before. This ""dulling"" of taste sensations is a disorder called hypogeusia. You can get an idea of how dulled your sense of taste has become by sampling strongly flavored foods, and attempting to differentiate between sensations of sweet, sour, bitter, salty and savory (umami).Complete loss of taste (a condition called ageusia) is much more rare, and should be treated very seriously, especially if its onset is sudden.
If you only enjoy foods which are extremely pungent or flavorful, or if all foods seem to taste the same to you, you may have developed, or been born with, one of these taste disorders.

, Some taste disorders cause false taste sensations, rather than dulling normal taste sensations. Such conditions are different from those causing taste loss, and identifying the difference will help your doctor diagnose your condition. Phantom taste perceptions, the most common taste disorder, are unpleasant taste sensations which persist even when nothing is in your mouth.Dysgeusia, a condition similar to phantom taste perceptions, involves a lingering, rancid, metallic taste.

, Many factors can contribute to the loss or distortion of your sense of taste. Read through the following list of potential causes, and identify the ones which apply to you. You may wish to write down the causes you identify so that you can talk to your doctor about them later.Recent infections in your upper respiratory system or ears
Exposure to industrial chemicals, such as pesticides
Taking oral medications, including common antihistamines and antibiotics
Any history of concussion or other head injury
Any surgery to the ear, nose, throat or mouth, including dental surgery
Dental conditions (including oral thrush) or poor dental hygiene
Several types of food poisoning, especially if they are viral
Mouth ulcers or tongue burns that cause intense pain

, Start by making an appointment with your primary care provider. Give them the details of your taste issues, including whether you are suffering from loss of taste or distorted taste. Your doctor may examine your ears, nose and throat for signs of illness. If a taste disorder is suspected, your doctor may refer you to an ear/nose/throat specialist. Your ENT specialist can administer taste tests designed to diagnose taste disorders, and suggest methods of treatment.

, Once your taste disorder has been diagnosed, you and your doctor will work to discover the underlying cause of your disorder. Be sure to bring along the list of potential causes you identified earlier., While there are no direct treatments for taste disorders, relief can often be achieved by fixing whatever health problem is causing the disorder. For instance, if your disorder is linked to a medication you are taking, switching medications may reverse the problem., Sometimes, though very rarely, the cause of a taste disorder will not be treatable, such as in the case of taste loss due to head injury. Don't give up hope. Counseling is available to provide you with tools to cope with your condition. Over time, your condition may even improve on its own., Daily brushing and flossing helps clear bacteria and food particles from your mouth. This debris can interfere with your ability to taste, resulting in a worsening of the symptoms of your taste disorder.Brush twice daily with a soft-bristled brush, and floss at least once a day.

, Adding extra spices or herbs to your food than you normally would can help you compensate for a dulled sense of taste. Avoid adding extra salt and sugar, however, as increasing your consumption of salt and sugar can, over time, lead to health issues.Instead try paprika, pepper, cloves, ginger, or any other spices that pique your interest.

Inform your oral surgeon about any pre-existing conditions you may have.,
Understand that smoking may cause problems.,
Consult with your primary physician.",How to Heal Gums After a Tooth Extraction," After a tooth extraction, your dentist will place a gauze on the wound to stop the bleeding. Make sure to bite down tightly on the gauze to apply pressure to the area to stop bleeding. If heavy bleeding continues, you may need to reposition the gauze pack to cover the wound more directly.Do not talk, as this may loosen the gauze and lead to further bleeding and delay the clot formation.
If the gauze gets too wet, you may replace it with another; however, do not change gauze more often than necessary and do not spit out saliva, as this may hinder clot formation.
Do not disturb the extraction area with your tongue or fingers, and avoid blowing your nose and sneezing or coughing during this time. Increased pressure may cause the wound to bleed again. Avoid holding your hand over the area of extraction to avoid warming up the area.
Remove the gauze after 30 to 45 minutes and check in the mirror to see if there is any bleeding.;
, Use only the medications prescribed by your dentist. If your oral surgeon has not provided you with a prescription for pain relievers, you may take an over-the-counter pain reliever. Take the antibiotics that your surgeon gives you.Take the first dose of pain medication as soon as possible before the effects of the anaesthesia wear off. It’s best to complete the dosages of painkillers and antibiotics as prescribed.

, Place an ice pack on your face outside the area of extraction. The ice pack reduces bleeding and controls swelling by constricting blood vessels. Use an ice pack for 10 to 20 minutes, then go without it for 30 minutes. Always wrap it in a towel or a cloth. Don’t place it directly on the skin. This can be done for the first 24 to 48 hours after extraction. After 48 hours, swelling should subside and ice will no longer provide relief.You can use a zipped plastic bag with crushed ice or ice cubes inside if you don’t have an ice pack.
Avoid keeping your hand in the area of extraction as you will generate heat.

, Tea contains tannic acid, which helps blood clots form by contracting your blood vessels. Using a tea bag may help reduce bleeding. If you notice a small amount of bleeding an hour after extraction, place a moist tea bag on the extraction site and bite down tightly to apply pressure to the area. Do so for about 20 to 30 minutes. Drinking cold tea may also be helpful, but applying a tea bag directly to the area gives better results., Wait until the morning after extraction to rinse your mouth. You can prepare a warm saline rinse by mixing one teaspoon of salt into one 8-ounce glass of water. Gargle slowly and gently without creating any pressure. Just move your tongue from one cheek to another several times, and then spit out the solution smoothly to avoid damaging the clot.Repeat rinsing with this solution four to five times a day for several days after the extraction, especially after meals and before bed.

, Proper rest ensures steady blood pressure, which helps facilitate blood clotting and healing of the gums. Do not engage in any physical activity for at least 24 hours after the extraction, and elevate the head slightly while resting to ensure that blood and/or saliva does not cause a choking hazard.Try sleeping propped up on two pillows and avoid sleeping on the extraction side so the blood doesn't stagnate under increased heat.
Do not bend downwards nor do any heavy lifting.
Always sit in an upright position.

, After 24 hours, brush your teeth and tongue gently, but do not use the toothbrush near your extraction site. Instead, rinse gently using the saline solution described above to avoid damaging the clot. Follow this procedure for the next three to four days.Flossing and using mouthwash can be kept in your regular routine. Just be sure not to use the floss near extraction site. Use an antiseptic mouthwash or a rinse prescribed by your dentist to help kill bacteria and prevent any infection.

, This can be applied to the extraction area starting the next day after extraction for faster healing. It can also prevent bacteria from forming near the extraction site. This also helps reduce pain and discomfort.Do not apply the gel directly into the socket. Just apply the gel to the area around the extraction site.

, This helps increase blood circulation, which promotes healing, and reduces swelling and discomfort. 36 hours after extraction, apply a warm, wet towel externally to the affected side of the face in a 20 minutes on, twenty minutes off rotation., You'll want to wait until the anesthesia has completely worn off before attempting to ingest food. Start with soft foods, chewing on the opposite side of your mouth as the extraction site. You may want to eat something cold and soft, like ice cream, to soothe the pain and provide you with some nourishment. Avoid anything hard, crunchy, crumbly, or hot, and do not use a straw, as this may dislodge a blood clot from your gums.Eat regularly and don’t skip meals.
Eat food that is at room temperature or cold, but never warm or hot.
Eat soft and mild-cold food like ice cream, smoothies, pudding, gelatin, yogurt, and soups. These are good especially immediately after an extraction because they soothe discomfort caused by the procedure. Make sure that what you eat isn’t too cold or hard, and that you don’t chew on the extraction area. Hard-to-chew foods (e.g. cereal, nuts, popcorn, etc.) can be painful and difficult to eat, and may injure the wound. Gradually change your food from liquids to semisolids to solids as the first few days pass.
Avoid straws. Drinking with a straw creates suction pressure within the mouth, which may cause bleeding. Sip or use a spoon instead to avoid this complication.
Avoid spicy food, sticky food, hot drinks, caffeine products, alcohol, and carbonated drinks.
Avoid tobacco/alcohol for at least 24 hours after extraction.

, Your gums and your mouth will swell as a response to the surgery, and you will probably be in pain. This is normal, and usually begins to subside after about two or three days. During that time, use an ice pack held against the affected cheek to soothe pain and reduce swelling and inflammation., After a tooth extraction, there is a lot of bleeding from the tiny blood vessels within the gums and bone. Bleeding should never be extreme or excessive, however, in some cases your dentist may place sutures to help with the healing process. If this happens, it may mean that post-surgical packs are being placed between the teeth and not directly on the wound. Consult your surgeon and reposition packs as necessary., A clot will form within the first day or two, and it's extremely important not to disturb or remove it. Clotting is a necessary first step toward healing, and removing or disturbing the clot may prolong the healing process and lead to infection or pain., For the next 10 days, the cells of the gums will proliferate to form a layer of epithelium that will bridge the gap produced by a tooth extraction. It is important not to disrupt this process while the wound is healing., After epithelial layer formation, the bone-forming cells in your bone marrow are activated. The process usually begins along the side (lateral) walls of the socket and continues toward the center.This will completely close the space created due to tooth loss. The complete closure of the socket created by bone deposition will take up to a year, but gum will cover the socket after just two weeks so there is nothing to worry about, as it will appear completely healed.

, You should also inform your surgeon about any medications you are currently taking. These may complicate the surgical procedure and cause problems during or after surgery.


Patients with diabetes generally take a longer time to heal after any dental treatment because bleeding also takes longer. Maintain a blood-sugar level close to normal to ensure faster healing after an extraction, and inform your dentist about your diabetic condition and your recent glucose test results. Your dentist will decide whether or not your blood sugar level is adequately under control for an extraction procedure.Patients with high blood pressure should be aware that certain blood pressure medications may cause bleeding from the gums. This could cause complications if the medication is not ceased prior to a tooth extraction surgery. Inform your surgeon about any medications you are currently taking or have recently taken.Patients taking anticoagulants or blood-thinning drugs like warfarin and heparin should inform their surgeon about those medications before dental extractions, as this class of medication will hinder blood clotting.Patients taking oral contraceptives containing estrogen may have complications with blood clotting. Consult with your surgeon if you are currently taking an oral contraceptive.Some long term medications will cause mouth dryness, which may lead to infection after a tooth extraction. Consult with your surgeon before any procedure. You should also consult with your doctor before changing any medications or dosages that you are taking.

, Smoking is a known factor in the development of gum disease.In addition, the physical act of smoking may cause the dislodgement of blood clots, which are necessary for healing to take place in the gums. Tobacco may also irritate the sensitive wound and complicate the healing process.If you are currently a smoker, consider quitting before your tooth extraction.
If you do not intend to quit smoking, be aware that patients should not smoke a cigarette for at least 48 hours after surgery. Patients who chew tobacco or ""dip"" should not use tobacco for at least seven days., Letting your primary doctor know about the surgery before undergoing a tooth-extraction procedure may help avoid potential problems caused by medications you are taking or conditions you may have.

Start early.,
Buy kid-friendly products.,
Break the process down into steps.,
Set a timer.,
Floss your child's teeth daily.,
Offer them a choice.",How to Keep Kids' Teeth Strong1," Children should start having their teeth brushed as soon as their first baby teeth appear. This should also be when they first visit the dentist. Lean your child against your lap or arms.Using a small toothbrush, take a rice-sized amount of fluoride toothpaste, and gently brush the child’s teeth.Afterwards, gently work a piece of floss around their teeth. Do this twice a day until the child is ready to learn how to brush and floss on their own.


Children should continue to use a rice-grain sized amount of toothpaste until they are three years old. When they are three, you should use a slightly larger, pea-sized amount. This reduces the amount of toothpaste that they swallow.After the age of three, kids are able to spit the full amount of toothpaste, especially if they were used to brushing. However, they will still need to use baby toothpaste, which has a lower percentage of fluoride.;
, There are special toothpastes and toothbrushes that are designed for use by children. These come in bright colors, diverse flavors, and easy-to-handle sizes. Look in your local grocery store, drug store, or pharmacy for branded children’s supplies.


Fluoride toothpaste is recommended for babies and children. You can find some child-friendly toothpastes in your local drug store, pharmacy, or grocery store.Children should use toothbrushes with soft bristles. This will be labeled on the package.
Use small, child-sized toothbrushes instead of adult toothbrushes. These will fit in children’s small mouths and move around their growing teeth more easily.

, When teaching your child to brush their teeth, you may find that they are struggling to remember everything. Break the process down into easy steps that they can repeat every time they brush their teeth. You may find that your children learn more quickly when you brush your teeth with them. As you go through each step, demonstrate how to do it.For example, you can say, “First, we squeeze our toothpaste. This how much we squeeze. Next, we move the brush around our teeth. Last, we spit out!” Show them as you tell them. Always supervise kids when they are brushing and make sure that they do every step as you explained.

, Children should continue brushing for two or three minutes.It might be tempting for a child to stop after a few seconds, so you should find ways to encourage them to keep brushing. An easy way to do this is to set a timer on your phone. Tell them that they must keep brushing until the timer goes off.


Another way to do this is to sing or play a song that lasts two or three minutes. Your child should brush for the full length of the song. Some toothbrushes will even play music for you. Your child is supposed to brush their teeth as long as the music plays.

, As soon as your baby's teeth start touching each other, you should start flossing.When they are old enough to follow directions, you can teach them how to floss themselves. Hold the floss tightly between both hands, and gently work it up between the teeth towards the gumline. Do not snap the floss into the gums because you may cause pain or even a small amount of bleeding that can scare your child enough to refuse flossing next time., Some children may be difficult to coerce into brushing their teeth twice a day. One way that you can encourage them is to let them make choices about their dental care.There are many ways that you can incorporate this into their routine.


When you buy them new toothbrushes, let them decide which one they get. There are many different designs for children, and they may be excited to use a toothbrush that they picked out themselves.
Buy a few flavors of toothpaste. When it is time to brush their teeth, ask, “Do you want the bubblegum flavored toothpaste or the grape flavored toothpaste?”

Eat something cold.,
Drink a hot beverage like coffee or tea.,
Sip a sweet or sugary beverage.,
Breathe in some cold air.,
Tap your teeth together.",How to Identify if You Have Sensitive Teeth1," Pick something mild to start. Eventually the colder temperatures may find a way through your tooth's enamel down to the dentin, cause some pain, and magnify the teeth sensitivity.


Try some ice cream as a starting point to see if the temperature affects you.
Chomp a popsicle, something dense enough for a hard bite, for a great next step.
Consider something harder, like ice chips, a texture that will definitely be cold long enough to test for issues.;
, Hot foods cause tooth pain because they heat the gasses produced by bacteria in the teeth. When heated, gasses expand and create pressure, causing internal tooth pain.

, The sugars in the drinks contact the dentin and the result is a fluid loss in the tooth, a consequential pressure change, and then a sharp pain. The same painful osmosis process can be caused by juicy, acidic fruits. You could also try chocolate, which can melt between your teeth and stimulate nerves inside your dentin.

, If you wince when breathing in sharply, your problem could be sensitive teeth. The air, particularly through pursed lips, is colder and might be shooting through the microscopic tubes in the dentin in your teeth.

, Gently. When teeth hit sharply against one another, it's possible to feel anything from a mild twinge to agony all the way into the nerve endings because of either direct contact with exposed dentin or forceful vibrations.You do not want to crack or chip your teeth, but when teeth normally collide in the mouth there could be some pain if dentin is exposed.


A similar type of pain may appear when a wisdom tooth starts growing and generates force throughout the bone, all the way up to the front teeth.

Rinse the mouth.,
Apply pressure.,
Use a cold compress.",How to Heal a Cut in Your Mouth1," If the cut in your mouth is bleeding, start by rinsing your mouth with cool water. Swish the water around in your mouth, making sure to swish it around the area with the cut. This helps remove the blood and help to stop the bleeding., If rinsing your mouth doesn’t stop the bleeding, you can apply pressure to the cut with a piece of gauze. Gently press against the cut for a few minutes to stop the bleeding., Pressing a cold compress or ice against the bleeding cut can also help stop the bleeding. Wrap the ice in a cloth and put it against the cut. This helps reduce inflammation and constrict the blood vessels, which will help stop the bleeding."

Respond quickly to an allergic reaction.,
Treat mouth infections.,
Make an appointment if you do not know the cause.,
Check on swelling and pain each day.,
Clean the area.,
Apply cold on the day of the injury.,
Switch to warm compresses.,
Take over the counter painkillers.,
Stay hydrated.,
Protect your lips with lip balm or chap stick.,
Keep the lip uncovered and pressure-free.,
Eat a healthy diet.,
Check your teeth and lips after an injury.,
Disinfect with salt water.,
Apply cold and hot compresses.",How to Heal a Swollen Lip," Some swollen lips are caused by allergic reactions, which can be fatal. Seek medical care right away if this has never happened to you before, if your lips are severely swollen, if it affects your breathing, or if you throat swells. If you've had similar allergic reactions in the past and know that these are mild symptoms, take an antihistamine, and keep your inhaler or epinephrine shot nearby.If the reaction was caused by an insect bite, seek emergency services immediately.If you're not sure what caused the swelling, take precautions as though it were an allergic reaction. In many cases, the cause of the allergic reaction is never discovered.
""Mild"" cases can still last several days. Visit a doctor if the swelling hasn't disappeared by then.;
, If your lips also have blisters, cold sores, swollen glands, or flu-like symptoms, you may have a mouth infection, most commonly the herpes simplex virus. Visit a doctor for a diagnosis and prescription antiviral or antibiotic medication. In the meantime, avoid touching your lips, kissing, oral sex, and sharing food, drink, or towels., If you don't know what caused the swelling, see a doctor to find out. This is especially important if it does not reduce within a few days. Here are a few possibilities:


Severe swelling during pregnancy may be a sign of pre-eclampsia. This is a serious condition, so visit the doctor right away.
Anti-depressants, hormone treatments, and blood pressure medication may lead to swelling.
Heart failure, kidney failure, and liver failure usually lead to more widespread swelling, not just the lip.

, If the swelling persists after two or three days, please see a doctor. If the pain suddenly increases, see a doctor.

, While your lip is swollen and sore, it is vulnerable to injury. Sponge it with water gently, several times a day or whenever it gets dirty. Do not pick at it or wipe it.


If the lip swelled after an injury, especially a fall, disinfect it with an antiseptic.
If the lip is swollen due to a piercing, follow the advice from the person who did the procedure. Don't take the piercing in and out unnecessarily. Wash your hands before you handle it.
Do not clean with rubbing alcohol, which can make it worse.

, Wrap ice in a towel, or use an ice pack from the freezer. Place it gently on your swollen lip. This will reduce swelling for a recent injury. After the first few hours, cold is not typically effective, except to relieve pain.


If you don't have ice, freeze a spoon for 5-15 minutes and put that on your swollen lip. Alternatively, suck on a popsicle.

, After the initial swelling is done, warmth may encourage healing. Heat water until hot, but still cool enough to touch. Dip a towel in the water, then wring out the excess. Hold it to your lips for 10 minutes. Repeat once an hour, several times a day or until swelling reverses.

, Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are medications that decrease pain and swelling. The most common over-the-counter variants are acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and naproxen.

, Drink plenty of water to keep your lips hydrated and avoid further cracking or swelling.

, These treatments moisturize your lips, preventing further cracking and drying.


There are many ways to make your own lip balm. Try combining 2 parts coconut oil, 2 parts olive oil, 2 parts grated beeswax, and a few drops of essential oil for scent.
In a pinch, just dab your lips with coconut oil or aloe vera gel.
Avoid balms that contain camphor, menthol, or phenol.Use petroleum jelly sparingly, as it may cause health issues in large quantities, and may not add much additional moisture.

, Pressure can cause more injury and a lot more pain. Try to keep the bruised area free and exposed to air.


If chewing food hurts, healing will take much longer. Replace some of your diet with healthy smoothies and protein shakes, through a straw.

, Stay away from salty, high-sodium foods, which can encourage swelling.In general, a healthy diet with enough vitamin and proteins may aid recovery.


Avoid acidic foods, which may cause pain.

, If you hit your mouth, check for injuries. If your teeth are loose, see a dentist right away. If you have deep cuts, visit a doctor. He may sew the wound closed to prevent scarring, or give you a tetanus shot.

, Dissolve 1 tbsp (15mL) salt in 1 cup (240mL) warm water. Dip a cotton swab or towel into the water, then dab the cut lightly. This will sting at first, but it reduces the risk of infection.

, As described above, an ice cube or ice pack wrapped in a towel will reduce swelling on the day of the injury. Once initial swelling is over, switch to warm, wet towels to stimulate blood flow and healing. Hold either type of compress to your lips for ten minutes, then leave it off for one hour before your next use.

Find a pediatric dentist.,
Schedule two visits a year.,
Sit with your child during the cleaning.,
Get sealants applied.,
Ask the dentist questions before agreeing to sedation.,
Give them a prize afterwards.",How to Keep Kids' Teeth Strong2," While adult dentists can treat children, it is better to find a dentist that specializes in cleaning children’s teeth. Not only can they help prevent common childhood issues but they will be able to calm down and relax a crying or distressed child. The American Association of Pediatric Dentists offers a search tool on their website to help parents locate a nearby specialist.Pediatric dentists also have a fully equipped dental office specifically for kids, which includes toys, colorful dental chairs, and even cartoons on a TV screen.

, Children should have their teeth cleaned and checked every six months. It may be easier to schedule these visits in advance so that you do not forget. If you have multiple children, you might try to schedule them all at the same time.

, Many children are frightened of the dentist. Sitting beside them and holding their hand may ease their anxiety. When you first go into the dentist, follow your child back into the examination room. Introduce your child to the dentist, and have the dentist show the child all of their tools beforehand. The dentist might even explain what they are used for. This can help calm your child’s fears before the cleaning begins.In some cases, you may need to sit on the chair and hold your child in your arms.

, Sealants are coatings applied by the dentist to prevent cavities from developing on the molars. Your child’s first molars will appear around age six. At this time, you can ask your child’s dentist if they can apply sealants to these teeth. While this does not replace brushing their teeth, it can prevent some cavities from developing, especially if your child eats a lot of candies and sugars., It is more and more common for dentists to use sedation during normal cleanings to help relax the patient. Your dentist might recommend it if your child is crying or fidgeting during their cleaning. It may also be given before a major procedure. While it can be safe for children to be sedated, you should have a serious talk with the dentist first. You should ask:“Before coming to the office, what do we need to do to prepare for the sedation? Does my child need to stop eating or drinking?”
“If something goes wrong, does your staff have training in emergency resuscitation procedures? How often do they renew their training?”
“What kind of sedation are you giving my child and how will this affect him or her afterwards?”
“How should I monitor my child after the procedure?”
“Who should I call if there is a problem afterwards?”

, Going to the dentist can be stressful for children. Some dentists give children a small prize pack after they are done. You might find it helps to incentivize your child with a small toy, keychain, or sticker to praise them for handling the appointment well."
"
Limit sugary snacks.,
Serve well-rounded meals.,
Give water instead of sugary drinks.,
Choose foods that strengthen tooth enamel.",How to Keep Kids' Teeth Strong3," The bacteria that causes cavities feeds on sugar in the mouth. To help prevent cavities, make sure that your child is not eating snacks high in added sugar. Read the nutrition labels of all prepacked foods to see how many grams of sugar it contains per serving. You can:


Choose cheese sticks instead of gummy fruit snacks.
Give your child oatmeal and fruit for breakfast instead of sugary breakfast cereals.
Buy natural, full-fat yogurt or Greek yogurt. Fat-free yogurt often contains more sugar.

, A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, dairy, and lean proteins will ensure both your child’s dental health and general health. While most foods contain sugar, you can limit the intake of these sugars by ensuring that they receive other vital nutrients as well.Besides the healthy advantages that natural food brings for the entire body and development of your child, they also keep your gums and teeth protected. They do this by stimulating the blood flow and bone development through the force required for chewing harder foods compared to processed food, which is soft.


Half of what your child eats should either be fruits or vegetables.
Whole grains include whole wheat bread, oatmeal, or brown rice.
Lean proteins include fish, eggs, beans, and lean cuts of chicken and beef.
Dairy includes milk, cheese, and yogurt.

, Children take in a ton of sugar from their drinks. Soda, juice, and sport drinks all contain high levels of sugar. Many of these drinks also contain acid that can break down tooth enamel. Your child should be drinking primarily water to prevent tooth decay.


If your child is still bottle feeding, only put milk, formula, or breastmilk in the bottle. Do not give them juice.Instead of juice, give your child whole fruit. Whole fruit has fiber that can scrub the teeth as you eat it., Certain foods can help keep tooth enamel strong. These foods tend to be high in either vitamin K, calcium, or protein—all of which are essential for strong bones. Cheese in particular is a great snack because it encourages saliva production and can strengthen enamel.Some other good foods include:


Milk
Dark, leafy vegetables like spinach and kale
Tofu
Meat
Eggs"

Make the child wear protective gear during sports.,
Save the tooth if it is knocked out.,
Treat pain with homemade remedies.,
Avoid using too much fluoride.",How to Keep Kids' Teeth Strong4," If your child plays sports or if they enjoy activities like biking or skateboarding, they should wear the proper protection. Mouthguards protect your child’s teeth from sudden impact, preventing the loss of teeth during an accident.You can get their dentist to create a specially fitted guard, or you can buy a “boil and bite” guard at a sports store., If your child does lose a permanent tooth, you can try to put it back in its socket, but it may not stay. In that case, you should save the tooth in a cup of milk or saline solution, and take the child to a dentist. No matter what you do, go to a dentist or emergency room immediately. Bring the tooth with you., If your child has a toothache or sore gums, you should call the dentist for an appointment. In the meantime, you can help reduce your child’s discomfort by using a few safe at-home remedies.


Mix a teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water. Have your child swish this in their mouth without swallowing. After 30 seconds, they can spit it out. This can help reduce pain in their teeth and gums.For a toothache, apply a few drops of clove oil to a cotton ball. Gently rub the oil against the sore tooth. An over-the-counter medication, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, can stop severe pain. Use a pain reliever marked as safe for children, and follow the instructions on the box carefully., Too much fluoride can cause a condition called enamel fluorosis. The condition can produce problems like discoloration and pitting. While fluoride toothpaste is necessary to prevent cavities, you should use no more than a pea-sized amount when your child is brushing their teeth."

Find any buildup of plaque or tartar on your teeth.,
Detect tooth decay.,
Gander at your gums.,
Check for cavities.,
Examine your fillings to identify any potential problems.,
Check for chips.",How to Identify if You Have Sensitive Teeth2," Plaque is accumulation of food byproducts and proteins in your mouth, and tartar is hardened plaque. The most common sign of plaque/tartar is a yellow or brown color to teeth or gums, but there are some tests that can be done at home to easily identify plaque buildup., It usually does not cause symptoms until you have a cavity or an infected tooth, but noticeable dark spots or white spots may be tooth decay. When this occurs, a toothache is the most common symptom, but dentists have a variety of high-tech methods, like fluorescent light, magnifying glasses, and intraoral cameras, to find problems., Gingivitis is basically redness or swelling of the gums. If left untreated it can turn into periodontal disease, with gums that become infected and pull away from teeth.If this fits you, your teeth may not just be sensitive, but they may also begin to loosen!

, Cavities are holes or structural damage in the teeth. There may be no symptoms, as cavities can be quite small. If symptoms occur, however, they may include: Pain, visible pits or holes in the teeth, or bad breath.Those little holes may be asymptomatic now, but could worsen and lead to sensitivity.

, Through biting and chewing actions, old fillings can crack at varying times. Look for a darker circle surrounding the filling, which is usually the sign of bacterial infiltration. Also look for deep fillings; they may be irritating the tooth's nerve and causing pain. Deep fillings can also cause a crack in the tooth structure that may even break your tooth, if you have a particularly powerful bite.

, Broken or chipped teeth obviously go beyond decay and can expose pulp - the home of nerves within the teeth beneath enamel and dentin - causing severe pain and sensitivity.Visit the dentist as soon as possible, before the chips/breaks cause significant sensitivity.

"
"
Brush your teeth.,
Stop using whitening/bleaching products.,
Cease grinding your teeth.,
Review your calendar.,
Diagnose your diet.",How to Identify if You Have Sensitive Teeth3," If you feel your pulse rate quickening, or your bicep flexing, you might be brushing too hard. Enamel is broken down via ""toothbrush abrasion"" and exposes dentin. If you're brushing vigorously, it could lead to increased tooth sensitivity and receding gums., Teeth whitening products often use hydrogen peroxide which wears down the enamel and could penetrate into any existing decay or inner areas of the tooth.Aside from potential pain and sensitivity, whitening does not affect various dental restorations such as crowns or porcelain veneers, which could cause multi-colored teeth, negating any vanity aspects of the procedure.

, Symptoms vary according to the nature, frequency and duration of excessive clenching and grinding. Aside from general sensitivity, grinding can include pain in the teeth, chronic muscular facial pain with tension headaches, flattened tooth surfaces, micro fractures of the tooth enamel, broken or chipped teeth, pain in the jaw joint that cause restricted opening and difficult chewing.If grinding is an old habit, you might usually have an increased development of the masseter and temporal muscles that change the look of your face, making your face seem muscular and always tense.

, Post dental treatment sensitivity can be created by inflammation and very subtle movement within and between teeth. If you recently had a procedure done at the dentist, there is a possibility of sensitivity., Acidic foods and drinks (e.g. tomatoes, pickles, fruits, soda) can wear down enamel if consumed regularly and in abundance.They may also be the culprits behind some acid reflux, which can also erode enamel."

Use an ointment.,
Gargle with salt water.,
Use honey.,
Try apple cider vinegar.,
Make a baking soda paste.",How to Heal a Cut in Your Mouth2," You can buy antibiotic ointments that are made to treat oral sores. These ointments will not only help heal the cut, but many also contain pain relievers. They can also reduce swelling at the site of the wound.When using oral ointments, make sure to read the directions carefully.

, Using salt water is one of the most common ways to heal a mouth cut. Mix a teaspoon of salt to one cup of warm water. Stir until the salt is completely dissolved. Swish the solution around in your mouth, making sure you pay close attention to the area with the cut.Salt has antiseptic properties that can clean the cut., Honey is an antibacterial and antiseptic substance that can help boost the immune system.Applying honey onto the cuts in your mouth can help kill bacteria, heal the wound, and reduce pain. Place raw honey onto the cut once each day., Apple cider vinegar has natural antiseptic and antibacterial properties.This can help kill any bacteria in the cut and help promote healing. Dab apple cider vinegar on the cut twice each day until it is healed., Baking soda has antibacterial properties.This can help kill bacteria in the cut in your mouth and promote healing. Make a paste with one teaspoon of baking soda and water. Place the paste on the cut two to three times each day.You can also try brushing your teeth with the baking soda paste, but avoid brushing the wounded area or else you may hurt it and cause it to start bleeding again.

"
Avoid spicy or hard foods.,
Stay hydrated.,
Stay away from mouthwashes that contain alcohol.,
Limit the movement of your mouth.,
Use wax to prevent cuts and reduce pain if you have braces.",How to Heal a Cut in Your Mouth3," Certain foods may irritate the cut in your mouth. Don’t eat anything that is extremely spicy or salty, since this can sting and cause pain. You should also avoid eating hard or dry foods. Instead, eat soft foods that won’t irritate the tissues in your mouth.You can try to eat dairy products such as ice cream, tender meats, and cooked vegetables.
Avoid acidic foods, like tomatoes and citrus fruits.

, By drinking a lot of fluids, you will keep your mouth wet. A dry mouth can cause pain and irritate the cut in your mouth. Avoid beverages that may cause pain, like citrus fruit juices or acidic beverages.You should avoid alcoholic beverages because they can cause burning.

, Don’t rinse with mouthwashes that contain alcohol because they may damage the wounded tissues in your mouth and inhibit the healing process. Instead, try rinsing with hydrogen peroxide if you have a mouth sore.If you want to gargle with a mouthwash, use only non-alcoholic ones.

, You can’t stop talking and using your mouth, but be more careful with the way you use your mouth while a cut is healing. Don’t open your mouth too wide. This can pull on the tissues inside of the mouth and open the cut again or delay the healing process., Apply orthodontic wax to the sharp outer areas of your brackets that tend to irritate the inside of your mouth. This will reduce your pain by limiting the irritation on the cut and will also prevent future cuts."

Educate yourself about the disease.,
Communicate openly.,
Notice changes in emotion.,
Visit a support group.",How to Help Someone Cope With Parkinson's Disease1," Parkinson's effects and treatment can be complex. Learn as much as you can from the patient's doctor, Parkinson's support groups, or books, and share what you learn with your loved one as well.

The National Parkinson's Foundation, American Parkinson's Disease Association, and The Michael J. Fox Foundation are excellent resources for Parkinson's patients and their families.;
, Some people with Parkinson's keep their diagnosis a secret for a while, while others are more open. Do your part by communicating openly. Don't treat the diagnosis like a secret or an embarrassment. Instead, embrace it as the key to getting the information you and your loved one need to cope.Encourage your loved one to express their emotions. Encouraging positivity doesn't mean burying the more painful feelings. If they say ""I'm frightened,"" you can say ""I hear you"" instead of ""Everything will be fine!""
The better the relationship between the person with Parkinson's and their primary caregiver, the better the outlook in terms of depression and physical health. If you are loving, caring, and concerned, you are helping.
This doesn't mean you should neglect yourself! Be open about how you are feeling, and make sure you get the care you need.

, Depression is a clinical symptom of Parkinson's, and the sufferer should report it to their doctor. If you notice that someone with Parkinson's has grown withdrawn, moody, or sad, let them know. Tell anyone else involved in their care what you have observed.Parkinson's causes a deficiency in dopamine, so any mood shifts are a possible sign of a change in that department.
The doctor will likely want to treat the depression with medication if it is diagnosed.
Offer to go with the doctor with them if they will let you.

, There are support groups for those with Parkinson's and for their caregivers, to attend either separately or together. These can be of great benefit for you both. Parkinson's can lead to feelings of isolation, and caring for someone with Parkinson's can be mentally depleting and socially isolating as well. Try going together or separately. Ask your doctor about local groups.Online forums can also be helpful—search for one that you like.

Make safety changes to the home.,
Attend doctor's visits.,
Ask about drug treatments.,
Keep a schedule, but expect it to change.,
Support the independence of your loved one.,
Start movement therapy early.,
Talk to the patient's doctor and dietitian about nutritional needs.,
Get compression stockings to prevent dizziness.,
Seek ongoing support.",How to Help Someone Cope With Parkinson's Disease2," Since the disease becomes progressively more severe, take precautions in advance to lower the risk of falls:


Free up floors from clutter and remove loose rugs. If your loved one finds it difficult to walk smoothly on thick floor rugs, replace them with thin carpet or solid flooring.
Install safety rails, raised toilet seats, and tub chairs. Grab bars are especially important next to the toilet and in the shower. Install a non-skid mat in the shower.
Stabilize furniture so it won't tip over when grabbed for support.Remove tall lamps, floor vases, side tables, and other unstable furniture.

, As long as your loved one allows, attend doctor's visits with them. It is hard for someone with Parkinson's to notice all the changes they are going through, or to remember everything they are instructed to do at the appointment. Go along, and take notes., Parkinson medication can be complex, and what works for one person may not work for another. Options include levodopa, dopamine agonists, COMT inhibitors, and MAO-B inhibitors. Talk to your loved one and to the doctor regularly about how the treatment is going. Don't hesitate to ask the doctor about alternatives or to bring up concerns you have with the current treatment.

If these treatments are not effective enough or if the disease progresses to the late stages, there are several surgical treatments available as well., When someone is going through Parkinson's, there's a lot to fit in: medications, doctor's visits, exercise routines…and the ordinary social events and chores that make up normal life. Keep extra time in your schedule whenever you are planning activities that involve your loved one, as they will experience fluctuations in mood and energy which can make it hard to schedule some activities in advance., It's important to let Parkinson's sufferers do what they are capable of doing. Taking over all tasks for fear they might slip up can make it worse for them. Keep an eye on how they are doing, but do let them self-direct as normal until it becomes too dangerous.Before you offer help, ask. Especially in the early stages, ask for permission before touching or otherwise guiding someone with Parkinson's.

, Exercise, physical therapy, and activity is helpful for those with Parkinson's, and the earlier it starts, the better. Cardiopulmonary fitness is crucial: exercises like treadmills walking at varying inclines, hiking with walking sticks, and swimming (with a variety of strokes) are excellent choices.Exercise that includes changes of tempo or action is beneficial for the cognitive maintenance of those with Parkinson's. Suggest that your loved one try walking in public places, doing yoga or Tai Chi, and taking classes where an instructor leads them through a series of exercises.

, There is not yet evidence of a specific ""Parkinson's diet"" that will help all patients, but a healthier diet may improve overall well-being and make it easier to cope.With medical advice, you can also explore possible dietary changes to treat certain problems. For example:

If medication causes constipation, increase fiber and fluid intake.
Levodopa or L-dopa, a common Parkinson's drug, may not be absorbed properly if taken with protein. If the patient is prescribed L-dopa, talk to their doctor about eating protein at certain times of day, or in smaller amounts. Do not change the diet without checking with the doctor.There have been many studies suggesting a link between diet and Parkinson's, but few clear results. Talk to the patient's doctor about the latest medical research.

, Mid- to late-stage Parkinson's can cause a sudden drop in blood pressure when the patient stands up.This condition, called orthostatic hypotension, can cause dizziness or even fainting, potentially leading to a bad fall. Wearing compression stockings or abdominal binders while sitting or lying down can help by preventing blood from pooling into the patient's legs.The patient's doctor can suggest additional treatments if this is still a problem.

, The person with Parkinson's will experience new challenges and find new ways to cope with them. In addition to continuing exercise, social interaction, and medical treatments, it may help to seek counseling support, or alternative therapies such as acupuncture or meditation.

Do not take herbal remedies without consulting a doctor first. Some herbal remedies may interfere with medication.

Check in regularly.,
Offer to join in on walks and social activities.,
Do what you used to do.,
Make long-term plans.",How to Help Someone Cope With Parkinson's Disease3," Someone with Parkinson's may be experiencing changes frequently, and may not even notice all of them. If you check in regularly, you'll get a good sense of how they are changing. Try calling or stopping by once a week if you are a friend, or come by every day if you are closer and your schedule permits (as long as this many visits are welcome!).


If you do notice concerning changes, or see new difficulties that could be solved with adjustments to the household, do mention what you see to the person with Parkinson's or to a caretaker.
Look for new needs. If your friend can no longer drive, offer to drive them to appointments or to the grocery store.

, People with Parkinson's benefit from walking and walking-based exercises. Depending on how they are doing, they may be able to hike, walk in a mall, or walk very slowly. In the latter scenario, you may have to help them at some points or just be patient as they put one foot in front of another.Social interaction is also beneficial.

, Insofar as a friend or loved one with Parkinson's is still capable, keep inviting them to do what you did before. They may need extra support to do it, so make changes to accommodate this!

, The course of the disease varies from person to person, but generally starts with mild symptoms. It can eventually progress to the most advanced stage, that may leave the person bed- and wheelchair-bound. Make plans in advance so the transition, if it comes, is less stressful."

Don’t fear modern orthodontics.",How to Improve Childhood Dental Habits," If “do as I say, not as I do” ever actually works as a parenting technique, it’s certainly not when dealing with dental care. If you don’t set a good example when it comes to taking care of your teeth, you will have a far more difficult time convincing your kids how important it is for them.Beyond simply being a good role model by brushing regularly and visiting the dentist, a parent with poor dental health is more likely to transmit tooth-harming bacteria when sharing food, drinks, utensils, or even kisses.Also, if you need yet another reason to quit smoking, research indicates that secondhand smoke may contribute to tooth decay and other mouth problems, which can even lead to oral or throat cancer.;
, The term “dental home” refers to a home setting where good dental care is prioritized and practiced by the entire family, with the assistance of a dental professional. It’s never too late to make your home a “dental home,” but the sooner, the better.Creating a ""dental home"" starts with a baby's first visit, ideally by his or her first birthday. Make regular checkups for the entire family a standard practice, and following the dentist's care recommendations a common procedure. Everyone in the home should embrace and encourage good dental habits, and set good examples for each other. Oral hygiene should be implemented just as regularly and enthusiastically as bodily hygiene is.
If a child only ever knows a home in which good dental habits are practised, it will seem like second nature. Compare it to how readily most people born in the last thirty years or so wear seatbelts, as opposed to the ongoing resistance by some of those who grew up before seatbelt use became the norm.

, Eating healthy is good for every part of your body, including your teeth. Excessive consumption of sugary and/ or sticky foods like cookies, candy, sodas, and juices are among the most common causes of childhood tooth decay.When preparing meals at home or school lunches, prioritize tooth-healthy foods like raw vegetables and fruits, lowfat but high-calcium dairy products, and water.While fruit juice seems like a healthy drink option, it can contribute to tooth decay by depositing sugars on the teeth. Try to limit overall daily intake of acidic juices (like orange or grapefruit) in particular, and avoid constant sips from a juice cup or box throughout the day., Kids are more likely to accept something and keep up with it if they feel like active participants in the process. While good childhood dental care requires close adult supervision and guidance, there are ways in which you can give a child a greater sense of control.Take your child to the store and let him or her choose a toothbrush and toothpaste (from the age-appropriate categories). Manufacturers love to put popular cartoon characters on kids’ dental care items.
Create a weekly ""tooth care"" chart and post it in a conspicuous location. Use stickers or checkmarks with colorful markers to denote a successful brushing or flossing. Let the child mark off each success, tally up the week's results, and help determine an appropriate reward or prize.
Some toothbrush manufacturers even provide you with timers that can help kids see how long they should be brushing their teeth.

, Even if they won’t be visible for several months, babies have teeth hidden beneath the surface even before they are born. It’s really never too early to set the habit (for the child and yourself) of regularly cleaning the gums and the teeth that will eventually emerge.You can gently wipe an infant’s gums with a soft washcloth dampened by water, or try gum- and toothbrushes designed for infants.
If you are fortunate enough to have a small child that sleeps through the night, don’t put him or her to bed with a bottle of formula (or, later on, juice or milk — breast milk is fine, however). As with older children, allowing sugars to sit on the teeth and gums overnight supports tooth decay. Clean the teeth and gums after the last feeding and before bedtime whenever possible., The old advice still holds true — everyone, including children, should brush their teeth twice a day, in the morning and in the evening. For children especially, make brushing a set part of the daily schedule — right after breakfast and before getting dressed for school, or right after bathtime and before story time. Make it so that they will remind you when it is time to brush teeth.While it is ideal to brush your teeth last thing before bedtime, with kids it may be better to move the process a bit earlier, before they get tired and cranky. Brush after the last serving of food or drink (other than water), though.

, Growing kids want to do everything for themselves, and it is good to give them some autonomy when it comes to dental care. However, young children require proper instruction, direct assistance, and close supervision when brushing or flossing. This ensures both safety and good technique.


Children should start using a rice-grain sized amount of toothpaste around age two, and move up to a pea-size amount at three or four. A three year old may be ready to start brushing him or herself, but only under close supervision. Kids shouldn’t brush without supervision until at least age six.Demonstrate proper brushing technique on your own teeth and your child’s. Use a soft bristle brush, a small amount of toothpaste, angle the brush slightly, and use gentle back and forth strokes.Start flossing a child’s teeth as soon as there are two teeth next to each other. Supervise flossing the same as with brushing. Kid-friendly flossing sticks may be preferable to traditional string floss.

, Good oral health care is serious business, but that doesn’t mean you can’t have a good time with it. Use games, songs, stories, or whatever else makes brushing time fun for your kids.A tooth-brushing session should last two minutes. Use a clock, a timer, an hourglass, or one of many digital apps that play songs or provide some other form of entertainment for the 120 seconds. Or, just see how many times you can sing “Row, Row, Row Your Boat” in two minutes while your child brushes.
Always offer praise when your child remembers to brush and completes the task. Offer simple rewards like stickers or even just big checkmarks on a weekly brushing chart. But don’t offer candy!, It may not seem like your highest priority when you can barely get your teen out of bed in time for school, but proper dental care for teens is at least as important as it is for smaller children. Remember (and remind them) that the permanent teeth that have replaced their baby teeth are the last ones they get. Not properly caring for these teeth at the start will greatly reduce the likelihood of their remaining strong and healthy for decades to come.Appeal to their vanity. Few teens want to walk around with yellow teeth or bad breath. Try not to lecture or preach, but provide subtle reminders about the importance of a healthy, good-looking, good-smelling mouth.
Consider enlisting the dentist to help. Often teens will listen to an impartial authority figure far more readily than to a parent.
Teens are too old for ""kids' stuff"" dental products and may find adult versions too boring or old-fashioned. Not surprisingly, manufacturers have noticed this and have begun to market dental products geared toward teens. Let them choose the products that appeal to them.

, Some parents may assume that children do not need to see a dentist until most if not all of their baby teeth have emerged. In truth, professionals recommend that children see a dentist as early as the eruption of the first tooth and no later than the first birthday. From that initial visit, the standard recommendation is to return every six months.Beyond the oral health benefits of visiting a dentist early in a child’s life, the likelihood of developing a fear of going to the dentist will be reduced. As with brushing and flossing, if regular visits to the dentist are the norm from the beginning of a child’s life, there is likely to be less trepidation or defiance., Any qualified dentist can care for a child’s teeth, but some dentists are particularly skilled at working with kids. Some specifically practice pediatric dentistry, while others offer a general practice with a kid-friendly atmosphere. It can pay to do a little research — make some calls, ask some friends, etc. — before choosing a dentist for your child.“Kid-friendly” doesn’t necessarily have to mean toys in the waiting room, posters of cartoon teeth on the walls, and prizes at the end of a visit (although these can help). Look for a dentist with the experience and demeanor suited to dealing with the distinctive elements of childhood dental care and to interacting with kids in general.
Don’t be afraid to change dentists if you feel like you can find a better-suited alternative for your child. A good dentist needs to have patience and maintain a calm demeanor during the procedures.

, Especially as they get a little older, some children may question why they need to go to the dentist when their teeth don’t hurt. Try to explain in simple terms what happens at a dental exam and cleaning, and why it is important. Seek out assistance from the dentist when possible — he or she may have kid-friendly videos, booklets, etc.An older child may have questions about the use of fluoride, and so may you. Some people advocate against the the widespread use of fluoride (especially its addition to public water supplies), but dental professionals by and large strongly support the use of fluoride in drinking water, toothpaste, applications done at the office, and sometimes supplements. Don’t hesitate to ask the dentist about the importance of adequate fluoride usage.

, The days of teens going through years with a mouth full of conspicuous metal braces are almost entirely in the past. Modern orthodontic devices are much less obtrusive and usually more targeted in application. They also tend to be applied earlier in a child’s life.Don’t let bad memories from you own childhood, or uninformed assumptions made by your child, prevent him or her from getting an orthodontic device that might save years of pain and embarrassment down the road. Once again, lean on the dentist for support in explaining the lasting importance of these short-term devices.

Your doctor can advise you if you are healthy enough to use FMD for your symptoms. They can also work with your specialist and/or a dietician to coordinate intermittent fasting you’re your treatment plan.Tell your doctor that you’re interested in trying FMD to ease your MS symptoms. Ask any questions that you may have about fasting with MS or your treatments. They will discuss the pros and cons of this type of diet for you.For example, “Dr. Maier, I was wondering about trying fasting to ease my symptoms. Do you think this could work for me along with my other treatments?”
Recognize that your doctor may suggest avoiding FMD if you have certain medical conditions in addition to your MS. Intermittent fasting may not be ideal if you have diabetes or intestinal issues.;
, If you see an MS specialist in addition to your doctor, discuss your interest in using an FMD with them. Your specialist may have specific tips or advice on using FMD in conjunction with other treatments.Discuss your regular doctor’s suggestions with your specialist. For example, “I had a chance to talk with Dr. Maier about trying FMD. He thinks it’s worth a go but wanted me to discuss it with you before we proceed.”

, In addition to your doctor(s), a registered dietician can give you tips on safely and effectively selecting low calorie foods that fill you and provide nutrients to get you through each fasting cycle. Having a dietician work with your doctors can also help ensure you get optimal treatments for your specific case of MS.Ask your doctor or specialist to recommend a dietician. You can also find a registered dietician through the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics online search tool at .
Let the dietician know any information that may help them create a safe FMD with you. This might include: medications you take, other conditions you have, your current eating habits, foods you like and dislike. For example, “I take Betaseron for my MS. I also have a mild case of diabetes. My doctors think it’s ok for me to try FMD, but would like for all of us to work together so I get the most benefits from the diet.”

, Although more testing is required, there are two common FMD plans for MS. One plan consists of limiting calories for five days per month and the other limiting calories for 6 days per month. You and your medical team can choose which one is the most realistic for your and your needs., You may not want to fast for three separate weekly cycles over the course of a month. Instead, you can get your fasting out of the way over the course of five days. Try this FMD over a course of three months, which may help you see more benefits. Eat the following calorie count over the course of your five chosen days:Day one: eat 1090 calories that includes a mixture of 56% good fats such as lean chicken or avocado and 34% unrefined carbohydrates such as vegetables or fruits. For example, you could have a mushroom and pepper egg white omelet and apple for breakfast, tuna with avocado for lunch, a Mexican cottage cheese salad for dinner.Days two through five: eat 725 calories that includes a mixture of 44% good fats and 34% carbohydrates such as vegetables or fruits. For example, you could have banana egg pancakes and nonfat yogurt for breakfast, a veggie Nori roll for lunch, and peaches and almond butter on toast for dinner.

, If you’re concerned about fasting-mimicking for five days, trying it for three cycles of seven days each. This means you would fast for two days over a seven day period and then repeat this two more times. Like the five day plan, you may also want to try “5,2” over the course of three months for additional benefits.Eat the following calorie counts if you want to do the “5,2” FMD:

Choose two fasting days per week. They don’t need to be consecutive.
Eat two meals on the days you choose to fast. Your first meal should equal about 200 calories and the second about 300 calories. This gives you a total of 500 calories for the days you’re fasting. For example, you could have high protein energy balls and oranges for one meal and a basic protein shake for the other.
Continue to eat healthy meals on the five days you’re not fasting. You don’t need to restrict calories, but avoid junk foods if possible.

, It can take anyone a little time to adjust to new eating habits. This is especially true if you are trying fasting for the first time. Recognizing that you may accidentally cheat or fall off the fasting wagon can help you start a new cycle of FMD when you are ready. Your body will eventually get used to fasting and it can have positive effects on your hunger and cravings as well as help ease your MS symptoms. In fact, your may find fasting days easier than regular days over time.Choose healthy foods as much as possible, which can help curb cravings for junk foods or those loaded with refined sugars.

, People often fear mood swings from fasting and this may happen to some people. But many people experience benefits to following an FMD that include easing your MS symptoms. Some of the benefits you may find as a result of intermittent fasting include:Weight loss
Improved lipid panels
Improved mood
Increase white blood “T” cells that are responsible for immunity, On the days you’re fasting, eat foods that are both low calorie and healthy. This can help you more easily get through the days without feeling too hungry while ensuring you’re getting proper nutrients to fuel your body.Some examples of foods you can eat on fasting days include:

Eggs
Tomato-based soups
Broth-based vegetable soups
Hummus
Whole wheat crackers
Avocado

, Many people are now fasting to get healthier. As a result, there are a wide array of cookbooks and websites with recipes and menus of 500 calories or less to use while fasting.Get a cookbook from a book retailer or look at the websites of chefs and other proponents of fasting. For example, Elly Pear and Angela Dowden have cookbooks and websites with tips and recipes for fasting.Ask your dietician if they know of any good recipes for fasting days.

, Having an idea of what you can and will eat on fasting days can help you stick to an FMD while getting its full benefits. Write a detail meal plan for each day and include total calorie counts to ensure you’re fasting properly and safely. You can easily find calorie counts for specific foods using online tools. You can also use online apps such as Eat This Much to help plan your meals.Write meal information for each day in a notebook or on your smartphone., Monday is the beginning of the week and can be stressful for many people. Consider making this one of your non-fasting days. For example, if you’re doing one week of “5,2”, your Monday plan might include:Breakfast: spinach, feta, and tomato omelet for breakfast
Lunch: kale salad with baked chicken
Vegetarian chili for dinner
Fresh berries for dessert

, You may have had a stressful start to the week. Try having a second non-fasting day on Tuesdays. Your meals might look like:Breakfast: bowl of granola and Greek yogurt with fresh berries
Lunch: tomato-basil-mozzarella Panini and mixed salad
Snack: apple with almond butter
Dinner: broiled salmon, baked potato, and steamed veggies

, Once you’ve had a chance to adjust to the week, have a fast day. Wednesday may be a good day to fast because it helps you get over the hump to enjoying a couple more days of your regular diet. Your Wednesday meals totaling 500 calories might include:Meal one: smoothie of ¼ cup each fresh and frozen blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, ½ banana, and ¼ avocado plus ¼ hard boiled egg for first meal = 187 calories.Meal two: one serving of smoked tofu kebabs with tzatziki and salad for second meal = 288 calories., You may feel hungry or even a bit weak after a day of fasting. Give your body a chance to bounce back on Thursday with sensible and healthy choices. Your meals might include:Breakfast: bagel with smoked salmon, capers, and light cream cheese
Lunch: two slices of homemade vegetable pizza and a small salad
Snack: hummus and pretzels
Dinner: Vietnamese pork pho

, It’s the weekend! Take your Friday to indulge and prepare for your next fasting day. A delicious Friday meal plan might look like:Breakfast: French toast with fresh berries and maple syrup
Lunch: big, mixed salad and hummus and crackers
Dinner: pasta with marinara sauce and steamed vegetables

, After two days of healthy meals, you may be ready for another day of fasting. Remember that you should only eat 500 calories over two meals. The Saturday fasting plan might include: First meal: one cup of cottage cheese with raspberries and one cup of strawberries = 207 calories
Second meal: 1.5 servings of vegetable, butter bean, and smoked paprika stew = 280 calories.

, The final day of the week can be a good time to rest and recharge. Choosing three healthy, non-fasting meals can help you replenish your energy. A Sunday meal plan might include:Breakfast: scrambled eggs with turkey bacon and home fries
Lunch: tomato soup with whole wheat grilled cheese
Snack: one cup of mixed berries
Dinner: baked chicken Parmesan with zucchini noodles and marinara sauce
Dessert: small slice of apple pie

The weak muscles are usually most noticeable in the torso area. The child may also appear to have floppy limbs or a floppy body. The baby may also have a weak or soft cry.This is usually apparent at birth or right after birth. The floppiness or weakened muscles may get better or go away after a few months.;
, Another common problem for children with PWS is feeding difficulties. The child may not be able to suck properly, so they will need assistance to feed. Because of the difficulties feeding, the child has slow growth development or a failure to grow.You may have to employ the use of feeding tubes or purchase special nipples to help the child suck properly.
This generally causes a difficulty for the infant to thrive.
These sucking problems may improve after a few months.

, As the child ages, they may experience rapid and excessive weight gain. This is generally due to problems with the pituitary gland and hormonal issues. The child may overeat, be hungry all the time, or have a food obsession, which adds to the weight gain.This generally occurs between ages one and six.
The child may end up classified as obese.

, Another symptom of PWS is abnormal facial features. This includes almond shaped eyes, thin upper lips, narrowing at the temples, and a down turning of the mouth. The child may also have an upturned nose., Another developmental symptom of PWS is delayed development of the sexual organs. Often children with PWS have hypogonadism, which means they have underactive testicles or ovaries. This causes a reduced development of their genitalia.In females, they may have abnormally small vaginal lips and clitoris. In males, they may have a small scrotum or penis.
They may have delayed or incomplete puberty.
This also can lead to infertility.

, Children with PWS may display the signs of developmental delays. This may present as a minor or moderate intellectual disability, or the child may have learning disabilities. They may not do common physical developmental tasks until much later, such as sitting or walking.The child may test at an IQ of 50 to 70.
Children may have difficulties with speech development.

, Reduced movement is a minor symptom of PWS. This may occur during pregnancy. The fetus may not have moved or kicked in the womb as much as normal. After the baby is born, he or she may display a lack of energy or extreme lethargy, which may be associated with a weak cry., If a child has PWS, they may have problems sleeping. They may be extremely sleepy during the day. They also may not sleep through the entire night, but experience disruptions while sleeping.The child may have sleep apnea.

, Children with Prader-Willi Syndrome may exhibit an array of behavior problems. They may throw excessive temper tantrums or be more stubborn than other kids. They may engage in lying or stealing, which is often related to food.The children may also show symptoms associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder, and even engage in actions like skin picking., There are a few physical symptoms that are minor criteria which help doctors diagnose PWS. Children with unusually fair, light, or pale hair, skin, or eyes are at a greater risk. Children may have crossed eyes or near-sightedness.The child may also show physical abnormalities, such as small or narrowed hands and feet. They also may be unusually short for their age.Children may have unusually thick or sticky saliva.

, Other less common symptoms may present in children with Prader-Willi Syndrome. This includes the inability to vomit and a high threshold for pain. They may have problems with their bones, such as scoliosis (a curvature of the spine) or osteoporosis (brittle bones).They may also have an early puberty because of abnormal activity in the adrenal glands.

, Doctors use the major and minor criteria to determine if Prader-Willi Syndrome is a possible condition for your child. Looking for these symptoms can help you determine if your child should be tested or examined by a doctor.For children two and under, a total of five points is needed to be tested. Three to four points must be from the major criteria symptoms, with the others coming from the minor symptoms.
Children three and over must score at least eight points. Four to five points need to be from the major symptoms., One good way to get your child diagnosed for Prader-Willi Syndrome early is to take them to their scheduled check ups after they are born. The doctor can track their development and start to notice any problems.During any of the visits during your child’s early years, the doctor may use the symptoms noticed during the exam to diagnose PWS.In these appointments, the doctor checks the child’s growth, weight, muscle tone and movement, genitals, and head circumference. The doctor also routinely monitors the child's development.
You should tell the doctor if your child has problems eating or sucking, if there are problems sleeping, or if they seem like they have less energy than they should.
If your child is older, tell your doctor about any food obsessions or habits of overeating you notice in your child.

, If the doctor suspects PWS, they will perform a genetic blood test. This blood test will confirm that your child has PWS. The test will look for abnormalities on chromosome 15. If there is a history of PWS in your family, you can also get prenatal testing to check your baby for PWS.The genetic test can also help you figure out if you may have other children with the same condition."

Think about how the twitch started.,
Consider if stress and anxiety play a role.,
Look for dietary causes.,
Consider drug and alcohol use.",How to Get Rid of a Long‐Term Nose or Mouth Twitch1," Do you remember where and when you first started noticing the twitch? Involuntary movements that originated in childhood have different causes and solutions than those that began in adulthood. Evaluate any and all environmental and situational factors, and make a list for reference in case you need to discuss the issue with a doctor.Doctors will evaluate your medical history and perform a physical examination to determine if the twitch is neurologic, medical, or psychiatric in origin.;
, Do you experience a nose or mouth twitch when you’re nervous? How do things like public speaking, talking to an authority figure, or similar stressful situations affect it? Is it more likely to happen when you’ve got a lot on your plate at work or in response to other anxiety triggers? What about other emotions, such as being amused, excited, or overjoyed?


Keep a journal to track when and where the tic happens.
Compare your notes on when it happens in the present to when and where you remember it happening in the past.
You may want to see a psychiatrist if the cause of your twitch is from stress and anxiety. He/she maybe able to help you with anti-anxiety medication in order to relieve stress.

, Dietary deficiencies, like lacks of magnesium, calcium, or potassium, can cause twitching. If you suspect that you’ve got some gaps in your diet, you should first see your primary care physician (PCP) or go to a clinic. A doctor can order a complete blood count and other standard tests to confirm any dietary issues.A dietary cause is a correctable medical cause of a twitch that can be treated by taking care of the underlying condition.

, Do you drink a lot of coffee, smoke cigarettes, or drink alcohol? Are you prescribed any medication? Stimulants like caffeine and prescription drugs can cause involuntary movements, as can withdrawal from alcohol and nicotine."
"
Get your diet on track.,
Get plenty of sleep.,
Work on reducing stress.,
Try willfully suppressing your tic.",How to Get Rid of a Long‐Term Nose or Mouth Twitch2," A healthy, well-balanced diet can potentially stop a tic within days.Make sure you're eating enough leafy greens and nuts for magnesium, and bananas for potassium. Consider taking a supplement for these specific minerals, or a general multivitamin.Omitting or limiting your sugar and caffeine intake are additional steps you should take to get rid of a nose or mouth twitch.
Drinking the recommended amount of water for your body size is also recommended. A good general rule is to drink eight 8 oz glasses of pure water every day. Drinks with caffeine and alcohol in them do not count as part of your daily water consumption.

, In addition to getting your diet on track, make sure you're getting at least 7 to 8 hours of sleep a night. Sleep deprivation appears to play a part in the occurrence of motor tics. Sleep loss, especially in combination with stress, can also exacerbate the issue's severity.Make sure that you practice good sleep hygiene.

, Both situational stress and general anxiety contribute to tics and twitches. Before seeing a counselor, you can try out techniques at home to relieve stress. Breathing exercises, self-massage, and meditation can also help improve your sleep habits and quality of sleep.


Wash your hands before giving face a massage. Use gentle, circular motions with your fingertips.Put on soothing music and use slow, deliberate breathing exercises to relax yourself.
Look for other ways of getting into a good state of mind: what makes you most relaxed?

, It might cause discomfort to suppress a tic, but it can be possible to delay the motion.Work on holding it back if it makes you self-conscious in social situations. Concentrate on refocusing the energy that gives rise to the tic to another part of your body, and release the energy using a voluntary movement.


Some therapists try to have you refocus or distract yourself when you are having the tic, such as by diverting your attention onto something else. For example, you might place your feet flat on the ground and pay attention to how this feels, count down from 100, or rub a penny between your fingers.

Ignore the twitch.,
Monitor the behavior over time and in various situations.,
Consult your child’s pediatrician if the issue persists.",How to Get Rid of a Long‐Term Nose or Mouth Twitch3," If your child is experiencing a nose or mouth twitch, sometimes the best solution is to ignore it. Calling attention to it might actually trigger it or harm self-esteem. Tics are common in children: up to one and four develop a tic that lasts between one month and one year before puberty.Consider your child’s age and when the tic started occurring.
If any vocal tics or complex involuntary movements accompany a facial twitch, you should see your child’s pediatrician rather than ignore these symptoms. In combination, they can indicate neurological disorders such as Tourette syndrome.Having a tic may also lead to a lack of socialization and stress for the child.

, Note when your child experiences a facial twitch. Write down instances to try to identify patterns. Have a conversation with him or her if they are of vocal age, and gently ask them to identify feelings or circumstances that give rise to the twitch., If the facial twitch persists for a year or more, consult your child’s doctor. Any notes you’ve taken on the tic’s causes and patterns will be beneficial. Your doctor can order tests or refer you to a specialist if necessary."
"
Consider if the issue is part of a more significant disorder.,
Make an appointment with your primary care physician (PCP).,
See a neurologist.,
Consult a mental health professional.",How to Get Rid of a Long‐Term Nose or Mouth Twitch4," Your tic or twitch could be associated with Tourette syndrome if it persists over time, changes in severity, or is associated with both complex movements and vocal grunts or other utterances.A facial tic or twitch could indicate Bell's Palsy, a non-specific diagnosis for sudden paralysis, weakness, or other symptoms associated with nerve damage in the face.You should see a doctor if any of these factors apply to rule out more serious issues.
A Bell’s Palsy is a medical condition that causes sudden onset unilateral facial paralysis. Facial Palsy can also be caused by a herpes simplex virus infection. Treatment involves either glucocorticoids or antiviral therapy.

, You should contact your PCP or visit a health clinic if home remedies don't work, or if your symptoms don't go away or worsen over time. You should also see your doctor to confirm a potential cause, such as diet or drug use, prescribed or otherwise. Your doctor can also refer you to specialists, such as a neurologist or mental health professional., This should be an early step if you’ve recently suffered head or neck trauma or any potential nerve damage in the twitch’s region that could be its cause. See your PCP for a referral, visit a local clinic, or consult the internet for help finding one. A neurologist can order an MRI and identify physical problems with your brain and nervous system., If you suspect anxiety or a related psychological factor is the root of your facial twitch, consult a psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed therapist. Triggers can either be situational, like a break-up or stress at work, or more global in nature, such as a diagnosed mental health disorder.


Note any history of such diagnoses with the mental health professional you consult.
Remember, no two people have the same emotional and psychological lives. Do not feel shame in seeking help or seeing a therapist. The twitch might go away as soon as you get your stress off your chest.
If your nose or mouth tic is related to drug or alcohol abuse you should talk to a mental health or substance abuse professional.
Look online for county or state programs that offer free or income-based counseling programs.

Request a spinal tap.",How to Diagnose Epilepsy," Epilepsy is a neurological disease that causes seizures.It mainly works on the nervous system.It more often begins in childhood, though it can come on in adulthood. Sometimes, it appears to be genetic, while other times, it is brought on by head trauma.;
, In epilepsy, the brain's neurons don't send out proper signals.With epileptic seizures, the brain's neurons misfire. Neurons work through electrical signals. Because these signals aren't traveling in their normal patterns, it causes electrical chaos in the brain, which leads to seizures., Seizures are one symptom, but other behaviors can be symptoms. For instance, epilepsy can cause you to behave oddly. It can give you unprovoked emotions or cause you to feel strange things throughout your body.Just because you have seizures doesn't mean you have epilepsy. Non-epileptic seizures are not caused by electrical misfires in the brain, but they do look the same on the outside. These seizures are sometimes caused by stress. Provoked seizures can be caused by abusing substances like alcohol or drugs, but they can also be brought on by other body problems, such as low blood sugar, excessive trauma, or a very high fever., Seizures can range from generalized or grand mal seizures to partial or focal seizures and absence or petite mal seizures.Generalized or grand mal seizures can cause your whole body to go stiff. The stiffness will often release into repeated movements. You may make strange noises or even stop breathing for a period of time. Sometimes, you may go to the bathroom while having a seizure. When coming out of a seizure, you may find yourself very confused and stay confused for part of a day. This type of seizure affects the whole brain.Partial or focal seizures only affect a part of the body, as they only affect a part of the brain. However, they can also lead to confusion, though not always. They can cause similar repeated movements, but it will only be in one or two parts of the body. They can also cause strange feelings, such as suddenly feeling full.Absence or petite small seizures are much smaller events. They generally lead to a person staring off into space or excessively blinking., Four main categories of epilepsy exist, idiopathic generalized epilepsy, idiopathic partial epilepsy, symptomatic generalized epilepsy, and symptomatic partial epilepsy.Idiopathic generalized epilepsy is often genetic and usually the symptoms begin in childhood or young adulthood. This type of epilepsy often isn't paired with a brain abnormality, but it can cause a variety of seizures.Idiopathic partial epilepsy can also be genetic, and it begins even earlier than idiopathic generalized epilepsy. This type of epilepsy is not as severe as other types, only causing minor seizures during sleep, and kids usually outgrow it.Symptomatic generalized epilepsy is paired with trauma in the brain, usually caused at birth. In fact, ""symptomatic"" means that the epilepsy has a known cause; sometimes types of epilepsy in this category are called ""cryptogenic"" instead, meaning the epilepsy likely has a specific cause but the doctor hasn't figured out what yet. It often accompanies other neurological problems, such as cerebral palsy, and it can lead to a variety of seizure types.Symptomatic partial epilepsy is the most common type to begin in adulthood, though it can also come on earlier. This type is also caused by some kind of trauma to the brain, leading to abnormalities, such as infections, strokes, or tumors. This type can be treated through brain surgery, which removes the part of the brain causing the problem.The main named types of epilepsy fall into one of these categories. For instance, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome falls under symptomatic generalized epilepsy., You can be at risk if you've had a brain injury, brain tumor, or a genetic condition that affects the brain. You can also be at risk if you've had a stroke or infections. Nonetheless, most cases of epilepsy do not have a known cause., Your doctor is the best source for diagnosing what type of seizures you are having.

, If you're having seizures, your doctor needs to know if something else could be causing them besides epilepsy, such as drug or alcohol abuse. Remember that stress and lack of sleep can cause seizures, as can missing doses of certain medications., Ask the doctor if any of the tests he or she plans to run on you require you to take special steps for pre-care, such as fasting.

, Before taking any tests, your doctor will likely examine you to determine if any of your movements, behaviors, or mental abilities are not quite right., An EEG helps the doctor see how the electrical signals move in your brain.During this test, the doctor will place sensors on your scalp. The sensors record your brain activity. Mostly, you will stay relaxed, but you may be asked to do a few things, like breathe deeply.Essentially, your doctor wants to see if your brain is misfiring and causing your seizures.

, Blood tests can help rule out anything else that may be causing seizures, such as infections., PET scans can pinpoint the part of the brain that is misfiring and causing the seizures.For a PET scan, your doctor will begin with an injection of radioactive material. The positrons in the injection react with electrons in the body. This test can also help decide if you have another health issue instead of epilepsy.Your doctor may also want a computerized tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Both of these also help your doctor identify abnormalities in the brain. A single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) scan may be used if an EEG or MRI doesn't show anything in your brain. Like a PET scan, you'd have a small amount of radiation injected into your body, and the SPECT scan would track how blood is moving to and from your brain., A spinal tap can help the doctor to determine if you have epilepsy through spinal fluid analysis.During a spinal tap, the doctor will remove fluid from your spine. You will be expected to get in a certain position, such as the fetal position. You will also be given a local anesthetic to help with any pain. The lab will analyze the fluid to find out more information."

Watch for speech problems that get worse over time.Progressive aphasia is when you lose your skills and abilities associated with language and communication over time, in a way that exceeds a natural age-related decline.,
Recognize signs of the ""agrammatic/nonfluent"" subtype of PPA.This subtype of progressive aphasia presents primarily with speech difficulties.,
Look out for signs of the ""logopenic"" subtype of PPA.This subtype of progressive aphasia mainly affects word finding.,
Watch for signs of the ""semantic"" subtype of PPA.The primary problem in the semantic subtype of progressive aphasia is losing word comprehension.,
Consider whether you are in the population most frequently affected by PPA.PPA most commonly affects individuals between the ages of 40 and 80 years old, with the peak incidence occurring around 60 years old.,
Take note of how it started.Progressive aphasia presents as a gradual decline in your language and communication abilities.,
Keep a diary of how your symptoms are changing (or worsening) with time.,
Receive a detailed clinical exam.The first step when you see a medical professional will be to receive a detailed clinical exam.,
Rule out other conditions that may present similarly.The reason that your doctor will ask so many questions and perform such a detailed exam is mainly to rule out the possibility of other conditions.,
Have a head CT or MRI.As part of the diagnostic process, you will most likely receive either a head CT scan or an MRI.,
See a speech therapist.Because the impact on language and communication varies from person to person (depending upon which area of the brain has been damaged), the approach of the speech therapist will vary depending upon your specific presentation.,
Learn new communication strategies.Given that the pathophysiology of progressive aphasia is not reversible, and will only continue to progress with time, it is important to explore alternate modes of communication that can help you to cope.,
Connect with an Aphasia Community Group.One of the key elements for people as their progressive aphasia worsens is finding a community of people who understand the condition, and who can be there as an emotional and social support network.,
Carry information about your diagnosis with you.As their condition progresses, some people carry ID cards with them and/or papers with information about their diagnosis that they can give to others.",How to Diagnose Progressive Aphasia," Things to be on the lookout for include:Language abilities that become more and more impaired with time.
Problems with written language in addition to spoken language.
Difficulty ""finding"" words (i.e. loss of precision of vocabulary), or substituting incorrect words due to forgetfulness. This may include forgetting the names of things, and frequently ""talking around"" a word by describing it or referring to it without using its actual name, as well as forgetting a person's name despite recognizing the individual.
Stuttering and/or trouble pronouncing words (or mispronouncing words).
Difficulty understanding words and sentences (note that this must be due to a word comprehension problem and NOT a hearing problem), which may lead to confusion or continually asking for clarification.
Slowed speech, incomplete sentences, incorrect word order, grammatically incorrect sentences, and/or decreased use of language as a means to communicate.
Trouble with written language, such as incorrect spelling, and problems reading and understanding written information.
Becoming mute (this is a very late sign).
Note that the signs and symptoms will vary depending upon the specific area of the brain that is damaged, which varies from person to person.;
, Speech will generally consist of fewer words, missing words, incomplete sentences, grammatically incorrect sentences, and difficulty ""finding"" (or remembering) the correct words to refer to things. Generally, in this subtype of PPA, comprehension of what other's are saying remains intact. It is predominantly a disorder of word production.

, Speech is normally preserved, other than challenges remembering the names of objects, and difficulty maintaining the precision of vocabulary that may have been used in the past.

, For instance, you may not recognize or understand the meaning of words that you previously understood. you may frequently ask for clarification, or appear confused, when trying to make sense of what others are saying.

, It affects twice as many men as it does women. It has been hypothesized that there may be a genetic component to progressive aphasia, as it happens more commonly in individuals with a family history of cognitive decline (such as other family members who have been diagnosed with dementia or aphasia).


It is important to understand that, while progressive aphasia always presents initially as symptoms only related to language and communication (without other symptoms that are commonly associated with dementia, such as memory loss), PPA may progress with time to become a more widespread dementia syndrome.
However, the diagnosis of PPA relies on presenting during the initial few years with deficits only in language and communication skills.

, It is not associated with a triggering event, and there is no definitive ""time of onset"" of the condition. Rather, most people notice subtle challenges with language and communication coming on gradually, with no other signs or symptoms of mental deterioration.


If there is a history of a triggering event, such as a stroke or a traumatic brain injury, you are likely NOT suffering from progressive aphasia.

, Note that one of the hallmarks of progressive aphasia is that it continues to ""progress"" (i.e. worsen) with time.It is not something that all of a sudden begins to show improvements, and it does not have a fluctuating course (with periods of being worse followed by periods of being better).


The best way to keep track of, and to remember, your symptoms and their progression over time is by keeping a diary.
Having a written record is always more reliable than going by memory alone, and the written record will help your doctors to diagnose the condition as well.

, Your doctor will assess your ability to read and to understand language, as well as your ability to speak and to effectively articulate your thoughts.


In addition to examining your language and communication abilities, your doctor will do a full mental and neurological exam to assess for any other cognitive or brain-related abnormalities.
Your doctor will ask you questions about how you are functioning in day-to-day life, and areas of your life that have been impacted by your condition.

, If other areas of your life are affected, and if you show other signs of mental deterioration, you may have another condition such as Alzheimer's disease which has more widespread manifestations than simply affecting language and communication.


Alzheimer's disease is the main disease that is confused diagnostically with progressive aphasia.The main difference between the two is that Alzheimer's disease is a widespread form of dementia that will negatively impact many areas of your life, such as memory, language and communication, knowing appropriate social behaviour, and being able to perform tasks required for day-to-day life.
Progressive aphasia, on the other hand, presents as a decline only in language and communication abilities (it is only this area of the brain that is damaged, which differs from a more widespread form of dementia). Therefore, declines in function will ALL be related to language and communication issues, with little to no memory problems or other concerns.

, This is because, in addition to ruling out other mental conditions, your doctor will want to rule out potential signs of a stroke or traumatic brain injury. This is best done with the combination of a neurological exam and imaging techniques (either CT or MRI).


If your CT or MRI is consistent with the possibility of progressive aphasia, and your clinical exam supports this as well (i.e. your clinical exam shows mental deteriorations associated with language and communication only, and affecting no other areas of your life), your doctor will assign you a diagnosis of progressive aphasia.
It is key to understand that progressive aphasia cannot officially be diagnosed (i.e. proven) until the time of autopsy (that is, following death when doctors look at your brain and evaluate the specific areas of brain damage).Similarly, other forms of dementia such as Alzheimer's Disease also cannot be officially diagnosed until after death, at the time of autopsy. They are all ""clinical diagnoses,"" meaning that your doctor will evaluate the imaging results (from CT or MRI) combined with your clinical signs and symptoms and assign you the best possible diagnosis that accounts for everything, as far as he or she can tell.
This is also why regular follow-up exams are important, to see if any of your signs or symptoms change. For instance, if you initially presented to your doctor with only language and communication deficits, and subsequently begin experiencing significant memory loss and other cognitive problems, your diagnosis may be changed in light of the new symptoms you are experiencing.

, He or she will focus on finding ways to help you to more effectively manage your condition in social situations, and to preserve as many of your communication abilities as possible.


Note that, while speech therapists can help you to manage your condition, they cannot cure it.
The actual ""pathophysiology"" (the damage to your brain) is not reversible and will only continue to worsen with time, as this is what the disease entails.

, Your speech therapist may suggest non-verbal strategies for communication, such as gesturing or pointing, which many patients find helpful when their condition becomes more severe.

, Connecting with an Aphasia Community Group may also provide you with insights and strategies as to how to better manage your condition, and to optimize your communication and interactions with those around you, as you will be exposed to people who are faced with similar problems in day-to-day life.

, This way, if communication is a significant challenge, it can help others to understand and hence smooth the interaction as much as possible.

Don't overlook a sudden and severe headache.,
Note any disturbances to your vision.,
Check for dilated pupils in the mirror.,
Pay attention to eye pain.,
Notice if your neck is stiff.,
Assess if half of your body feels weak.,
Seek medical attention immediately.",How to Detect an Aneurysm1," If an artery bursts in your brain due to an aneurysm, it will cause a severe headache that comes on suddenly. This headache is the key symptom of a ruptured brain aneurysm.Usually this headache will feel much worse than any headache you have ever experienced.
The headache is usually fairly localized, confined to whichever side of the head where the artery burst.
For example, if the artery near your eye bursts, it will cause severe pain that radiates into your eye.
The headache may also be associated with nausea, disorientation, and/or vomiting.;
, Double vision, reduced vision, blurred vision, or blindness are all indicators of a cerebral aneurysm. Vision disturbances occur because of pressure on the arterial wall near the eyes that cuts off blood flow to eyes.The optic nerve can also be pinched by the accumulating blood, causing blurry or double vision.
Blindness in this situation is caused by ischemia of the retina, where the blood flow to the retinal tissues is insufficient., Dilated pupils are a common sign of cerebral aneurysm, due to the blockage of an artery near the eyes. Usually, one of your pupils will be significantly more dilated than the other.It will also be sluggish and unresponsive to light.


The enlarged pupil is caused by the pressure of blood accumulating within the brain.
Dilated pupils may indicate that an aneurysm just happened, shown by artery damage located near the eyes.

, Your eyes may throb or feel intense pain during an aneurysm.This happens when the affected artery is near the eyes.
The eye pain will usually be one-sided pain, because it is local to the part of the brain that had an aneurysm.

, A stiff neck can occur to due to an aneurysm if a nerve in the neck is affected by the ruptured artery.The ruptured artery does not necessarily have to be nearby the exact place in the neck where the pain is felt.
This is because the nerves in the neck extend a decent distance up and down the neck and head area. Pain will project itself past the site of the aneurysm.

, Half-sided body weakness is a common sign of aneurysm, depending on which part of the brain is affected.If the right hemisphere is affected it will cause left-sided body paralysis.
On the other hand, if the left hemisphere is affected, it will cause right-sided body paralysis.

, Ruptured brain aneurysms are fatal in around 40% of people, and about 66% of survivors suffer some type of brain damage.If you are experiencing any of the above symptoms, call your emergency services (like 911 in the US or 999 in the UK) immediately.Experts do not recommend that you drive yourself or have a family member drive you to the hospital.Aneurysms can cause severe debilitation in a short period of time, making it dangerous to be behind the wheel.
Call an ambulance for your safety and that of others. Paramedics can get you to the hospital more quickly and perform life-saving procedures on you during transit.

Additionally, a person with astrocytoma can have double or blurred vision and loss of appetite.These symptoms can indicate a variety of health issues and they should be taken seriously if they do not go away after a couple of days.;
, A brain tumor can change your personality and your behavior. If you or someone you know has a sudden change of personality that cannot be explained for other reasons, it may be due to a brain tumor.Part of these personality changes may be related to problems with memory, confusion, and decline of brain function, which can also be a symptom of astrocytoma., Along with personality changes, your physical ability may change as well. For example, your ability to move your limbs may be reduced or you may gradually lose the ability to speak.You could experience difficulties with your ability to speak.
You may also experience changes to your vision, including blurred vision or loss of vision.
Changes in physical ability are likely to be gradual.

, Astrocytoma can cause seizures, which usually present as small tremors or twitching in the face, arms, and legs.They may range in severity, from barely noticeable to extremely aggressive.


Along with seizures, astrocytoma can also cause numbness in the face, arms, and legs.

, Astrocytomas occur in males more often than in females and they are more likely to occur in those over age 45.While the cause of astrocytoma is not known, there may be a correlation between exposure to radiation and tumor development in some cases.There is a type of astrocytoma, pilocytic astrocytoma, that is more common in children and young adults. This is the most benign type of astrocytoma.

, If you are experiencing any of the symptoms of astrocytoma, you should see your doctor for an examination. Your doctor will most likely ask you in detail about your symptoms and when they started. The doctor will then give you a physical exam.If you have any of the symptoms associated with astrocytoma that should prompt you to see a doctor.
If your doctor suspects cancer, they may refer you to an oncologist. An oncologist is a doctor that specializes in cancer treatment.

, If your doctor suspects a brain tumor, they will do imaging of your head and spine. In most cases, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is done. It is a sensitive and reliable way of detecting brain tumors.Your doctor can also do a CT scan. However, this imaging process shows less detail than an MRI.
Your doctor has been trained to read the MRI results and they should explain what they find to you.

, Once your doctor spots what they think is a tumor, they will need to do a biopsy to confirm a diagnosis. The biopsy will allow the doctor to get a small piece of tissue from the mass they have detected.Once the biopsy is done the tumor will be graded. This means that the tumor specimen will be looked at through a microscope and it will be assessed.

, While medication cannot eliminate the cancer, it can help to minimize or control the symptoms. There are a wide variety of medications that can be prescribed, depending on what your symptoms are, but they usually include anti-epileptic medication (Keppra) and steroids (Decadron)., Surgical treatment of astrocytoma can be used to remove the mass or to relieve pressure caused by the mass. It is usually done with more severe tumors. You will need to consult with a brain surgeon to determine whether brain surgery is viable. Whether surgery is recommended, or even an option, is dependent on the tumor's location and severity.For large tumors, surgery is not done with the intention of completely eliminating the cancer. The nature of astrocytoma, and how it invades surrounding normal-looking cells, makes it impossible for surgery to eliminate it completely.

, Once the condition is confirmed, radiation is likely to be recommended. It can be administered to the whole brain or to specific areas of the brain, depending on what your doctor recommends.In some cases, those with low-grade tumors do not get surgery but have radiation instead.After radiation is done, it is usually followed up by a round of chemotherapy.

, After you undergo treatment you will likely need to take medication and allow your body to recover from the treatment. Follow your doctor's recommendations for aftercare and how long you need to take off of work or physical activity.


Part of aftercare is keeping abreast of the status of your condition. Get regular medical exams and let your doctor know if your symptoms return or change.

The tense muscles, in turn, will put pressure on your bladder., While leaning forward, lay your forearm across your lower abdomen and press gently. Do not press directly on your bladder, which could cause backflow to your kidneys., Repeatedly tap your bladder with your fingers, below your navel. Tap about a little faster than once per second, for thirty seconds.If necessary, shift around to find the best spot, and keep up the tapping until a steady stream has begun.

, Stroking your inner thigh or tugging on a pubic hair may trigger the nerves that control the bladder.

Recognize the two different types of seizures.",How to Deal With Seizures in Children," They cannot be manually prevented or slowed down, so the most important thing you can do is prevent the child from getting any additional injuries during the seizure.;
, If they start to convulse, get them to lie on their side to keep their throat clear and allow any allow secretions like saliva or vomit to drain.

, This will prevent any hazards caused by broken glass around their face.

, Try to keep them in an open, empty area.

, This can lead to an injury to your child or to yourself.

, Make sure you remain with them until they wake up.

, If they are not breathing after the seizures have stopped, begin mouth-to-mouth rescue breathing (CPR).


Don’t try to administer CPR while your child is in a convulsive seizure, as this may lead to an injury to your child or yourself.

, They will likely be in a state of confusion and will either refuse the medication or be unable to take it.

, Often, the doctor does not start with the medicines right away, once your child has their first episode of seizure as it might just be a single, isolated episode.


Most anti-convulsion medicines have side effects that lead to liver damageand damage to teeth, so most doctors avoid starting long term medications until a clear case of epilepsy has been diagnosed.

, This drug helps by inhibiting the GABA (Gamma aminobutyric acid) neurons that fire from your child’s brain continuously during a seizure. But, it should be used only as a drug to stop a seizure and not as a way to treat your child’s seizures in the long term.


The dosage for children is 0.1mg/kg, with the maximum dose being 4 mg/kg. It is usually given at 2 mg/minute intravenously i.e through your child’s veins and is administered every five minutes until the seizure stops.
If the vein is difficult to find, other routes like sublingual (placing the tablet below the tongue) or per rectal (inserting tablet through the anal opening) may also be used. In these cases, the dose is 2mg/ml in saline that is injected into the anus to curb the seizures., Your child’s doctor can give your child this drug in several ways, including:Through an I.V. This the best, more preferred way to administer the drug, as it will reach your child’s bloodstream very fast. The dose is 0.1mg/kg.
Orally. Your child’s doctor may give your child Midazolam as a pill if their seizure is too rapid for an I.V. The dose is 0.5mg/kg, which is administered every five minutes up to two times a day.
Through their nose. If your child is not agreeing to the I.V. or to swallowing a pill, the doctor may give administer Midazolam as a spray that your child can puff through their nose. Each puff is 0.1mg/kg, so two puffs in each nostril will sedate your child. If you are treating your child’s seizures at home, you will likely be advised to use this option as it has the least side effects. But take your child to the hospital immediately if they experience increased seizures.

, The most common side effects of these drugs include sedation, hypotension, and respiratory depression.


Since these drugs abolish the GABA (Gamma aminobutyric acid) pathway that helps to stimulate your child’s receptors and muscles, exceeding the prescribed dosages of these drugs can lead to these side effects. These drugs should only be given in a hospital by medical professionals and closely monitored., If any of the other drugs fail to control your child’s seizures, this drug is used.


The dose is 20 mg/kg and can only be increased up to 1000 mg.
It is administered at 1 mg/kg/min and is mixed in saline. It will be given over a period of 20 minutes. It is also the first choice of medicine for babies suffering from seizures who under 30 days of age. , This is the most commonly used drug to treat generalized seizures.


The dose is usually 5 milliliters (0.17  fl oz) per day for a period of 1 to 2 years and can be given as a 100 mg tablet to children 10 years and older. They should consume only one tablet every day at the same time for 1 to 2 years.
This drug balances the electrical activity in your brain by allowing the right amount of sodium and potassium changes. But it shouldn’t be given to children with kidney or heart problems.

, These drugs are used in the treatment and prevention of seizures. They start at a low dose and gradually increase until the seizures are brought under control. These medications work by inhibiting the over-excitation of the neurons in your child’s brain that lead to seizures.


Diazepam reduces the electrical over-activity of your child’s brain and relaxes the muscles that contract to produce seizures. Generally, children are given a lower dose of Diazepam, even if their body weight is equivalent to an adult. The adult dosage is 3-10 mg divided into several doses.
Carbamazepine is given in doses based on age. In children younger than 6 years old, an initial dose of 10-20 mg per kg body weight is given. For children between 6-12 years old, the initial dose is 100mg twice a day and in children older than 12 years old, the initial dose is 200 mg twice a day.
Ethosuximide is used in the treatment of petit mal (absent) seizures. In children between 3-6 years old, the initial dose is 250 mg/day and in children older than 6 years old, the initial dose is 500 mg/day.
You may also get a prescription for Lamotrigine. In children 12 years and older, the initial dose is 25 mg once a day.
Phenytoin is used in the treatment of complex partial seizures, grand mal (generalized) seizures and seizures during or after surgery. The initial dose is 5mg per kg per day.
Gabapentin is used in to treat partial seizures. The dose is 10-15 mg per kg per day in children between 3-12 years of age.

, Your child’s doctor should follow the drug levels in your child’s body and also monitor any side effects due to the medication.


Keep in mind it will take time for your child to adjust to the medication.
While it is more preferred for your doctor to prescribe just one drug for your child’s seizures, your doctor may prescribe another drug to control the seizures if needed.
If your child is taking medication on a regular basis, the drugs should be tapered over a period of time until your child’s doctor is convinced your child is starting to recover.

, Melatonin is a hormone secreted by a small gland deep inside your child’s brain called the pineal gland. It controls our sleep-wake cycle, so it’s possible that by increasing the amount of melatonin in your child’s brain, they can reduce the risk of seizures brought on by fatigue, as it induces sleep.


In children, a dose of 3mg melatonin before bedtime along with the anti-epileptics can have therapeutic effects., This is a special diet that has been found to be effective at treating seizures and can be used as an alternative therapy for children who do not respond to conventional drugs., This diet consists of low carbohydrates, moderate proteins and is high in fat content, as a typical ketogenic diet provides 3 to 4 grams (0.11 to 0.14 oz) of fat for every 1 gram (0.035 oz) of carbohydrate and protein. With this diet, your child’s body is forced to burn fats instead of carbohydrates.


Under normal circumstances, the carbohydrates consumed in food are transformed into glucose, which is then used mainly for the brain function. But since there are very little carbohydrates in a ketogenic diet, the liver comes into play and transforms fats into fatty acids and ketone bodies. This ketone then reaches your child’s brain and replaces glucose as the source of energy.
Increased levels of ketones in the blood lead to ketosis which in turn decreases the frequency of epileptic seizures.In fact, this diet reduces seizures by about 50% in children below 10 years old., Working together with these medical professionals will ensure you find the best way to apply this diet for your child.

, This treatment is gaining momentum in the treatment of drug resistant seizures.It helps to shorten or abort seizures altogether. In fact, many people who undergo VNS experience a significant (more than 50%) reduction in the frequency of their seizures, as well as a decrease in seizure severity.


It is not known exactly how VNS works. But the vagus nerve is an important pathway to the brain, so one possible way this treatment works is that by stimulating the vagus nerve, electrical energy is discharged upward into a wide area of the brain, disrupting the abnormal brain activity responsible for seizures.Another theory suggests that stimulating the vagus nerve causes the release of special brain chemicals that decrease seizures., Your child will be put under general anesthesia for the procedure. A stimulator device about the size of a silver dollar is surgically placed under your child’s skin, in the upper part of their chest. A connecting wire is run under their skin from the stimulator to an electrode that is attached to the vagus nerve, which is accessible through a small incision in their neck.Once the stimulator is implanted, it is programmed to generate pulses of electricity at regular intervals, depending on your child's tolerance. For example, the device may be programmed to stimulate the nerve for 30 seconds every five minutes.
The settings on the device are adjustable, so the electrical current is gradually increased as your child's tolerance increases. Re-programming the stimulator can be done at the doctor's office.
Your child will also be given a hand-held magnet, which when brought near the stimulator, can generate an immediate current of electricity to stop a seizure in progress or reduce the severity of the seizure.
Keep in mind VNS is an add-on therapy, so it should be used in addition to another type of treatment, like seizure medication. If your child is using VNS, their doctor may reduce the dosage of their medication.

,, Biofeedback is a treatment technique where your child is trained to improve their health with the help of information and signals from their own bodies.Biofeedback is used in treating various disease conditions by specialists to relax patients, to reduce their pain, and reclaim normal functioning.
In a case of epilepsy, the form of biofeedback used is called neurofeedback. It is used to teach patients to control their brain activity consciously and thereby prevent seizures.

, In this surgery, isolated brain lesions that are injured or a defect like a tumor or an abnormal blood vessel causing seizures only are removed. Though this is a drastic option, recovery is quick and mostly complete.


The results of a lesionectomy are great once the exact lesion has been identified.

, These are a band of nerve fibres that connect the two halves of the brain’s cerebrum.


In this operation, a part or entire callosum is cut, disabling the communication between both hemispheres of the brain. This prevents the seizures from spreading from one side of the brain to the other side.
The usefulness of this surgery is limited and it is only rarely performed in children with ‘drop attacks’.

, In this procedure, the surgeon makes a series of shallow cuts on your child’s brain tissue to interrupt any seizure impulses but does not harm their normal brain activity.


This is used in epileptic cases where the area of focus cannot be removed safely.
Due to the plasticity of your child’s brain, the brain quickly makes up for the minor deficits that might occur. So, the earlier the surgery is done, the better the results.

, In this surgery, the point where the impulse discharge of seizure occurs is removed by removing that lobe of the brain. E.g. frontal lobe removal, etc. This is an extremely drastic measure undertaken only when survival becomes more important than meaningful survival.


Resection of an entire lobe of the brain has many downsides as it means loss of all the functions that the lobe performed.
The recovery is rapid due to plasticity of a child’s brain to recuperate fast, but some permanent deficits like language and memory, depending on the lobe removed, will occur.

, In this surgery, one hemisphere is disconnected from the rest of the brain, but only some part of the brain tissue is removed.


This is a last stand surgery and is rarely ever performed.

, Your child may be suffering from a simple absence seizure or petit mal seizure.


These short episodes will start and stop suddenly. Your child will likely return to normal as soon as the seizure stops. There will be no falling down, tongue biting or frothing at the mouth that you may find during a more severe convulsion.

, They may be suffering from a complex partial seizure.


Partial seizures generally affect just a small group of muscles that spasm and move convulsively.

, These convulsions are sometimes accompanied with difficulty breathing and rolling of their eyes. They may also froth at the mouth and bite their tongue. These are symptoms of generalized and febrile seizures.

, They may also not remember they had a seizure. This stage of drowsiness is known as the aural phase.


Your child should return to normal within 15 minutes but may suffer from fatigue for about a day after the seizure.
They may also suffer from constipation. Occasionally, jerking during a seizure leads to injuries that range from a bite on their tongue to a broken bone.

, They are likely experiencing a very serious type of seizure called status epilepticus, which is a symptom of epilepsy. In this condition, your child may also have repeated seizures over quick intervals without returning to a stage of normalcy in between each seizure., Certain types of epilepsy seem to run in families. As well, your child could inherit a low seizure threshold. Individuals with a lower seizure threshold are more likely to have seizures., These conditions can lead to the development of a febrile seizure, which is the most common type of seizure found in children., This can be a probable cause of febrile seizures in children., Other conditions like cerebral palsy,bleeding in the brain, ingesting certain poisons, and taking certain medicinescan lead to the firing of excessive electrical impulses in the brain, leading to a convulsion or seizure.

, Seizures are caused by abnormal electrical discharge from the brain. Our brain needs electronic impulses to function so we have hormones in our brain that stimulate and inhibit electrical impulses. A decrease in these impulses leads to seizures.

, Your child may experience either of these types.


A partial seizure involves excessive impulses being fired from only a part of the brain, so only a part of the body is affected.
A generalized seizure involves a much larger portion of the brain and often affect the entire body as one unit.

Choose an isotonic drink for normal rehydration.,
Gather your ingredients.,
Pour three cups (about 800 mL) of water into a pitcher.,
Add one cup (about 200 ml) of fruit juice or tea.,
Sprinkle in a pinch of salt.,
Stir the mixture well.",How to Make Your Own Fluid Replacement Drink1," Isotonic drinks will replenish lost fluids while also giving your body a some extra carbohydrates to help provide energy.The concentration of carbohydrates and electrolytes in these drinks nearly mimics the concentration present in blood allowing for efficient absorption of fluid. Choose an isotonic fluid replacement drink for normal workouts and moderate sweating. To be considered isotonic, a drink contain roughly the same salt and sugar content as the human body does.For example, you might drink an isotonic drink during and after soccer practice. Or, you might drink an isotonic drink after running a 5K.;
, Isotonic fluid replacement drinks help to rehydrate you faster because they contain about the same amount of sugar and salt as your blood. To make an isotonic fluid replacement drink, you will need:3 cups or (about 800 mL) of water
1 cup of fruit juice (any kind) OR 1 cup of tea and 2 tablespoons of sugar
a pinch of salt

, Get a large pitcher and pour in your water. You will need about three cups or 720 mL of drinking water to make an isotonic solution.Make sure that the water is at room temperature or slightly warm so that the salt will dissolve easily.

, Next, add your tea to the pitcher. You will need to add about one cup or 240 mL or fruit juice or tea to the water.The fruit juice will add flavor and sweetness, while the tea will just add flavor.


If you are using tea, then you will also need to add about two tablespoons of sugar to the tea to get the right sugar content.Add the sugar while it is still warm and stir the sugar into the tea until it dissolves. Then add the tea to the water.

, You only need a pinch of salt to get the right sodium level for your isotonic fluid replacement drink. Pinch a little salt between your index finger and thumb and drop it into the pitcher., After you have added all of your ingredients, stir or swirl the ingredients together so that they are well-combined. Then, it will be ready to drink! Pour some into a water bottle and take it along for your next workout or enjoy a glass right away.

Be aware that aortic aneurysms can be either abdominal aortic aneurysms or thoracic aortic aneurysms.,
Take note of severe abdominal or back pain.,
Note nausea and vomiting.,
Check if you are dizzy.,
Check your heart rate.,
Feel your skin to see if it's clammy.,
Keep an eye on any sudden chest pain and high-pitched breath.,
Swallow and see if it seems difficult.,
Speak and listen for any hoarseness in your voice.",How to Detect an Aneurysm2," The aorta is the primary artery that delivers blood to your heart and to all your other extremities, and an aneurysm affecting the aorta can be classified into two sub-types:Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). An aneurysm that happens in the abdominal (stomach) area is called an abdominal aortic aneurysm. This is the most common type of aneurysm and is fatal in 80% of cases.Thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA). This type of aneurysm is located in the chest area and occurs above the diaphragm. During a TAA, a section near the heart enlarges and affects the valve between the heart and aorta. When this happens, a backflow of blood occurs in heart, causing damage to the cardiac muscles.

, Unusually severe and sudden stomach or back pain can be a symptom of abdominal aortic aneurysm or thoracic aortic aneurysm.The pain is caused by your bulging artery putting pressure on neighboring organs and muscles.
The pain usually does not resolve by itself, nor will changing position alleviate it..

, If you experience nausea and vomiting along with severe abdominal or back pain, you may be experiencing a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.Constipation and difficulty urinating may also occur. Abdominal rigidity can also occur with sudden onset.

, Dizziness is caused by massive blood loss that often accompanies a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.Dizziness may also cause fainting. If you feel dizzy along with these other symptoms, try to sit down or rest on the floor, lowering yourself as carefully as you can

, A suddenly increased heart rate is a reaction to the internal blood loss and anemia caused by a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm., Clammy skin can be a tell-tale symptom of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.This is due to an embolus (moving blood clot) that is formed by the abdominal aneurysm and affects the surface temperature of the skin.

, Since a thoracic aortic aneurysm happens in the chest area, the increased size of the aorta can push up against the chest area, causing pain and a high-pitched sound during breathing.This chest pain feels intense and stabbing.
Dull chest pain is probably not a symptom of an aneurysm.

, Difficulty swallowing can indicate the occurrence of a thoracic aortic aneurysm.A problem swallowing can be due to the enlarged aorta, which puts pressure on the esophagus and makes it hard to swallow., An enlarged artery can press the laryngeal nerve, including the vocal chords, which leads to a hoarse voice.This hoarseness will come about suddenly, not over time as with a cold or flu.

Get an ultrasound to obtain a preliminary diagnosis.,
Try a computed tomography scan (CT-Scan).,
Look into a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test.,
Try getting angiography done to examine the interior of the artery.",How to Detect an Aneurysm3," An ultrasound is a painless procedure that uses sound waves to visualize and create pictures of certain parts of the body.This test can only be used to diagnose aortic aneurysms.

, This procedure uses X-rays to take pictures of the structures in the body. A CT scan is painless and provides more detailed pictures than an ultrasound. It’s a good choice if the doctor suspects aneurysm or wants to rule out other possible diseases.During the procedure, a doctor will inject a dye into your vein that makes the aorta and other arteries visible on the CT-scan.
This can be used to perform a diagnosis all types of aneurysms.
You can have a CT scan done as part of your routine check-up even if you don’t suspect an aneurysm. This is a great way to identify aneurysm as early as possible.

, This procedure uses magnets and radio waves to visualize organs and other structures in your body. It is also painless, and is useful for detecting, locating, and measuring aneurysms.Instead of just 2D, it can create 3D cross-sliced images of the blood vessels in your brain.
An MRI can be used to diagnose any type of aneurysm.
In some cases, MRI and cerebral angiography may be performed together to support each other.
With the use of computer-generated radio waves and magnetic fields, an MRI can produce more detailed images of the brain’s blood vessels compared to a CT scan.
The procedure is safe and painless.
Unlike an X-ray, an MRI does not involve any radiation and is safe to be used by people who need to avoid radiation, such as pregnant women., This procedure uses X-rays and special dyes to visualize the interior of your affected artery.This will show the extent and severity of artery damage – plaque build-up and artery blockage are easily seen with the help of this procedure.
Cerebral angiography is only used to detect cerebral aneurysm. This procedure is invasive because it uses a small catheter inserted into the leg and guided through the circulatory system.
This procedure will indicate the exact location of the ruptured artery in the brain.
After the dye is injected, a series of MRI or X-ray imagings will then follow to create a detailed image of the blood vessels of the brain."

Understand the cause of a cerebral aneurysm.,
Know your risk factors.,
Stop smoking.,
Watch your blood pressure.,
Manage your diet.",How to Detect an Aneurysm4," A cerebral aneurysm happens when an artery in the brain weakens and forms into a balloon before rupturing. They often form at forks or branches in arteries, the weakest sections of blood vessels.When the balloon ruptures, continuous bleeding in the brain will occur.
Blood is toxic to the brain, and when bleeding happens, it is often called hemorrhagic syndrome.
Most brain aneurysms take place in the subarachnoid space, which is the area between the brain and the skull bone.

, Cerebral and aortic aneurysms share several risk factors. Some of them cannot be controlled, such as inherited genetic conditions, but others can be reduced by smart lifestyle choices. Here are common risk factors for cerebral and aortic aneurysms:Smoking elevates your risk of both types of aneurysms.
Hypertension, or high blood pressure, damages blood vessels and the lining of the aorta.Aging increases your risk of cerebral aneurysms after age 50.The aorta becomes stiffer with age, and the prevalence of aneurysms increases as you get older.Inflammation can cause damage that leads to aneurysms. Conditions like vasculitis (an inflammation of the blood vessels) can damage and scar the aorta.Trauma, such as falls or motor vehicle accidents, can damage the aorta.Infections such as syphilis (an STI) can damage the lining of the aorta.Bacterial or fungal infections of the brain can damage blood vessels and increase the risk of aneurysm.Substance use or abuse, especially cocaine use and heavy alcohol consumption, cause hypertension that can lead to brain aneurysms.Gender plays a role in your risk for aneurysms. Men develop aortic aneurysms at a higher rate than women do, but women are at higher risk for developing brain aneurysms.Certain inherited conditions, such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome (both connective tissue disorders), can cause weakening of cerebral blood vessels and the aorta., Smoking is believed to contribute to the formation and rupture of brain aneurysms.Smoking is also the most significant risk factor for developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). 90% of individuals with aortic aneurysms have a history of smoking.The sooner you quit, the sooner you can begin to lower your risk., Hypertension, or high blood pressure, causes damage to cerebral blood vessels and the lining of the aorta, which can lead to the development of aneurysms.Losing weight if you are overweight or obese can reduce your blood pressure. Even losing 10 pounds (4.5 kg) makes a difference. Get regular exercise. Getting 30 minutes a day of moderate physical exercise can help lower your blood pressure.Limit alcohol. Do not drink more than 1-2 drinks per day (1 for most women, 2 for most men)., Keeping your blood vessels healthy can help prevent an aortic aneurysm.A healthy diet can also help lower the risk of rupturing an existing aneurysm.Eating a balanced diet with plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein will help prevent aneurysms from forming.Reduce your dietary sodium. Limiting sodium to less than 2,300mg a day (1,500mg a day for people with active high blood pressure diagnoses) will help control blood pressure.Reduce your cholesterol.Eating foods high in soluble fiber, especially oatmeal and oat bran, will help reduce “bad” cholesterol (LDL). Apples, pears, kidney beans, barley, and prunes also contain soluble fiber. Omega-3 fatty acids from fatty fish like sardines, tuna, salmon, or halibut will also help reduce your risk.Eat healthy fats.Be sure to avoid saturated fats and trans fats.Fats from fish, vegetable oils (e.g., olive oil), nuts, and seeds are high in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, which can lower your risk.Avocado is another good source of “good” fat and can help lower your cholesterol."

Drink more water.,
Try particular fruits.,
Use certain herbs.,
Eat certain vegetables.,
Try teas and coffees.,
Treat constipation.",How to Make Yourself Pee2," If you need to pee for a doctor's appointment due to a urine test, drinking water ahead of time is probably the fastest and safest way to induce urination.


Excess water intake is not harmful to your health. If the body receives too much water, the kidneys will naturally expel it via urine. If you know you need to pee at your doctor's office, try drinking a glass or two of water before going in.
However, if you have congestive heart failure or another condition that causes edema, you should limit your fluid intake. If you have chronic renal failure and are on dialysis, you should also limit your fluid intake.
Unless you're particularly shy about urinating in public; you do not need to overdo it. Having an eight-ounce glass of water before your appointment should make urination easier and quicker in the office., Certain fruits have diuretic properties. A diuretic is a substance that promotes the formation of urine in the kidneys, causing a person to expel urine more frequently.A variety of fruits serve as natural diuretics.


Citrus fruits in general, but lemon especially, can increase urination. They can also potentially lower blood pressure over time and can treat urinary tract infections.Watermelons get their name due to the fact they contain a high amount of water. Eating watermelon can help you build up fluid and might lead to urination.Fruit derivatives, like apple cider vinegar and cranberry juice, also serve as diuretics. You can drink cranberry juice straight before an appointment, and apple cider vinegar is an ingredient in many salad dressings., Certain herbs promote urination and can be used as natural diuretics if you need to induce urination.


The antioxidants in parsley can promote urination.Not only can cilantro promote urination, it can also lower blood pressure and regulates the digestive system.Garlic has a variety of health benefits, such as bolstering the immune system, and may also serve as a healthy, natural diuretic.Ginger helps get rid of fluid build-up and adding it to foods as a spice may increase urination., Fruits and herbs are not the only natural diuretics available. Certain vegetables might also promote urination.


Cucumbers and celery have heavy water content, which can increase the amount you need to pee.Carrots are an easy food to snack on and might contribute to more frequent urination. Having a carrot or a cup of baby carrots before a urine test might help you urinate more.Cabbage, like cucumbers, has a high water content that promotes urination., Teas and coffees promote frequent urination and having a cup of green tea or black coffee before a urine test might help you pee. However, be careful about overdoing it with caffeine, especially before a doctor's appointment. Caffeine can cause a temporary spike in blood pressure, and you want to make sure you get an accurate reading at the doctor's office., Hard, difficult to pass stool can push against the bladder and urethra, making it difficult to pass urine.Add more fiber to your diet, exercise more, and visit the doctor if constipation does not improve.


Avoid holding in bowel movements, which can make constipation worse.

Practice progressive muscular relaxation.,
Find a way to distract yourself.,
Hold your breath.,
Seek psychiatric treatment.",How to Make Yourself Pee3," Many people have trouble urinating in public places. If this is the case with you, engaging in certain relaxation techniques can help you calm down enough to use a public restroom.


If you find ways to distance yourself from the act of urination, your body will carry out its natural functions. Calming yourself via progressive muscular relaxation can help with this.Relax different muscle groups at a time. Start by relaxing your neck and shoulders, and then move down to your arms, torso, and hips. Keep going until you've loosened up your legs and shins. Focus on the different muscle groups and not on the fact you're using a public restroom. This will relax your muscles, helping you use the bathroom, and also distract you from the act of urinating., Much like relaxation techniques, finding ways to not think about the act of urinating can help the process happen. Find a distraction when you have to use a public restroom


If you have a smart phone, reading a news article or listening to a song on your headphones can be a helpful distraction.You can also distract yourself with your own thoughts. Have a go-to image, song, line, or sound to consider while urinating. For example, you could imagine a location you find calming, like your childhood bedroom. You could also try to recite the lyrics to a song you know. Anything to get your mind off of using the restroom is key., Holding your breath increases the levels of carbon dioxide in your system, which can help reduce your overall stress level.


Exhale about 75% of your breath and then hold the rest. Try holding your breath in for about 45 seconds.Repeat the process and see if it helps. Some people find this actually increases their overall anxiety, so it's a good idea to test out these kinds of breathing exercises before trying them in public., If you have frequent or intense anxiety about urinating in public and it leads to discomfort at work or in social situations, you could seek out psychiatric treatment for your issues.


Shy bladders have been successfully treated with behavioral therapies, drugs, and hypnotherapy. Your psychiatrist will work with you to find the best treatment option given your existing psychiatric and medical history.You can find a psychiatrist by going through your insurance provider or try to find a free or reduced rate clinic in your area. If you're a college student, you can go through your college or university.

Make an appointment with your doctor.,
Seek emergency care, if necessary.,
Try medications.,
Have a doctor determine what is causing your urination issues.",How to Make Yourself Pee4," If you're having unusual problems urinating, you should make an appointment with your regular physician to figure out if there is a medical cause to your problem.


Your doctor will perform a medical and physical examination. If you are male, your doctor will probably perform a prostate exam.If the doctor feels a urine test is necessary; she may use a catheter to release urine. This is a tube that goes up the urethra and drains urine into a bag.Blood tests may also be needed to check for any signs of infections.Treatment depends on the problem's cause, but a variety of medications can be used to treat urinary problems., The inability to urinate can occasionally be a medical emergency that requires immediate care. Go to the emergency room if you experience any of the following problems:


Acute and painful feelings in the bladder or stomach could be a sign of a severe bladder obstruction. See a doctor immediately as you may need an emergency catheter to drain urine.Sudden and painful urine retention can be severe. Damage to the bladder and kidneys may occur without emergency treatment, so it's important to get to the ER as soon as possible., A variety of medications are used to treat urinary problems. Ask your doctor what medications she recommends.


Alpha receptor blockers are one class of medication used to treat urinary problems. They work by relaxing the muscles in the bladder and reducing whatever is obstructing urine flow. They are usually used for long-term issues with urine retention, especially enlarged prostates in men.These drugs include 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors and antimuscarinic drugs for urinary incontinence.
5-alpha reductase inhibitors shrink the size of the prostate gland, so such medications are only prescribed to men. They may take weeks or even months to work depending on how long it takes them to successfully shrink the prostate gland., If you have difficulty voiding, then there is usually a medical condition that is causing this to occur. Your doctor will want to do some test including a urine sample to make sure that you do not have an infection and that your urine is in working order.


Men who have a hard time urinating they may suffer from urinary incontinence. This is usually due to an enlarged prostate on physical examination. Risk factors for urinary incontinence include advanced age. The older you get, the more likely you are going to have problems going to the restroom.
Prostate disease is another concern especially those who have a history of prostate surgery or radiation.
A history of urinary tract infections can also lead to problems with urinating. You may have scars from the infections including strictures and fistula formation.
Further, physical limitation is also a risk factor for people that have a hard time peeing.
Neurological disease lead to urinary retention and problems with peeing. This includes problems with the CNS, spinal cord, stroke, or impaired cognition.
Further conditions including diabetes, sleep apnea, depression, and constipation lead to problems with urinary incontinence.

Choose a hypertonic drink if you need extra carbohydrates.,
Gather your ingredients.,
Add four cups (about one Liter) of drinkable water into a pitcher.Start by pouring the drinking water into the pitcher.,
Pour in two cups (about 500 mL) of fruit juice or tea.Next, you can add your fruit juice.,
Stir in a pinch of salt.",How to Make Your Own Fluid Replacement Drink2," Hypertonic fluid replacement drinks contain more sugar, so they are ideal for replenishing fluids and calories following a heavy workout. A hypertonic drink is one that has more salt than normal cells, so it will draw water out of those cells with osmosis.These drinks can also be helpful for restoring energy during and after a long-distance run, such as a marathon. However due to the higher concentration of sugar the water in these drinks is not as easily absorbed and are best used in combination with an isotonic drink to rehydrate and refuel after a workout.Hypertonic drinks can also be useful as part of a weight gain regimen, but make sure that you also add more calories from food. They are especially useful for gaining weight because they supply more calories and carbohydrates.

, Making a hypertonic fluid replacement drink is easy. To make a hypertonic fluid replacement drink, you will need:


4 cups or (one Liter) of water
2 cups of fruit juice (any kind) OR 2 cups of tea and 5 tablespoons of sugar
a pinch of salt

, You will need about four cups (about one liter) of water to make the drink.It is best to use room temperature or slightly warm water so that you can easily dissolve the salt.

, This fluid replacement drink contains more juice because it needs to have a higher glucose level.If you are using tea instead, then you will need to add extra sugar to ensure that the drink contains enough glucose.


If you are using tea, then add about five tablespoons of sugar to the tea while it is still warm. Mix the sugar with the tea until it completely dissolves.

, To complete your drink, just add in a pinch of salt.Get a pinch of salt between your thumb and index finger, add it to the pitcher, and then stir the ingredients together. Your fluid replacement drink is ready to drink!

Choose a hypotonic drink for trying to keep your weight down.,
Gather your ingredients.,
Measure out four cups (about one liter) of water.You will need about four cups or one liter of room temperature or slightly warm water.,
Measure out ½ of a cup (about 100 mL) of fruit juice.Next, add the juice to the pitcher.,
Sprinkle in a pinch of salt.To complete your fluid replacement drink, take a pinch of salt and add it to the pitcher.,
Chill and serve the drink.",How to Make Your Own Fluid Replacement Drink3," A hypotonic fluid replacement drink contains fewer calories and is best for athletes who are trying to maintain a certain weight or for those who are trying to lose weight.Hypotonic drinks have less salt than normal cells do, so water goes into the cell more easily than if you drank a hypertonic drink.They are good for losing or maintaining weight because they contain fewer calories and carbohydrates as well as less sugar.For example, if you are a gymnast or a boxer trying to stay within a low weight class, then a hypotonic drink might be ideal.

, Hypotonic fluid replacement drinks contain less glucose than other types. To make a hypotonic fluid replacement drink, you will need:4 cups or (one Liter) of water
½ of a cup (about 100 mL) of fruit juice (any kind)
a pinch of salt

, Make sure that the water is suitable for drinking. Measure out the water and add the water to a pitcher.

, You will need about ½ of a cup or 100 mL of fruit juice. Pour the juice into the pitcher with the water.

, Then stir the ingredients together until they are well combined.

, Place the pitcher in the refrigerator for a few hours or until it is cool. When the drink is cool, it is ready to use. Pour some of the hypotonic drink into a water bottle or glass and enjoy!

Get a plastic lid.,
Trim off the sides and lips of the lid.,
Bend it into a funnel shape.",How to Make an Easy StP (Stand to Pee) Device1," You can make an STP device very easily at home, but you will need to practice using before you try it when you are out. To make a “coffee can lid” device you need to get hold of the plastic lid from a coffee can, or something similar, such as a lid from a yoghurt pot. These plastic lids are good choices because they are flexible enough to bend, and the plastic makes them easy to clean., Once you have the lid, you will need to carefully cut off the edges and any lips around the edge of the lid. You want to trim the lid so that you are left with a smooth and flat disc.Make sure the disc you are left with is still large enough for you to use effectively.

, When you have your flat disc all you need to do is to roll it into a funnel shape. You will just need to pee into the funnel and the stream will come out of the narrow end."

Know your liver and kidneys may also be checked.",How to Diagnose Frontal Lobe Seizure," That is, seizures can cause a person to move in funny ways. For instance, you might see one arm stick straight out for no reason while the other one stays close to the body., This type of seizure, as with most seizures, can cause a person to move in a repetitive way. For instance, the arm might flex repeatedly, or the hips may thrust into the air. The person may rock back and forth or bicycle their legs. These kinds of movements, in coordination with the person being unresponsive to you, can indicate a seizure.These types of seizures can also cause muscle weakness., Because the frontal lobe controls movement, it can lead to strange contortions in the person's body, including her face. You may notice strange eye movement or the person making strange faces. For instance, the person may blink too much, twitch, or make chewing or swallowing motions., Ask the person a question. If the person can't talk to you or doesn't even seem to notice you are there, she may be having a seizure.However, not every seizure causes a person to be unresponsive. Sometimes, the person will stay conscious through the whole seizure., Often, frontal lobe seizures happen at night, when the person is sleeping. If you see the symptoms above when the person is sleeping, she might be having a seizure. Similarly, if you wake up suddenly with tense muscles or in an odd position, it could mean you've had a seizure, though it could also mean you had a bad dream., These type of seizures are often very short. In fact, most of the time, they last less than a minute. Keep an eye on the clock if you notice someone with these symptoms to see how long it lasts., Cluster seizures, or short bursts of seizures, sometimes occur with frontal lobe seizures. If you have several seizures in a row, it could be a symptom.If the person doesn't regain consciousness between seizures, she should be taken to a doctor, or you should call 911.

, Seizures often arise after trauma to the brain. However, other conditions can lead to seizures, as well, such as strokes, infections, or even tumors. Many conditions that cause an issue in your brain can lead to seizures.Nonetheless, many people have nothing else wrong with their brains and still develop seizures., If no one has observed you having a seizure, write down what you do experience. Maybe you notice you lose bits of time, or find yourself waking up in the middle of the night with sore muscles. Whatever symptoms you are experiencing, even if you think they aren't related, could be important., Make sure you bring up all your symptoms with your doctor. For instance, even random mood swings or strange sensations can be related to seizures. It's also important that you provide the doctor with information about the timing of the symptoms, as frontal lobe seizures often happen at night. Symptoms you may notice in yourself or others include:

Losing time.
Waking in odd positions.
Having sore muscles with no other explanation.
Mood swings.
Body contortions.
Unconsciousness.
Seizures while sleeping.
Repetitive facial movements such as twitching or chewing motions.
Several seizures in a row.
Odd body positions (such as one arm out).

, A complete medical history is necessary in order to determine the cause of the seizures. While these types of seizures do not always have a cause, they can be caused by head trauma, stroke, mental health, medications, or other brain abnormalities., If someone has a seizure that lasts more than 5 minutes, you should take that person to the emergency room. Call 911 if you've been watching the clock while someone was seizing or even if you feel like the seizure has gone on too long but you didn't note the time., If you haven't been diagnosed with frontal lobe seizure, it is important to rule out other medical conditions. Seizures can be caused by other problems in the body, and blood tests will measure things like body chemistry and your blood sugar level.A blood test is done by obtaining drawing a sample of blood from you, usually from a vein found at the inner aspect of your elbow. The sample is then brought to the laboratory for analysis.
Patients with acute seizures should have blood tested for electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, glucose, calcium, magnesium, and liver function. Other tests should also be performed in anticipation of treatment, such as a complete blood count, differential, and platelets.
Part of the test, called the complete blood count, will measure the number of white blood cells, the number of red blood cells, the amount of hemoglobin, and how much of your blood is composed of red blood cells.The blood test should show normal values of electrolytes and other compounds that may affect brain function. For example, decreased levels of glucose and magnesium may lead to seizures.

, If your seizures start out of the blue, your doctor is going to want an MRI. An MRI will reveal if something else is going on with your brain, such as a tumor or lesions. It will also locate any unusual blood vessels. It is not a painful procedure.This test is a combination of radio waves and strong magnets, used to create an image of the soft tissue in your brain. You will lay down on a bench and be pushed into a donut shaped machine where you will need to be still for a period of time. The test can take an hour but generally isn't longer than an hour and a half. The machine will make loud noises.In some cases, the technician may inject an artificial dye into you to help create the image.
You must remove any metal on your body before entering the machine, such as jewelry, hairpins, watches, hearing aids, and underwire bras; talk to your doctor about any devices in your body, such as a pacemaker or artificial heart valve., This test measures the electrical activity in your brain, and it can show where the seizure is occurring. However, it really only gives your doctor information if she does the test while you're having a seizure. Even then, frontal lobe activity can be hard to detect. Your doctor may want you to stay overnight to detect seizure activity.For this test, the technician will attach electrodes to your scalp. It is also a painless procedure.On the day of the procedure, it's a good idea not to use any hair cream, styling gels, or spray, as it can keep the electrodes from sticking well.

, Often, your doctor will use blood or urine tests to check these organs. Mostly, these tests are done to rule out other problems that could lead to seizures."

Purchase a medical spoon.,
Make a hole in the end of the handle.,
Practice at home.",How to Make an Easy StP (Stand to Pee) Device2," A medical spoon is a cheap plastic device that you can buy at your local pharmacy. It has a broad open spoon-shaped end that is connected to a tube. You can use this as an STP device by peeing into the spoon end and directing the stream out of the end of the tube. You can convert a medical spoon into an STP device very easily., The tube end of the spoon is closed up, so to use it as an STP device you need make a hole in the end for the pee to come out of. There are a few ways you can do this. If you have a drill, you can drill a hole in the end of the tube. This will give you good control and allow you to direct the stream with some accuracy.Alternatively you can slice off the end of the tube. If you do this, you can use a lighter to warm the plastic and make it easier to cut.After slicing off the end of the tube, you can use the lighter to ensure that there are no sharp edges., After you have made your STP device, you should be sure that you spend some time at home practicing with it. It can be a strange experience at first, and leaks and mess can happen if you are uncertain. Practice using it in the bath, shower, or toilet at home before you try using it in a men’s room.

Buy a packer.,
Get a medicine spoon and some plastic tubing.,
Make a hole in the packer.,
Push the tubing through.",How to Make an Easy StP (Stand to Pee) Device3," If you prefer to have something that you keep in your pants and looks more like a penis, you can use a packer. Packers are silicon penis shaped objects that you can put in your pants. Using a packer can be a more subtle way to STP, than using a more basic device, such as the medicine spoon.


You can buy packers from numerous stores online. Search for ""packers"" and choose the size and colour you want.
You can get a packer for around $10-$15.Ensure you buy a soft packer.

, You can make a packer into an STP device cheaply and quite easily at home. To do this you will also need to get a medicine spoon, and some relatively narrow plastic tubing. The tubing must be narrow enough to get through the penis, but wide enough so that you can attach it to the medicine spoon without any leaks.


3/8s of an inch is good size tubing to use. You can get this from your local hardware store.
Trim down the medicine spoon, and firmly attach the tubing to the end of it.The medicine tube and tubing will be the channel your pee travels down, through the packer to the urinal.

, You need to get this tube through the packer, and to do this you need to make a hole in the packer. You can use any long sharp object, such as a screwdriver, or a tent peg. Make sure the object you are using to make the hole is longer than the packer.Carefully but firmly push the screwdriver through the packer, taking care to ensure that it comes out around where the urethra is.
Once you have skewered the packer, leave the screwdriver in there.
If you are struggling to pierce the packer, you can try heating the piercing device first.

, Now place the tubing and spoon over the end of the screwdriver and work it back through the hole you have just made in the packer. This will take some careful manoeuvring and some brute force, but it will go through eventually. Soft packers are very malleable so they will stand being squeezed and pushed around while you get the tubing through.


Once you have gotten the tubing through, the medicine spoon end, which you will pee into, should be protruding sufficiently to use.
The end of tube should be the right at the front end of the penis, where the urethra is.
You may need to roll the end of the packer back a little when you use it to ensure that the tubing is sticking out of the packer enough to avoid any accidents."

Rinse it after each use.,
Store it in a zip-lock bag.,
Soak it in a disinfectant solution.",How to Make an Easy StP (Stand to Pee) Device4," It’s important to keep your STP device clean, and rinse it off after every use. If you don’t, you will be carrying around an unpleasant smell that can transfer to your clothes. The plastic homemade STP devices are simple to quickly rinse off. The plastic means that the any urine will bead up on the surface and be washed off easily.You can rinse it with a little soap when you are washing your hands.

, When you are carrying the STP device around with you, it’s best to try and keep it in a small zip-lock bag. This way any unpleasant aromas or drips will be contained in the bag. If you get a small zip-lock bag, such as a freezer or sandwich bag, you will still be able to keep the STP device in your back pocket.


You can also use alcohol wipes or hand sanitizer to disinfect the device after each use., You need to take extra steps to ensure that your STP device is kept clean and you limit the risk of infection. Every night you should soak it in a solution that will thoroughly clean it, ready for the next day. Get a bowl and mix up half a cup of 2% or 3% hydrogen peroxide, and a teaspoon of antibacterial soap, in three cups of hot water.


Place your device into the solution and leave it to soak for a few hours.
Take it out and rinse it thoroughly.
Put it on the side and let it air dry."

Limit purine-rich foods.,
Increase your intake of phytate-rich foods.,
Include dairy products in your diet.,
Eat vitamin C-rich foods or add a vitamin C supplement.,
Stay hydrated.,
Drink green tea.,
Sip some tart cherry juice.,
Include a moderate amount of coffee.",How to Lower Uric Acid Levels with Diet1," The best way to reduce uric acid levels is to limit the amounts of purine-rich foods in your diet.Purines are chemicals that form when your body breaks down certain types of food, but a high level of purines can lead to conditions like gout and kidney stones.You should avoid purine-rich foods if you have had gout or uric acid-containing kidney stones or if you have a family history of these conditions. Do not exceed more than two to four servings of any of these foods per week and avoid them completely during a bout with gout or if you have uric-acid-containing kidney stones. Purine-rich foods to limit or avoid include:Beer and liquor
Sugary soft drinks
Fatty foods such as fried foods, butter, margarine, and high-fat dairy products
Organ meats such as liver, kidneys, and sweetbreads
Beef, chicken, pork, bacon, veal, and venison
Anchovies, sardines, herring, mussels, codfish, scallops, trout, haddock, crab, oyster, lobster, and shrimp;
, Phytate is a substance that seems to prevent the formation of many types of kidney stones, including those caused by uric acid. Include two to three servings of phytate-rich foods every day. Phytate-rich foods include:Beans
Legumes
Whole grains

, Make sure that you include calcium-rich foods in your diet, such as low-fat dairy products. Include one to two servings of calcium rich foods per day. Calcium rich foods include:Milk
Yogurt
Cheese

, Getting enough vitamin C may also help to lower uric acid levels. Try eating a couple servings of foods that are rich in Vitamin C each day or talk to your doctor about including a vitamin C supplement to help lower your uric acid levels.Foods that are rich in vitamin C include:Citrus fruits such as oranges, grapefruit, lemons, and limes
Kiwi fruit
Berries
Cantaloupe
Pineapple
Mango
Papaya
Broccoli
Peppers
Sweet and white potatoes
Tomatoes
Leafy greens such as spinach, cabbage, and turnip greens
Cauliflower
Winter squash

, Drinking plenty of water can also help to reduce uric acid in your blood. For most people, the recommended amount is six to eight 8-ounce glasses glasses of water every day. Talk to your doctor for a specific recommendation on how much water you should be drinking every day., Green tea has been shown to decrease the risk of uric acid-containing kidney stones. Try to drink about two to three cups of green tea per day to help lower your uric acid levels., Tart cherry juice has long been used in naturopathic medicine to treat gout and kidney stones. If you have an attack of gout, drink three to four eight ounce glasses or organic, tart cherry juice. This should provide some relief within 12 – 24 hours.


Eating cherries can also help. Try including a serving of cherries in your diet each day., Drinking coffee in moderation has been shown to decrease uric acid in your blood. Try to include a cup or two of coffee per day to help lower your uric acid levels."

Purchase a measuring cup.,
Keep a fluid diary.,
Tabulate your number of trips to the bathroom.,
Download an app.",How to Know if You're Urinating Too Often1," You will need this in order to accurately measure and track your urine output. You can purchase a urination-measuring cup from your local pharmacy. Most pharmacies and drug stores carry urinals for men to measure their urine output, as well.Measuring cups for urination measure the volume of your urine in cubic centimeters (1 ml = 1 cc).;
, Each time you use the restroom, record the time of day, how much you urinated, and your fluid intake and type. For your fluid intake, measure how many ounces you drink between trips to the bathroom. Keep a record for at least three days where a day equals a 24-hour period. The days do not need to be consecutive; however, pick days that will be easy for you to record.By measuring out your liquids before consuming them, you can accurately calculate your fluid intake. Use measuring cups to measure your fluid intake.
For example, write: 10 a.m., 3 cc, 8 oz of tea.
You can also record your urgency level on a scale of 1 to 3 where 1 is mild, 2 is moderate, and 3 is severe.

, Urination frequency during the day should be tracked separately from urination frequency during the night.You will also need to calculate the volume of your fluid intake. Do this for each 24-hour period. Taken together, compare these results to the urination frequency of an average adult. These results will help you or your doctor determine if your urination frequency and volume is normal.For example, urinating eight to nine times while consuming 2,000 ml of fluid during a 24-hour period is considered normal.

, Applications like Pee Tracker and iP Voiding Diary can help you track your urination frequency and volume, as well as fluid intake. Applications are helpful alternatives if you do not want to manually fill out a diary or chart.However, you will still need to purchase a measuring cup to measure the volume of your urine.

Explain the process to the patient before beginning.,
Ask the patient to lie on on their back.,
Wash your hands and put on sterile gloves.,
Open the catheter assembly.,
Sterilize and prepare the patient's genital area.,
Apply lubricant to the tip of the catheter.,
If the patient is female, hold the labia open and insert the catheter into the urethral meatus.,
If the patient is male, hold the penis and insert the catheter into the urethral opening.,
Continue pushing until the catheter sits in the bladder.,
If using a balloon catheter, inflate the balloon with sterile water.,
Connect the catheter to the drainage bag.",How to Insert a Catheter," Most patients are not used to inserting any object, let alone a long tube, into their urethra. Though this isn't always described as ""painful,"" it is often described as ""uncomfortable,"" even intensely so. Out of respect for the patient, explain the steps of the procedure to him or her before beginning.


Explaining the steps and what to expect can also help the patient relax and avoid anxiety.;
, The patient's legs should be spread and their feet should be together. Lying in a supine position relaxes the bladder and urethra, facilitating easier catheter insertion. A tense urethra compresses the catheter, which results in resistance during insertion, causing pain and sometimes even damage to the underlying tissue of the urethra. In severe cases, this may cause bleeding.


Assist the patient in getting into the supine position if necessary.

, Gloves are an important part of the PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) health care workers use to protect themselves and the patient during medical procedures. In the case of catheter insertion, sterile gloves help ensure that bacteria are not introduced into the urethra and that the patient's bodily fluids do not come into contact with your hands.

, Single-use catheters come in sealed, sterile kits. Before opening the kit, ensure you have the correct catheter for your purposes. You will need a catheter that is the correct size for your patient. Catheters are rated for size in units called French (1 French = 1/3 mm)and are available in sizes from 12 (small) to 48 (large) French.


Smaller catheters are usually better for the patient's comfort, but larger catheters may be necessary to drain thick urine or to ensure the catheter stays in place.
Some catheters also have specialized tips that allow them to serve different functions. For instance, a type of catheter called a Foley catheter is usually used for draining urine because it includes a balloon attachment which can be inflated to secure the catheter behind the bladder neck.
Gather medical-grade disinfectant, cotton swabs, surgical drapes, lubricant, water, tubing, a drainage bag, and tape. All items should be properly cleaned and/or sterilized.

, Scrub the patient's genital area with disinfectant-soaked cotton swabs. Rinse or scrub the area with sterile water or alcohol to remove any debris. Repeat as needed. When finished, lay down surgical drapes around the genitals, leaving a space for access to the penis or vagina.


For female patients, be sure to clean the labia and urethral meatus (the outside of the opening of the urethra located above the vagina). For men, clean the urethral opening on the penis.
Cleaning should be done from inside to outside so as not to contaminate the urethra. In other words, start at the urethral opening and gently work your way outward in a circular fashion.

, Coat the distal portion of the catheter (the 0.78-1.97 in (2-5 cm) portion at the tip) with a generous amount of lubricant. This is the end you will insert into the urethral opening. If using a balloon catheter, be sure to lubricate the balloon portion at the tip as well.

, Hold the catheter in your dominant hand and use your non-dominant hand to spread the patient's labia so that you are able to see the urethral opening. Gently insert the tip of the catheter into the urethra.

, Hold the penis in your non-dominant hand and gently pull upward, perpendicular to the patient's body. Insert the tip of the catheter into the patient's urethra with your dominant hand.

, The length of the catheter should be gently fed through the urethra and into the bladder until urine is observed. After urine begins to flow, continue to push the catheter into the bladder another 2 inches (5.08 cm) to make sure the catheter is against the neck of the bladder.

, Use a water-filled syringe to inflate the balloon via sterile tubing connected to the catheter. The inflated balloon serves as an anchor so as not to displace the catheter when moving. Once inflated, pull gently on the catheter to ensure the balloon is seated snugly against the neck of the bladder.


The amount of sterile water you use to inflate the balloon depends on the size of the balloon on the catheter. Usually, about 10 cc of water is required, but check the size of your balloon to be sure.

, Use sterile medical tubing to allow urine to drain into a drainage bag. Secure the catheter to the patient's thigh or abdomen with tape.


Make sure you place the drainage bag lower than the patient's bladder. Catheters work via gravity - urine cannot drain ""uphill.""
In a medical environment, catheters can be left in for as long as 12 weeks before being changed, though they are often removed much earlier. Some catheters, such as a straight or intermittent catheter, for instance, are removed immediately after urine stops flowing.

Determine if you have any pain that may be related to kidney stones.,
Check for changes in your urine’s color or smell.,
Identify any changes in urination habits.,
Pay attention to nausea.,
Watch for severe symptoms.",How to Know if You Have Kidney Stones1," Pain is one of the most common symptoms of kidney stones, so you may notice it before anything else. Pain from a kidney stone is usually very sharp and severe and can even be incapacitating. You might feel pain in different places and at different times. If you have kidney stones, then you may feel pain that:Is near your groin and lower abdomen
Is located on the side of your back around your ribs
Comes and goes, but will worsen over time
Becomes more intense and then less intense
Happens when you try to urinate;
, Changes in your urine may also signal that you have kidney stones. To determine if you have kidney stones, watch for urine that is:Brown, red, or pink in color
Cloudy
Bad smelling

, Changes in how often you need to urinate can also signal that you may have kidney stones. You may have kidney stones if you:Feel like you need to urinate even if you just went
Find yourself going to the bathroom more often that is normal for you

, Sometimes kidney stones may cause you to feel nauseous or even to vomit. If you have been nauseous and/or vomiting, then this may also indicate that you have kidney stones., If you notice any severe symptoms, then you should go to an emergency room as soon as possible to get treatment. Severe symptoms to watch for include:Severe pain that makes it impossible to get comfortable
Pain that is accompanied by nausea and vomiting or fever and chills
Bloody urine
Having a hard time urinating at all

Don't wait to see your doctor until these conditions begin causing serious problems — seeing your physician early can help prevent many issues and can hep you make good choices for your self-care. You can safely make dietary changes on your own, but it is always best to keep your physician informed of your self-care approaches.

, Gout is a painful arthritic condition that results when uric acid salts deposit in joints. The most common joint in gout is at the base of the big toe, but it can also affect the joints of the feet, ankles, knees, hands, and wrists. The joints affected become red, inflamed, swollen and painful. It occurs more often in men, but postmenopausal women have a higher risk as well.

, Kidney stones can form from uric acid and can cause kidney damage and disease.Uric acid-containing kidney stones can be very painful and are the most common type of kidney stone in children.Kidney stones may cause significant symptoms which include:Severe, sharp pain
Nausea
Vomiting
Blood in the urine
Sweating
Fever
Cloudy urine

, Even though diet plays a major role in uric acid levels, anyone can have high levels of uric acid in the blood. Adult men and postmenopausal women have the highest risk. Other risk factors include:Obesity or being overweight
Untreated high blood pressure, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, heart disease, and kidney disease
Some medications including diuretics, low dose aspirin, immunosuppressant drugs
Family history of gout
Recent surgery or trauma

Be aware of urinating more than eight times during the day.,
Expect more frequent urination if you are older.,
Be mindful that medications and diuretics can affect urination frequency.,
Be aware of volume.,
Calculate your appropriate fluid intake.",How to Know if You're Urinating Too Often2," The average person urinates about six to seven times in a 24-hour period. It is still normal to urinate eight times during the day and once during the night. Urinating more than twice during the night is not normal, however.The average person does not urinate more than two cups every two hours, or more than 10 times after drinking two liters., As you get older, the tissues in your bladder become tough, and as a result, are less flexible. Additionally, you bladder muscles get weaker as you age. Combined, these factors can cause older individuals, i.e., 55 years and older, to urinate more frequently.Contact a doctor if you urinate more than twice during the night.

, If you are taking medications, consider the effects these medications can have on your urination frequency. Double-check the side effects with your doctor. Additionally, diuretics like caffeine can irritate your bladder causing you to urinate frequently.By reducing your caffeine intake, you can reduce your urination frequency.
Alcohol is also a bladder irritant that can cause you to urinate frequently., While you are tracking the frequency of your trips to the bathroom, you should also be tracking the volume of urine you produce. If you are urinating more than 2.5 liters (2,500 cc or ml) per day, then you may have an excessive amount of urine, known as polyuria. This should be addressed by your doctor, as the underlying cause could be serious (such as diabetes or kidney problems)., Drinking too much water, juice, and other liquids relative to your size may also cause you to urinate frequently. The amount of liquids you should drink per day depends on your weight. Calculate your appropriate fluid intake by multiplying your weight by 0.5. The number you arrive it is how many ounces you should be drinking per day.For example, if you weigh 120 pounds, then multiply 120 by 0.5. This equals 60. Therefore, you should be drinking 60 ounces of liquids per day.
If you work out, add 12 ounces of liquids for every 30 minutes you exercise. So if the person in the above example exercises for 30 minutes, they should be drinking 72 oz total (60 + 12 = 72).

Monitor how many caffeinated beverages you consume.,
Retain your urine longer.,
Determine if you have an overactive bladder.,
Contact your urologist.",How to Know if You're Urinating Too Often3," Because caffeine is a diuretic, consuming coffee, tea, sodas, and other caffeinated beverages can cause you to urinate frequently. Additionally, some drugs and medications have diuretic-like symptoms, for example medications that treat high blood pressure.Alcohol is another type of drug that could be causing you to urinate frequently.

, While some people use the restroom at the slightest urge, others wait until their bladders are a little fuller before using the restroom. For the individuals that go at the slightest urge, you can train your bladder to hold your urine longer.Train your bladder by waiting until the urge becomes strong before using the restroom. If the urge becomes painful then you are waiting too long. Increase your bladder’s tolerance gradually over a four-week period. This is only recommended for individuals who do not have incontinence issues.

Kegel exercises may also help you retrain your bladder.

, The symptoms of an overactive bladder include urinating frequently, inability to postpone the need to urinate (urinary urgency), urine leakage (incontinence), and urinating more than twice during the night. Consult your doctor if these symptoms apply to you.Weak pelvic muscles, nerve damage, medication, caffeine, a urinary tract infection, excess weight, and estrogen deficiency can all cause your bladder to become overactive.

, If your urination frequency is interfering with your daily routine and you are unsure as to why the frequency has increased, then consult your urologist. Bring your fluid chart with you and discuss your symptoms with your doctor. Your urologist will be able to diagnose you based off of your symptoms and other factors.Contact your urologist immediately if you experience pain when urinating, pain in your abdomen or groin, loss of bladder control, dark brown urine, blood in the urine, fever, and trouble urinating.

Consider your medical history.,
Ask family members about their medical history.,
Drink more water.,
Follow a healthy diet.,
Lose weight if you are overweight or obese.,
Identify any medical conditions or surgeries that may have put you at risk.",How to Know if You Have Kidney Stones2," The strongest risk factor is a history of kidney stones. If you have already had a kidney stone, you have a greater risk of developing more.It is important that you take measures to reduce any other other risk factors.

, If someone in your family has had kidney stones, then you may be at higher risk of having kidney stones as well.Consider your family member’s experiences with kidney stones as you think about whether or not you may have them.

, Not drinking enough water is another risk factor in developing kidney stones.Water helps to dissolve minerals that may form kidney stones in your body. The more water you drink, the less likely it is that these minerals will cling to each other and form stones.

, Eating an unhealthy diet can also increase your risk of developing kidney stones. If you eat a lot of protein and/or a lot of salty, sugary food, then you are at higher risk of developing kidney stones.Think about what you eat in a typical day to determine if this is one of your risk factors.


Recent recommendations are to avoid sodas containing phosphoric, such as colas, as these increase the risk of kidney stones., Being obese is another risk factor for kidney stones.You are considered obese if your BMI is 30 or higher.Check your weight and BMI to determine whether or not this may be one of your risk factors for kidney stones.


Keep in mind that if you have recently gained weight, then you may also be at risk of developing kidney stones, even if you are not obese., Some medical conditions and surgeries can also put you at higher risk of developing kidney stones. Consider your recent medical history to determine if any medical conditions or surgeries may have increased your risk for kidney stones. Some conditions and surgeries that can increase your risk of kidney stones include:Inflammatory bowel disease
Gastric bypass surgery
Chronic diarrhea
Hyperparathyroidism
Urinary tract infection
Cystinuria

See your doctor for a diagnosis.,
Follow your doctor’s instructions for treatment.,
Take over-the-counter pain relievers to cope with pain.",How to Know if You Have Kidney Stones3," Kidney stones can become more severe and painful if left untreated. If you think that you may have kidney stones, then you should see a doctor as soon as possible. Your doctor can diagnose your kidney stones based on your symptoms, a blood or urine test, or by using imaging such as a CT scan.Getting a CT scan is the most accurate way to determine if you have kidney stones. Your doctor can also use the results of the kidney stones to determine where the stones are at and how big they are., If you are diagnosed with kidney stones, then your doctor will recommend the best course of treatment for your situation. This may include drinking plenty of water in order to help pass the kidney stones or administering special medications to help you pass the stones.


If you kidney stones are large, then your doctor may need to use something called “extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy” or ESWL. This procedure breaks large stones into smaller ones so that you can pass them more easily.Your doctor can also use a scope to break up a stone that is trapped in your ureter and make it easier for your body to pass.Be aware that surgery may be required for severe cases of kidney stones that do not respond to other forms of treatment., If your pain is severe, then your doctor may prescribe a prescription pain-killer. But in less severe cases of kidney stones, an over-the-counter pain killer will help to numb the pain.You may take ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or aspirin depending on your medical needs and personal preferences.
Ask your doctor for a recommendation if you are not sure what to take.
Read and follow the product instructions for any medicine that you take.

Visit your doctor for a prostate exam after age 50.,
Adjust your bathroom habits.,
Take saw palmetto extract.,
Take prescription medications for mild symptoms.,
Have surgery for moderate to severe symptoms.,
Have your prostate surgically removed.",How to Increase Urine Flow1," The prostate is a gland in men that sits low in the abdomen, and when it gets enlarged it squeezes the urethra. This causes slow flow, difficulty starting to urinate, dribbling, and a weak stream. It is very common for men to get enlarged prostates after the age of 60.This condition is called Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH, which is a noncancerous enlargement of the prostate. If you have urinary trouble, see your doctor to be checked for BPH.


BPH is very common, but prostate cancer – though much less common – can also enlarge your prostate and cause urinary symptoms. It’s important to have your prostate checked regularly starting at age 50 (or earlier if a relative had prostate cancer).;
, There are several simple changes that you can make to your bathroom habits to help minimize your symptoms. Some things to try include:Go twice. Try to empty your bladder twice each time you go to the bathroom.
Relax and take your time. Try taking some deep breaths while you wait for your urine to start flowing. Give yourself plenty of time and don’t worry if it takes a while. Try reading a magazine or a book while you wait.
Sit down to urinate. If you usually urinate standing up, then sitting down might help to relax you and make it easier for you to urinate.
Turn on the faucet. The sound of running water may also help you to go. If this isn’t an option, then try to imagine the sound of running water.
Stay hydrated. You might be frustrated with your low urine flow and want to avoid urinating as much as possible, but not drinking enough water can make matters worse. Drink water throughout the day and avoid drinking it late in the evening so you won’t have to get up as much during the night.
Avoid dehydrating substances. Anything that may lead to dehydration can make it harder for you to urinate. Avoid alcohol and any medications that can dehydrate you or make urination difficult. Ask your doctor if you are not sure what medications may cause problems for you.

, Purchase saw palmetto extract as a supplement from your drug store or health foods store.Saw palmetto is a palm-like plant that has been used medicinally for decades.Some men find this supplement improves their symptoms of BPH, though it’s not scientifically proven to help. Discuss using any medications or supplements with your doctor beforehand.


Buy saw palmetto extract in 160mg capsules and take one twice a day, unless directed otherwise by your doctor. Check the label carefully and be sure to get a product that contains “85-95% fatty acids and sterols.”

, Alpha-blockers are most commonly prescribed for men with mildly distressing symptoms. These can cause low blood pressure and dizziness when going from sitting to standing, so be careful when you start taking these medications. They include tamsulosin (Flomax), terazosin (Hytrin), doxazosin (Cardura), alfuzosin (Uroxatral), and silodosin (Rapaflo).Your doctor may also prescribe an alpha-reductase inhibitor (a type of anti-androgen) like finasteride (Proscar) or dutasteride (Avodart) for larger prostates.If you take Viagra or another medication for erectile dysfunction, do not take terazosin or doxazosin unless directed to do so by a doctor.

, There are several medical procedures that either remove or destroy some of the prostate by going through your urethra. You will be sedated or anesthetized so you won’t feel any pain during the procedure, and may stay overnight in the hospital or may go home the same day. You and your doctor will decide which of these is the best procedure for you:TURP, or transurethral resection of the prostate: parts of the prostate are removed to improve flow; this may cause sexual side effects like trouble ejaculating.
Prostate ablation: parts of the prostate are burned away with heat or light; this is better for men with medical issues, as it causes less bleeding than the TURP.
Some minimally invasive procedures have fewer side effects and can be done in a day, though urinary trouble may recur afterwards: widening of the urethra with an incision in the prostate, radiofrequency ablation, microwave thermotherapy, or a prostatic lift.

, If you are generally healthy and your prostate is very large, over 100g, or causes very severe urinary symptoms that affect your quality of life, you can have your prostate removed with surgery.You may need surgery if you have frequent blood in your urine, recurring urinary tract infections, bladder stones, kidney problems, or the inability to urinate."

Drink lots of water.,
Drinking citrus soda to help prevent kidney infection is also useful - often kidney infections can lead from bladder infections.,
Take vitamin C daily.,
Avoid taking bubble baths.,
Urinate.,
Avoid wearing thongs.,
Wipe the right way.",How to Lessen the Likelihood of Kidney Infection," Cranberry juice has been touted as useful for urinary tract problems, but in some cases it can be an irritant instead of a help. Water is best. Three to four quarts a day is how much you should aim for.;
, Cranberry extract or pure cranberry juice is also useful, however cranberry can aggravate the condition in certain cases. Drinking apple cider vinegar is also a good preventative measure.

, The dose is variable. Some people can only tolerate 500mg a day, others take 4 to 5 grams without problem; check with your doctor first but a good dose is around a gram a day. This helps keep urine acid and prevent growth of organisms.

, The sudsy water helps break down the protective mucus at the opening of your urethra and allows germs to get in.

, For females: after intercourse, get up and urinate as soon as you reasonably can. Urinating rinses away any germs which may have gotten to the urethra.

, They provide a moist trail right from your anus to the urethra and those E. coli travel right to it. Instead, wear cotton underpants or at least cotton crotch panties. Cotton allows moisture to evaporate and prevents having a perfect environment for growth of organisms.

, After using the toilet, be sure to wipe from front to back, so as not to drag germs from the anal area to your urethra.

Be aware the symptoms of a kidney stone vary by age.,
Seek medical attention if your baby or toddler cries continuously and appears to have abdominal pain.,
Notice if your older child complains about lower abdominal pain.,
Take your older child to the doctor if there is blood in their urine.,
Bring your child to a doctor if it hurts when they pee.,
Check if your family has a history of kidney stones.,
Look at your child’s diet and any medications they are taking.,
Monitor any congenital abnormalities of your child’s kidneys or urinary tract, as well as any hereditary diseases.,
Allow your child’s doctor to do an x-ray on their abdomen.,
Let your child’s doctor do an ultrasound or sonogram on their abdomen.,
Get a referral for a CT scan for your child.,
Make sure your child drinks a lot of fluids.,
Give your child acetaminophen or ibuprofen to help with their pain.,
Be aware most kidney stones are caused by certain dietary minerals and substances that form solid crystals.,
Limit your child’s salt intake or amount of salty foods they eat.,
Monitor your child’s intake of foods high in purines.,
Keep an eye on your child’s intake of foods rich in phosphates.,
Avoid eliminating any foods completely from your child’s diet until you get a diagnosis.",How to Know if Your Child Has Kidney Stones," Most of the symptoms result from extreme pain occurring as the stone passes down your child’s ureter (the tube between the kidney and bladder) or from the sudden pressure in your child’s kidney because the stone is blocking urine flow.;
, There are numerous conditions that may cause these symptoms, including a kidney stone.It may be hard to tell if your infant or young child has a kidney stone, as they may only show general symptoms like irritability, severe or prolonged crying, and vomiting.Your doctor or pediatrician should do a urinalysis on your infant or toddler. If unexplained microscopic blood is detected on a urinalysis, this may be the only tip off your child has a kidney stone.

, Older children with kidney stones will have symptoms similar to the symptoms of a kidney stone in an adult, including lower abdominal pain, usually only on one side, that could be severe and episodic (come and go).Abdominal pain may indicate that the stone is moving down your child’s urinary tract, or is blocking urine flow from their kidney.
Typically, your child will be unable to find a position that diminishes their pain. If your child is a boy, he may describe the pain as in, or radiating to, one of his testicles on the same side as the abdominal pain.
If they are experience pain on the right side of their abdominal, this can be a sign of appendicitis, especially when there is no blood in their urine.

, This could be a sign of several serious medical conditions, including kidney stones., The doctor should do a culture of their urine, as the stones may be an indication of a urine infection.You child may also experience nausea and vomiting when the pain becomes very severe.

, Your child may also be more susceptible to kidney stones if they have had one before., If your child is on a ketogenic diet, which is sometimes used to treat seizures, they may be more likely to develop kidney stones.Certain medications used regularly, including diuretics (furosemide, bumetanide), acetazolamide, cisplatinum, and allopurinol, can also lead to the development of kidney stones.

, If your child was born with issues like slow draining urine from their kidney or a kidney cystic disorder, they may be more susceptible to kidney stones.Hereditary diseases like cystic fibrosis, Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome, Bartter’s or Gitelman Syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease can all also lead to the development of kidney stones.

, Though this x-ray may be uncomfortable for your child, it can be easily and quickly done by a radiologist.Some kidney stones are dense enough to appear on an x-ray.

, An ultrasound study (sonogram) is moderately sensitive to stones in your child’s kidney and bladder, but cannot detect if there are any stones in your child’s ureter.However, it is safe and non-invasive screening test for stones.

, A CT (computerized tomography) scan uses x-rays to get 3 dimensional images of the entire urinary tract. A CT is very sensitive and can usually detect stones that are not clear in x-rays.Keep in mind that this test will expose your child to significant doses of x-radiation and, although widely available, is usually reserved for cases where additional information is required for the diagnosis or anatomy of the urinary tract.

, This will help the kidney stone to pass.


In fact, for most children who have had, or are at risk of a kidney stone, the chances of forming a stone can be significantly reduced with a consistent robust fluid intake.
A general daily fluid intake goal is based on your child’s age. Ages 2-5 should have 42-62 ounces of fluid a day, ages 8-10 should have 75-85 ounces of fluid a day, and ages 13-18 should have 100-120 ounces of fluid a day., Use the written doses as specified on the package.


If pain medication is ineffective, or your child’s fluid intake is poor, take them to the hospital to help with pain control and fluid administration.

, These crystals then increase in size over time in your child’s kidneys and/or urinary tract. The crystals develop due to a buildup of minerals such as calcium, phosphate, uric acid, and oxalate in your child’s body.The most common type of kidney stone forms when calcium in your child’s urine combines with oxalate.
Oxalate is naturally found in many foods. It also is formed in our body as the result of the normal metabolism of substances such as Vitamin C.
Increased oxalate in the urine often also occurs in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Food such as rhubarb, spinach, peanuts, strawberries, wheat bran and chocolate all contain large amounts of oxalate., The amount of calcium in the urine increases when your child’s diet contains large amounts of sodium chloride, or common table salt.


This can contribute to stone formation in children at risk for calcium-containing stones.
Keep in mind excess calcium in your child’s urine is usually the result of too much intestinal absorption or excessive kidney excretion. Rarely, it may also be caused by the abnormal production of certain hormones, and very rarely it may be the result of a tumor.

, Most of the uric acid in the urine comes from the breakdown of dietary purines. Foods rich in purines include fish, in particular herring, mackerel and sardines, red meat, dried beans, peas, and organs such as cow kidney.


Uric acid also is produced from the regular turnover of body cells in your child’s body.
Certain very rare inherited diseases also result in the production and excretion of uric acid.

, These include seeds and nuts, beans, cheese and dairy products, salmon and shellfish, and red meats.


Cystine is another amino acid that can cause kidney stones. It can be excreted in very high amounts in people with a rare hereditary disease affecting their cystine metabolism, called cystinuria., In some cases, an altered diet can increase your child’s kidney and urinary tract issues, rather than solve them."

Do strengthening Kegel exercises.,
Get physical support for your bladder.,
Use estrogen cream.,
Use heat packs on your lower abdomen.,
Discuss cholinergic medications with your doctor.",How to Increase Urine Flow2," Women and men alike can benefit from doing kegel exercises, which strengthen the pelvic floor and improve continence and urinary flow.You can do Kegels anywhere, simply follow these instructions:While urinating, squeeze the muscles that stop your flow midstream – those are the muscles you want to isolate. You can do the exercise in any position.
Tighten those muscles, hold for 5 seconds, then relax. Repeat this several times in a row.
Gradually work up to holding the contraction for 10 seconds, then resting for 10 seconds. Try to do three sets of ten repetitions every day.
Don’t squeeze other muscles like your abs, legs, or butt. Focus on flexing only your pelvic floor muscles.

, Sometimes, vaginal childbirth or heavy coughing or straining can weaken the muscles that hold your bladder in place, causing your bladder to droop into the vagina, also known as a prolapsed bladder. This can affect how well you can urinate, and may be your problem if you have a feeling of fullness or pressure in your vagina or pelvis, it feels worse when you strain or bear down, you feel like your bladder isn’t fully empty after you urinate, you leak urine during intercourse, or you see or feel a bulge of tissue in your vagina.Ask your doctor about getting a pessary – a support for your bladder that sits inside your vagina.
In severe cases, you can have surgery to reinforce your pelvic muscles and ligaments.

, Most women with leaking or weak stream experience the trouble after menopause – as estrogen decreases, skin and tissues thin and weaken. Using an estrogen cream that’s made for your vagina may help strengthen the surrounding skin and tissues. Ask your doctor or OB/GYN whether your urinary troubles might be helped with “topical” estrogen., Place a hot water bottle or heating pack on your low abdomen between your belly button and your pubic bone. Like with other muscles, the heat may relax your bladder and help you urinate more freely.You can also try taking a hot shower or soaking in a warm bath.

, Cholinergic medications increase how strongly your bladder contracts, which will help you urinate if your weak flow is due to nerve issues. Bethanechol hydrochloride (Urecholine) is usually prescribed, but can have many side effects, so talk to your doctor about whether it’s right for you.Ask your doctor questions about your condition, such as, “What is causing my urinary problems?” and, “What type of medicine will help? What are the possible side effects?”

Get medical treatment for weak flow with groin pain.,
Get treated if it burns when you pee.,
Treat your constipation.,
Get examined for scar tissue.,
Stop medications that decrease urination.",How to Increase Urine Flow3," Prostatitis, inflammation of the prostate because of infection, is a cause of slow or weak urine flow in men. You usually also have pain in your groin or pelvis, and possibly chills or a fever. See your doctor to get checked if you have these symptoms associated with difficulty urinating.Prostatitis will be treated with antibiotics if it’s caused by a bacterial infection.

, Urinary tract infections, or UTIs, are much more common in women than men. UTIs can cause inflammation or swelling that blocks urine flow.Visit your doctor for treatment if you have symptoms of a UTI such as:A strong urge to urinate
Burning or pain when you urinate
Urinating often in small amounts, or having weak flow
Urine that looks cloudy, pink, red, or brown
Pain in the center of your pelvis
A strong smell to your urine

, Sometimes if you’re constipated, hardened stool can push against your urethra or bladder and block urine from leaving your body. If you’re unable to urinate or have a weak flow and you’re also constipated, try to alleviate your constipation, then see if you can urinate freely.Drink extra water, eat prunes, and avoid dairy to try to alleviate constipation.
Take an over-the-counter laxative like Miralax or Colace, or try a Fleet enema.Ask the pharmacist for suggestions.

, If you’ve had past surgeries in the area of your lower abdomen, scar tissue may have formed. See your doctor for evaluation and discuss any illnesses, surgeries, or medical problems you have had with your bladder, kidneys, urethra, vagina, or prostate. Scar tissue can sometimes be removed with a minor surgery, which will allow for more room for urine flow.Scarred areas can also be open up with dilators, which stretch the area to allow urine to flow better. These procedures often need to be repeated over time., Stay away from antihistamines like Benadryl, and decongestants like pseudoephedrine found in many cold medicines. Ingredients in these make it harder to urinate."
"
Stay hydrated.,
Minimize salt in your diet.,
Take a diuretic.",How to Increase Urine Flow4," If you have low flow, you may just be dehydrated. Men should drink around 13 cups of water and other fluids daily (about 3 liters), and women should aim for 9 cups (2.2 liters).Drink more if you sweat a lot, work out, or live in a hot climate. Water, juice, and tea count towards your fluids.


If your urine is scarce and dark, you may be dehydrated.

, Eating a high-salt diet can cause you to retain water, which limits how much you urinate. Decrease salt in your diet by avoiding fast food and processed food like chips and other snack-aisle items. Flavor your meals with herbs and spices instead of table salt.

, If you have a medical condition that makes your body hold onto extra water – like heart failure, for instance – your doctor may prescribe a diuretic. That’s a medication that increases how much you urinate. Diuretics should only be used for specific conditions, so discuss your urinary trouble with your doctor and ask if a diuretic is right for you."

If necessary, alcohol hand sanitizer or towelettes may be used instead.
You should also wash your work surface with disinfectant spray or towelettes. Allow the surface to air dry before using.;
, Take off the plastic lid covering the bottle of saline solution and wipe the top clean with an alcohol pad.


Scrub this rubber top for at least 15 seconds. The idea is to make it as clean as possible before proceeding.
As you handle the bottle of saline solution, you should only touch the outside of the glass. Do not get your fingers on the top or inside of the bottle.

, Twist a sterile needle onto a sterile syringe, tightening it as firmly as possible.


Only use an unopened sterile catheter tip syringe. If you want to use previously opened clean syringes and needles, you must get approval from your doctor.
Keep the needle cover on when you are attaching the needle to the syringe. Only remove it after the two pieces have been joined together.
Make sure that the needle and the syringe remain sterile. Do not allow the tip of the needle, the base of the needle, or the tip of the syringe to touch your skin or any other object.
If you are using a needle and syringe that are already attached, make sure that the needle is secure by twisting it on the syringe. A secure needle should not budge.

, Hold the syringe steady with one hand while pulling the plunger back with the other. Pull the plunger back until you have filled the syringe with 10 ml of air.


Note that the black line of the rubber plunger tip should land precisely on the line next to the ""10 ml"" mark of the syringe.
Under most circumstances, you should draw back 10 ml of air. Your doctor may instruct you to use a different amount, however, depending on the exact circumstances.

, Insert the needle into the rubber top of the saline bottle. Push the plunger down, pushing the air inside the syringe into the bottle.


You must poke the needle straight down into the bottle and hold the syringe vertically.

, Turn the bottle upside-down, then pull back on the plunger of the syringe. Continue pulling the plunger until you have filled the syringe with 10 ml of saline.


Keep the needle inserted into the rubber top of the saline bottle the entire time. Do not remove and re-insert it.
The needle must remain below the fluid level inside the bottle as you work. Do not allow it to come into contact with the air inside the bottle.
As before, the black line of the rubber plunger tip must fall on the line next to the ""10 ml"" mark.
If your doctor instructs you to use more or less saline, follow your doctor's instructions.

, Tap on the syringe to loosen any air bubbles, then push any trapped air back into the bottle by carefully pushing the plunger in.


Keep the needle inserted in the saline bottle as you complete this step.
While checking for air bubbles, you must hold the syringe vertically straight with the needle pointing up. Tap on the barrel of the syringe with your knuckles to loosen any trapped air. The air should rise to the top of the syringe, near the base of needle.
Once all of the air has gathered beneath the base of the needle, you can push the plunger in. Continue pushing until all of the air has been forced back into the bottle.
If necessary, insert the tip of the needle back into the saline solution and pull the plunger back again to fill the syringe with enough saline.

, Remove the needle from the saline bottle and place the cover back over it. Set it aside until ready to use.


If no cover is available, place the needle back into its sterile packaging. The needle must not touch an non-sterile surfaces.
Work carefully and make sure that you do not accidentally poke yourself with the needle as you cover it.

, Wash your hands with soap and warm water, scrubbing well for at least 15 seconds. Dry them with a clean paper towel when finished.


You should wash your hands again even if you already did so while preparing the syringe.

, Scrub the connection site between the catheter and drainage tubing with an alcohol pad, cleaning the area for 15 to 30 seconds before continuing.


Allow the area to air dry. Do not dry it with towels, and do not attempt to speed the drying process by blowing on the area with your breath or a fan.

, Place several towels beneath the connection site joining the catheter to the tubing. Position a pan beneath the open end of the catheter connection, as well.


This basin will collect any urine and other fluid from the catheter as you irrigate it.

, Gently twist the catheter from the drainage tubing to disconnect the two pieces.


Quickly cover the end of the tubing with a sterile connection cover to keep it clean. Put it aside for now.
Position the catheter over the collection basin you just prepared. Do not let the open end of the catheter actually touch the basin, however.

, Place a sterile, empty syringe into the open end of the catheter. Pull the plunger back to check for urine.If no urine comes out of the catheter at this time, you can proceed to the next step.
If you draw urine into the syringe, you should use the syringe to remove the urine currently inside the catheter. Clean out the catheter as thoroughly as possible.

, Remove the empty syringe from the catheter and insert the saline-filled syringe.


If the needle is still on the syringe, take it off before inserting the syringe opening into the catheter.
Make sure that you do not touch the end of the syringe.
Twist the syringe onto the catheter cap until it feels secure.

, Slowly push down on the plunger, filling the catheter with the saline solution. Work carefully and stop at the first sign of resistance.It is generally best to use a ""push-pause"" approach. Push the plunger down to insert 2 ml of saline into the catheter, then pause for several seconds. Push another 2 ml into the catheter, then pause again. Repeat this pattern until all of the saline has been inserted into the catheter.
Do not force the saline into the catheter. If you encounter resistance, it is best to call a nurse or doctor for help. He or she may need to use a different technique to irrigate the catheter. It is also possible that the catheter will need to be changed.

, Pinch the end of the catheter while untwisting the syringe from the catheter cap.


If the catheter has a clamp, close the clamp after removing the syringe.

, Let gravity drain any remaining urine and saline into the prepared basin.


You may need to hold the open end of the catheter over the basin for a few minutes to make sure that it has drained completely.

, Clean the connection site and connect the tubing to the catheter again. Wash your hands when finished.


Use an alcohol pad to clean the area where the syringe and catheter met. Allow the area to air dry naturally.
Remove the cap from the drainage tubing and scrub the tip of the tubing with another alcohol wipe. Allow it to dry naturally by air, as well.
Insert the tubing back into the catheter. Check after 10 to 15 minutes to make sure that urine is flowing out of the catheter properly.
Discard all of the needles and syringes used during the process into a puncture-proof waste bin.
Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water. Dry them with clean paper towels when finished.
As soon as everything is clean and reconnected, the process is complete.

You should see your healthcare professional if you have any urinary symptoms. Sometimes, increasing the pH of your urine can help – other times, you may need antibiotics or other treatment to solve your medical problem. Get a proper diagnosis, talk to your doctor about treatment options, and ask if raising your urine pH will help if you experience any of the following:

You’re urinating more or less than usual, or you can only urinate in small amounts.
It hurts or burns when you urinate.
Your urine looks very dark.
Your urine smells bad.;
, Some types of kidney stones occur if there’s too much acid and other compounds in your body, so alkalinizing your urine (raising the pH) can help dissolve kidney stones. You may also need other treatment and not all types of kidney stones are improved this way, so talk to your doctor about treatment options.Signs and symptoms of kidney stones can include any of the following:Pain in your flank (the side of your torso beneath your ribs)
Pain that travels to your abdomen or groin
Pain that comes in waves and changes in intensity
Blood in your urine (urine may look pink, red, or brown)
Cloudy or bad-smelling urinePain when you urinate
Urinating more often or feeling sudden urges to urinate
Nausea and vomiting
Fever and chills

, You can get gout if you have too much of a certain kind of acid in your body (uric acid). Gout can cause severe pain, redness, and swelling in your small joints, usually your big toe. If you have severe pain in your big toe that’s unrelated to an injury, see your doctor to get diagnosed. If you have gout, try to raise the pH of your urine to decrease your uric acid level – this can help prevent future attacks of gout., If you are going to try to raise the pH of your urine, keep track of the changes by measuring pH once a day. Urine that is too alkaline can cause problems, just as acidic urine can. Purchase pH test strips from your local pharmacy. To test your urine, collect a sample in a clean cup and use the strips as directed. Insert the strip into the urine for the directed amount of time, then match the color on the strip to a color chart on the bottle to determine pH.

Alkalize your urine to a pH >7 if you’re trying to dissolve kidney stones.Get a clean urine sample. Begin to urinate for several seconds, then collect a sample in your clean cup by catching the urine mid-stream.
Urinary dipsticks are available from companies like AimStrip. These can be used to test urinary pH, as well, though you may have to get them from the company directly."

Eat a balanced diet.,
Lower the amount of salt in your diet.,
Eat kidney-friendly foods.",How to Improve Kidney Function1," A healthy balanced diet is a major factor to good overall health, and kidney health is no exception. Avoid fatty and salty food, and eat lots of fresh fruit and vegetables. If you are unsure about what a balanced diet might look like, look at the food groups identified in the food pyramid and go from there.


The original food pyramid has been criticised by public health experts, so you may want to look at the more recent healthy eating pyramid which combines healthy eating with weight control.;
, It is very common for people to have diets which exceed the recommend amount of salt, or sodium. Diets which are high in sodium can have particularly bad effects on your kidneys, as a high sodium diet can lead to high blood pressure. Over time, having high blood pressure will damage your kidneys and could make you more vulnerable to serious kidney problems.Choosing fresh rather than packaged foods will most likely mean that you are consuming less sodium.
When buying pre-packaged food, keep an eye out for those labelled ‘no added salt’ or something similar.
Get into the habit of reading food labels and finding out the sodium levels in foods.

, The most important thing is to have a balanced and healthy diet, but there are some foods out there which are particularly beneficial for your kidneys and kidney function. Foods with antioxidants, typically fruit and vegetables, can be a boost to your overall health and you kidneys. Some of the best ones to ensure you have regularly on your shopping list are cabbage and cauliflower, berries (especially cranberries), red bell peppers, and onions.Although cranberries are very good for you, cranberry juice you buy in a carton might have an awful lot of sugar in.
Asparagus is thought to be especially good for the kidneys."

Make an appointment with your doctor to discuss your symptoms and a possible multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis.,
Look for the early symptoms of MS.,
Know that symptoms of MS manifest in different ways for different patients.,
Look for the most common symptoms of MS.,
Plan for blood tests that bring your doctor closer to a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.,
Schedule a spinal tap with your doctor.,
Prepare for an MRI through your health care provider or local health care facility.,
Ask your doctor about an evoked potential test.,
Make a follow-up appointment with your doctor once all of the tests are complete to determine whether a definitive multiple sclerosis diagnosis can be made.",How to Diagnose Multiple Sclerosis," While it's all well and good to try to diagnose MS on your own, the detailed and difficult diagnosis makes it hard for even licensed professionals to achieve certainty.;
, Many people with MS experience their first symptoms between the ages of 20 and 40.If you come across any of the following symptoms, write them down for you doctor to use in ruling out other possible medical conditions:


Blurred or double vision
Clumsiness or coordination problems
Thinking problems
Loss of balance
Numbness and tingling
Weakness in an arm or leg

, No two cases of MS present in the same way. To this end, you may have:


One symptom followed by a respite for months or even years before the symptom presents itself again or a new symptom presents.One or several symptoms in close proximity to one another, with the symptom(s) becoming worse within weeks or months., These symptoms include:


Feelings pins and needles, but also numbness, itching, burning, or stabbing throughout the body. These symptoms present in about half of patients with MS.
Bowel and bladder problems. These include constipation, frequent urination, suddenly urgent urination, problems emptying the bladder fully, and the need to urinate at night.
Muscle weakness or spasms, resulting in difficulty walking. Other potential symptoms can exacerbate this symptom.
Dizziness or lightheadedness. While outright vertigo is uncommon, feelings of dizziness and lightheadedness are common.
Fatigue. About 80% of MS patients feel chronic fatigue. Even after a good night's sleep, many MS sufferers say that they feel tired and drained. Fatigue associated with MS is usually independent of the amount of physical work or exercise that you do.
Sexual problems, including vaginal dryness in women and difficulty achieving erection in men. Sexual problems can extend to lower responsiveness to touch, lower sex drive, and difficulty achieving orgasm.
Speech problems. These include long gaps between a string of words, slurred speech, or intensely nasal speech.
Thinking problems. Difficulty concentrating, difficulty retrieving memory, and low attention span are all common.
Shaking or tremors, making it difficult to do some everyday activities.
Eye problems, usually affecting only one eye. Examples include dark spot(s) in the center of the eye, blurred or grey vision, pain, or temporary loss of vision.

, This happens by ruling out other potential diseases that could be causing the symptoms. Inflammatory diseases, infections and chemical imbalances can result in similar symptoms, providing a red flag but also a false alarm. On top of this, many of these disorders can be effectively treated through medication and other treatments.

, Although a spinal tap, or lumbar puncture, can be painful, it is an essential step in diagnosing MS. This test involves the removal of a small sample of fluid from the spinal canal that is taken for analysis in a laboratory. The spinal tap is often a component in how to diagnose multiple sclerosis, because the fluid may show abnormalities in white blood cells or proteins that may indicate a malfunction of the body's immune system and the presence of the disease. This test may also rule out other diseases and infections.


In order to prepare for a lumbar puncture:
Tell your doctor if you are taking any medications or herbal remedies than may thin out your blood.
Empty your bladder.
Sign a consent form and possibly a medical test information form.v



, This test, also known as magnetic resonance imaging, uses a magnet, radio waves and a computer to create an image of the brain and spinal cord. This test can be helpful in making a multiple sclerosis diagnosis because it often shows abnormalities or damage in these areas that can indicate the presence of the disease.


An MRI is considered one of the best tests used to diagnose multiple sclerosis to date, although a diagnosis of MS is impossible to make using an MRI alone.That's because patients can still register a normal MRI and still have MS. On the flip side, elderly people especially can have lesions on the brain that look like MS but which aren't.

, As doctors are learning more about how to diagnose multiple sclerosis, this test is providing additional information to get an accurate determination of the disease. The procedure is painless and involves the use of visual or electrical stimuli to measure the electrical signals your body sends to your brain. These tests may be performed by your doctor, but are usually sent to a neurologist for interpretation.

, If your doctor can determine how to diagnose multiple sclerosis based on these tests, you will then move toward the treatment phase of the disease. This involves learning to effectively manage symptoms and slow the disease progression.

Eat a lot of fruit.,
Increases your veggie intake.,
Replace the meat in your meals.,
Snack on nuts and seeds.,
Season your food with alkalizing herbs and spices.,
Decrease your intake of acid-forming foods.,
Stop drinking alcohol.,
Take a plant-based supplement to raise pH.",How to Increase Urine pH2," Load your diet with fresh fruits and vegetables to increase the pH of your urine.Most fruits are alkalinizing (raise pH), but some do this more effectively than others. Some of the best alkalinizing fruits include:Blackberries, strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries
Nectarines, persimmon, apples, apricots, pears, and peaches
Tangerines, limes, lemons, and oranges
Papaya, pineapple, watermelon, cantaloupe, honeydew, and banana
Grapes, raisins, and cherries
Avocado and green olives

, Try to include fresh vegetables in every meal. Increase your portion sizes of vegetables and decrease your portion sizes of meats to help increase the pH of your urine.Some of the best veggies to regularly include in your diet are:Asparagus, celery, and artichoke
Onions, endives, and kohlrabi
Collard greens, mustard greens, and kale
Winter squash, zucchini, and summer squash
Eggplant, beets, and bell peppers
Parsnips, sweet potatoes/yams, and baked potatoes
Broccoli, cabbage, and okra

, Replace a portion of meat in your meal with legumes like beans or peas.These increase your urine pH and provide a good source of protein. Lentils are also a good alkalizer and make a healthy replacement for meat., A handful of nuts and seeds make a great snack throughout the day, and are a good way to get healthy fats in your diet if you cut down on how much meat you eat.Some nuts are especially alkalizing, such as chestnuts, pumpkin seeds, and cashews.

Almonds, sesame seeds, and sunflower seeds also increase your urine pH, though not as much as the others., Rather than cooking with regular table salt, add flavor to your food with tasty herbs and spices that increase your urine pH. Cook with sea salt and black pepper, and include these other flavors in your meals:Ginger root
Parsley
Basil
Garlic
Cilantro
Bay leaves
Cayenne pepper
Soy sauce
Cinnamon

, While eating alkalizing foods, minimize what you’re eating that increases acid in your urine. Meat, poultry, eggs, fish, and dairy are big acid-formers that are common in many diets. Minimize your intake of these by monitoring your portion size – base meals mainly on fruits and vegetables, with only small servings of the above proteins., Alcohol makes your urine more acidic. Drink mineral water, ginger tea, or pineapple or grapefruit juice instead – these all raise your urine pH.Talk to your doctor if you think you need help to stop drinking.

, Take a plant-based dietary product, or “green food” extract. Use it for a week as indicated on the label. This may effectively raise the pH of your urine and increase alkalinity in your body.An example of a product that has been studied is Greens+, a product by Genuine Health from Toronto, Canada.

Take sodium bicarbonate.,
Inquire about potassium citrate if you have kidney stones.,
Ask about calcium citrate as a treatment option.",How to Increase Urine pH3," Sodium bicarbonate is a medication you can take to raise the pH of your urine.Medications to raise urine pH are only appropriate for certain conditions, and taking it improperly can cause serious health problems – only take it as directed by your doctor. Usually, the medication is given in your doctor’s office as an injection.

Don’t use sodium bicarbonate if you are vomiting, you have alkalosis (too little acid in your body), or you have a deficiency of calcium or chloride.Let your doctor know if you’re taking any other medications or supplements, you have any allergies, you’re pregnant or breastfeeding, or you have disease of your heart, kidneys, or liver.

, Some medications are appropriate for specific medical conditions caused by acidic urine. Ask your doctor about potassium citrate (Urocit-K), a medication used to treat a specific kidney condition and resolve kidney stones.This medication can have many side effects and is not used to treat all causes of kidney stones.

, This medication might be helpful and appropriate to increase your urine pH. It depends on your condition, symptoms, and what is causing your urinary problems.Ask your doctor if this medicine is right for you."

Drink lots of water.,
Drink water at regular intervals.,
Only drink alcohol in moderation.",How to Improve Kidney Function2," Staying well-hydrated has big benefits for your health. Being well-hydrated will mean that your urine is more diluted which will help maintain kidney function and health. Some doctors recommend eight glasses a day, but in some cases more than this is recommended. Water helps to flush toxins and waste from the body so being hydrated aids the kidneys with this task, as well as regulating body temperature., Drinking water frequently throughout the day, rather than gulping down half a litre twice a day, could also contribute to improved kidney function. The kidneys keep fluid in your body regulated, so it is easier for them to do this if you drink a little and often., Drinking a lot of alcohol can have very serious negative consequences for your kidney functionality. One of the kidney’s main tasks is filtering out harmful substances from your blood. Alcohol is one of the harmful substances that the kidney deals with, and excessive alcohol can negatively impact on the kidney’s ability to do this.Alcohol also dehydrates you, and this has a negative impact on your kidneys just as staying well-hydrated has a positive one.

Control your weight.,
Get plenty of exercise.,
Get a good vitamin D supply by exercising outside.",How to Improve Kidney Function3," It is important to keep to a healthy weight, as being overweight can increase your blood pressure which in turn puts more strain on your kidneys. Having a healthy and balanced diet and taking regular exercise should be enough for you to maintain a healthy weight and keep your blood pressure down.


Being overweight can also lead to diabetes, which, together with high blood pressure, are the two major causes of kidney disease., Being active and exercising has a wide range of beneficial consequences for health, and plays and important part in losing and controlling weight. It helps improve circulation and mobility which is good news for the kidneys which work to regulate blood in the body. Regular exercise can help you to prevent diabetes and control blood pressure, which decrease the strain on your kidney and lowers the likelihood of kidney disease.If you are not used to regular exercise it’s important to make a part of your normal routine to feel the long-term benefit and improve kidney function. This might seem hard to achieve if you are very busy, or a bit lazy, but you should try hard to find a way to do it.
Finding a sport or activity that you really enjoy is probably the best way to make exercise fun for someone who isn’t used to it.Exercising with friends or your partner might make it a lot more fun and laid back if you don’t want to join a club or a team.

, Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to kidney disease. One of the jobs of the kidneys is to activate vitamin D, so getting out in the sunshine and taking vitamin D in from the sun lowers the pressure on the kidneys.A minimum of fifteen minutes in the sun a day can help your kidney function.
Vitamin D also helps with the regulation of the calcium and phosphorous levels in your body.

Understand what kidneys do.,
Know how kidney problems come about.,
Ask your parents if there is a history of kidney problems in the family.",How to Improve Kidney Function4," The first thing to do is to read up a bit and educate yourself a little about how kidneys function and what there purposes are. The kidneys play a large role in maintaining healthy blood, and thus facilitating the crucial transportation of nutrients around the body, as well as protecting against disease and maintaining a pH balance.If you think about this, you will realise how important healthy and high functioning kidneys are to your overall health.

, Once you have a grasp of the functions and importance of healthy kidneys, find out a little about how problems with kidneys can be caused. The two most common causes of kidney disease are diabetes and high blood pressure.There are numerous other potential causes, including poisoning and physical damage or trauma. For example, kidney disease could develop after a particularly heavy blow to the kidneys.


Some painkillers used regularly for a long time can cause kidney problems, so if you take them regularly check with your doctor., Kidney problems are often hereditary, so if your family has a history of kidney-related health problems you could be at a higher risk.If this is the case, you can talk to your doctor to get more specific medical guidance on how to avoid hereditary kidney problems.

Check for any loss of sensation.,
Watch for any muscle weakness.,
Notice where in the body the symptoms occur.,
Monitor for other symptoms.,
Go to the doctor.,
Undergo a neurological examination.,
Get tests to check your nerve function.,
Go through other tests to rule out other conditions.,
Evaluate the duration of the symptoms.,
Know who CIDP commonly affects.,
Differentiate CIDP from other similar conditions.",How to Diagnose CIDP," One of the most characteristic symptoms of Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy is numbness or loss of sensation. This loss of feeling can be experienced in any part of the body.You may also experience abnormal sensations, such as a tingling or pain in parts of your body like the hands or feet.;
, Muscle weakness occurs for at least two months with CIDP. The weakness in the muscles occurs on both sides of the body. Because of this weakness, there might be difficulty walking, problems with coordination, or other motor functions. You might become clumsier than normal. You may have an awkward gait or have missteps when walking.Often, the weakness occurs in the hip, shoulder, hands, and feet.

, CIDP is similar to many other neurological disorders that cause motor function problems and disturbances of sensation. In typical cases, the numbness and weakness occurs on both sides of the body, usually in all four limbs. Additionally, tendon reflexes have to be either reduced or absent.

, Loss of sensation and motor function problems are the most common and definitive symptoms; however, there may be other secondary symptoms that occur with CIDP. These can include:Fatigue
Burning
Pain
Muscle atrophy
Problems swallowing
Double vision

, To get diagnosed with CIDP, you need to see a physician. This should be done when you notice tingling or numbness in your body or any motor function problems. The doctor will perform an exam and discuss your symptoms with you.Start keeping track of your symptoms as soon as you notice them. CIDP is only diagnosed after eight weeks of symptoms.
Be as honest and detailed with your symptoms as possible. CIDP is similar in some ways to several other disorders. The more your doctor knows about your symptoms, the easier it will be to distinguish one disorder from another. Be prepared to tell your doctor what symptoms you have, where in the body you feel them, what makes them worse, and what makes them better.

, Your doctor may perform a neurological examination to rule out related conditions or gather additional information to confirm CIDP. During a neurological examination, your doctor will probably check your reflexes since a lack of reflexes is a common symptom of CIDP.Your doctor may also test different parts of your body to check for numbness or your ability to feel pressure or touch sensation.
You may also have to do a coordination test. The doctor may check your muscle strength, muscle tone, and posture.

, Your doctor may order several tests to confirm CIDP — there is no one test that can confirm the diagnosis.You may need to get a nerve conduction test or electromyography (EMG). These tests look for slow nerve function or abnormal electrical activity that signals nerve damage.The nerves are stimulated and checked to see if they are damaged. Then, the muscles are tested to see if the muscle or nerve is the cause of the problem.
These tests can help the doctor find damaged or missing myelin along the nerves. Myelin is a sheath around nerves that helps control electrical impulses.
An MRI may be done to look for enlargement of the nerve roots or inflammation.

, Your doctor may perform additional tests to make sure there is nothing else causing your symptoms. A spinal fluid analysis will show if you have elevated protein levels or an elevated cell count, which both point to CIDP.Blood and urine tests may also be conducted to rule out other conditions.

, CIDP is a slow-moving condition. It can present and worsen in a slow but gradual way. Alternately, it can appear in relapses, where you recover between each bout of symptoms. These relapses and periods of being symptom-free may occur for weeks or months.Symptoms need to be present for more than eight weeks before a diagnosis of CIPD can be made.

, CIDP is a rare condition. It affects approximately one to three people per 100,000 every year. It can affect anyone at any age; however, men are twice as likely to be diagnosed with CIDP than females.Though CIDP can happen to anyone of any age, the average age of diagnosis is 50.

, CIDP is sometimes difficult to diagnose because the condition is similar to other conditions; however, there are important differences that can help you settle on CIDP.Guillain-Barre syndrome and CIDP are similar. Guillain-Barre is a disease that comes on quickly, and people usually recover in around three months. CIDP is a slow-acting condition, and you may be affected by it for years.
Multiple sclerosis and CIDP both affect motor functions; however, MS affects the brain, spinal cord, and other parts of the central nervous system, but CIDP does not. CIDP mainly affects the peripheral nerves.
Lewis-Summer syndrome and multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) may only affect one side of the body, whereas CIDP typically affects both sides. MMN doesn’t result in loss of sensation.

Monitor how you feel.,
Think about potential causes.,
Note any pain you are feeling.,
Determine how you are sleeping.,
See if your physical activities are limited.",How to Detect Chronic Fatigue1," Symptoms for chronic fatigue often come and go. When you have a number of the following symptoms for extended period of time, such as greater than six months, and seems to be worsening, you need to be evaluated by a physician. Symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) include: You feel tired for more than 24 hours after exertion. Notice if you are excessively tired for long periods of time after exerting yourself through intensive physical or mental activities. This is an important symptom to notice, as most of the time, exercise should leave you feeling energized, not fatigued.
You feel unrefreshed after sleep. Sleep should make you feel better. If you don’t feel better after sleep or suffer from insomnia, you may be suffering from CFS.
You lack short-term memory. You may easily misplace things or forget what someone has just told you. You also may experience general confusion or have trouble concentrating.
You suffer from muscle pain. You may experience soreness or muscle weakness not due to exertion. You experience joint pain. Your joints may hurt even though you do not have swelling or redness.
You have mild to severe headaches. These headaches differ from those you’ve had in the past and you can find no cause for them.
You feel enlarged lymph nodes in your neck or armpits. Swollen glands mean your body is fighting illness or an infection. You have a sore throat. Your throat may be sore, but is not linked to other cold or flu-like symptoms.;
, Your chronic fatigue may be linked to changes in your lifestyle. Consider any recent changes in your life.If you’ve recently had a viral infection, this may be a sign of CFS. Viral infections can be triggers for chronic fatigue.
Problems with the immune system can also lead to chronic fatigue. Remember if you’ve had any recent issues with your immune system.
Low blood pressure is often found in CFS patients. Monitor your blood pressure to see if it falls within the normal range. , Make sure it’s not due to injury or excessive exertion, but daily pain not linked to specific causes. If you experience any of the following, they may be linked to chronic fatigue: Muscle soreness
Joint pain without redness or swelling
Headaches

, Write down how much you sleep each night and how often you wake up. If you discover that you are sleeping well but still feeling exhausted, then CFS may be behind your fatigue.


You can download apps on your smartphone that will track and analyze your sleep quality.
Some nights you will sleep better than others. Recognize when you sleep less due to outside factors like work or other obligations as opposed to problems getting a restful night of sleep.
Know that sleep totals will change. You may experience problems for weeks and then sleep well for a long period of time.
Track if you wake up excessively early. If you are waking up hours before your alarm clock on a regular basis, write down how often that happens.
Note any instances of insomnia you may have. Even if it’s just for a few hours, write down any time you have significant trouble falling asleep.
Remember if you wake up often during the night. If you have one, ask your partner to note if you are sleeping fitfully.
Make yourself as comfortable as possible. Give yourself the best chance to sleep by dressing comfortably and keeping your sleeping area dark and cool.

, You may have changed your non-essential activities to compensate for your increased fatigue. Look further into whether CFS is a factor if the following is true:


You have reduced all other outside activities besides work. You do not meet with friends or family unless absolutely necessary.
Your weekends are spent recovering or resting for the week. You cannot imagine doing anything on the weekends, since you need the time to recover and prepare for work.
You have stopped all leisure activities. You may have quit any athletics you are involved in or any groups that you have joined.

"
"
See if you have difficulty with mental activities.,
Keep track of external factors.,
Consider additional risk factors that may make you susceptible to chronic fatigue.,
Assess your quality of life.",How to Detect Chronic Fatigue2," Keep track of any problems you have doing daily activities you are used to doing with ease.Pay attention if you:


Experience problems concentrating. Note if you have difficulty completing tasks in a reasonable time frame.
Lack short-term memory. You often may forget things that people just told you or events that recently happened.
Cannot concentrate or retain attention. You may not be able to pay attention for a long period of time without zoning out.
Feel scatter-brained or have difficulty organizing your life. You may forget appointments or meetings with colleagues or friends.
Struggle to find the right word or to maintain your stream of thought. Talking when prompted may be difficult for you.
Have blurry vision during daily activities. Even if you are wearing glasses or contacts, you struggle seeing clearly and distinctly.

, If anything has changed recently in your stress, sleep, or health patterns, it may be time to make an appointment with a physician. If your stress level has increased, this can cause chronic fatigue. Think about your daily life and if anything has changed substantially.
Think about any recent health problems you’ve had and how they may contribute to your fatigue.
Make a list of questions to ask a doctor if you decide to make an appointment. Think of questions to ask them as well as what information you need to have to help them answer your questions.

, CFS is more likely to occur in specific groups of people. If you are in these target groups, consider chronic fatigue as a potential diagnosis. Chronic fatigue can affect people of all ages. It is most common though in people in the 40s and 50s.
Women are generally diagnosed with chronic fatigue more than men. This may be due to their reporting it more rather than acquiring it more.
Being unable to manage stress can be a problem that contributes to chronic fatigue.

, If you've felt differently, changed your social life, daily, work, or school schedule because you're tired, it may be a sign of chronic fatigue. Consider if you feel more depressed recently than normal. Depression can be due to feeling tired and lacking sleep.
Think about your social life. Consider if you go out less than you used to because you are too tired.
Reflect on if you’ve changed your lifestyle in substantial ways. Think about the ways you’ve adapted your daily schedule if you’re feeling fatigued.
Realize if you’re missing work or school more often due to feelings of tiredness. Absences at work or school may increase with chronic fatigue.

Provide your doctor with all necessary information.,
Consider sleep disorders.,
Make sure to test for a variety of conditions besides chronic fatigue.,
Make management plan with doctor.,
Change your lifestyle.,
Look into alternative medicine.,
Get emotional support.",How to Detect Chronic Fatigue3," Make sure you are aware of the most important facts about CFS. Chronic fatigue is not very common. It is estimated to affect 836,000 to 2.5 million people in the United States.
Chronic fatigue is diagnosed four more times more often in women than men.
There is no test for chronic fatigue. It can be diagnosed through symptoms or signs that are happening at the same time.
There is no cure for chronic fatigue; however, symptoms can be treated and reduced.
Adults have a fair to poor prognosis for chronic fatigue. Children have a better to good prognosis. In both cases, treatment of the symptoms is important.
Having a healthy lifestyle is the best advice given by physicians to treat chronic fatigue.
In younger people, the most common group diagnosed is teenagers.

, It is very difficult for doctors to diagnose CFS since there is no test and the symptoms mirror a number of other diseases.


Know the difference between CFS and ME (myalgic encephalomyelitis). CFS is the preferred term for doctors, while ME is used by those suffering from the condition. For many, fatigue seems too everyday of a word to describe the syndrome. Realize there is no test for CFS. The doctor will not be able to provide a simple and easy test, so make sure to have patience.
Know the common symptoms as described above. If you have CFS, you will experience four of the eight symptoms close to the same time.
Talk to your doctor about getting tested for other potential causes of fatigue. Because CFS is relatively rare, it is more likely you are suffering from a different condition, including thyroid, anemia, sleep disorders, medication side effects, infections, nutritional deficiencies, fibromyalgia, autoimmune disorders, depression, and so on. Many of these are more treatable than CFS.
Realize that CFS goes through cycles of remission and relapse. You may feel better for a time and then feel much worse. There is no cure, but only the symptoms can be managed.
Your symptoms may vary. Some symptoms will be prominent than others. Additionally, some may change and become more or less of an issue through time.
There is a low rate of diagnosis for CFS. Only about 20% of people who have it have been diagnosed. Chronic fatigue syndrome is often not taken seriously by doctors or by friends and family. Make sure to be consistent and firm with your doctor regarding the severity of your symptoms.

, Make sure she can make an informed diagnostic decision about your chronic fatigue.


Have your medical history available and complete. Provide your doctor with any information from other doctors as well as your own recent observations.
Take any physical or mental exams the doctor suggests. These tests can help determine additional issues as well as fully explain any symptoms you may be experiencing.
Be prepared to give blood or fluid samples. Your doctor may want to test your blood to rule out any additional diseases.

, Your doctor may want to test you for sleep disorders outside of chronic fatigue. Even though these disorders can lead to fatigue, they are not symptoms of chronic fatigue.


Test for sleep apnea. Sleep apnea causes you to stop breathing temporarily during sleep. It can can cause you to be drowsy and elevate your blood pressure.
Test for restless legs syndrome. Restless leg syndrome causes you to desire to move your legs throughout the night. You can have difficulty maintaining a consistent night of sleep.
Test for insomnia. Insomnia is when you have difficulty falling or staying asleep. If you suffer from insomnia, it can also lead you to be fatigued since you are not sleeping regularly and consistently.

, You may be experiencing mental health issues, problems with medication, fibromyalgia, mono, lupus, or Lyme disease. Don’t go into the doctor determined to get a specific diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome. Depression is often affiliated with similar symptoms as chronic fatigue.
Different medications can have side effects that affect sleep, fatigue, memory, or muscle and joint pain. Make sure your doctor knows all of your medications.
Fibromyalgia is also linked to pain, difficulties with memory, and difficulties sleeping. Have your doctor look into this as well as chronic fatigue.
Mononucleosis can also cause you to be tired and fatigued for long periods of time; however, it eventually goes away, so it’s important for your doctor to rule it out.
Lupus is a chronic disease that affects your immune system. It can also cause many of the same symptoms as chronic fatigue.
Lyme disease is transmitted to humans through a tick bite. It is pretty serious, so make sure to check your body for rashes and bites.

, If you have chronic fatigue, you cannot cure it; however, you can address the symptoms in a variety of ways. People who suffer from chronic fatigue may also be depressed. Small doses of antidepressants can help with sleep and pain management. Sleeping pills may be useful if avoiding caffeine does not work. They will at least help you get a slightly better rest at night.
Physical therapy and moderate exercise may help you to improve your range of motion that has suffered due to chronic fatigue. Don’t overdo it. You don’t want to be even more fatigued and exhausted the next day.
Counseling may help you to gain a different perspective on your syndrome. Try to feel like you can gain control over your life despite experiencing chronic fatigue.

, Follow your doctor’s management plan while also trying lifestyle changes that can help alleviate your symptoms. Reduce stress. Try to reduce the number of stressors in your life. Taking it easier can help you to feel less tired all the time.
Examine your diet. You may not be getting enough nutrients from your food to function properly, leaving you feeling fatigued.

Improve your sleep habits. Don’t do anything too demanding before bedtime.
Pace yourself. Slow down your life. Don’t try to get everything done at once.

, Alternative medicine may help you to relax, which can help to alleviate some symptoms of chronic fatigue.


Acupuncture is often used for pain relief. It may be able to help with muscle soreness or joint pain.
Massage can be useful for soothing your sore muscles. Try massage that focuses on the problem areas that are sore most often.
Yoga can also help you to stretch your muscles and gain flexibility. Don’t try anything too strenuous since you don’t want to tire yourself out even more.

, Chronic fatigue is draining. Make sure you are staying in touch with your loved ones and getting outside help when you need it.


Talk to your loved ones about your chronic fatigue. They may be able to help you if your mobility is limited. Confide in them when chronic fatigue is really wearing on you.
Look into psychological counseling. Counseling can help you to learn how to deal with the psychological effects of chronic fatigue. Try to get an outside perspective.
Find a support group. A support group of fellow sufferers of chronic fatigue can help you to commiserate about your syndrome. You can help each other out during the roughest times.

Recognize the symptoms of sarcoidosis.,
Consult with your doctor.,
Talk to your doctor about corticosteroids.,
Ask your doctor about ""off-label"" drugs.,
Maintain a strong immune system.,
Don't smoke tobacco.,
Avoid exposure to dust and chemicals.,
Change your diet.",How to Deal With Sarcoidosis," Sarcoidosis is a condition where cells called granulomas accumulate in the eyes, lungs, skin, and lymph nodes.For many people, sarcoidosis begins with general symptoms, such as unexplained fatigue, mild fever, swollen lymph nodes and weight loss.However, because lung involvement is so common with sarcoidosis, lung symptoms start to dominate: persistent dry cough, shortness of breath and chest tightness and/or pain. Skin symptoms typically involve a rash consisting of reddish-purple bumps and growths or nodules just under the skin. Eye symptoms aren't common, but can include eye redness and pain, blurred vision and light sensitivity.


Approximately 90% of sarcoidosis patients have some type of lung issue, with nearly 1/3 experiencing respiratory symptoms such as coughing, difficulty breathing and chest pain.As many as 25% of sarcoidosis patients develop skin problems.;
, Sarcoidosis often doesn't generate noticeable symptoms (particularly during its initial stages) and it often resolves itself after a few months, so doctors aren't always so anxious to treat the condition with medicines.Furthermore, drug treatment is usually only offered if good health practices (see below) fail to prevent sarcoidosis from progressing. Your doctor will give you a thorough exam, focusing on the areas commonly affected by sarcoidosis — lungs, lymph nodes, skin, eyes — before deciding if drug treatment is necessary.


You will need to see your doctor for a physical exam as well as some diagnostic tests. Diagnostic tests may include a TB test, chest x-rays (looking for lung damage or enlarged lymph nodes), blood tests (calcium levels, kidney and liver function), CT scan, EKG, pulmonary function test, eye exam and skin biopsy (looking for the tell-tale granulomas).Most patients (>75%) can get symptomatic relief by taking over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen, naproxen) while at home., When drug therapy is recommended to combat sarcoidosis, the main goals are to keep the lungs and other affected organs working properly, and also to relieve symptoms generated by the affected organs. Corticosteroid drugs display powerful anti-inflammatory properties and remain the primary first-line treatment for preventing granuloma formation in sarcoidosis.Prednisone is the most common oral corticosteroid prescribed for sarcoidosis, although other formulations can be applied directly to an affected area — via creams for skin lesions or via inhalers for lung granulomas.


Other drugs that your doctor may recommend include glucocorticoids, colchicine, azathioprine, and cyclophosphamide.
Keep in mind that there is currently no drug treatment that reverses lung scarring (fibrosis) caused by advanced sarcoidosis.
Side effects from taking corticosteroids include mood swings, water retention and weight gain, hypertension, acne, mineral leaching from bones and impaired immune function., Off-label drugs are those used for conditions not originally approved for by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Doctors commonly use off-label drugs for a variety of other conditions because of reports of effectiveness. Common drugs used off-label for sarcoidosis include methotrexate (used against cancer and rheumatoid arthritis), chloroquine (antimalarial drug), cyclosporine (used with organ transplants to suppress immunity) and thalidomide (leprosy drug).Methotrexate and chloroquine currently have the most support from studies for effectively combating the side effects of sarcoidosis.The latest research is looking at using biologic medications that inhibit tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha inhibitors), such as adalimumab and infliximab. TNF-alpha inhibitors are normally used for rheumatoid arthritis and skin psoriasis, but show promise with sarcoidosis also.

, For any type of infection (bacterial, fungal or viral), true prevention depends on a healthy and strong immune response. Your immune system consists of specialized cells that search for and attempt to destroy potential pathogens (like the ones that may cause sarcoidosis), but when the system is weakened, harmful microorganisms grow and spread virtually unchecked.Consequently, focusing on ways to keep your immune system strong and functioning properly is a logical and natural approach to preventing essentially all infectious diseases.


Although it’s uncertain which foreign substance triggers the body’s abnormal response in sarcoidosis, it's been observed that cases occur in groups of people with close contact and in recipients of organ transplants, which suggests a potential infectious ability.
Sleeping more (or getting better quality sleep), eating more fresh produce, practicing good hygiene, drinking lots of water and regularly exercising are all proven ways to keep your immune system strong.Your immune function will also benefit by cutting back on refined sugars (soda pop, candy, ice cream, baked goods) and drinking less alcohol (no more than one beverage per day).

, Since sarcoidosis often affects the lungs, you shouldn't smoke cigarettes or cigars if you've been diagnosed with the condition. Smoking causes more than 4,000 chemicals to affect the lungs, which causes irritation, inflammation, dysfunction and destruction of the various tissues.Some of the chemicals in cigarette smoke also cause cellular mutations, which is the main mechanism of lung cancer. Smoking doesn't directly cause sarcoidosis, but it can certainly make the condition worse.


Sarcoidosis usually starts in the lungs and the lymph nodes in the chest, which suggests that the cause or primary contributing factor for the disease is inhaled.
Other diseases and conditions of the lungs that can mimic sarcoidosis include berylliosis (lung inflammation related to beryllium exposure), asbestosis (inflammation related to asbestos exposure), tuberculosis, farmer's lung disease, mesothelioma, lung cancer and fungal infections.

, In addition to not smoking, you should also avoid exposure to other substances potentially harmful to the lungs, such as dust, chemical fumes, gases and toxic inhalants.Sarcoidosis is likely not directly caused by common allergens or toxic chemicals, but any additional irritation or inflammation of the lungs only contributes to the diseases severity and makes symptoms worse.


Consider switching your household cleaning products to more natural ones, such as white vinegar, diluted lemon juice and/or colloidal silver.
To avoid inhalation of dust and other potentially irritating particles, wear a common medical / surgical mask while outside.

, Sarcoidosis patients occasionally have abnormally high levels of calcium in their blood, the reasons for which are not clear.However, if that's the case with you, then avoiding excessive amounts of calcium-rich foods is likely a good idea until the disease goes into remission or your blood composition changes.Calcium-rich foods include dairy products, sardines, canned salmon with the bones, collard greens, kale, broccoli and oranges.


Although vitamin D is important for strong bones and immune function, supplements should be discontinued (short-term) because the vitamin is responsible for increasing calcium absorption in the intestines.
In a related vein, vitamin D is produced by your skin in response to intense summer sunshine, so excessive sunbathing should also be avoided if you have sarcoidosis and high blood and/or urine levels of calcium.

Make sure you have the right doctors and keep up with them.,
Learn as much as you can about Lupus.,
Take care of yourself.,
Pay attention to your body.,
Talk to your doctor.,
Coping with lupus may require a lifestyle change.,
Keep in mind that stress can cause flare ups.,
Be aware that having lupus can be difficult for family and friends as well.,
Lupus is difficult to see.,
Most importantly, it can be difficult for YOU to deal with.,
Set boundaries with family and friends about who they talk about it with.",How to Cope With Having Lupus," Lupus patients generally have a variety of doctors, including a rheumatologist (for joints). It is essential that you keep your doctors well informed. If you don't get along well with one doctor, then find one that you do get along with.;
, Ask your doctor lots of questions and read up about it online. A good website to start is the Lupus Foundation of America, as listed below.

, Get enough sleep. Drink enough. Eat enough. Remember to take some time to relax.

, Learn to recognize signs of flare ups. If you start to feel ill, try to figure out what is causing it (sun? stress? working too hard?) so that you can avoid it. Also, if you recognize that you are having a flare, you can tell your doctor so that it gets under control before it gets out of hand.

, If you have questions or concerns, call your doctor. Don't worry about ""bothering them over something minor"", you have a serious illness and it's their job to help you with your health. It is better to ask too often than not enough.

, The majority of lupus patients are photosensitive (sensitive to UV or sunlight). Wear sunscreen and avoid excessive sun exposure.

, Try to take things one step at a time and not overdo it.

, They may have a difficult time understanding the disease and coping with the fact that you have it. Try to keep them well informed.

, It is common that people have a hard time understanding that you are ill. Try to educate them about lupus. Send them a link to a lupus website or give them a book about lupus to read.

, If you are having difficulty coping, you may want to consider seeing a psychiatrist, joining a support group (internet based or in real life), and talking to your doctor about it.

, If you don't want them telling everyone about it, tell them so. It is normal for a person to want to keep his/her medical information private.

Obtain the probability of nodal involvement by reference to factors such as clinical palpability, tumour size, lymphovascular invasion etc.,
Obtain the probability of false negative pertaining to a sample of n nodes.,
Call the desired probability of nodal involvement on the basis of a pathologic analysis of the sampled nodes the posterior probability.,
Alternatively, read the posterior probability from Table 2 below, which is found to be approximately 1% for a woman whose prior probability equals 20% and all 5 nodes sampled from her are found to be clear.",How to Compute the Probability of Nodal Involvement in Invasive Breast Cancer,"


Useful tables can be found in the medical literature. Call this probability the prior probability. See Table 6 in and Table 1 below which is a modification of Table 6 of by Professor Howell Tong (London School of Economics), see for details.

Probability of false negative, FN(n)

, Then apply the following formula: Posterior probability with a sample of n nodes which are all clear = FN(n) x prior probability / (1 - prior probability + FN(n) x prior probability). For small FN(n) x prior probability, which is usually the case, the posterior probability is approximately equally to FN(n) x prior probability / (1 - prior probability), i.e. False negative probability x odds (of nodal involvement).


Alternatively, use Table 1 to obtain a prediction before axillary sampling and then Table 2 to obtain your prediction after axillary sampling. Table 2 does not apply to samples that produce one or more positive nodes.
Example: Suppose the patient's breast tumour has size 1.6 centimeter (0.6 in). with no lymphovascular invasion and she discovered it by her feeling the lump herself. Reading off from Table 1, the prior probability of nodal involvement is equal to 0.2. Suppose 5 axillary nodes have been removed from her by the surgeon and all the nodes are found to be clear. Then because FN(5)=0.05, the posterior probability of nodal involvement = 0.05 x 0.2 / (1-0.2 + 0.05 x 0.2 ) = 0.0123=1.23%. The approximate formula gives 1.25%.

Work with your illness.,
Surround yourself with supportive people.,
Find ways to focus on the happy things.,
Ask your loved ones to be understanding about your limits.,
Ask for help.",How to Cope with an Invisible Disease1," Your illness may make it difficult to do every activity that you want to do. This doesn’t mean that you can't spend time with your family or friends. Find things to do with your family and friends that work with your illness.For example, you may not be able to go hiking or walk around a busy city all day due to your chronic pain. Instead, you can go on a sightseeing bus or boat tour, spend the day at a lake picnicking or fishing, or arrange a day at home where you play board games.
Ask your family and friends, “Can we do something different? My illness won’t allow me to do what you’ve planned, but we can do something else and have a good time.”;
, There will be people in your life who will support you and those who will always be negative about your condition. Try to distance yourself from those in your life who are not supportive. Instead, spend time with those who understand your condition and still treat you like a person.You have limited energy and emotional resources. You want to make sure you are placing your time and energy on people who are worth it.
For example, if you have chronic fatigue syndrome, people may not support you because it is a condition with symptoms they cannot see. CFS leaves you feeling drained and tired much of the time, so you don't want to waste your energy on people who are not supportive of you and your condition.

, Try to find happiness around you. You may feel negative or down due to your illness, but focusing on small things that make you happy can help you cope. Think about what makes you happy. Cultivate those interests and find ways to include those things in your life.For example, if you love to read but have MS, you may want to try large-print books or audiobooks if you get fatigued when reading. If you used to play a musical instrument but have a neurological disease, spend time listening to music.
Your illness may require you to readjust the way you think and do things. If you think outside of the box and more positively, you will be able to figure out ways to bring happiness into your life.

, For people with invisible illnesses, getting out of the house and being active can be very difficult. Though you would love to go to every dinner or party you are invited to, that is not always an option. Discuss with your loved ones that you have limits and that you would like them to respect those limits.For example, you may only be able to attend one dinner a month or one every six months due to chronic fatigue syndrome, MS, or depression. Let your loved ones know that doesn’t mean you don’t care about them.
Tell your loved ones that it is helpful for them to say things like, “I will invite you to these engagements, but you don’t have to attend. I will be happy when you do come, but there is no pressure. I understand your limits.”

, You may experience times when you need to ask for help. You have limited energy and may not be able to get everything done each day. If this is the case, you may want to ask your loved ones for help with small things.For example, if a friend or family member is going to the grocery store, you may want to ask them to pick you up a few things. If you live with others, you might ask them to do a load of laundry or load the dishwasher on days when you have limited energy.

Try herbs that may be useful in Crohn’s disease: Herbs such as Glycyrrhiza glabra, Asparagus racemosus etc can be beneficial in Crohn’s disease.",How to Diagnose and Treat Crohn's Disease," The symptoms of Crohn's disease are similar to those of other intestinal disorders, such as ulcerative colitis and irritable bowel syndrome. The symptoms may come and go and can vary from mild to severe. They will differ from person to person, depending on what part of the gastrointestinal tract is infected. Some of the most common symptoms include:



Diarrhea: The inflammation that occurs in Crohn's disease causes cells in the affected areas of your intestine to secrete large amounts of water and salt. Because the colon can't completely absorb this excess fluid, you develop diarrhea.

Abdominal pain and cramping: Inflammation and ulceration may cause the walls of portions of your bowel to swell and eventually thicken with scar tissue. This affects the normal movement of intestinal tract contents through your digestive tract and may lead to pain and cramping.

Blood in your stool: Food moving through your digestive tract can cause inflamed tissue to bleed, or your bowel may also bleed on its own.

Ulcers: Crohn's disease begins as small, scattered sores on the surface of the intestine. Eventually these sores may become large ulcers that penetrate deep into — and sometimes through — the intestinal walls.

Reduced appetite and weight loss: Abdominal pain and cramping and the inflammatory reaction in the wall of your bowel can affect both your appetite and your ability to digest and absorb food.

Fistula or abscess: Inflammation from Crohn's disease may tunnel through the wall of the bowel into adjacent organs, such as the bladder or vagina, creating an abnormal connection called a fistula. This can also lead to an abscess; a swollen, pus-filled sore.;
, Aside from the above mentioned symptoms, people with Crohn's disease may experience other, less-common side effects such as joint pain, constipation and swollen gums.


People with severe Crohn's disease may experience fever and fatigue as well as problems that occur outside the digestive tract, including arthritis, eye inflammation, skin disorders, and inflammation of the liver or bile ducts.
Children with Crohn's disease may have delayed growth or sexual development., Call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following symptoms:


Feel faint or have a fast and weak pulse.
Severe stomach pain.
Unexplained fever or shaking chills lasting more than a day or two.
Repeated vomiting.
Blood in your stool.
Ongoing bouts of diarrhea that don't respond to over-the-counter (OTC) medications.

, If your doctor suspects that you might have Crohn's disease, he/she may refer you to a gastroenterologist (digestive system specialist) to undergo different diagnostic tests. These may include:



Blood tests: Your doctor may suggest blood tests to check for anemia, which is a common side effect of Crohn's disease (due to blood loss).

Colonoscopy: This test allows your doctor to view your entire colon using a thin, flexible, lighted tube with an attached camera. With the camera, the doctor will be able to identify any inflammation, bleeding or ulcers on the wall of the colon.

Flexible sigmoidoscopy: In this procedure, your doctor uses a slender, flexible, lighted tube to examine the sigmoid, which is the last 2 feet (0.6 m) of your colon.

Barium enema: This diagnostic test allows your doctor to evaluate your large intestine with an X-ray. Before the test, barium, a contrast dye, is placed into your bowel by way of enema.

Small bowel X-ray: This test uses x-ray to examine the part of the small bowel that can't be seen by colonoscopy.

Computerized tomography (CT): Sometimes you may need a CT scan, which is a special x-ray technique that provides more detail than a standard x-ray. This test looks at the entire bowel as well as at tissues outside the bowel that can't be seen with other tests.

Capsule endoscopy: If you have signs and symptoms that suggest Crohn's disease but the usual diagnostic tests are negative, your doctor may perform capsule endoscopy.

, Many different medications are used to control symptoms of Crohn's disease. The type of medication that works for you will depend on the specific nature of your Crohn's disease and the severity of your symptoms. Some commonly used drug treatments include:



Anti-inflammatory drugs: These drugs are often the first step in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. They include sulfasalazine (Azulfidine) which is useful mainly in colonic disease , mesalamine (Asacol, Rowasa) which may help to prevent a relapse of Crohn's disease after surgery, and corticosteroids.

Immune system suppressors: These drugs also reduce inflammation, but they target your immune system rather than treating inflammation itself. They include azathioprine (Imuran) and mercaptopurine (Purinethol), infliximab (Remicade), adalimumab (Humira), certolizumab pegol (Cimzia), methotrexate (Rheumatrex), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), and natalizumab (Tysabri).

Antibiotics: These can heal fistulas and abscesses in people with Crohn's disease. They include metronidazole (Flagyl) and ciprofloxacin (Cipro).

Antidiarrheal agents: Crohn's disease patients who suffer from chronic diarrhea usually respond well to antidiarrheal agents such as loperamide. Loperamide - which is sold commercially as Imodium - can be bought over-the-counter without a prescription.

Bile acid sequestrants: Patients with terminal ileal disease or a previous resection of the ileum (end part of the small intestine) may not absorb bile acids normally which can lead to secretory diarrhea in the colon. These patients may benefit from bile acid sequestrants like cholestyramine or colestipol.

Other medications: Some other medications that may relieve symptoms of Crohn's disease include steroids, immune system suppressors, fiber supplements, laxatives, pain relievers, iron supplements, vitamin B12 shots, and calcium and vitamin D supplements.

, There's no firm evidence that what you eat actually causes inflammatory bowel disease. But certain foods and beverages can aggravate the disease (especially during a flare-up) while others can help to ease symptoms and prevent future flare-ups.


Fiber supplementation is said to be beneficial for patients with colonic disease. This is due to the fact that dietary fiber can be converted to short-chain fatty acids, which help the colon to heal itself.
Try to avoid dairy products, as most patients with Crohn's disease (particularly of the small intestine) are lactose intolerant. You may use calcium supplements to make up for any deficiencies and decrease the risk of osteoporosis.
Avoid foods which tend to cause gas and bloating such as beans and leafy green vegetables. You should also limit your intake of fatty, greasy or fried foods which can interfere with healthy digestion. In addition, you should try to eat smaller amounts throughout the day, to minimize bloating and avoid putting excess strain on your digestive system.
In certain circumstances, your doctor may recommend a special diet given via a feeding tube (enteral) or nutrients injected into a vein (parenteral) to treat your Crohn's disease. This is a temporary way of providing nutrition, usually to people who's intestines need to rest following surgery, or who's intestines are failing to absorb nutrients by themselves.Be aware that every Crohn's patient is different and may have their own unique food intolerances. A good way to identify such intolerances is to keep a daily food journal where you make a note of everything you eat. This can help you to identify food items that exacerbate your symptoms. Once you are aware of which foods cause your symptoms, you can make an effort to avoid them.

, Although Crohn's disease can't be cured, you can minimize symptoms and live a normal, full life by following your doctor recommended treatments and making several healthy lifestyle choices. These include:



Reduce stress: Although stress doesn't cause Crohn's disease, it can make your signs and symptoms much worse and may trigger flare-ups. Although it's not always possible to avoid stress, you can learn ways to help manage it.

Quit smoking: If you smoke, you are far more likely to develop Crohn's disease. In addition, smoking worsens the symptom's of Crohn's disease, and increases the likelihood of complications and surgical intervention.Exercise more: Regular exercise will help you to maintain a healthy weight and reduce stress - two things that can make a huge difference in helping you to control the disease. Try to find a form of exercise that you enjoy doing - whether it's a dance class, rock climbing or dragon boat racing.

Avoid drinking alcohol: Symptoms of Crohn's disease can be worsened as a result of drinking alcohol. Therefore, it is recommended that you drink only in moderation, or cut out alcohol completely.

, If diet and lifestyle changes, drug therapy or other treatments don't relieve your signs and symptoms, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove a damaged portion of your digestive tract or to close fistulas or remove scar tissue. The three mains types of surgery Crohn's patients undergo are as follows:



Proctocolectomy: This procedure involves the removal of the rectum and all or part of the colon. It is performed with the patient under general anesthetic by a specialized surgeon. Recovery time is usually between 4 and 6 weeks.

Ileostomy: An ileostomy is a second procedure that is performed in addition to the proctocolectomy. It involves attaching the ileum (the end part of the small intestine) to an opening in the abdomen (called a stoma). A small bag (called an ostomy pouch) is attached to the stoma to collect stool. After the surgery, the patient will be shown how to empty and clean the pouch, and can go on to live a healthy, normal life.

Intestinal resection surgery: This type of surgery involves the removal of just the diseased section of the intestine. After the removal, the two healthy ends are attached, allowing the intestines to resume normal function. Recovery usually takes 3 to 4 weeks.
The NIH estimates that approximately two thirds of people with Crohn's disease will require surgery at some point in their lives, when they fail to respond to other treatments. Unfortunately, the disease often returns following surgery, so further procedures may be required. If Crohn's Disease is presenting with stubborn fistulae (Fistulising Crohn's Disease) then an Ayurvedic Para Surgical Technique known as ""Kshar Sutra Therapy"" is proved very effective along with Ayurvedic (herbal) medicines.,


Studies on Glycyrrhiza glabra (liquorice) suggest that this herb may normalize the environment in the intestines by reducing the inflammation and promote the healing of ulcers.
Studies on Asparagus racemosus suggest that this herb may soothe the gastric mucosal lining and promote the repair of damaged and stressed tissues.
Studies on Valeriana Officinalis suggest that this Advanced Resonance Homeopathic remedy may relieve symptoms like abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, involuntary passing of stools, and nausea.
Studies on Veratrum Album suggest that this Advanced Resonance Homeopathic remedy may relieve loose and watery stools.

Remind yourself it’s not your fault.,
Try not to feel embarrassed.,
Accept that people may not accept the condition.",How to Cope with an Invisible Disease2," Because of the nature of invisible illnesses, some people start feeling like they are responsible for their sickness or are making it up. This leads to thoughts that you should be able to “get over it” and get better. Though you may look fine on the outside, your illness is real.This may be especially true if you have conditions like depression or mental illness, IBS, CFS, or migraines. Some people may think these are not real conditions and that you can control your symptoms.
Tell yourself, “It is not my fault that I am ill. I cannot make myself better. I have a very real disease, and that’s okay.”

, When you are around your family and friends, you may feel guilty or embarrassed about your condition. You may not be able to to do the same things that they can, which can cause negative feelings. Remember that your illness is valid, so you should not feel guilty.Whenever you feel embarrassed or guilty, remind yourself, “This is not my fault. I have nothing to be embarrassed or guilty about.”

, Despite your efforts to educate others and explain what you go through, some people may never think that you are sick. They only will believe something they can see with their own eyes. Remember, this is not your fault. You cannot change the way someone thinks.Try your best to explain and educate them, but if they won’t accept it, let it go.

"
"
Explain to your family and friends how to react.,
Help your loved ones learn what not to say.,
Educate yourself and others about your illness.",How to Cope with an Invisible Disease3," Many family members and friends want to help and be supportive when you have an invisible illness. If they are unsure how to help, tell them. Let them know what you need from them and how they can be supportive.Help your family members and friends understand they should drop all assumptions about your invisible illness. This can lead to condescending comments and a lack of understanding. Encourage your family and friends to approach you with an open mind.
You may tell them how to compliment you without trivializing your illness. For example, they may say, “You look great today. I’m sorry you don’t feel well,” or, “I’m sorry you don’t feel as good as you look.” Let them know that they can compliment you by saying, “Your hair looks nice,” or, “I like that outfit.” They don’t always have to mention your illness.

, Though your friends and family may mean well, they may not know how to talk about the subject, how to treat you, or what to say. This may lead to them saying or doing something that hurts you. Point out to your loved ones how things they say are offensive and hurtful.For example, tell your loved ones not to say things like, “But you don’t look sick,” “It’s all in your head,” “It could be worse,” or “Wouldn’t you feel better if you got out more/did more/were more active?” All of these things can be very hurtful.
Help them realize that trying to tell you how to “cure” yourself or “treat” your condition belittles your condition. Say to them, “I am aware of treatment and management options for my condition. My doctor and I work very closely together. I can explain my management plan to you if you would like.”
For example, people often think depression can be ""cured"" by getting out or thinking positively. They may think you can cure your CFS with more sleep or that IBS is in your head. These assumptions can be very hurtful.

, Many people only believe illness is something they can see. This means they might not know or understand your condition. To help yourself cope, first educate yourself about your disease. This can help you understand more about your condition and help you know how it affects your body even though it’s invisible.You should also help educate those around you about your illness. Give your condition a name for people so they associate the way you feel with a name, even if it’s chronic pain.
Explain the symptoms to your family and friends. Since there are no visible symptoms, help them understand what is going on inside your body.
Tell your family and friends about treatment options and management strategies.

"
"
Create a management plan with your doctor.,
Find a doctor who believes you.,
Talk to a counselor.,

If you are not in the habit of paying attention to your diet, level of activity, and other factors that affect your health, now may be the time to make some positive changes.Caring for your body will not only make you feel better physically, it will also make you happier.

, Some of the best lifestyle changes to start with are those that reduce harm upon your body. In particular, if you smoke, strongly consider stopping. There are many resources to help you do so. Similarly, cut back on drinking alcoholic beverages, especially if you have more than a few drinks per week.Ask any member of your medical team about how to quit smoking, or look online for information and other types of support from organizations like the American Cancer Society.

Get past the initial shock together.,
Listen to and love your spouse.,
Notify family and friends.,
Get both your and your spouse's families involved, as appropriate.,
Take care of yourself.,

Make plans.,
Attend to your own career and finances.,

Indulge your spouse's new eating preferences.,
Help to adapt your living space to your spouse's changing needs and capacities.,
Understand all you can about your spouse's illness and care.",How to Support a Spouse who Has Cancer," If your spouse was just diagnosed with cancer, it is normal and natural for you both to feel shaken and scared, angry, tearful, and many other emotions.

Hold each other. The most important thing you can give your spouse right now is your love.
Don't be too afraid to show own feelings at this time. You're scared because you love him or her.
Take your time. If it takes a whole evening or a whole weekend or longer to begin to come to grips with the diagnosis, let it.;
, This may be the most valuable thing you can do right now. You know your spouse better than anyone else, and you trust each other. Besides, isn't it what you asked of each other in the first place?

Understand that neither you nor your spouse may have the right words to talk about these things. You may have awkward moments, and you may have to agree with each other that any words (even if they are not the ""right"" ones) are better than no words.

, This may be as hard as receiving the diagnosis yourself. If you are up to it, offer to make at least some of the difficult phone calls for your spouse.

If you can’t bring yourself to tell many people, tell one or two and ask them to help do the retelling. The truth will still be unpleasant, but at least it won’t be unpleasant all alone.
You need not be in the spotlight now, either. It is enough to get through this, whatever way you can.
In the longer term, consider setting up a blog, email list, or some other communication network to keep friends and family informed of your spouse's progress without having to share news repeatedly with each individual.
Part of your role may be to field questions and suggestions from concerned family and friends. Nobody knows what to say at a time like this. Some of the questions will be painful, and it's possible that some suggestions will be unhelpful or ""too helpful."" Some will be too honest or too tactful. They may even challenge or contradict your beliefs. Remember that these people mean well. If you have no better response, a simple ""Thank you for keeping us in your thoughts"" is a good way to acknowledge their concern.

, Family is whatever you and your spouse define it to be. Choose people whom you trust. Neither you nor your spouse need to go through this alone.

Try to give people something they can do even if it is something simple like bringing food to share when they come to visit. Most people are eager to help but don't know how.

, No, you’re not the one who was just handed a diagnosis, but you need to stay well enough to help. When you travel on an airplane, you are instructed to put your own oxygen mask on before helping others. The same principle holds for helping your spouse.

This may mean doing things like getting enough sleep, continuing to eat healthfully, and even taking a day off now and then (leaving the care to others whom you trust, as needed).

, This is the dreaded ""getting your affairs in order."" While it's unpleasant to think about, and it may even seem selfish to you, both of you should be prepared in case the worst does happen. Think of it this way: even if your spouse survives the cancer, you will both feel more comfortable knowing that you have put your personal affairs in order.

Prepare or update your will and/or trust. You may need to consult with an attorney.
Keep your spouse's existing medical insurance current. If it drops for any reason, it will be difficult or impossible to reinstate it later.
Prepare a power of attorney (or equivalent document, for both financial matters and health care decisions.
Prepare an emergency health care directive stating your spouse's wishes clearly regarding extraordinary measures. Discuss with your spouse's doctor or another knowledgeable professional as to what procedures you will need to make firm decisions about: CPR, feeding tubes, respirators. Make your decisions well before an emergency occurs and be clear about what measures your spouse would like to be taken, and what he or she would prefer to avoid.
Make sure your financial accounts and major assets (vehicles, house, etc.) are in both of your names and that you both have easy access to them.
Review and, if necessary, update the beneficiary information on any retirement or investment accounts that have it.
Get your user names, passwords, and security questions in order and available to both of you.
Make arrangements for childcare in the event of your spouse's death or if you are called upon to spend more time caring for your spouse. It might be helpful to have a group of neighbors willing to care for your children any time of day or night. Perhaps they can coordinate a schedule amongst themselves.
Discuss plans and preferences for burial or cremation and any related services. Remember, you may not need to execute these plans; they will not hasten your spouse's death. But you will spare yourself from making difficult, uncomfortable decisions at an even more uncomfortable time. Funeral arrangements can be expensive, so you may wish to set aside funds in advance, too.
Learn to perform any tasks that have been the responsibility (or mostly the responsibility) of your spouse. This may mean identifying the bills to pay each month, learning to cook, or caring for your spouse's pets or garden.
Collect your contacts or address book information all in one place. While there may not be any direct legal or financial relevance, it will help immensely in keeping track of and informing old friends.

, You will have to set priorities, but if you have a job and can keep it, it will help in all kinds of ways.

Look into your options for taking time off in case you need to care for your spouse. There may be different options depending on your place of employment as well as your state or local laws. Your human resources department should be able to point you in the right direction.
Inform your supervisor in advance that you may need to take a leave of absence.
Set aside a savings account if you can. It will help with medical expenses and it will see you through in case you need to take any unpaid leave.
If your spouse becomes incapacitated, find out whether he or she is eligible to collect disability insurance, sickness benefits, and in-home health care.

, Chemotherapy can cause nausea, but it can also cause flavors to taste ""off""; food may taste metallic or bitter. Gently encourage your spouse to eat what he/she can. Ask what tastes good and find a way to cook it or get it. Don't be troubled if your spouse's preferences have changed.

If you eat out, you can always order something else for yourself in a restaurant.
Your spouse may eat little and keep down even less while undergoing chemotherapy. Ask your doctors what to expect and what special steps to take if or when this happens.

, Depending on your spouse's condition and treatments, he or she may come to have difficulty climbing stairs, standing for extended periods, and doing other things you had taken for granted before. Your spouse's needs may change with time, and you most likely know best what adaptations are necessary at any given time, but here are some general considerations.

Stairs may pose a particular challenge for an individual with limited mobility. You may need to arrange ground-floor living quarters and bathroom facilities.
A ramp can cover entrance and exit steps.
Clear ample space and pathways for walker or wheelchair use.
Remember that medical supplies and equipment may be rented, and that medical insurance may help to cover the costs of such things as wheelchairs, walkers, hospital-style adjustable beds, oxygen machines, and many other things.
Doctors and hospice staff can help with specific suggestions for your spouse's condition.

, Your understanding will result in timing friend and family visits, preparing for those difficult days following chemotherapy sessions, and providing a schedule that fosters well-being and recovery.

Ask questions of your spouse's doctors and nurses. These questions may be about anything from where the cancer is to what special care your spouse may need at home. Be alert to times when your spouse isn't able or willing to ask relevant questions.
Help keep track of symptoms and side-effects your spouse experiences between treatments. Side effects that ensue from radiation and chemotherapy treatments range from nausea to sleeplessness to hiccups and acne. If you are informed, many of these side-effects can be alleviated. Write down the information you receive. In this situation, you may find that you cannot rely solely on your memory.
Talk openly and be honest, give doctors and nurses the best and clearest information you can, and trust them to provide the best care they can.
Keep detailed notes on all of the medications your spouse takes. A written list, either on the computer or handwritten, can be of great help. Ask pharmacists or others to make sure you know both the brand name and generic names of drugs, and keep track of the dosage and frequency. You should be prepared to brief any medical professional on this vital information.
You can help your spouse a great deal by acting as a patient advocate in this way.

However, red, yellow and orange vegetables have high levels of vitamins and antioxidants that can help keep your colon healthy.What makes these vegetables that particular color are the vitamins and antioxidants that are found in them. Red, yellow and orange vegetables are particularly high in an antioxidant known as beta carotene which is an orange/red color.
This antioxidant is often associated with Vitamin A as it is a precursor to becoming Vitamin A in your body. Adequate intakes are also associated with a decreased rate of colon cancer.
Include a one cup serving of any of these colored vegetables. You can try: red, yellow and orange bell peppers, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, butternut squash and carrots.;
, Another group of foods that can help protect your colon and resist the formation of polyps are folate-rich foods. Luckily, folate can be found in a wide variety of foods.


Studies have shown that an intake of 400 IU of folate every day can help prevent the formation of polyps but also helps prevent colon cancer as well.400 IU of folate is easily consumed if you eat a balanced diet and focus on folate-rich foods.
Specific foods that are high in folate include: fortified breakfast cereals, spinach, black-eyed peas, asparagus, broccoli, green peas, whole wheat bread and peanuts.

, Calcium is another commonly found mineral that has been shown to prevent the formation of colon polyps. Including regular servings of foods high in calcium can help protect your colon.


One study in particular showed that those people who consumed 1200 mg of calcium daily (which you can get from three servings of calcium-rich foods), had a 20% less recurrence of cancerous colon polyps.Calcium is found most commonly in dairy foods. You can have milk, yogurt, kefir, cheese or cottage cheese to get in an adequate serving of calcium.
In addition, calcium is found in other plant-based foods outside of the dairy group. Almonds, broccoli, dark greens, and fortified orange juice or soy milk offer another source of calcium.

, Some foods contain a certain type of fat called omega-3 fats. Often known as heart healthy fats, these fats are also beneficial to your colon.

Specifically, studies have shown that a lack of adequate water can lead to dehydration and polyp formation in your colon.When you don't drink adequate amounts of fluids, your body will harvest free water from other areas - like your stool or other cells. This causes dehydration and constipation.
Decreased bowel transit time and the concentration of carcinogenic compounds that are found in cells can increase your risk for the growth of cancerous polyps.
Health professionals recommend drinking about 64 oz or 8 glasses of water everyday. However, you may need to increase your water intake to prevent constipation., Vegetables are high in a variety of nutrients that can keep your body healthy. However, they're also high in fiber which can help protect your colon.


Fiber is essential to keeping your bowels moving at a healthy speed. When your bowel transit is slow, you increase your risk for colon polyps and cancer.To meet your recommended fiber intake, include three to five servings of vegetables everyday. Measure out one cup of vegetables or two cups of salad greens.Vegetables that are particularly high in fiber include: artichokes, asparagus, avocado, sweet potatoes, bean sprouts, dark greens, beets, broccoli, cauliflower and cabbage.

, Fruits are also high in a variety of nutrients. Some fruits are also exceptionally high in fiber which can help you increase your overall fiber intake.

, One specific group of foods that are also known for being very high in fiber are grains. However, choose 100% whole grains over the refined grains for the most nutrient dense choice.


Whenever you choose to eat grains (like bread, rice or pasta), go for 100% whole grains. These foods are less processed and much higher in fiber compared to refined grains (like white rice or white bread).Include two to three servings of whole grains every day. Measure these out to 1/2 cup of cooked grains or 2 oz per serving.Choose foods like: brown rice, quinoa, oatmeal, whole wheat bread, whole grain pasta, millet, farro or barley.

, You might not think that many protein foods are high in fiber. But vegetarian sources of protein do offer a decent amount of fiber per serving.


Legumes are not only high in protein, but are also very high in fiber. These are a great food group to add to your diet to help increase your overall fiber intake.
Legumes are a plant-based group that include foods like beans, lentils and nuts.
Since they do fall into the protein group, they follow the recommendations for those serving sizes. Measure out 1/2 cup of these foods per serving.Choose foods like: black beans, chickpeas, lentils, peanuts, soy beans, lima beans, kidney beans and pinto beans.

, Since fiber plays such an important role in general health, many food manufacturers have been adding fiber to their products. This is a great way to help people meet their daily needs.


Fiber is found in a wide variety of foods, but it can still be difficult to meet your daily needs. Men need 38 g of fiber daily while women need about 25 g of fiber daily.In addition to choosing foods and food groups that are high in fiber, also look for foods that have added fiber to them. This fiber is added during the processing of the food and can help you meet your needs.
Foods that are commonly fortified with extra fiber include: yogurt, soy milk, cereals, breads, orange juice and granola bars.

, Although there are many foods that you should eat more often to help prevent colon polyps, there are foods that you should limit or avoid.


Saturated fats, unlike omega-3 fats, have been shown to increase your risk for the formation of colon polyps and colon cancer.One study in particular found that for every additional 100 grams of red meat that you consume (which is higher in saturated fat) your risk for colon cancer increases by 14%.
Limit meats: fatty cuts of beef, salami, hot dogs, bacon, sausage and deli meat. These are highly processed and high in saturated fat.
If you do choose to have these foods occasionally, stick to the appropriate portion of 3 to 4 oz total per serving., You may not realize that another group of foods that has been linked to colon polyps and colon cancer are sugary, sweetened foods. Limit these in your diet.


The sugar from sweetened foods increase your glucose levels. Studies have shown that with increased glucose levels, your risk for the formation of colon cancer increases as well.Foods that are high in sugar and that should be limited include: sweetened beverages, candy, cookies, cakes, pies, ice cream, sugary cereals, pastries and fruit juices.
If you do choose to have these foods, make sure they are small portions and something you only eat occasionally - not on a regular basis.

, In addition to avoiding or limiting certain foods, you should also take care of how you prepare certain foods. Charring or burning foods when you cook them may increase your risk of colon cancer.When you cook foods, especially over a grill, you can char or burn them. Although this may taste good, this charring creates carcinogenic substances in the food which have been associated with higher rates of colon cancer.
If you are grilling foods try to avoid foods from becoming overly charred. When eating, avoid the blackened bits or areas that are charred. Remove with a fork and knife so they are completely removed from your serving.
Another trick is to grill or cook foods over aluminum foil. This helps prevent foods from becoming too charred or burned.

, In addition to sweetened beverages, alcoholic beverages have also been linked to the formation of colon polyps. You should limit your overall intake of alcoholic beverages.


Studies have shown that regular consumption of alcohol (more than the recommended limit of one to two glasses daily) is associated with increased risk of colon polyp formation.In addition, those people who have had a history of colon polyps are at an increased risk for those polyps becoming cancerous with more excessive intake of alcoholic beverages.
Try to limit how much alcohol you consume. Women shouldn't consume more than one drink daily and men should limit their intake to two drinks or less per day.

Be a good listener.,
Acknowledge their feelings.,
Make extra time for them.,
Keep up morale.",How to Support Someone Diagnosed With Cancer1," One of the best ways to show your support is by letting your friend know that you are ready to listen. Tell her that you understand that she may not want to talk about her illness, but that when she does, you'll be there. Don't assume that your friend already knows this. It's always welcome to hear that someone is ready to be there for you.Be an active listener. Don't just listen, participate in the conversation. Indicate that you are engaged by responding with nods of the head, maintaining eye contact, and making appropriate facial expressions.
Ask questions. Don't interrupt your friend, but at appropriate pauses, ask questions to indicate that you are listening. Try saying something like, ""So, you'll be going for treatment three days a week, right? Will you have a set schedule, or will it vary?"";
, Receiving a cancer diagnosis is clearly a very emotional experience. Make it clear to your friend that you understand that they will be going through a range of feelings. Don't try to project your own feelings onto her, and don't try to neglect their emotions.Your friend might tell you that she is scared. For many people, it is a natural response to say something like, ""Don't worry, you'll be fine."" Try to avoid brushing aside your friend's feelings, even though you mean well.
Acknowledge their feelings by paraphrasing. For example, you can say, ""I hear you saying that you're scared that you won't be around to see your kids grow up. That must be a terrifying feeling. How can I help?""

, Try to be flexible when making plans with your friend. Be aware that they will probably need some extra support. Let them know that you are available to keep them company whenever they want. But you should also be careful not to overstay your welcome. They will likely tire easily, so be aware that while your visits might be more frequent, they might also be shorter.Be available, but also be normal. Try to treat your friend as you always have. Their health might have changed, but she's still the same person. For example, if the two off you have typically joked and teased each other a lot, don't stop.
Try to keep doing activities that are typical. Maybe the two of you used to have a standing date to go see a movie each weekend. Your friend might not be up for that, but you can still over to come over for a Netflix and popcorn night.

, It is natural that you will also be upset by your friend's diagnosis. It's totally okay to cry together and let them know that you are upset. Just don't let that be all you do. Remember, you are there to support her.Try to find some positive things to discuss with your friend.

Ask what you can do.,
Do small things.,
Talk to the family.,
Participate in the cause.",How to Support Someone Diagnosed With Cancer2," Often, the best way to know how you can help is to ask your friend what they need. You can also ask specific questions, such as ""Do you need a ride to your chemo appointment?"" This will let them know that you are willing to do specific tasks, and you're not just making a vague offer.If your friend has children, offer to take them off of their hands once or twice a week. They can get some rest and you can provide the kids with some fun.

, Sometimes we take for granted our ability to complete what seem like ordinary, everyday tasks. When your friend is diagnosed with cancer, they might feel overwhelmed by everyday life. Offer to help run simple errands, such as going to the post office or dry cleaners'.Often, our natural instinct is to send food (and lots of it) when someone is sick. Unfortunately, cancer patients offer suffer from a loss of appetite. Instead of loading them down with casseroles, ask your friend if you can go grocery shopping for them. Have them provide a list of things that sound good to them.

, Remember, it's not just your friend who is going through a tough time.Their family is also going through a very emotional situation. Try talking to their spouse, parents, or kids, if appropriate. Let them know that you are there to lean on and offer to help in any way that you can.If your friend is married, you could say something like, ""I know you're going through a hard time, too. Let me know if you want me to keep Ann company while you go relax with your friends some evening.""

, A great way to show that you care is by working to find a cure for cancer. There are many great organizations that have regular fundraising events. Look for one in your area and sign up.Simple ways to show support for friends or family members with cancer include the #NoHairSelfie. One can either physically or virtually shave their head, take a picture, share the image of themselves on social media and raise money for cancer research. In addition to being a symbol of courage for your loved one, sharing your selfie with friends and family brings together a community of support for your loved one.
Alternately, for specific types of cancer such as breast cancer, one can look into walking in one of the three day walks organized by the Susan G. Komen Foundation. Don't forget to wear a shirt with your friend's name on it to further show your support.
No matter which activity you engage in, recruit others to join you. Building a committed and active support network is a great way to show your friend that you are dedicated to helping them in the fight against cancer.

You can get information from your doctor or local hospital.Learn to speak the language. For example, cancer is diagnosed in stages. Find out whether your friend is Stage 1 (non-invasive) or Stage 4 (invasive and most advanced).
If it seems appropriate, ask about the prognosis. You don't want to be too aggressive when asking questions, but if your friend seems to want to talk, ask questions to let them know that you are interested and that you care.

, Once you understand what type of cancer your friend has, you can start to learn about the type of treatment. Often, cancer is treated with surgery. Other times, chemotherapy is the first step. If you don't understand what your friend is talking about, ask. They'll be glad you are concerned.If your friend is set to have surgery, help her plan for her post-surgery care. Make sure she knows you're around to walk their dog. You can also help out by bringing magazines and treats to the hospital.
If your friend is going through chemotherapy, you can offer to keep her company during the treatments. Take along a deck of cards or download some great T.V. shows on their iPad. They'll be glad to have distractions.

, Cancer takes a huge toll on a person, both physically and emotionally. Learn some of the common issues cancer patients deal with. By knowing what to expect, you will be better prepared to support your friend.Be aware that your friend might look physically different. For example, they might suffer from hair and weight loss.
Feeling extremely tired is another side effect. Be patient with your friend if they doze off while you are spending time together. They might also be more forgetful than usual, so don't be offended if they forget some details of a story you told them.

, This cancer diagnosis is difficult for your friend, but it is also difficult for you. Make sure that you have a good support system around you to help you cope with your emotions. If you know others who have been in the same situation, ask for advice on how they dealt with all of their feelings.Consider talking to a therapist if you are having trouble coping with your sadness.
Be kind to yourself. It takes a lot of energy to support a loved one who is going through cancer, so make sure to take time for yourself and relax.

If you experience any of the following symptoms, call a doctor and arrange an appointment, preferably within 24 hours.Fluid draining from your ear (especially if smelly, bloody, or pus-like)
Fever
An increase in pain or redness on the skin behind your ear
Severe dizziness
Facial weakness
Buzzing or other noise in your ears
Patients with diabetes, especially older patients or patients with severe ear pain, are at-risk for more serious infection and should visit a doctor urgently. Ask to be referred to an otolaryngologist (ear and throat doctor).;
, Avoid swimming or putting your head underwater. While showering, place cotton balls loosely in your ears to prevent water from entering them.Do not attempt to dry out your ears using cotton or any other object. Cotton swabs increase the risk of infection, and are particularly dangerous when the ear is already infected.

, You can use an electric heating pad set to low, or a warm, dry towel. Hold over your ear for a few minutes to relieve pain. You may notice some drainage as earwax melts.To create a dry, warm compress, microwave a wet washcloth, then seal it in a zip-locked bag. You can wrap a second, dry towel over the bag for more comfort.
To avoid burning, do not apply the compress to children, or to a sleeping person.

, Over-the-counter NSAIDs such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen can reduce pain if you are experiencing significant discomfort.

, The serious symptoms listed earlier may be signs that you have a ruptured eardrum, caused by pressure from the infection. The following treatments are unsafe with this condition, since the fluids can drain past the eardrum and into your inner ear. Always visit a doctor if you have one of these symptoms along with swimmer's ear.


If you have ever had a damaged eardrum or ear surgery in the past, consult a doctor before using the treatments below, even if you do not have these symptoms., Create an equal mix of white vinegar and 70% rubbing alcohol, heated until warm but not hot.Alternatively, purchase a non-aqueous acetic acid eardrop at a drugstore.Putting cold or hot liquids in your ear may lead to dizziness. Try to warm the solution to roughly your body temperature.

, Some earwax is fine, but if the ear canal is blocked or if dirt or debris is in the ear, it may need cleaning first. Fill a bulb syringe with the vinegar and alcohol mixture and squirt a trickle into your ear canal, letting it drain out.


Warm water rinsing is not recommended for swimmer's ear.If your ear still feels blocked, visit an otolaryngologist or ask a general practice doctor for a referral. The otolaryngologist can clean your ear more effectively using suction.Never perform this step on a person with diabetes, not even at a doctor's office., The alcohol will help remaining moisture evaporate, while the vinegar will make your ear canal more acidic. Both of these make your ear a less welcoming place for bacteria. Apply with the following method:


Warm the solution by rubbing the container in your hands or placing it in a cup of warm water – without mixing the two liquids together.
Lie down with your ear facing upward.
Have an assistant place two or three drops on the wall of the ear canal, allowing air to escape so drops can get into the ear. Gently wiggling your ears will aid in this process.
Remain lying down for a few minutes., If there are no signs of improvement, a doctor should be able to examine your ear and recommend one or more of the following treatments:An antibacterial eardrop (or more rarely, an antifungal eardrop)
Insertion of a wick into a swollen ear canal, to allow eardrops to penetrate
Oral or injected antibiotics if the infection has spread
Surgical cleaning of the ear canal
Incision and drainage of an abscess
Let your doctor know if you are diabetic, immune-compromised, or if you have had ear surgery or a punctured eardrum in the past.

, Contrary to popular belief, cleaning your ear with a cotton swab or any other object can actually damage the ear canal and increase the risk of infection. A thin layer of earwax is necessary for a healthy ear.Even excessive water irrigation to remove earwax can cause damage.If you suffer from excessive earwax, ask a doctor for advice on safe treatment.
Excessive soap use on your ears can increase the chance of infection due to the raised pH levels., The use of earplugs while swimming is controversial among medical professionals. On the one hand, they can prevent water entering your ear canal. On the other hand, inserting any object into your ear can damage it and make it more susceptible to infection.Ask your doctor for advice, taking into account the state of your ear canal and the likelihood of exposure to bacteria where you swim.

, Use a dry towel or hair dryer to dry your ears after swimming or showering. If you feel water in your ear canal, place a drop of vinegar mixed with a drop of rubbing alcohol in your ears to hasten drying and reduce the chance of bacterial growth., Hair spray and hair dye contain chemicals that can damage your ear canal. Place cotton balls loosely over your ear canal to prevent this during application., Go see an otolaryngologist if you have itchy, flaky, scaly ears or extensive earwax.

Let your loved one lead.,
Talk about it.,
Expect change.,
Do your research.,
Go to medical appointments.,
Find a way to keep in touch.,
Ask for help.,
Take care of yourself.,
Find some time to enjoy each other.",How to Care for Someone with Breast Cancer," Your loved one may need to talk right away or they may need space to figure out how they are feeling. Be supportive of them either way. For now, it is probably best to listen and let your loved one lead the conversation.;
, As your loved one comes to terms with their diagnosis, you’re going to need to start thinking about logistical concerns. Figure out what your loved one does and doesn’t want out of their cancer treatment and care. Are they interested in surgery? Chemo? What will your insurance cover? How will you break the news to other family members, especially if you have children?

, Your relationship is going to change. You may have to take on roles they previously had, like running the household finances or cooking dinner. Find ways to prepare for these changes before intensive treatments start. Your loved one may not have as much energy during treatment to help you or provide accurate instructions. Your loved one will also go through physical changes. Expect that they may feel strange or betrayed by their body. Reaffirm your intimacy and that you love them for many more reasons than their appearance can go a long way in easing their concerns.

, Help your loved one research doctors and what your insurance covers. Similarly, look into counseling -- even if you think you won’t need it. There are a variety of in-person and online support groups for both cancer patients and their caregivers. There are also programs that can help in other areas of your life, like navigating finances or changes in your loved one’s appearance as they undergo treatment. Start a running list of these organizations and reach out to them when you need them. See the ‘Tips’ section for a very short list of places to start looking for counseling and other support services.

, As long as your loved one is okay with it, go with them to medical appointments. If they are hesitant to let you go, reaffirm that it helps to have an extra pair of ears (and a hand to hold). Also consider taking notes for later.

, Keeping family and friends updated on your loved one’s fight is essential. Although it might be best to tell them about the diagnosis in person, updating them individually can be tedious. Consider setting up an email blast or a webpage that your family and friends can check to stay in touch. There are also pre-made webpages you can personalize (see ‘Tips’ section for examples) to keep everyone updated, fundraise, and/or ask for help.

, With all of your new responsibilities, it might feel like you have too much on your plate. Talk to relatives and friends about what they can do to help you. Even little things, like cooking dinner or giving rides to appointments can be a huge weight off your shoulders. If finances allow, consider hiring a part-time caretaker or nurse, or even a young neighbor to help with house/yard work.

, You’re no use to anyone if you burnt out or sick. Simple things, like eating a balanced diet and taking 5 minutes to de-stress, can keep you running at full steam. You also need to reflect on how your loved one’s diagnosis affects you. Find a few strategies to help you cope; they’ll be especially helpful on bad days.

, It seems counter-intuitive -- this might be the hardest time in your life. Even so, finding small ways to enjoy your loved one will make it much easier. Try sharing one thing a day that you are grateful for, cooking together, or watching a movie you both love. Those little moments can make all the difference.

Consider potential environmental triggers.,
Assess potential lifestyle and health causes.,
Think about whether you've experienced any issues with your ears.,
Determine whether you have any pre-existing medical conditions associated with tinnitus.,
Consider your medications.,
Know that there can also be no cause.",How to Find the Causes of Tinnitus1," Environmental factors are influences you experience from the world around you. Prolonged exposure to loud noises is the most common cause of tinnitus.Repeated exposure to loud noises, such as amplified music, gunshots, aircrafts, and heavy construction, damage the tiny hairs in the cochlea that send electrical impulses to the auditory nerve if sound waves are detected. When these hairs are bent or broken, they send electrical impulses to the auditory nerve even though no sound waves are detected. The brain then interprets them as sound, which we know as tinnitus.


Individuals who have the greatest job-related risk of developing tinnitus include carpenters, street-repair workers, pilots, musicians, and landscapers. Individuals who work with loud equipment or who are repeatedly around loud music have increased risk of developing tinnitus.
A single exposure to a sudden and extremely loud noise can also cause tinnitus. For instance, tinnitus is one of the more common disabilities among individuals who have served in the armed forces and were exposed to bomb blasts.;
, There are several different health-related causes for tinnitus, including aging, poor lifestyle habits, and changing hormones.The natural aging process can affect the development of tinnitus. This aging process causes a deterioration in the cochlea, which can be aggravated by exposure to loud noises in the environment over time.
Smoking or drinking caffeinated or alcoholic beverages can trigger tinnitus. In addition, stress and fatigue, if not properly managed, can pile up and lead to the development of tinnitus.
Although no direct causation has been found, anecdotal evidence suggests that changes in hormone levels for women can and have triggered tinnitus. These changes occur in pregnancy, menopause, and while using hormone replacement therapy., Blockages in the ear canal can change the way that sound reaches the sound-sensitive cells in the cochlea and therefore trigger tinnitus.These blockages can be the result of ear wax, ear infections, sinus infections, and mastoiditis (an infection of the mastoid bone behind the ear). These health conditions change the ability of sound to travel through the middle and inner ear, which triggers tinnitus.


Meniere’s disease can trigger tinnitus or muffled hearing. This is a disorder that has no known cause but affects the inner ear and triggers severe dizziness, ringing in the ears, hearing loss and a feeling of fullness in the ear. It often affects just one ear and may trigger an attack separated by long periods of time or trigger attacks after only several days. It can develop at any age but is more likely to occur in individuals between 40 and 60 years old.Otosclerosis is a hereditary disorder that results in an overgrowth of the bones in the middle ear, leading to deafness. This condition makes it difficult for sound to travel to the inner ear. White, middle-aged women are at the greatest risk for developing otosclerosis.More rarely, tinnitus can be caused by a benign tumor on the auditory nerve, the nerve which allows sound to be transmitted to the brain and interpreted. This tumor is called an acoustic neuroma and develops on the cranial nerve that runs from your brain to your inner ear, often causing tinnitus on only one side. These tumors are rarely cancerous, but can grow to be quite large — it's best to seek treatment when they are still small., Diseases of the circulatory system, such as high blood pressure, malformation of the capillaries, diabetes, heart disease, anemia, atherosclerosis, and coronary artery disease also affect the circulation to other parts of the body, including the supply of oxygen to the cells in the middle and inner ear. Loss of oxygen and blood supply can damage these cells and increase the potential risk of developing tinnitus.Individuals affected by temporomandibular joint syndrome (TMJ) have a higher risk of developing tinnitus. There are some different theories as to why TMJ affects tinnitus. The chewing muscles are very near to those muscles in the middle ear and can affect hearing. There could be a direct connection between the ligaments that attach to the jaw and one of the bones in the middle ear. Alternately, the nerve supply from TMJ has some connection with the part of the brain that is involved in hearing.Trauma to the head or neck can also affect the inner ear or the nerves that affect hearing or brain function that is linked to hearing. These injuries generally cause tinnitus only in one ear.Brain tumors can affect the area of the brain that interprets sound. In these cases you may have tinnitus in one or both ears., Medications are another factor which can trigger tinnitus. Certain medications can cause medication-induced ototoxicity, or “ear poisoning.” If you are taking any medications, look on the package insert or ask your pharmacist to find out if tinnitus is listed as a side effect. Often there are other medications in the same family of drugs that your doctor can prescribe for you that can treat your condition without causing tinnitus to develop.There are over 200 different drugs which list tinnitus as a side effect, including aspirin, certain antibiotics, anti-inflammatory medications, sedatives, antidepressants, and quinine medications. Cancer medications and diuretics also make the list of medications related to tinnitus.
Antibiotics frequently associated with tinnitus include vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, gentamycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, and tobramycin.
Generally the higher the dose of medication used, the worse the symptoms become. Most of the time when the medication is discontinued, the tinnitus also resolves.

, Even with all these associated conditions and triggers, some people can develop tinnitus for no known reason. Most of the time it isn’t serious, but if it doesn’t resolve it can trigger fatigue, depression, anxiety, and problems with memory."

Your liver also produces acetaldehyde when metabolizing alcohol, but your body then further breaks down acetaldehyde over period of time.
Bacterial microbes that live in your body cannot further break down acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde in your mouth that is produced by microbes can lead to oral cancer, throat cancer, and similar cancers. A concentration of acetaldehyde equal to or greater than 100 micromolar has the ability to cause cancer.
Note that the amount of acetaldehyde that is produced from alcohol in your mouth is not necessarily related to the amount of acetaldehyde that is pre-existing in the beverages before you drink them. However, the amount (concentration) of alcohol in beverages and in your body is a major factor that leads to higher acetaldehyde levels in your mouth and the rest of your body.


Calvados (a French apple brandy) with 40% alcohol has been shown to produce the most acetaldehyde in the mouth after a sip is taken (a sip is 5 milliliters (0.17  fl oz) or one teaspoon). From the point that it is sipped and for at least five minutes after sipping, it produces high levels of acetaldehyde. At these levels, the acetaldehyde may cause cancer.
A 40% solution of pure alcohol, similar to regular-strength vodka and other types of hard liquor, also produces levels of acetaldehyde that were capable of causing cancer when a sip is taken, but the levels are generally lower than with Calvados. Wine with 12.5% alcohol was also capable of producing cancer-causing levels of acetaldehyde with each 5 ml sip, but the levels of acetaldehyde are noticeably lower (the level varies depending on the exact time after sipping, but can be about half that of 40% alcohol).
The level of acetadehyde produced by 5% alcohol beer is about half that of wine, and stays below the cancer-causing threshold (although this may vary for different brands/types of beer). Light beer produced even less acetaldehyde. Note that the size of the sip that is taken may change these results, so larger sips of beer may result in cancer-causing levels of acetaldehyde. A 5 ml sip of beer is not much. Exactly how a sip is taken can also alter acetaldehyde levels, and different scientific studies can show somewhat different levels of acetaldehyde under similar conditions.;
, The alcohol level of the beverage has no consistent relation to the acetaldehyde content of the beverage.


Vodka and gin will generally have the lowest concentration of acetaldehyde (0 to about 300 micromolar). The primary reason is that they are distilled multiple times to achieve a very pure product. Vodka and gin are generally made using column stills, which produce almost pure alcohol. If pot stills are used, they are generally used in conjunction with column stills. With gin, only the final distillation is usually conducted with a pot still.
Another reason that vodka and gin are relatively free of acetaldehyde is that they are usually made from grains (sometimes potatoes). Fruits, not grains, are major sources of acetaldehyde, although yeast that is used to make alcoholic beverages produces acetaldehyde. This being the case, spirits (hard liquor) made from fruits can have up to about 26000 micromolar acetaldehyde.
Fruit spirits may have no acetaldehyde, but it is important to note that the average fruit spirit has about 20000 micromolar acetaldehyde. Port wines, sherry, and other types of fortified wine should be avoided as they consistently contain high levels of acetaldehyde, partially due to how they are aged.
The acetaldehyde range for sherry is about 1000 to 12000 micromolar, while the range is about 500 to 18000 for Port wines. Non-fortified wines and Cognac can have from zero to about 5000 micromolar acetaldehyde. White wines may have relatively low levels. Whiskey and Bourbon can have relatively high levels of acetaldehyde, as they are generally made using pot stills.
Beer can have up to about 1500 micromolar, but the average is closer to 200. Lagers and light beers that don't have the fruity aromas that some ales have should have the lowest concentrations of acetaldehyde. Also, mass-produced beer that is packaged using the most sophisticated bottling equipment that prevents oxidation of the beer should have lower concentrations.
Calvados has between 500 and 1500 micromolar acetaldehyde.

Note that there is no way to know the acetaldehyde level of specific brands of alcohol so avoid the general types with high levels. Also be aware that beer and wine that contain high levels of acetaldehyde may not increase levels of acetaldehyde simply due to their acetaldehyde content (it is not a linear relationship).



, Use non-alcoholic beverages that are unlikely to contain acetaldehyde such as club soda, seltzer water, and tonic water to dilute the alcohol and acetaldehyde content. This will help to keep the acetaldehyde content in your mouth and throat at lower levels. Fruit juice may contain acetaldehyde.


As an example, say that one 12 oz glass of beer and one 1.5 oz shot of vodka have the same concentration (micromolar) of acetaldehyde. While the shot of vodka and beer contain about the same amount of alcohol, the shot of vodka will contain a much smaller total amount of acetaldehyde.
Therefore, if you dilute the vodka with club soda to achieve a total of 12 oz, the vodka drink will have much less total acetaldehyde than beer, and should result in about the same amount of acetaldehyde as beer in your mouth when you drink it.

, The fewer microbes that are in your mouth, the better. Brush, floss, and use alcohol-free mouthwash. However, you will not be able to totally eliminate the microbes that live in your mouth.


Be aware that mouthwashes that contain alcohol may increase the incidence of oral cancers by up to five times (although some studies do not show this to be the case).

, L-cysteine (not N-acetyl cycteine or NAC) immediately neutralizes acetaldehyde, and it has been used successfully to lower levels of acetaldehyde in the body, especially in the stomach, when alcohol is consumed.

, If the alcohol is removed from your mouth and throat right after you sip or drink and alcoholic beverage, the acetaldehyde and residual alcohol that could be converted into acetaldehyde will largely be removed from your mouth and throat.
The less time that acetaldehyde contacts your mouth and throat, the less time cancer-causing levels will be in contact with your cells. Of course some acetaldehyde will be washed downstream into your stomach and lower gastrointestinal tract, but the alcohol that you consume will travel to these parts of your body anyway, and additional acetaldehyde will still be formed. Taking L-cysteine should help to prevent damage downstream in your body.

, Remember that each and every time you take a sip of an alcoholic beverage, the levels of acetaldehyde spike in your mouth. Slam or chug alcoholic beverages so that they are in contact with your mouth and throat for the smallest amount of time possible. Take care to do this safely in a responsible manner.

, The risk for cancers caused by acetaldehyde in alcoholic beverages increases in a linear fashion. That basically means every drink increases your risk of cancer, an even one drink per day will increase your risk. Three drinks will essentially triple your risk.
Also, if you drink to the point of being intoxicated, there will be high levels of alcohol and resulting acetaldehyde in your body even after you finish drinking alcoholic beverages.


One drink is 12 oz (5% alcohol) regular-strength beer, 4 or 5 oz wine, 3 oz fortified or dessert wine, or about 1.5 oz of hard liquor. Note that these serving sizes are based on US government health standards, and government-set serving sizes based on health standards will actually vary for different countries.

, People without an effective pair of this gene are unable to break down acetaldehyde in to acetic acid (basically non-carcinogenic vinegar) within their body as well as other people. Therefore they are at a much greater risk for cancers caused by acetaldehyde. An effective pair of the ALDH2 gene is uncommon in Asian populations; either one or both are often defective.

, While homemade beer (homebrew) and wine probably doesn't contain more acetaldehyde than many commercial examples, very high levels of acetaldehyde have been measured in homemade beer and wine. The same goes for distilled spirits (moonshine!). Improper packaging and production methods (fermentation, etc) can lead to high levels of acetaldehyde.

Quit using tobacco products.,
Maintain a healthy weight.,
Avoid exposure to intense sunlight.,
Consume alcohol in moderation.,
Avoid exposure to known carcinogens.,
Avoid risky behaviors such as unprotected sex.",How to Lower Your Chances of Getting Cancer1," Smoking is the biggest risk factor for developing lung cancer. The use of tobacco products in general is a risk factor for cancers of the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, bladder, cervix, colon, and ovaries.Quitting smoking or quitting using tobacco products can be difficult, but with a good plan, support group, and perseverance, it can be accomplished. The National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research provides some helpful guidelines to help people quit using tobacco products.


Decide to quit and make a plan. Many people find it helpful to write down reasons why they want to quit.
Choose a date about one week in the future that you will quit using tobacco. Prepare yourself for quitting, and stick to the date you picked.
Begin to taper your tobacco use prior to your quit date.
Gather support. Tell your family and friends about your decision to quit using tobacco products. Warn them that you may not be quite yourself for the next few weeks, but let them know you are determined!
Keep busy by exercising and participating in activities not associated with using tobacco products.;
, Being obese is defined as having a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than 30, if you are over 20 years old.Obesity puts people at an increased risk of many types of cancer, including cancers of the pancreas, kidney, thyroid, gallbladder.Tips to maintain a healthy weight include: Get regular exercise.
Eat healthy foods.
Avoid foods that you tend to overeat.
Weigh yourself regularly to track your progress.
Consult a dietician or nutrition professional for additional advice and help with planning.

, Sunburns cause lasting damage to the skin. Children who have had at least one blistering sunburn are at twice the risk of developing melanoma (a type of skin cancer) compared to children who never suffered blistering sunburns.Exposure to intense sunlight can be limited by covering up with long sleeves, pants, and hats and by wearing sunscreen. The Skin Cancer Foundation provides guidelines for minimizing exposure.Seek out shady areas and minimize your time in the sun when it is most intense – typically between 10AM and 4PM.
Cover yourself with loose-fitting clothing, preferably made from fabric with Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF) rating.
Wear a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses that block ultraviolet (UV) light.
Apply broad-spectrum sunscreen that is at least Sun Protection Factor (SPF) 30 when you will be out for an extended period of time. It is best to apply the sunscreen about 30 minutes before heading outside, and then to reapply sunscreen every two hours.
Do not use tanning beds.

, Alcohol is broken down in the body to acetaldehyde, which is a probable carcinogen (cancer-causing agent) that can damage DNA.The use of alcohol together with smoking increases the risk for cancer more than the use of either substance by itself The American Cancer Society suggests that people who do drink alcohol should have no more than two standard drinks per day for men, and one standard drink per day for women.One standard drink is 12 fluid ounces of beer, 5 fluid ounces of wine, or 1.5 fluid ounces of 80-proof liquor.

, If you work in a laboratory environment, a factory, or even in an office, you likely come into contact with known or probable carcinogens from time to time. Three agencies maintain lists of carcinogens. They are The National Toxicology Program, the International Agency for Research on Cancer and the Environmental Protection Agency.A non-exhaustive list of human carcinogens can be found at The American Cancer Society.Adhere to all workplace rules regarding personal protective equipment such as masks, respirators, gloves, goggles, and gowns.
Read the labels of household cleaners, herbicides, and pesticides. Wear appropriate protective equipment and follow all safety guidelines.

, Some viruses can be transmitted by sexual contact between individuals. Infection with certain kinds of these viruses can put people at increased risk for cancer. For example, the viruses that cause hepatitis B and hepatitis C increase the risk for liver cancer.Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) attacks immune system cells and kills them. A weakened immune system increases the risk of many types of cancer, including a type of skin cancer called Kaposi’s sarcoma.

Understand what tinnitus is.,
Recognize the symptoms of tinnitus.,
Reflect on potential causes and recent events.,
Consult your physician.",How to Find the Causes of Tinnitus2," Tinnitus isn’t a condition but actually a symptom of other problems or condition that range from age-related hearing loss to hearing damage or circulatory system disorders. The treatment for the condition will be based on the underlying cause of tinnitus, which is why finding the cause matters. Tinnitus can be primary or secondary. Primary tinnitus occurs when no cause can be identified other than hearing, and secondary tinnitus occurs as a symptom of another condition. Determining which type of tinnitus you have will increase the potential of successful treatment.Tinnitus can be classified in two categories. First, objective tinnitus, also called pulsatile tinnitus, happens in just 5% of the cases and is audible to an observer who is listening with a stethoscope or is standing close to the individual. This type of tinnitus is associated with vascular or muscular disorders to the head or neck, such as brain tumors or brain structure abnormalities, and is often synchronized to the individual’s heartbeat. Second, subjective tinnitus is audible only to the individual and is more common, occurring in 95 percent of the cases. This is a symptom of many different ear disorders and is reported in over 80 percent of people who suffer from a sensorineural hearing loss.Tinnitus may affect individuals differently, even though they are experiencing identical loudness or pitches in sound. The severity of the condition can be a function of the individual’s reaction to the condition.

, Tinnitus is often described as a ringing in the ears but it can also sound like buzzing, hissing, roaring, or clicking. The pitch and tone can vary from individual to individual and the sound may also change. You might hear the noises in one ear or both, which is an important distinction your physician should know for diagnostic purposes.Aside from the ringing in the ears, a person may also exhibit other symptoms such as dizziness or lightheadedness, headaches, and/or neck pain, ear or jaw pain (or other TMJ symptoms).


Some people will experience a loss of hearing while others don’t experience any difficulty hearing. Again, this distinction is important during diagnosis.Some also become hypersensitive to certain frequencies and volume ranges of sound, a condition called hyperacusis. This is strongly associated with tinnitus and individuals can suffer from both at the same time.Secondary effects of tinnitus include difficulty sleeping, depression, anxiety, problems at work and home, and a deterioration of an individual’s emotional state., Think about what has happened in your life recently and search for situations or circumstances which may have caused tinnitus. To prepare yourself for a medical appointment for diagnosis and treatment of your tinnitus, record your symptoms and any other information that may be relevant to the development of your symptoms. For example, note if you:


Have been exposed to loud noises
Have a current or chronic sinus, ear, or mastoid infections
Are taking or have recently taken any of the medications listed above
Have been diagnosed with a circulatory problem
Have diabetes
Have TMJ
Have suffered a head or neck injury
Have a hereditary disorder, osteosclerosis
Are a woman and recently experienced a change in hormonal levels, such as pregnancy, menopause or start/stop of hormonal replacement therapy

, Your physician will perform a thorough history to determine any past environmental exposures or medical conditions which may have triggered tinnitus. Treatment for tinnitus will depend upon the underlying medical cause of the condition.


If you are taking medications which are associated with tinnitus, you may want to discuss changing the medication with your physician.
Auditory nerve retraining may be necessary if you experience hyperacusis.

Eat a healthy diet.,
Exercise regularly.,
Get vaccinated.,
Get adequate sleep.",How to Lower Your Chances of Getting Cancer2," Experts believe that eating a healthy diet could prevent up to 10% of all cancer cases in the United Kingdom.Eating more fruits and vegetables has been linked to reduced risk of cancers of the mouth, esophagus, stomach, lung, and larynx.Eating too much red meat (beef, pork, lamb) and processes meat (salami, bacon, hot dogs) has been linked to increased risk of cancer.People who eat more fiber have reduced risk of bowel cancers.Include chicken and fish in your diet. Replace some of the red or processed meat you eat with chicken or fish one to two times per week. Try replacing some of the meat in meals with beans or tofu.
Eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables each day.Spices that have been shown to have carcinogen-blocking effects include amla, garlic, and turmeric (via the curcumin).Consume turmeric (which contains curcumin) with black pepper to boost the bioavailability.To boost fiber content in your meals, adhere to the five servings of fruits and vegetables per day. Include whole grain foods in your meals daily.
Diets high in saturated fats may increase breast cancer risk. Avoid saturated fats by reading food labels and choosing alternatives with less saturated fat., Studies have shown that women who exercise 30 minutes per day five times per week (or 150 minutes total) have a 15 – 20% reduction in breast cancer risk.Other studies have consistently demonstrated a 30 – 40% reduction in colon cancer risk when individuals increase their physical activity.Physical activity has also been shown to reduce the risk of lung and endometrial cancer.


Exercise at a moderate to vigorous intensity for 30 – 60 minutes per day. Examples of moderate intensity exercises include walking briskly, water aerobics, and bicycling at less than 10 miles per hour.Examples of vigorous intensity exercises include jogging, hiking uphill, swimming laps, and jumping rope., Infection with certain types of viruses increases the risk for certain kinds of cancer. For example, the virus that causes hepatitis B (HBV) increases the risk for liver cancer.Infection with certain strains of the human papillomavirus (HPV) increases the risk for cervical, anal, vaginal, and vulvar cancers.Vaccines are available that are effective in preventing infection with these viruses. It is important to note that the HPV and HBV vaccines are not the same as a “cancer vaccine.” Cancer vaccines are designed to stimulate the body to attack cancer cells once cancer has developed. Researchers are currently working on cancer vaccines, and many are in clinical trials as of this writing.Ask your healthcare provider which vaccines are suitable for you and your children.

, There is some evidence that disrupted circadian rhythms increases cancer risk.One study found that women who worked irregular schedules had a 30% higher risk of developing breast cancer than those who worked a more regular schedule. Shift work is also a risk factor for prostate cancer.Inadequate sleep is also a risk factor for obesity, which is itself a risk factor for cancer.Experts suggest trying the following in order to sleep more soundly at night: Create a sleep schedule. Go to bed the same time every night and wake up at the same time every morning.
Have a sleep routine. Wind down the same way every night.
Create a comfortable sleeping atmosphere. For most people, this means cool temperatures, low noise, and a dark room.
Avoid certain foods and drinks in the hours before bedtime. Caffeine can keep you up for hours after you consume it. Alcohol may seem to put you to sleep initially, but it can disrupt sleep later in the night. Going to sleep overfull can create discomfort and a need to visit the restroom in the middle of the night.
Take power naps during the day, but keep them under 30 minutes. Too much sleep during the day can interfere with your ability to fall asleep and stay asleep.
Get daily exercise, but avoid exercise too close to bedtime.
Learn healthy ways to deal with stress. Worries about finances, relationships, and work can keep you up at night.

Get regular check-ups with your healthcare provider.,
Discuss your family history with your healthcare provider.,
Get the recommended cancer screening tests.,
Monitor yourself and recognize early warning signs.",How to Lower Your Chances of Getting Cancer3," This includes regular dental exams, during which oral cancers may be found. Regular check-ups allow you to ask questions about your cancer risk, get information about cancer screening tests, and to get any symptoms checked out. Catching cancer early or catching precancerous conditions offer the best possibility of successful treatment. A regular physical should also include exams for cancers of the mouth, reproductive system, skin, thyroid, and other organs., Sometimes, certain kinds of cancers run in families.This can be because of common lifestyle choices (smoking), environmental exposures, or because of an abnormal gene that is passed down from generation to generation. If people in your family have had cancer, there is a possibility that you are at increased risk for cancer. Your healthcare provider can advise you about your specific risk and recommend additional tests.

, The American Cancer Society has published guidelines for cancer screening testswhich include:


Yearly mammograms for women, beginning at age 40
Tests that either detect colon polyps and/or colon cancer, beginning at age 50 for men and women
Cervical cancer screening for women, beginning at age 21
Discuss prostate cancer screening with your physician, beginning at age 50 (men only)
Listed here are general guidelines. Read the entire American Cancer Society guidelines for the most complete information., Men and women can monitor themselves for skin cancer by doing skin checks and paying close attention to odd-looking moles or growths.Other cancers can sometimes present with skin abnormalities as well.Women should perform monthly self-breast exams. Men can perform self-testicular exams. Sudden, unexplained weight gain or weight loss can be a sign of cancer. Consider weighing yourself on a regular basis so you are aware of weight changes.

Apply ice.,
Use a head wrap to compress your injured ear.,
Take anti-inflammatories.",How to Drain Cauliflower Ear1," Immediately after an injury to your ear that causes swelling, stop your activity and apply ice (or something cold) in order to reduce the inflammation and numb the pain.The ice will reduce the flow of blood into the space between the skin and cartilage of your upper ear. Apply the cold therapy for about 10 minutes at a time, every hour or so, for about three to four hours from the time of the injury.


Wrap the ice cubes, crushed ice or frozen gel pack in a thin cloth before applying it to your ear in order to prevent frostbite or skin irritation.
As an alternative, use a small bag of frozen vegetables or fruit to combat the swelling of your ear.;
, In addition to applying ice to your swollen ear, wrap a Tensor or Ace bandage around your head so you feel pressure against your ear.The combination of cold therapy and compression is the most effective way to combat swelling of virtually all musculoskeletal injuries. Pressure can stop the internal bleeding faster, thereby reducing the severity of the cauliflower deformity.


You can also use a long strip of gauze or an elastic exercise band to compress the ice against your ear.
Consider wedge packing some gauze in front of and behind your ear before wrapping it with a stretchy bandage to increase the pressure on it.
Do not wrap the gauze so tightly that it causes a headache or dizziness or cuts off circulation, as blood flow is necessary to carry away excess fluid. You should also avoid wrapping it in a way that causes the gauze to block your vision or reduce hearing in your uninjured ear.
Remove the bandage once every hour to let your ear rest.

, Another method of reducing swelling and the pain of a cauliflower ear is to take over-the-counter anti-inflammatories, such as ibuprofen (Advil), aspirin or naproxen (Aleve).Take them as soon as possible after your injury for best results. Combine them with cold therapy and compression also.


Painkillers, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) are obviously helpful for pain, but they don't reduce swelling at all.
Aspirin and ibuprofen can increase and worsen internal bleeding, so ask your doctor if anti-inflammatories are appropriate for your case.
Don't take anti-inflammatories for longer than two weeks in order to reduce side effects, such as stomach and kidney irritation. For cauliflower ear, a couple of days of medication is probably sufficient.

Check for symptoms that resemble the flu.,
Register your fatigue level.,
Monitor your weight.,
Pay attention to bruising and bleeding.,
Examine your skin for tiny red spots (petechiae).,
Determine whether you have infections more frequently.,
Feel for bone pain and tenderness.,
Understand risk factors.",How to Recognize the Signs of Leukemia1," These symptoms include having a fever, being tired, or having chills. If the symptoms fade after a few days and you feel healthy again, you probably just had the flu. That being said, if flu-like symptoms do not subside, see your physician. Leukemia patients often mistake leukemia symptoms to be those of the flu or other infections. In particular, look for:


Continual weakness or tiredness
Frequent or severe nosebleeds
Repetitive infections
Unexplained weight loss
Inflamed lymph nodes
Swollen spleen or liver
Bleeding or bruising easily
Small red marks on your skin
Profuse sweating
Bone crampsBleeding gums;
, Chronic fatigue is often an early symptom of leukemia. Because fatigue is quite common, many patients overlook this symptom. Weakness and very low energy can accompany fatigue.Chronic fatigue is different from just feeling tired. If you feel unconcentrated or like your memory is weaker than normal, you might have chronic fatigue. Other symptoms include swollen lymph nodes, new and unexpected muscle pain, sore throat, or severe exhaustion lasting longer than one day.You may also notice that you feel weak, such as in your limbs. It might be harder to do things that you normally do.
Along with fatigue and weakness, you may also notice a change in your pallor. These changes may all be due to anemia, which is when you have low hemoglobin in your blood. Your hemoglobin transports oxygen to all of your tissues and cells., Losing a large amount of weight for no apparent reason is often a symptom of leukemia and other types of cancer. This symptom is called cachexia.This can be a subtle symptom, and taken alone it doesn't necessarily point to cancer. Still, if you're losing weight without changing your regular diet and exercise habits, it's important to visit your doctor.It's normal for weight to fluctuate up and down over time. Look for a slow but steady drop in weight through no effort of your own.
Weight loss that’s related to sickness often is accompanied by a feeling of low energy and weakness rather than increased health.

, People with leukemia tend to bruise and bleed more easily. Part of the reason is because they have lower counts of red blood cells and platelets, which can lead to anemia.If you seem to bruise after every minor bump, or start bleeding profusely from a small cut, take note. This is a particularly important symptom.Also beware of bleeding gums., These spots will look out of the ordinary and unlike normal splotches you'd get after exercising or blemishes from acne.


If you see round, tiny, red spots on the skin that weren't there before, see a doctor immediately. They will appear as a rash rather than as blood.They often form in clusters on your skin., Because leukemia damages your healthy white blood cell count, frequent infections can occur. If you have a lot of skin, throat, or ear infections, your immunity might be weakened., Bone pain is not a common symptom, but it is possible. If your bones feel achy and painful, and you have no other reason for the soreness, consider getting tested for leukemia.


Bone pain associated to leukemia can happen because your bone marrow becomes overcrowded with white blood cells. Your leukemia cells also can pool close to your bones or within the joints., Some people are more predisposed to get leukemia. Although having some risk factors does not mean one certainly will get leukemia, recognizing risk factors is important. You might be more at risk if you have (had):

Prior cancer therapies like chemo or radiation.
Genetic disorders
Been a smoker
Family members with leukemia
Been exposed to chemicals like benzene"

Watch for excessive scratching.,
Notice any rubbing of the ear on the ground.,
Pay attention to whining.,
Check for head tilting.,
Notice any changes in behavior.,
Check for unpleasant smells.,
Look for discharge.,
Watch for skin redness or thickness.,
Look for trouble chewing.",How to Diagnose Ear Infections in Beagles1," Your Beagle may scratch his ear often if he has an infection. Watch for persistent scratching with a hindpaw or rubbing with a front paw against.Your dog may also shake his head a lot.;
, Because the ear will be bothering your Beagle, watch for him to rub, drag, or scoot his ear along the ground. Rubbing the ear along the ground is another sign of irritation that may be due to an infection., All dogs whine at some point. But whining sometimes indicates your dog is in pain. Since ear infections make the ears sore, the dog may whimper or whine.Some dogs will scratch their ear while whining, indicating their ear hurts.

, Watch for your Beagle to hold his head to the side. Persistently holding the head to one side is a sign the ear on that side is sore.This can also be a sign of a deep infection, and because of this, it's important to get the ear checked immediately.

, Ear infections can be painful, and because of this, your dog’s behavior may change. An infection may prevent your dog from eating, or make him reluctant to go for a walk because his ear hurts. If you see changes in your dog’s behavior, see if you can determine the underlying problem.


Your dog may also act more irritable than usual, or become depressed., Bacterial infections often give off an unpleasant odor. Sniff your dog’s ears to determine if they smell bad or different than normal., Look for any discharge from the ear canal. The discharge might be a thick, brown or black wax or a yellow-green infection., The skin of the ear may be reddened as a result of scratching or infection. If your dog’s ear has been irritated for a while, the skin may become thickened, greasy, or crusty.Compare one side with the other to get an idea if the skin is normal or thickened.

, Sometimes, if the pain is bad enough, your dog may have trouble chewing. This is because it may be painful to open the mouth. Your dog might also be reluctant to chew."

Examine your mouth regularly.,
Look for small white sores.,
Watch for red sores or patches.,
Feel for lumps and rough spots.,
Don't ignore pain or soreness.,
Don't ignore chewing difficulty.,
Take note of swallowing problems.,
Listen for changes in your voice.,
Make an appointment with your doctor or dentist.,
Ask your doctor about special dyes for your mouth.,
Ask your doctor about using laser light instead.",How to Recognize Signs of Oral Cancer," Most cancers of the mouth and throat cause some identifiable signs or symptoms during their early stages, but not all do. In some cases, cancers don't cause symptoms until they’ve reached an advanced stage. Regardless, doctors and dentists recommend that in addition to regular checkups, you should carefully look at your mouth in a mirror at least once a month to check for any abnormal signs.Oral cancers can grow virtually anywhere in your mouth and throat, including the lips, gums, tongue, hard palate, soft palate, tonsils and insides of the cheeks.Teeth are the only parts that can't develop cancer.
Consider buying, or borrowing from your dentist, a small dental mirror in order to help you examine your mouth more thoroughly.
Brush your teeth and floss before examining your mouth. If your gums normally bleed after brushing or flossing, rinse with some warm salt water and wait a few minutes before examining.;
, Check all around your mouth for small white sores or lesions, which are called leukoplakia by doctors. Leukoplakia are common precursors to oral cancers, but they are often misdiagnosed as canker sores or other small ulcers caused by abrasions or minor trauma.Leukoplakia can also be mistaken for bacterial infections of the gums and tonsils, as well as Candida yeast overgrowth in the mouth (called thrush).


Although canker sores and other ulcers are usually very painful, leukoplakia aren't typically, unless they're in advanced stages.
Cankers are most common on the inner lips, cheeks and sides of the tongue, whereas leukoplakia can be anywhere in the mouth.
With good hygiene, canker sores and other small abrasions and cuts usually heal within a week or so. In contrast, leukoplakia don't go away and often become larger and more painful with time.
Any white sore or lesion that does not go away after two weeks should be evaluated by a medical professional.

, While checking the inside of your mouth and back of your throat, watch out for small red sores or patches. Red sores (lesions) are called erythroplakia by doctors, and although less common than leukoplakia in the mouth, they have a much greater potential for becoming cancerous.Erythroplakia can initially be tender, but typically not as painful as sores that look similar, such as canker sores, herpes lesions (cold sores) or inflamed gums.


Canker sores are initially red before ulcerating and turning white. In contrast, erythroplakia stay red and don't go away after a week or so.
Herpes lesions can occur in the mouth, but are much more common on the borders of the outer lip. Erythroplakia are always inside the mouth.
Blisters and irritation from eating acidic foods can also mimic erythroplakia, but they're quick to disappear.
Any red sore or lesion that does not go away after two weeks should be evaluated by a medical professional.

, Other potential signs of oral cancer include the growth of lumps and the development of rough patches in the mouth.In general, cancer is defined as uncontrolled division of cells, so eventually a lump, swelling or other growth will appear. Use your tongue to feel around your mouth for any unusual lumps, bumps, protrusions or roughened patches. In the early stages, these lumps and rough spots aren't typically painful and can be mistaken for many things in the mouth.


Gingivitis (swollen gums) can often cover-up potentially dangerous lumps, but gingivitis will usually bleed with brushing and flossing — early cancerous lumps don't.
A lump or thickening of the tissues in the mouth can often affect the fit and comfort of dentures, which can be the first sign of oral cancer.
Always be concerned of a lump that keeps growing or a rough patch that spreads within the mouth.
Rough patches in the mouth can also be caused by chewing tobacco, abrasions from dentures, dry mouth (lack of saliva) and Candida infections.
Any lump or rough patch that does not go away after two to three weeks should be evaluated by a medical professional.

, Pain and soreness in the mouth is typically caused by fairly benign problems, such as cavities (dental caries), impacted wisdom teeth, inflamed gums, throat infections, canker sores and poor dental work. As such, trying to distinguish these causes of pain from potential cancer is very difficult, but if your dental work is up-to-date, then you should be suspicious.Sudden, severe pain is usually a tooth/nerve issue, and not an early sign of oral cancer.
Chronic soreness or achy pain that gets worse with time is more concerning, but is still often a dental issue that can be easily remedied by a dentist.
Gnawing pain that spreads around your mouth and causes the lymph nodes around your jaw and neck to get inflamed is of significant concern and should always be looked at immediately.
Any prolonged numbness or sensitivity of your lips, mouth or throat also warrants more attention and investigation.

, Due to the development of leukoplakia, erythroplakia, lumps, rough patches and/or pain, patients with oral cancer often complain of difficulty chewing, as well as moving their jaw or tongue in general.The displacement or loosening of teeth due to a cancerous growth can also make it difficult to chew properly, so take note if these changes occur.


If you're elderly, don't always assume poor fitting dentures are to blame for not being able to chew normally. If they once fit well, then something in your mouth has changed.
Mouth cancer, particularly of the tongue or cheeks, can cause you to bite down on your own tissues more often while chewing.
If you're an adult and notice your teeth getting loose or becoming crooked, then make an appointment with your dentist as soon as you can.

, Due also to the growth of sore spots and lumps, as well as difficulty moving their tongue, many oral cancer patients also complain of not being able to swallow properly.It may start out just with swallowing food, but advanced throat cancer can make if difficult to swallow beverages or even your own saliva.


Throat cancer can cause swelling and narrowing of the esophagus (the tube that leads to your stomach), as well as a chronically inflamed throat that hurts with each swallow. Cancer of the esophagus is known for a rapidly progressive dysphagia, or problems swallowing.
Throat cancer can also cause numbness in your throat and/or the feeling that something is caught there, like a ""frog"" in the throat.
Cancer of the tonsils and back half of the tongue can also cause great difficulty swallowing.

, Another common sign of oral cancer, especially during the late stages, is difficulty talking. Not being able to move the tongue and/or jaw properly can affect your ability to pronounce words. Your voice may also become more hoarse and change its timber as throat cancer or other types affect the vocal cords.As such, recognize any changes in your voice, or listen to people who claim you're talking differently.


Sudden, unexplained changes to your voice may indicate the presence of a lesion on or near your vocal chords.
Due to a feeling of something caught in their throat, people with oral cancer sometimes develop an audible tic of constantly trying to clear their throats.
An airway obstruction due to cancer can also change how your speak and the quality of your voice.

, If any signs or symptoms last for more than two weeks or quickly get worse, then contact your doctor or dentist as soon as you can. Unless your family physician is also an ear, nose, mouth specialist (otolaryngologist), then your dentist may be the better bet to start with because they can rule out any non-cancerous mouth problems more readily and then treat them to relieve your discomfort.


In addition to a mouth exam (including your lips, cheeks, tongue, gums, tonsils and throat) your neck, ears and nose should also be looked at to determine the cause of your problem.
Your doctor or dentist will also ask you about risky behaviors (tobacco smoking and alcohol use) and your family history, as some cancers have a genetic link.Be aware that people over 40 years of age, especially if they are male and of African American descent, are considered at higher risk for oral cancers.

, Along with an exam of your mouth and throat, some dentists or doctors may use special oral dyes to better visualize abnormal areas in your mouth, especially if you are considered at higher risk for oral cancer.For example, one method uses a dye called toluidine blue.


Putting toluidine blue dye over a cancerous area in your mouth will make the diseased tissue stain a darker blue than surrounding healthy tissue.
Sometimes infected or injured tissue also stains dark blue, so it's not a definitive test for cancer, just a visual guide.
To be sure of cancer, a tissue sample (biopsy) needs to be taken and looked at under a microscope by a cancer specialist. This way you can get an accurate diagnosis.

, Another method of trying to distinguish healthy tissue from cancerous tissue in the mouth is by using special lasers. In general, when laser light is reflected off abnormal tissue, it looks different (more dull) from light reflected off normal tissue.Another method uses a special fluorescent light to view the mouth after it's been rinsed with an acetic acid solution (vinegar, basically). Again the cancerous tissue stands out.


If an abnormal area of the mouth is suspected, a tissue biopsy is usually performed.
Alternatively, sometimes the abnormal tissue can be evaluated by exfoliative cytology, where the suspected lesion is scraped with a stiff brush and the cells looked at microscopically.

Understand the risk.,
Sanitize your hands and/or wear gloves.,
Disinfect and prepare your injured ear.,
Pierce the hematoma with a needle and syringe.,
Draw out the blood and other fluid.,
Disinfect the area once again.,
Apply pressure to stop the bleeding.",How to Drain Cauliflower Ear2," Even though it's possible to drain a mild cauliflower ear without going to the doctor, particularly if you have some sort of medical training, doing so significantly increases your risk of infection and later complications. You should only attempt to drain a cauliflower ear if there's no possibility of seeing a doctor or medical professional within two to three days.


Furthermore, draining your own ear should only be attempted if the trauma is mild with only moderate swelling and no torn skin.
If you have a cell phone, call emergency services to get some helpful advice and support.

, Before dealing with your cauliflower ear, make sure to sanitize your hands by washing them with warm water and regular soap for about 30 seconds, then dry them with paper towels. If you have latex surgical gloves, then put them on after you wash your hands, but it's not critical to wear them. Having clean or protected hands greatly reduces the risk of spreading bacteria to the ear injury and causing an infection.Alternatively, if you don't have soap and water, lather your hands in some alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
Alcohol or baby wipes can also be helpful to clean your hands if you find yourself in an emergency situation.

, Before attempting to drain your cauliflower ear, make sure to disinfect it thoroughly. Soak a sterile cotton ball with with rubbing alcohol or tea tree oil and apply it to the top half of your ear where the swelling is worse.The top half of your ear is where you'll be puncturing the skin, so make sure it's entirely disinfected.


Tea tree oil is a natural anti-bacterial cleansing agent, but make sure not to get any in your eyes because it can sting.
Use a generous amount of rubbing alcohol or tea tree oil to coat all the crevices, both inside and outside the upper half of your ear.
Alcohol swabs are also great for disinfecting, as is alcohol-based sanitizing lotion, which can be applied with a clean Q-tip.
Apply ice for about 10 – 15 minutes just prior to puncturing your ear in order to numb the pain — ice is a natural anesthetic.

, If you don't have one at home or wherever you are, buy a new 20-gauge 1-inch needle with at least a 3 milliliters (0.10  fl oz) syringe attached to it in order to pierce the hematoma — the large pocket filled with blood.The 20-gauge needle isn't the smallest type, but it's the best choice to suction up the thick, coagulated blood inside a cauliflower ear.


The 3 mL syringe capacity will ensure that all the fluid can be suctioned up, and the 1-inch needle length will help prevent you from puncturing the ear too far and damaging the cartilage.
Only pierce the swollen portion of the mid-to-upper ear deep enough to get the tip of the needle in. Do not shove the needle in too deeply since you could cause more damage.

, Once the tip of the needle has pierced the skin of your cauliflower ear, slowly and steadily pull the plunger of the syringe to draw out the blood, pus and inflammatory liquid.Continue drawing out fluid until you can no longer pull the plunger back or until the wounded area appears completely drained and deflated.


You may need to gently squeeze the affected part of your ear as you drain it to help move all the blood and fluid to the tip of the needle and, ultimately, out of the ear. While you do this, try to hold the needle as still as possible to keep it from causing micro-cuts inside your ear.
The fluid may look a little milky red if pus is present, or bright red if the injury is fresh (within hours).
When removing the needle, do it slowly and with a steady hand so the puncture wound remains small. Again, moving the needle around too much can tear the skin, so be careful.

, After gently squeezing all the remaining fluid out from your ear, disinfect the small puncture wound with more rubbing alcohol, tea tree oil or alcohol-based sanitizer applied to a clean cotton ball/swab or soft tissue. With an open wound, your ear is most susceptible to infection at this stage, so take your time and do a thorough job of disinfecting.Note that the skin will still seem wrinkled afterward, but this usually heals and flattens out over time as long as all the ear has been thoroughly drained.
Let the small puncture ""weep"" for a few minutes if need be, which means it might continue to leak a small amount of blood.

, Depending on your injury and how well you drained the cauliflower ear, there may be no more blood after a few minutes of light weeping; however, if blood continues to trickle or drip from your ear, then you need to apply pressure for a few minutes with some clean gauze or tissue to stop the bleeding and promote clotting.


After a few minutes of pressure to stop the bleeding, consider applying a small bandage to cover it up and deter infection.
Make sure to change your bandage daily or every time it gets wet.

"
"
Undergo drainage and compression.,
Ask about drainage and splinting.,
Get an incision to drain your ear instead.",How to Drain Cauliflower Ear3," Although drainage with a needle is still widely used by doctors, it's no longer recommended by many sources because the hematoma often returns to some extent.Regardless, your doctor may prefer needle aspiration and go about it in a similar fashion to the above recommended procedures. Afterward, your doctor will apply a special compression wrap to the site to prevent additional blood from pooling in the wounded ear.


Aside from expertise, the main difference between you draining your ear and your doctor doing it is that your doctor will use a local or topical anesthetic to make the procedure nearly painless.
Applying pressure with a tight bandage also helps any torn skin reconnect to the ear cartilage beneath it.
The doctor will likely apply gauze to both the front and back of your ear before wrapping it with sterile bandages.

, This procedure is quite similar to the needle and syringe drainage and compression technique, but instead of using a compression wrap to apply pressure on your ear, a physician will place a special splint inside to keep more constant pressure on the wound in order to completely drain it.


Splinting may take the form of sutures, which are placed through the ear in a manner that holds a special gauze in place.Alternatively, the splint can be made from pediplast or silicone and molded to your ear.
If a splint is used, your ear will need to be checked by your doctor again in one week. Sutures stay in place for two weeks unless redness or tenderness develops. A molded splint may be kept in place even longer.

, The most commonly recommended method for doctors to drain a cauliflower ear is by a small incision from a scalpel.Making an incision completely drains the blood and greatly reduces the chance of a hematoma forming again, which can be an issue with the needle drainage technique. Making an incision is also easier to get thickly coagulated or clotted blood out of your ear.


This type of procedure is typically performed by a plastic surgeon or by a licensed otolaryngologist (ear, nose and throat specialist).
With an incision technique, the doctor will have to close the wound with a few stitches, which will either dissolve or be taken out a week or so later.
Stitches will keep the detached skin over the cartilage, giving it an opportunity to reattach itself to the cartilage properly.

Have a physical exam.,
Undergo blood work.,
Receive a bone marrow biopsy.,
Obtain a diagnosis.",How to Recognize the Signs of Leukemia2," When you visit your doctor, he will check to see whether your skin is abnormally pale. This could result from anemia that is associated to leukemia. Your doctor will also check to see whether your lymph nodes are swollen. Your physician also will test to see whether your liver and spleen are larger than normal.Swollen lymph nodes are also a trademark sign of lymphoma.An enlarged spleen is also a symptom of many other sicknesses like mononucleosis., Your doctor will draw blood. Then, she will examine the blood herself or send it to a laboratory to assess your white blood cells or platelet counts.If your numbers are significantly high, she could order additional tests (MRIs, lumbar punctures, CT scans) to check for leukemia., For this test, a doctor inserts a long, slender needle into your hip bone to extract marrow. Your doctor will send the sample to a lab to assess whether leukemia cells are present. Depending on the results, he might order additional testing., Once your doctor has examined all possible aspects of your condition, he can give you a diagnosis. This might take a bit of time, as laboratory processing times vary. Still, you should hear within a few weeks. You might not have leukemia. If you do, your doctor will be able to tell you what type you have and discuss potential treatment options.


Your doctor will share whether leukemia is growing fast (acute) or growing slowly (chronic).Next, he will determine what kind of white blood cell has the disease. Lymphocytic leukemia impacts lymphoid cells. Myelogenous leukemia affects myeloid cells.
While adults can get all types of leukemia, most small children suffer from Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL).
Both children and adults can suffer from Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) but this is the most common fast growing leukemia for adults.
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) impact adults and may take years to show symptoms."

Take your Beagle to the vet.,
Get an exam.,
Perform any additional tests.,
Treat the ear infection.",How to Diagnose Ear Infections in Beagles2," If you notice any of the symptoms of an ear infection, then your Beagle should be checked by a vet.Take your dog to the vet as soon as you notice any problems. The earlier you catch the infection, the better for your dog., When you take your dog to the vet, she will perform a physical examination. She will take a look at your dog’s ears to see if there is pain around the ear, a discharge, or physical changes in the ear. She will also look to see if the dog has a head tilt.The vet will use an otoscope to look down the external ear canal. The otoscope is part magnifier and part light-source, and has a narrow cone which fits down the ear canal and allows the vet to look deep into the ear.
The vet will carefully inspect the ear canal for inflammations, redness, ulcer, discharge, or a foreign body in the ear, such as a grass awn. If a discharge is present and the ear is sore, this is enough to diagnose an ear infection.

, If the dog has ear infections often, or the infection is slow to respond to treatment, the vet may perform further tests. These tests include examining a discharge smear. This allows the vet to identify if simple common bacteria are present or more complex bacteria, check for ear mites, and identify yeasts. This can help target treatment.


The vet may also send a swab away for culture. The lab grows the bugs that are present and then attempts to kill them with different antibiotics in order to tell which is the most effective antibiotic to use to get rid of the infection., If an ear infection is present, the vet will probably clean your dog's ears. Then, she may start with topical ear drops at the office containing medications against yeast, bacteria, or ear mites. You will probably be given ear drops, or an antibiotic or antifungal, for your dog to administer at home."
"
Refrain from giving ear medication not prescribed by the vet.,
Check your dog’s ears daily.,
Know why the Beagle is prone to ear infections.",How to Diagnose Ear Infections in Beagles3," If your dog displays the symptoms of an ear infection, you shouldn’t just give him any ear medication. The ear infection might be due to a bacteria or yeast that the medicine doesn’t help. It’s better to take your dog to the vet to make sure he gets the proper treatment., To help prevent ear infections, clean your dog’s ears regularly. When you give your Beagle a bath, make sure to dry the ears well.Once a week you should check your Beagle’s ears.Lift your dog’s ear flaps every day and inspect them quickly. Look for skin redness, excessive wax, or a discharge from the ear.You should also give each ear a quick sniff to see if there is any unpleasant smell, which could indicate an infection.
Compare one ear with the other. Often ear on one side is worse than the other and can indicate an infection.

, The ear canal is lined with skin, and it tends to be warm and moist, which makes it a great environment in which bacterial or yeast infection can grow. Because a Beagle’s ears are so long, this traps bacteria inside.The Beagle is also an energetic dog that loves to exercise in fields and woods, increasing the risk of grass awns getting into the ear. The Beagle also loves to swim, and if water gets into the ear canal, it makes the environment even more damp, and therefore favourable to infection.
If your Beagle comes into contact with another dog that has ear mites, he might catch the ear mites and develop an ear mite infection."

Inspect your reusable earplugs, first.,
Throw away your damaged or dirty earplugs.,

Scrub your earplugs, gently, in new soapy water.,
Rinse your earplugs with cold water.,
Wipe your earplugs with alcohol.,
Air dry your earplugs in a clean place.,
Store your dry ear plugs in their case.,
Wash your earplugs after every use.,
Do not share your earplugs with anyone.,
Think about using only disposable earplugs.,
Do not use your earplugs all the time.,
Do not clean and re-use disposable earplugs.",How to Disinfect Ear Plugs," You are checking to see if your earplugs are torn, bent, or excessively dirty.Your earplugs can harden and become rigid if they are covered in a lot of earwax and skin oils from your ear canal. This loss of flexibility will prevent you from getting a good seal when you use your earplugs.Your ear canal connects your outer ear with your eardrum. It makes earwax, which is a mixture of shed skin cells, a little bit of dust, and a fat-like secretions from the glands in the canal. The secretions from the glands lubricate the ear canal and fight off infections from bacteria and fungi. When you insert earplugs covered with stains and other materials, you run the risk of overwhelming your ear canal’s natural defenses with too much dirt and germs.;
, Do not continue with trying to disinfect them. Buy yourself a new pair of reusable earplugs.Reusable earplugs can be made from a variety of materials. The more common reusable earplugs are made from pre-molded silicone rubber, vinyl, other hypoallergenic synthetic rubbers, and foam covered in a special material or “skin”. These types of earplugs can be used more than once because they are very durable and long-lasting when washed properly. But, they are not indestructible and must be replaced., You want to keep your earplugs clean, but sometimes your schedule will not allow for the time it takes to wash them by hand. Clean your earplugs in the washing machine, the dishwasher, or boiling water. You still have to air dry them and store them in their case.Keep track of your small earplugs. Put your earplugs in a fine mesh bags used for produce, close the bag with a rubber band, and wash them in the dishwasher.You can put your earplugs in a delicates washing bag when you clean them in the washing machine.
Be careful not to damage your earplugs.

, Fill a bowl with a cleaning solution. The solution can be soapy water or hydrogen peroxide. Add a mild soap, like dish detergent, to warm water and mix until you see suds. Or, use undiluted hydrogen peroxide., Let them sit undisturbed in the soapy water or hydrogen peroxide for several minutes. You will know exactly how long your earplugs need to soak after a couple of cleanings., Discard the old cleaning solution. It contains the dirt and grime you are trying to get off your earplugs. Remove any visible materials with your fingers, a soft cloth, or a soft brush, like a toothbrush.Buy a new toothbrush just for this purpose. A used toothbrush, even if it has been cleaned, will still have bacteria from your mouth on it.

, Move on to this step only after you have removed all of the dirt and stains with a thorough scrub. Do not leave behind any matter which may harden your earplugs; this may force you to discard them sooner than you want., Your earplugs have been disinfected. They should be soft and clean without any deformities or tears., Let your ear plugs dry completely before you use them. You can squeeze the ear plugs or pat them gently with a towel to get out some of the excess moisture.Using moist earplugs can lead to irritation, pain, or infection. The skin in your ear canal does not respond well to extra moisture., It is a good habit to immediately return your earplugs to their case whenever you are not using them. This keeps your clean earplug protected from damage as well as any dust and dirt.Your reusable earplugs will last from a couple of weeks to several months. It depends on how often you use your earplugs, how often you clean them, what type of earplugs you buy as well as where and how you store them., This can be time consuming, but it is worth the effort. You decrease your chances of developing ear irritation or an infection from earplugs covered in earwax, skin oils, and dust., You are sharing whatever germs, earwax, and skin oils the other person has in her ear canal. This is another way you could develop ear irritation or an infection., You can throw away your earplugs after every use. This is a reliable way to make sure your earplugs are always in good working condition. But, you may end up spending more money this way, and it creates more waste., When you keep them in for long periods of time, your earplugs stop the normal process of earwax being moved through your ear canal towards your outer ear. Take out your earplugs sometimes and let your ear canals “breathe.”Your earplugs can push earwax deeper into your canal where it builds up and hardens. You may develop ear pain, ringing in your ears, irritation, infection, discharge and even hearing loss., A washing may cause your earplugs to degrade. They can no longer protect your hearing from loud noises or keep water out of your ears when you swim. Having earplugs that properly guard your ears is an important part of good ear hygiene.Materials, like uncovered foam and soft wax, used in single-use or disposable ear plugs are not designed to be cleaned with soapy water or alcohol. If your disposable ear plugs are no longer soft and pliable, they cannot form a good fit in your ears."

Exercise.",How to Cure Tinnitus," Tinnitus is a not a disease itself, but rather a symptom of other problems in the ear, brain, heart, or blood vessels. So if you can eliminate the underlying cause of the problem, the tinnitus may go away by itself. Therefore the first thing to do if you're suffering from tinnitus is to call a doctor.


Your doctor might run specialized tests, such as an X-ray, audiogram, residual inhibition, and evoked response audiometry.
Make sure to keep a detailed list of foods or situations that trigger or worsen your tinnitus, and tell your doctor about all medicines, vitamins, supplements, etc. you are taking.
Some common underlying conditions that can cause tinnitus include earwax blockages, fluid pressure in the inner ear, infection/inflammation, abnormal bone growth in the ear, blood vessel disorders, jaw misalignment, aneurysm (blood vessel ballooning), certain types of tumors, and nerve or inner ear disorders such as Meniere's disease.;
, Certain drugs have been found somewhat effective at reducing the symptoms of tinnitus, although the results vary from patient to patient, depending on the origins of the condition. Tinniticil is a good example. Talk to your doctor to see if any medications are the right match for you.


Some people find relief from severe tinnitus by taking tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline and nortriptyline. However these medications can cause some undesirable side effects, such as blurred visions, dry mouth and heart problems.Anticonvulsant medications such as clonazepam and gabapentin have been shown to reduce the loudness and annoyance of tinnitus in some people.
In Brazil a drug for treating alcoholism, called acamprosate, has been tested for treating tinnitus symptoms with significant success. The drug is currently undergoing studies in the U.S.Other medications which have been found to quiet symptoms of tinnitus in some people include anti-anxiety medications, antihistamines and even anesthetics.

, Some common medications have been found to worsen the symptoms of tinnitus. If you or your doctor believe that your medication regimen is affecting your tinnitus, it may worth reducing the dosage or cutting out certain drugs altogether. Some more common medications that can cause or worsen tinnitus are:


Certain antibiotics, such as polymyxin B, erythromycin, vancomycin and neomycin.
Some cancer medications, such as mechlorethamine and vincristine.
Diuretic drugs, such as bumetanide, ethacrynic acid or furosemide.
Antimalarial drugs and certain antidepressants.
Aspirin - when taken in large doses.

, Built-up earwax can harden and block the ear canal - leading to hearing loss, irritation and tinnitus. If this is the cause of your tinnitus, the symptoms can be greatly relieved and even cured once the blockage has been removed.


Clear excess earwax at home using baby oil, mineral oil or glycerin oil. These oils will soften the earwax, allowing it to clear by itself. You can also use hydrogen peroxide drops and over-the-counter ear drops to the same effect.
If these methods fail, you can have your earwax cleared by a doctor/nurse practitioner using one of several methods. The earwax can be removed using lavage (washing out the eardrum) or extracted using special medical instruments or suctioning. Alternatively, the doctor can prescribe stronger ear drops to soften the wax, and then for you to return for final clearing out.
Attempting to remove earwax using q-tips, can simply push earwax deeper into the ear canal and worsen the blockages., If your tinnitus is accompanied by hearing loss, getting fitted with a hearing aid can work wonders to get louder sound from outside to then by contrast lessen the annoying effects of rushing or ringing sounds.


Hearing aids may bring back the ability to hear ambient background noises, which may help to mask the tinnitus.
If you believe your tinnitus is related to hearing loss, see an audiologist who can help to select and fit a hearing aid that is right for you (to amplify the tones that you need to hear more clearly).
If your hearing is good/unaffected but the tinnitus is a problem, you can also get implants which stimulate the auditory nerve using an electrical impulse. This may temporarily stop the tinnitus.

, Sound therapy is a way of masking or drowning out the internal noise caused by the tinnitus using sound.


Although it does not cure the tinnitus, sound therapy can help patients to forget about their symptoms and allow them to concentrate or rest without distraction. Sound therapy can be used in two major ways:
Through small, in-ear devices that look similar to hearing aids. These emit low levels of white noise which help to over up the tinnitus.
Through some combination of music, a fan, air conditioner, air filter/purifier, aquarium or sound machine which can be placed in the patient's bedroom and other locations to distract one from the tinnitus. White noise (such as a TV on low volume while it is not on a station), various environmental sounds, or the noise produced by household appliances may help to cover up/distract from some tinnitus., They can worsen symptoms of tinnitus associated with blood flow. Caffeine was previously considered by medical professionals to worsen tinnitus, but recent research suggests this is not the case. Caffeine may actually improve symptoms, and prevent tinnitus getting worse or ever occurring in the first place.


This is because these substances cause blood vessels to dilate, increasing the flow of blood in your body. Increased blood flow is associated with some of the ""whooshing"" or rushing noises heard in the inner ear.
As a result, you should quit smoking and cut back on alcoholic beverages.
You should also make an effort to reduce your salt intake as high salt consumption contributes to high blood pressure, which is sometimes linked to tinnitus.

, Patients suffering from tinnitus are often found to have low levels of zinc in their systems.


As a result, some patients have found relief from tinnitus by taking zinc supplements daily.
Magnesium and B vitamins are two more supplements which are said to ease tinnitus symptoms. Folic acid is a common supplement for hearing health, and since most individuals with tinnitus also suffer from some degree of hearing loss, eating foods high in Folic acid may potentially help, if the deficit is nutrient deficiency related.
You can search for ""tinnitus relief"" supplements online that contain several vitamins and minerals that are said to work together in a single capsule.

, Ginkgo biloba is an herbal supplement which some say may naturally relieve symptoms of tinnitus.


This is perhaps due to the fact that ginkgo extract is used to improve blood flow, therefore reducing high blood pressure and ringing in the inner ear.
Consider trying ginkgo supplements that contain ginkgo leaf extract rather than Ginkgo seeds, as those seeds may contain natural, toxic chemicals., Biofeedback is a relaxation technique which can help people to control their body's reaction to certain stresses. In this way, patients can use their thoughts to alleviate symptoms of tinnitus.


During a biofeedback session, a therapist will hook you up to a machine via electrical sensors. The machine will then provide feedback on your body's physiological reactions, such as temperature, muscle tension and pulse.
Once you learn to recognize these reactions in your body, you might train your thought patterns, behaviors and emotions to respond to them. In this way, you could train your body to manage pain and stress through your thoughts alone.
Using biofeedback, you can attempt to train your body not to respond to the stresses that worsen symptoms of tinnitus.

, This is by working collaboratively with a psychotherapist to develop skills for testing and modifying attitudes/beliefs, identifying distorted thinking, and changing ineffective behaviors. Severe tinnitus can cause major adjustment problems for it's sufferers - it can worsen concentration, inhibit sleeping patterns and affect personal relationships.


Cognitive therapy may help tinnitus sufferers to cope with these issues, and prevent the condition taking over their lives.
Cognitive therapy will not get rid of tinnitus, but it can help sufferers to alter their reactions to it and help them lead normal lives.
Cognitive therapy is usually used in combination with some other form of tinnitus treatment, such as medication or sound therapy.

, Sudden, explosive like or prolonged exposure to loud noises can cause tinnitus or make existing symptoms worse.


As a result, people who work in noisy environments around loud machinery should take precautions to protect their hearing by wearing ear plugs or ear muffs.
Music can cause tinnitus if played too loudly on intensive audio or MP3 players for prolonged periods. You can solve this by turning the volume down to a safer level. People may also suffer from temporary tinnitus after attending a concert, but this should go away on its own.
Protect your ears by wearing earmuffs or earplugs when performing noisy household tasks such as blow drying your hair or mowing the lawn., Stress tends to aggravate tinnitus. Therefore you should always take time to relax and enjoy the company of your loved ones.


You can reduce stress by taking up activities such as meditation and yoga, practicing deep breathing techniques and avoiding stressful people.
Try to get at least 7 hours of sleep a night, as fatigue can substantially increase stress levels., Cotton swabs, or Q-tips, should not be used to clean earwax from the ears.


Cotton swabs can merely push earwax further into the ear canal where it can harden and form blockages which lead to tinnitus.
Typically ears are self-cleaning - the wax will dry up and fall out by itself, so there is no need for manual cleaning.
If excess earwax does build up, you can use glycerin, olive oil, peroxide or special ear drops to soften it, or have a physician clean out your ears for you.

, Regular cardiovascular exercise - such as walking, running and swimming - increases blood flow in the system, which reduces the possibility of some kinds of tinnitus which are linked to blood vessel/circulation deficiency.


Try to do at least 30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise four to five times a week for best results.
Following a balanced diet can also help to improve cardiovascular and nerve health and might prevent tinnitus."

Know who is most at risk for an ear infection.,
Recognize the symptoms of a middle ear infection.,
Distinguish between a middle ear infection and “swimmers’ ear.” Swimmers’ ear, also known as otitis externa or an “external ear infection,” is an infection of the outer ear canal caused by bacteria or fungi.,
Look for signs of ear infection in children.,
Know when to seek immediate medical attention.",How to Cure an Ear Infection1," In general, children are more likely to get ear infections than adults. This is because the eustachian tubes (tubes running from the middle of each ear to the back of your throat) are smaller in children and more prone to fill with fluid. Children also have weaker immune systems than adults and are also more prone to viral infections such as colds.Anything that blocks the eustachian tube can cause an ear infection. There are other risk factors for an ear infection, including:Allergies
Respiratory infections such as colds and sinus infections
Infection or trouble with the adenoids (lymph tissue in your upper throat area)
Tobacco smoke
Excess mucus or saliva, such as that produced during teething
Living in a cold climate
Changes in altitude or climate
Not being breastfed as an infant
Recent illness
Attending daycare, especially a larger daycare with many children;
, A middle ear infection (acute otitis media) is the most common type of ear infection and is caused by a virus or bacteria.The middle ear is the space just behind the eardrum that contains the small bones that pass vibrations to the inner ear. When the area becomes filled with fluid, bacteria and viruses can get in and cause an infection.An ear infection often occurs after a respiratory infection such as a cold, although severe allergies may also bring one on.Symptoms of a middle ear infection include:Ear pain or an earache
Feeling of fullness in the ear
Feeling ill
Vomiting
Diarrhea
Hearing loss in the infected ear
Tinnitus
Dizziness
Ear drainage
Fever, especially in children

, Moisture is a common culprit for this type of infection (hence the name), but scratching or inserting things into the ear canal can also leave you prone to infection.Symptoms may begin as mild but often worsen, and include:Itching in your ear canal
Redness inside the ear
Discomfort that worsens if you pull or push on your outer ear
Ear drainage (begins clear and odorless, may progress to pus)
More severe symptoms include:

Feeling of fullness or blockage
Decreased hearing
Severe pain that radiates outward to your face or neck
Swelling of neck lymph nodes
Fever



, Young children may display different symptoms of ear infection than older children and adults. Because young children often cannot communicate how they’re feeling, look for the following symptoms:Tugging, pulling or scratching the ear
Banging the head around
Fussiness, irritability, or incessant crying
Difficulty sleeping
Fever (especially for infants and very young children)
Fluid drainage from the ear
Clumsiness or balance problems
Trouble hearing

, Most ear infections can be treated at home, and many go away on their own. However, if you or your child experience certain symptoms, you should contact your doctor immediately. These symptoms include:Blood or pus in ear drainage (may look white, yellow, green, or pinkish/red)
Continued high fever, especially if it is over 102F (39C)
Dizziness or vertigo
Stiff neck
Tinnitus
Pain or swelling behind or around the ear
Ear pain that lasts more than 48 hours

Use heat to sooth the earache.,
Administer over-the-counter pain medications.,
See a doctor.,
Clear the nose.,
Wiggle the ear gently.,
Inhale soothing steam.,
Try olive oil.,
Use garlic and mullein flower oil.,
Try lavender oil.,
Avoid the cold virus.,
Get tested for allergies.,
Prevent ear infections in babies.",How to Cure an Earache," Heat can bring quick pain relief.


Apply a warm compress over the painful ear.You can make a warm compress from a washcloth dipped in hot water and wrung out, or from a hot water bottle or heat pack purchased at a pharmacy. Do not make it hot enough to scald the skin. You can keep the compress on your ear as long as you like. You can also try icing it first. Put a bag of ice on the area for 15 minutes. Then place a warm compress on for another 15 minutes. Repeat two to three times.
Hold a blow dryer an arm's length from your ear and blow air set to the ""warm"" or ""low"" setting into the ear. Do not use the hot or high setting.;
, Good choices include ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Follow all instruction on analgesic packaging.


Note that dosing for children is usually dependent on weight. Do not give children under the age of 18 aspirin. Aspirin in children is linked to the rare but devastating Reye's Syndrome, which causes brain and liver damage., If symptoms persist for more than 5 days for adults or more than 2 for children, the earache is in a child is under 8 weeks old, the neck becomes stiff, or if a fever develops, see a doctor immediately. While earaches are common, if left untreated they can become a very serious infection that can lead to other complications.


If the cause of the earache is bacterial, a doctor can prescribe a course of antibiotics to stem the infection and analgesics to mitigate the pain.
An untreated ear infection can result in permanent hearing loss, so it's important that you seek treatment if symptoms worsen or persist.

, Earaches are often caused by a buildup of fluid caught in the Eustachian tube, a tiny tube that connects the ear, nose, and throat. By clearing the nose, you can relieve pressure on the eardrum.Try gently squirting a little bit of salt water in the child's nostril, followed by suctioning.You can use a bulb suction device or a Nose Frida to get the nasal secretions flowing.

, Earaches can cause pressure in the Eustachian tubes, which can be relieved by gently popping (much like air pressure on air planes). This process can allow fluids trapped in the canal to drain.Hold the outer ear with your thumb and forefinger close to the head, and gently tug and rotate the ear as much as possible without causing discomfort. You can also try inducing yawning by faking a yawn, which can have a similar effect of popping the Eustachian tubes.

, Hot steam can help the fluids in the Eustachian tubes to drain (literally by causing your nose to run), which relieves pressure in the inner ear. Adding certain medications or scents to the steam can add an additional benefit of a gentle anesthetic for the ear pain.


Prepare a steam inhalation by adding several drops of eucalyptus essential oil or a teaspoon of Vicks or similar vapor rub to nearly boiling water in a bowl.
Place a towel over your head and inhale the steam through the nose three times a day until pain subsides. This will help to open the Eustachian tubes, easing pressure and help to drain the fluids from the ear.Do not place a small child's head under a towel over a very hot bowl of water, as the child may get burned or even drown in the water. Instead, apply a small amount of Vicks BabyRub (which is specially formulated for small babies and children) to the baby's chest or back, and then either stand in a very warm shower holding the baby, or let the baby play in a bathroom while a hot shower runs. The steam from the shower will mix with the vapors of the medication and create a soothing effect.

, To alleviate pain, place a few drops of warm olive oil in the ear.The oil works by soothing the irritated inner ear.


The bottle can be placed in a small glass of warm water for a few minutes to get it warm. Drop the oil directly into the ear, then plug the ear loosely with a cotton ball.
If using this method on a baby, try it when the baby is napping and you can prop him on his side in order to keep the oil in place. You should not put cotton balls in a small baby's ear.
Be aware that there is no peer-reviewed evidence suggesting that this does anything aside from placebo effect.

, Garlic has been shown to have antibiotic properties, and is thought to be a natural anesthetic.


You can find garlic and mullein flower oil on Amazon or from your local health food store.
Warm the oil (make sure its not hot by dropping a bit on your own wrist), then use a dropper to place a few drops of oil in the ear twice a day.
Again, this method is not supported by any peer-reviewed evidence.

, Although you should not put lavender oil in the ear directly, you can massage it on the outside of the ear, which is thought to improve circulation and lead to better inner-ear drainage. Plus, the smell itself can be soothing.Mix a few drops of lavender oil into a few drops of a carrier oil (like fractionated coconut oil or olive oil), then gently massage it to the outside of the ear as needed throughout the day.
Other essential oils that are thought to benefit pain and circulation include eucalyptus, rosemary, oregano, chamomile, tea tree, and thyme.This method is supported only by anecdotal evidence. There are no studies to support the health benefit of essential oils.

, One of the most common causes of earache is the common cold, and while there is no cure for the cold virus, you can take precautionary steps to avoid contracting it in the first place.Wash your hands regularly, especially after you've been in public places and before eating. If you don't have access to a sink, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer. The cold virus is notoriously resilient and can live for hours on surfaces, so even if you don't see anyone who appears sick, its possible to contract a cold simply from going to the library or the grocery store.Exercise regularly. People who exercise regularly have healthier immune responses, so their bodies are able to better fight off infection and resist the cold virus.Eat a vitamin-rich, balanced diet. Eat nutrient-dense, whole foods, focusing on lean proteins, vegetables, and fruits. The phytochemicals in plants like peppers, oranges, and dark leafy greens actually help your body absorb vitamins, so it's best to stick to natural foods for your immune-supporting vitamins., Allergic reactions can cause itching in the ear and earache. These can range from environmental to food-based allergies.


Call your doctor to schedule allergy testing, which can include a blood test or a skin-prick test. The test will give you information on what kind of allergens might be responsible for your ear irritation, such as ragweed, pets, or dairy.

, Ear infections in babies are common but can be reduced or prevented using particular feeding strategies.


Vaccinate your child. One of the common infectious agents for ear infections is part of the routine vaccine series.
Try to breastfeed for at least the first 12 months of your baby's life. Breastmilk contains antibodies that have been shown to reduce ear infections, so breastfed babies tend to get earaches less often than formula-fed babies.If you bottle feed, be sure to hold the baby at a 45 degree angle, and never feed the baby flat on his or her back or laying in his or her crib. Doing so can cause liquid to pool in the inner ear, resulting in an earache. Try to wean the baby from the bottle to a sippy cup between ages 9 and 12 months in order to reduce the rate of ear infections associated with bottles."

Check for earwax.,
Rule out head trauma.,
Check with your doctor to determine if you have a vascular condition.,
Consider changing medication.,
Talk to your doctor about auditory disfunction.,

Try alternative remedies.,
Don’t worry.,
Take medications to suppress side effects.,
Listen to white noise.,

Ask about Tinnitus Retraining Therapy.,
Change your lifestyle.,
Seek counseling.",How to Cope with Tinnitus," Sometimes Tinnitus can be caused by excess earwax. A simple cleaning of the ear will reduce many of the symptoms. Your doctor can check for you and perform the necessary cleaning.


Professionals now recommend against the use of cotton swabs for removing earwax. Washing out your ear with water will help, but if your wax is so severe that it is causing Tinnitus, consider visiting the doctor for a professional treatment.;
, Somatic Tinnitus is a ringing in the ears resulting from head trauma. This type of Tinnitus is typically loud, varies considerably in frequency throughout the day, and causes problems with concentration and memory. Sometimes somatic Tinnitus can be treated with surgery that realigns the jaw., If the Tinnitus takes the form of a pulsing sound, in sync with your heart beat, it is possible that it is caused by a vascular condition. Your doctor might be able to provide medication for this. In some cases, treatment will require surgery.


Pulsatile Tinnitus (as described above) can be a sign that you suffer from a serious health condition like high blood pressure, hardening of the arteries, vascular tumor, or aneurysm. Visit the doctor immediately if you hear a pulsating sound in your ear., A long list of medications have been known to cause Tinnitus, including Aspirin, ibuprofen, Aleve, blood pressure and heart medicines, antidepressants, and cancer medicines. Consult with your doctor to see if your medication could be causing your condition, and, if so, whether your prescription can be altered. , Tinnitus is often caused by damage to tiny hair cells in the ear. Damage to the hair cell can be a result of aging or can be a consequence of being exposed to loud noises. People working with machinery or people listening to loud music often develop tinnitus. A short blast of loud noise can also lead to a temporary to permanent hearing loss.

Other causes of auditory dysfunction include the use of certain medications, stiffening of the bones of the middle ear, tumors within the auditory system, vascular disorders, neurological disorders, and genetics.
The severity of the disease varies and 25% of people report an increase in symptoms over time. Long-term tinnitus is unlikely to go away completely, but it can usually be managed.

, Tinnitus can be a minor, temporary condition. It is not always necessary to visit a doctor. But if you have a strong, sudden onset, it has lasted a week, or if it has begun to seriously affect your standard of living, visit a doctor. You should consider professional treatment if you begin to suffer from side effects like fatigue, trouble concentrating, depression, anxiety, or memory problems.Be prepared to discuss with your doctor when the sound began, what it sounds like, any medical conditions you might have, and all medications you take.
Diagnosis is made on history and physical examination as well as a hearing test. A patient may also need and CT or MRI of the ear for other pathology.
Management involved treatment of the underlying pathology. This includes depression and insomnia. Tinnitus retraining therapy, masking, biofeedback and stress reduction may also be part of the treatment plan.

, Gingko biloba, which can be purchased at many health stores, is sometimes thought to help treat Tinnitus, though its efficacy is debated by the scientific community.Other methods that are occasionally tried include B vitamins, Zinc supplements, hypnosis, and acupuncture, though there is even less cause to believe that these approaches will be effective than there is for Gingko biloba., Stress can make Tinnitus worse. It is rarely a serious threat to your health. Even if there is no way to treat your case of Tinnitus, it will often go away with time. You should focus on making your condition as livable as possible and understanding as much as you can about it.


As many as 15% of all people suffer from some degree of Tinnitus. It is a common disorder that is usually not a cause of serious concern., There are medications that will treat some of the effects of Tinnitus even when it cannot be cured. Antidepressants have been known to help. Xanax will make it easier to fall asleep. Lidocaine can also to suppress symptoms.Antidepressants should only be used in extreme circumstances because they can cause dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, and heart problems.
Xanax should also be used sparingly because it can be habit-forming., Outside noise often suppresses the ringing in your ears. A white noise machine that produces nature sounds can help. When one of these is not available, some household items can help. Try playing the radio, running a fan, or turning on the air conditioning.


A quiet, regularly repeating sound can be particularly helpful when you are trying to go to sleep.

, Doctors have designed a number of treatments for Tinnitus based on the realization that white noise can help treat the condition. Some of these amplify your hearing. One new technique uses customized acoustic therapy. Talk to your doctor to determine what treatment is appropriate for your condition and your price point.


Hearing aids have been known to treat Tinnitus by amplifying outside noises. Cochlear implants suppress in Tinnitus 92% of cases.Ask your doctor about neuromonics, a new treatment that uses acoustic therapy and counseling to treat Tinnitus. The technique is still experimental, but shows considerable promise., If Tinnitus persists and can not be treated with masking, TRT can help. TRT does not try to eliminate Tinnitus but uses long term therapy and auditory treatment to make the patient comfortable with the sound. While masking has been shown to be most effective in treating Tinnitus in the first six months, TNR is most effective for cases lasting over a year., Relax, stress can make Tinnitus worse. Exercise and rest can improve your condition. Cut out things known to irate Tinnitus. Reduce your consumption of alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine. Loud noise in particular can aggravate Tinnitus., Tinnitus can cause stress and depression. If you are having a hard time coping physically, at least be sure to cope mentally by seeking the assistance of a professional. Support groups exist for people who suffer from Tinnitus. Seek one lead by a qualified health professional.

Wash your hands before touching the piercing.,
Do not remove a new ear piercing.,
Clean the piercing with a cotton ball dipped in saline or soap.,
Apply an antibiotic ointment.,
Avoid rubbing alcohol and hydrogen peroxide.",How to Clean an Infected Ear Piercing1," Always wash your hands well before touching a piercing, especially if it’s new or infected. Use an antimicrobial soap and warm water. Avoid fiddling with your earrings and only touch them when you have to clean them., If your piercing is new, keep it in place for at least six weeks, even if it becomes infected. While you should rotate a new lobe piercing, stop rotating it if it becomes infected for one to two weeks.If your infected piercing is permanent, or more than six months old, remove the earring while you deal with the infection.

, Soak a cotton ball or swab in saline solution or a mild antimicrobial soap. Dab the soaked ball or swab around the infected area. Then dry the area with disposable paper towels.If the shop where you got your ear pierced provided a saline solution, use it to clean your ears. You can also purchase a pre-made product or make a saline solution by mixing 2 teaspoons of salt with a quart (about a liter) of warm water.
If you use a soap, go with a fragrance free brand that doesn’t contain alcohol.
Clean an infected ear piercing twice a day. You can rotate the earrings during this time while they are still wet from the saline solution or soap.

, After cleaning and drying the piercing, you can apply an antibacterial ointment to encourage healing. Dab a small amount of the ointment onto a cotton swab and paint a thin coating over the infected area.If the infection is weeping or emitting a discharge, avoid using ointment., Rubbing alcohol and hydrogen peroxide will dry out the infected area and kill cells that are needed for healing. Killing white blood cells around the infected site could make the infection even worse. Don’t apply alcohol or hydrogen peroxide to the infection, and make sure any cleaning products you use are alcohol free."

Fill a bowl with warm water and soap.,
Insert your ear plugs into the soapy water.,
Wipe or scrub the ear plugs.,
Rinse and dry the ear plugs.,
Store the ear plugs in a case to keep them clean.,
Disinfect dry ear plugs, if desired.",How to Clean Ear Plugs1," Fill a small bowl with enough warm water to completely submerge your ear plugs. Add a few drops of a mild soap, like dish soap. Mix the water with a stirring utensil, like a spoon, or with your clean hands to distribute the soap through the water.Ear plugs that are regularly used should be washed whenever visibly dirty or every few days.
Infrequently used plugs should be washed after using every time to prevent bacteria from breeding in the plugs while stored in their case.
Using harsh cleaners or non-mild soaps could shorten the shelf life of your ear plugs or make them less effective.
This cleaning technique can also be used for banded ear plugs. However, both banded and multi-use single-ear plugs should be replaced after 2 to 4 weeks for best performance.;
, Allow the plugs to soak in the soapy water for a few minutes to loosen dirtiness. Some ear plugs may float in the water. In this case, hold the plugs under the water for a few minutes, or until the plugs remain submerged in the water., While submerged, use your clean hands to wipe away and buildup or stuck on dirtiness from the plugs. Alternatively, use a soft bristle brush, like a toothbrush, to scrub the plugs clean.


You may need to remove the plugs from the water to get a better look. Swish the plugs in the solution to remove broken up dirt., After cleaning, rinse the plugs in cold water. Dab excess moisture from the plugs with a clean, dry paper towel to speed up the drying process. Allow the plugs to sit on a clean towel to air dry. Storing plugs that are still wet could cause bacteria to grow in the plug material., When the plugs are completely dry, store them in their case. If you lack a case, you can use a small plastic container as a substitute. Keep them in their case except when using them to prevent maintain their condition and prevent re-dirtying them., Fill a clean spray bottle with a small amount of isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol. Mist dry ear plugs lightly with the alcohol. Set the plugs on a clean towel to air dry. When completely dry, store the plugs in a case.Ear plugs that are used often should be disinfected weekly or after any kind of activity that caused you to sweat.
Plugs that are used rarely should be disinfected after every few uses or after activity that caused heavy sweating.

Take your child to the doctor if s/he is younger than six months old.,
Allow the doctor to examine your ears or your child’s ears.,
Be prepared for the doctor to examine the eardrum more closely in case of a stubborn or chronic infection.,
Keep in mind that you can treat many ear infections at home.,
Use caution when flying with a child who has an ear infection.",How to Cure an Ear Infection2," If you notice any symptoms of ear infection in an infant, take him or her to the doctor immediately.Infants at this age have not fully developed their immune systems. They are at a much higher risk for serious infections and will likely need immediate antibiotics. Do not try home remedies on infants and very young children. Always consult your pediatrician for the most appropriate route of care.

, If you suspect that you or your child have a serious ear infection, prepare for tests such as:A visual examination of the eardrum using an otoscope. It may be difficult to get your child to sit still for this exam, but it’s an important test to determine if the child has an ear infection.
An examination of any blockage or filling of the middle ear using a pneumatic otoscope, which will blow a little air at the eardrum. The air will cause the eardrum to move back and forth. If fluid is present, the eardrum will not move as easily or readily, which indicates a likely ear infection.An examination with a tympanometer, which uses sound and air pressure to check for any fluid in the middle ear.
If the infection is chronic or a severe case, an audiologist may perform a hearing test to determine if there is any hearing loss.

, If you or your child becomes quite ill as a result of ear issues, your doctor may make an opening in the eardrum and draw out a sample of fluid from the middle ear. S/he will then send these samples to a lab to have them tested., Many ear infections go away on their own without treatment. Some ear infections may disappear within a few days, and most ear infections will disappear on their own within 1-2 weeks, even if you don’t treat them. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians suggest a “wait-and-see approach” with the following guidelines:Children 6 to 23 months old: Wait and see if the child has mild inner ear pain in one ear for less than 48 hours and a temperature less than 102.2 F (39 C).
Children 24 months and older: Wait and see if the child has mild inner ear pain in one or both ears for less than 48 hours and a temperature less than 102.2 F (39 C).
Past 48 hours, it is important to see a doctor. Often you or your child will be started on an antibiotic to prevent the infection from spreading and reduce the chance of rare life-threatening infections.
Rarely, more serious complications may develop, including mastoiditis (an infection of the bones around the skull), meningitis, infection spreading to the brain, or hearing loss., Children with active ear infections are at a higher risk of a painful condition called barotrauma, which is experienced when the middle ear attempts to adjust to the changes in pressure. Chewing gum during ascent and descent can decrease the risk of this.If you have an infant with an ear infection, bottle-feeding during ascent and descent can help regulate the pressure in the middle ear.

Take over-the-counter pain medication.,
Apply a warm compress.,
Get plenty of rest.,
Stay hydrated.,
Try Valsalva's Maneuver if no pain is present.,
Place a few drops of warm mullein or garlic oil in your ear.,
Try a naturopathic remedy.",How to Cure an Ear Infection3," Ibuprofen or acetaminophen can be taken if the pain does not diminish on its own or if other symptoms don't develop. These medications can also help reduce your child’s fever and can make him or her feel better.


Never give children under the age of 18 aspirin as this has been linked to Reye's syndrome, which can result in brain damage and liver problems.Use child-strength formulations when giving any pain reliever to children. Follow the dosing recommendations on the package or ask your pediatrician.
Do not give ibuprofen to children under the age of 6 months.

, A warm compress will help lessen the pain of an ear infection. You can use a warm, damp washcloth.You can also fill a clean tube sock with rice or beans and tie or sew the open end of the sock shut. Microwave the sock for 30 seconds at a time until it is the desired temperature. Apply the compress to the ear.You can also use salt as a natural remedy. Heat one cup of salt and place it in a cloth. Tie it up with a rubber band and place it on the affected ear for 5-10 minutes when it’s bearably hot while lying down.
Apply the warm compress for 15-20 minutes at a time., Your body needs rest to recover from infections.Make sure that you do not push yourself too hard while you have an ear infection, particularly if you also have a fever.


Pediatricians do not recommend that you keep a child home from school for an ear infection unless s/he has a fever. However, you should probably monitor your child’s activity to make sure s/he gets the rest s/he needs.

, Particularly if a fever is present, you should drink extra fluids.The Institute of Medicine recommends that you drink at least 13 cups (3 liters) of fluids daily if you are male, and at least 9 cups (2.2 liters) of fluids daily if you are female., The Valsalva's Maneuver can be used to open up the eustachian tubes and relieve the ""stuffed up"" feeling that may occur with an ear infection. You should only do this maneuver if you do not currently have ear pain.Take a deep breath and close your mouth.
Pinch your nose shut. Then, while pinching the nose, ""blow"" your nose gently.
Do not blow too hard, or you could damage your eardrum. You should feel your ears ""pop.""

, Mullein and garlic are natural antibiotics and may also provide soothing relief from ear infection pain. If garlic oil is not available, you can prepare it at home. All you need is, cook 2 garlic cloves in 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of mustard or sesame oil until it turns blackish. Cool this oil and use a eyedropper to place 2-3 drops of warm (never hot) oil in each ear.You should always consult with a pediatrician before trying this with children.

, One study suggests that a naturopathic herbal remedy called Oticon Otic solution (Healthy-On) may be helpful in reducing ear pain from ear infections. Consult your doctor before using this remedy. Never give any alternative medications to your child without consulting your pediatrician first.
